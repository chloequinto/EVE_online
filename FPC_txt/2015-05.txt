1 to for all the reasons already cited aboveperhaps they could be replaced with legal boosters designed to be real cheap and easily produced even by beginners in fact id overhaul the entire drug industry and make it more interesting  viable for new pla
yes it would be nice agreed but everyone old enough to know that santa doesnt really exist should also be mature enough that barring eccentric billionaire pays ccp 50 million bucks to do it type scenarios wis is never going to happeni could reiterate all the reasons why ccp arent able to deliver it any more and arent motivated to make the huge investment required to restart the project essentially from scratch even if they were able to raise the resources to do so they cant but you have already read and handwaved away or ignored those many times already so why bore you with them againso i will merely say this in all kindness just accept it i know it sucks i agree that it is a huge waste of potential i absolutely comprehend that if the wis project hadnt been utterly mismanaged and pissed away years worth of dev resources then it might have lifted eve to a whole new experiential level but it was and it did and it now wont ever achieve that and those are the cold facts after 4 years you should be well past the denial anger and bargaining phases use that energy and commitment towards something that will actually happen you owe it to yourself
im wondering where youre getting the whole completely dead and they would have to redevelop stuff to restart it bit the last bit i heard that was confirmed from ccp was basically that no one in management was willing to be the one to stand up and say they should devote any sort of resources to expanding the project after all of the blowback after the initial launchtheres certainly nothing to indicate that theres some huge tech debt hurdle to overcome hereon the flip side i know you generally know what youre talking about and arent prone to vast sweeping exaggerationsso in short got a source for this
stop putting words in peoples mouths nobody was discriminating against goons you can always have your alt1 move things from a to b your 2nd alt from b to c your main clonejumps from a to c voila no fatigue and your stuff is where it should bemultple character training do you even use it
i love the way it is now its ofc a quick patch to a more structural issue in null sec force projection and requires more mechanicsms wihtout those we also not where we wUFFFDnt to be but atm if i look at kills pilots for example in provi get they up in numbers and isk big time ee have fights without the world pilling onto them as currently wiht nc super and cap deployment is limited and so is tidi all seem to have fun and fatique and range add strategic choices too itfor form ups people can travel in industrials through the jb network ceptors and jumpclones those combined take care of most traffic realised so as a player and as a csm i am happy with it for now and more intrested how it will hold under the new sov mechanics with fozzie sov and hopefully further down the line with structures buildable stargates and long term future i ma also intrsted in the rebalance of titans nad supers in combo wiht fatiqueso whilst its not your ultimate feature its a quick patch that workes like intended untiill and so on
i support the idea of jump fatigue in making sov less stagnant but i also think having it on jump bridges is a little overkill but removing it from jbs would then most likely make most people go jump bridge crazy so instead maybe have a fatigue reduction bonus on jump bridges the same way as on industrial ships
before i made csm i made a post on margin trading and ccp answered its a feUFFFDture so i tried it af ee times myself and make nice isk when i started runnign csm i stopped so i know how it worksthere is several kinds of scams wit it once where there is only enough money for 25  of the inflated or rare item those are the dumb onces u can crash their order if u own the item i even collect stuff they liek to crash them and make money of them the other one is where u first sell a minimum amoutn to yourself so there is 00 isk in the escrow left and a market buy value of billions it will always collaps and leave the victim scammedescrow however is also used alot in legit ways that drive the economy so the trick woudl be too keep that and fix the other exploit it is doable since you coudl do a exception math if the order in cant be forfilled with the minimum sale possible then the order cant hold as noone can sell anything too anythign on your buy list it would leave honest owners options so basically buyin 10 items of 100 mill a piece with a minimum of 10 so minimum sale is 1 bill escrow needs to hold 1 bill or buy order fallsbuying 10 items of 100 mill a piece minimum of 5  ecrow meeds too hold 500 millbuying 10 items of 100 mill a piece minimum of 1 escrow needs to be 100 mill escrow skiill overwrites 250 minimumbit technical but that woudl fix it however i havent as a csm found much enthousaism for it but its on my list i can show any ccp life sometime how to set up a escrow with 0 isk in and buy orders of billions rigged too collaps
i never really knew about this until i read this post im guessing this is associated with those market fail order posts youll see in market hubs like amarr and jitaif thats the case id agree with the majority if youre gonna be stupid andor greedy then youd have to pay the price because this skill is great for traders and people who are incapable of doing thorough research make it a great skill for scammers too id say this skill should stay and people should instead brush up on their scam detection abilities
im starting to regret my vote that post is all well and good but ignores the person being scammed and their initial intentions how can you think of making a change such as yours without looking to them firstso ask yourself what was their thought process before hand what did they expect to gain from the order who did they think would be better off and less well off after it completed lets face it they were simply over charged for something they paid well over the normal market price so ask yourself whyim all for giving players information to help them but im dead against changing mechanics to help the lazy because thats what we have here those so set on ripping others off that they fail to gather more info than the buy and sell order price given the fact the information that helps them avoid this expensive mistake is readily at handdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
when you initially setup or change your planetary facilities or schematics its quite a timely process and i can think of some ways this can be improved to save time and make life easier for capsuleers who do planetary interactionwhen placing production facilities or extractors you have to select the facility or extractor place it and then keep repeating the process until all your desired facilities are placed instead of this process a better way would be to select the desired facility and remain in placement mode for that facility until youve placed the desired amount of facilities then you can select the next facility to be placedthe same thing applies with link creation to create links you click on create link then you click on the 1st facility then the 2nd and a link is created then this process is repeated for every link i think itd work better if you enter a link creation mode and instead of clicking on the from and to facility youd clickdrag instead that way you can continue creating links from and to facilities without having to click on create link every timeanother nice feature would be an undo option in case you accidentally routed placed or linked something incorrectly this would be better than cancelling all your changes deleting individual links or decommissioning individual facilitiesthen another timely process is installing schematics and routing incoming and outgoing commodities this however i havent been able to think of a better way of doing all i can think of for now is having a schematic paint mode different ones for basic advanced and hightech facilities so that a single schematic can be assigned to multiple facilities quickly and easilyas for routing to and from facilities i think a better way would be to show its produced commodity and required commodities in a single tabseparated window where you can select one of them and assign a route where it has to output its produced commodity or take its required commodities from instead of having to go to its products option and route its produced commodity then having to go to the facility storing or producing the required commodities and routing them to that facility but on this option i think someone out there might have a better suggestionpi is currently a timely and slightly irritating process if youre not focusing on producing a single product continuously hopefully this can be improved in the future o7
the launcher issue is known note that the csm doesnt get involved in bugs and technical issues we have a internal bug channel with ccp and ofc on major things like the skin bug we do get updated tickets are still they way too sort this and if more thne one on same issue that does help bump the importancei agree that there is a risk wiht a quicker candence  however it also reduces several issues with long developed releases from csm point i see developers more in control  taking responsibility for what the release and taking action i disagree wiht bugs and such being more abundant hard too pinpoint e cept the launcher issue is pretty prominent ofckeep reporting what you find and we will ask ccp ofc as they inform us how the new candence works and even moves to a future where stuff is released when done even outside the windows
ccp has resources that could be spent on wis but instead they are choosing to spend those resources on eve valkyrie and maybe project legiontime will show if it was a good decision  either way its a gamblemy subscription expires in 9 days so i dont give a damn either way
erm how do you know what resources they do and dont have calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
i dont think its the supers that should be nerfed i think it should be its ease of building one which will put more risk for it to be lost supers can be destroyed or else there would be no lossmails of supers because of this increasing their cost to produce would even it out
so we can keep the lovely big coalitions intact
hello guysi would like to share a few ideas i have for the situation with capitals and supercapitals after fozzisov hits many people are panicking because they thinkknow that titans will become next to useless when fozzisov hits i have two ideas that would hopefully make titans of more use1 buff their turretmissile damageyoure probably thinking whoa theyre the most powerful ships in the game making them stronger is insane but hear me out as of current meta triage carriers most favorably the archon for armor fleets and chimera for shield fleets are commonly used as a mass backup of logistics remote repairing subcapital fleets within subtosub cap fights those of you who were there or if youve heard about it remember when cfcn3pl dropped about 15 titans on a cfcn3pl vs provibloc fight just so provibloc couldnt bring triage carriers on the field that kind of threat needs to be raised for the single titan sure make it so titans can only effectively hit capitals but making their weapons stronger will mean that in those sort of engagements only 1 or 2 titans need to be dropped to shut down the ability for foes to bring triage carriers on grid or have it so titans have enough power on their guns to take down a flock of triage carriers quickly on the field to make them worthbut what if their guns arent kill that brings me onto my second point2 buff their doomsdaynow youre probably moving away from this forum why would you ever buff the biggest and most powerful single weapon in all of new eden ill tell you why it takes numbers of titans to successfully use their doomsday on even just one carrier and take it down if that carrier is tanked hard enough which is can do the max you can get out of a carriers ehp wout boosts is about 5 mil ehp if i calculated correctly doomsdays currently do 2 million ehp per shot and take into account that the doomsday can only be fired once every 10 minutes and takes a fair bit of fuel to fire and also take into account that within those 10 minutes it cant be jumped out i think that to make them worthwhile to bring on the field make the doomsdays do 58 million ehp a shot also another idea would be to make the doomsday operate similar to how the remote ecm burst works still make it so the major amount of ehp hit can only be hit onto a capital but what would make it worthwhile is that after it has been fired have an area of effect damage around the target ship and at least a good enough amount to lower the tank of a t3 this would make doomsdays actually worthwhile in bringing titans on the field and activating their doomsdays i would also suggest lowering the time it takes for the titan to take a jump home but that would eliminate or at least lower the risk of bringing them on field to a certain degreeif these changes do occur and i would be over the moon if a csm member actually did think this was a great idea then it will hopefully provide an option to risk these vesselsthank you for reading and please reply back telling me if you liked the idea of if ive gone completely insaneo7
ive another idea for improving
hello dear community members this was basicly a supportticket i wrote earlier allready which i want to share the contacted gm assured me he forwarded it to the right people but convinced me to also post this on the formus even with a link thanks gm spidersupportticketas allways i hope this ist the correct category i have a hard time finding the right onei am a hobby industrialist and like to manufacture things for profit this is very important for the faction ship market as many people just put their bpcs in contracts and wait for a person like me to buy and manufacture them according to the full industry index on jita station im not the only one however my problem is that i have to buy the minerals individually per blueprint if i make my 5 daredevils for example thats 8x5 so 40 times rightklicking buy on the required mineral i have found a workaround where i show info on the outcome ship klick info on it tab over to industry tab klick show info on the blueprint there shownd as a original and press show in industry this way i can buy the exact amounts for multiple ships with a rightklick put up immediate buyorder however it wont display how much i allready have in minerals so without a sellorder for 1684m units of tritanium i will end up in need to buy a second time whats left outthis is not only annying for me as a player but also a bigg issue for ccp since it creates a big chunk of jita lag on the serversso thats why im asking in a support ticket now to implement a multiple run simulation for faction blueprint copies so peole only need to buy their minerals one timescreenshot
youve gone completely insane
explain more
i dont have the time or energy nor does i believe any other sane human to explain every reason and link to every other post explaining why what youre asking for is a bad thing dating back from when i started in 2007 to nowuse the forum search thingy and look at the old forums
you mean you cant give a valid reason because aoe dds actually did  and while the current dd system is great if it worked like remote ecm then it will add a threat to subcaps as well giving a good reason to drop titans on grid
if thats your thinking youve 1 not done your homework on the myriad other threads detailing why aoe dds are a bad thing and 2 not read the long stretch of threads and reasonings as to why titan turret damage was nerfed in the first placeim not your parent youre grown up enough to learn how to search the internet
yes which i agreed with as stated is there something wrong with reading comprehension in this forum or are people deliberately truculent
both
because theres no tangible difference between a space taxi and a carrier thats being deployed to support force projection how on earth is whatever mechanic youd like to see going to differentiate between the two a popup where you can check a box that says you pinkyswear youre not moving your space taxi for any nefarious purposes
wow just wow i didnt think anyone would have the audacity to propose something like thattitans are serving a pretty well used niche currently bridging of subcap ships and killing off poorly tanked carriers off with doomsdayif you buff all those things for a titan how do you kill one bring more titans hey what about if we do all your proposed changes but make another small change every subcap ship in the vicinity has the chance to engage the titan on a smaller scale like an infiltrator ship flying inside it docking with it and letting troops in a mini game of space marines if the titan pilot wins the minigame nothing happens if the titan pilot loses weapons propulsion jump capability and defenses are put offline
i do know how to search the internet i also know how capsupercap engagements happenplease tell me if you were the pilot of a titan and your alliances nyx has been hotdropped by 3 other supercarriers would you drop in your titan no because you wouldnt be able to break the spider tanks of the other 3 supercarriersbut what if your titan was actually powerful enough to mean something in field presence without having to be put in mass numbers then youd feel more comfortable with putting your titan on grid
poorly tanked exactly if the carrier pilot actually knows what hes doing then he will be able to tank a doomsday and might i add very well bridging subcaps these ships are supposed to be the most threatening in the game and an end game for alliances but just to serve as a bridge no that is silly if that game just carries on then we wont even see titans on grid because for what cause new sov systems is just going to eliminate any need to have to risk your big ships no ones going to drop a titan on a couple of carriers because you can do a better job with subcaps that pump out more dps but people would use titans for such a job if there was enough force to make it a considerable optionkilling a titan with these new traits would be easy if theres no caps on grid then subcaps will just melt him because he cant dd subcaps and thats because these ships are geared towards doing a good job of countering other capitals which is why it needs a bit more of a reason to use it for that sole purpose
you obviously do not know how to search the internet or have any idea about how supercap escalations happen if youre seriously suggesting that going back to the incredibly notfun times of titan fleet dominance is a good ideathis whole thread smells of the usual abloobloobloo endgame thing no is iwin butan which is dumb and really just means you need to back to playing with elves and pixie dust
considering its the one ship that takes the longest to train up for and build i would say its an end game ship
so basically youre proposing the existing industry tab be implemented so it can directly interface with the local marketso what happens when there are no minerals avaliable in the local stationsystem does it buy the closest and cheapest minerals avaliable even if they are out in lowsec and nullsec i presume youd want some kind of control over these things so when you go interface with market youll get the cheapest minerals as close to your industrial facility as possible
there is no end game in eve
quotei agree with this eve is a game which revolves around politics and social organizations religion corporations clans and tribes is really what we are all about fighting in spaceships is not who we are its just what we do who we are has a lot more to do with who our family and friends are what we do in our spare time etc wis would could should be something to help develop the roleplaying and interacting with the milieu of a science fiction world also i agree about the potential microtransaction market custom furniture clothes books food and drink trophies etc could all be items crafted bought and sold by players besides captains quarters office space in a station could be rented out as well as a bar casino chapel cafe etc tbh i think even just having a corporate board room to meet your fellow corpies might be the next step instead of just your own captains quarters you might have an option of taking a transport tube to the board room for an in person meeting this would be just as boring as the captains quarters but it would be refreshing to actually see your other corpmates in person at least also it would make sense from an ingame perspective why would you need to run in a station that had maglev trains and transport tubes why would there be fighting in a space station that was secured by your faction of course people will still want to be able to fight in stations i wonder if this should be restricted to melee weapons not only are they more fun than pistols but they are probably safer to use in space as well imagine what would happen if a bullet or a laser beam ricocheted off the walls of a space station what if they punctured the space station exterior
why do you want it to turn into a firstthird person gameccp needs to work less on spaceships spaceships are the best working part of their franchise and also the least importantoh why is that so we should leave broken stuff and move onto creating more broken things spaceships are the games core so its the most important thing calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
just to add on something here in the eve world a space station is about the only place that is somewhat safe the only way to not die is to not undock ever since i first joined eve there has been an ongoing battle between the miners farmers and the pirates griefers that like to gank them the miners whom some might call carebears are adamant that highsec space be safer for them while the pirates correctly point out that no where is safe in eve not even in high sec space ccp has chosen to address this problem by nerfing high sec at least to the point where they are making it more difficult to safari high sec player corps perhaps this is necessary since a lot of players are reluctant to leave the npc corps specifically for this reason i might suggest that the wis station interiors become a sort of newbie zone these would be an area to walk around in and explore in safety while giving your character a feel for life in their chosen faction this might even be part of the newbie tutorials walking or taking a transport tube to each agents office in the station the starting station would have a university campus sort of atmosphere lots of young people and students there might also be some opportunities to make money reasonably safely doing social jobs within the station it is already possible to make money safely while docked through station trading why not also as a bartender i mention this specifically because eve has a tendency towards inflation goods are becoming more expensive to buy but missions are paying the same as they always have many newbies gravitate towards mining because it seems like the surest steadiest money for people starting out if newbies had the opportunity to make money crafting items for use in the station or roleplaying a social job there might be higher new player retention did you get your mining ship ganked no insurance you might have to work in a station job for a while until you can afford a new ship there might also be parts of the station set aside for fighting and other nasty stuff like gambling drugs and prostitution i would call this the red light district i suppose this would be like the lowsec area of the station
do you really think giving people the encouragement to stay docked is in any way good for the gameno its not eve is good at spaceships we dont need to turn it into the sims in space oh look wardec who cares i have to do some food shopping in station and buy some wallpaper for my cq sounds terrible and doesnt add anything remotely exciting to the gameoh look corp meeting in the station fck that lets just use teamspeak like we always havethis wis is only relevant for a few rpers anything else would just be boring after day 2 and everyone would just resort back to the old and easier ways to do things calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
see if you can work it out
naw a special rig you can apply to your carrier that turns it into a travel carrier with no jump fatigue but reduces your cargo fleet and maintenance bays by 100 also reduces your drone bay and all defenses by 75 ship cant be repackaged or rig destroyed until 35 days pass
at which point you are better off using a jump clone that uses no fuel and requires no friendalt to light cynos for you
if you guys are really going to move forward with this whole walking in stations thing please make the avatars  characters  capsuleers  people  whatever the hell they are called make them better my guy walks like a girl its troublingedit a weird pretentious girl i would like to add one of those kind who thinks shes all that just because she has a vagina
wis was announced 2011 and all we got until now is the crappy captain quarter and the aurum shopccp please think about it you put so much ressources on dust what nobody plays anyway valkyrie world of darknesslegion etcstop wasting your ressourcesthink about this a secondwalking in stations  avatar interaction  natural zeal to enhance prestige  much more aurum salesor maybe just give us a sign that you hear us let us invite our friends to our quarters and give us the option to play the cool boardgame that you showed us hereedita few minutes after the post there came one thoughta few space sims announced this feature already did you ever think about how much players eve will lose when these games finally come out
exactly but people are coming up with ideas on how to evade jump fatigue with an excuse that logistics movements shouldnt be penalized but warlike things should
shoes oh no the shoooesi want the damn station door to open first before i buy my evewifu a set of high res stilettos
speaking of other space gamesi think its funny that people wail about the processing demands of walking in stations yet the computing resources for star citizen are much higheri can run the captains quarters on my computer and it is smooth as silk star citizen currently runs like a slide show on my pc
because not using a ship with no cargo for up to 5 days just because it equipped a rig isnt somehow worse than making a couple of jumps and slowboating the rest of the wayright

what stops us from applying your same logic to sub capsany force able to field more of the dominant sub caps of the game wins should we remove sub caps too
a lot of them do that anyways until a decent war comes along so no real difference ehmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
if the nerves of my brain were laid out in a line they would stretch approximately 180000 kilometers if the word hate was written on every single neuron it would still not equal one onebillionth of the hate i have for jump fatigue hate hate hateapologies to harlan ellison
it sustains me
the place buyorder function range function of station system all the way up to 40 and region works relativly fine but at times you end up with buyorders covering hostileclosed outposts that forces you to utilize hostile alts to access the modules you have bought there or consider it as the part of your costoverhead as expensesthis sort of works out but isnt a very functional mechanicadditionally with the coming sov changes i can see regions becoming more fragmented which is a good thing a more dynamic 00 plus i think current alliances own more systems than they should considering their sizebut a workable market require a somewhat predictable and stable system having a even higher  of your marketyield locked in even more unaccessable stations will hurt market activity and by proxy one of ccps visions of 00 a thriving playerdeveloped ecosystemthe obvious answer for most alliancescoalitions is to make hubs where the majority of players base out of but that doesnt change the endresult of underuseddeserted outposts not useful for anything beyond their productionresearch slotsso my suggestion ismake the range options include the range filters you have today in addition to a select regional outposts which brings up a window where you can spesifically select which outposts you want your buyorders to reachobviously i can see this being alot of work and ive read and seen comments thru youtubestreams from developers regarding legacy code that have unwanted sideeffects when they change something fundemental but i really think the buyorder range filter is overdue for a tweak
all i can say is  you did it to yourselves the jump fatigue mechanic is a direct response to the common place actions in nullsec  to wit blueing up half the known universe and then blasting across the galaxy in back like you were going to the corner market and stagnating the cluster in a way that had never been done beforeyou created this monster deal with iteve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno

i agree current csm sold us out and i have 30 days of jump timer to prove it
which you only have yourself to blame for as previously stated look i know you guys would love to go back to the days when the only restriction on your movements was how fast you could get a cyno alt to the next target system but you have to face reality those days are gone for good and there are tons of entities just like you who instead of complaining or proposing fixes which are simply transparent efforts at sidestepping fatigue have simply pulled their socks up and adapted how they do thingstheres tons of ways you can increase mobility without falling victim to fatigue and im just going to share one of them  wormholes wormholes are your new best friends so learn about them track them map them and dont be afraid to use them
actually that was me not the current csmsmug
the only thing that 30 day jump timer proves is that you didnt seriously consider the well publicised and explained consequences of your actions
roll the tumbleweed this ones getting the ignore stampgg all better luck next time
dude you really need to stop being so flippant it doesnt really help anyone or anythingthere are ways to deal with this which would be relatively painless however blanket restrictions on one feature to tackle one problem yet affects many game play mechanics which were never actually much of an issue is bad idea
30 days of space aidsexcuse me but how the  do you not realize what youre doing wrong long before you get 30 days of space aidsif you ended up with the max timer after more than 6 months of living with jump fatigue the true issue is with the being between the chair and keyboard here not with the jumo fatigue system

hello one thing that annoys a lot of people is the figure of 8 slow small camera movement that moves when the camera is idle this can be annoying to some such as myself and makes long sped up videos look as if theyve been recorded by shakey cam it would be great if this could become an optional feature thanks o7
i had a big long reply but the forum get 404ing every time i tried to post it forums script is i guess telling me not to waste my time trying to reason with people who dont care about reasons
its all very well saying that there are painless ways to deal with this but all the painless ways so far proposed have either reduced down to pinky swear solutions or are just straight up let me move as many ships around as fast as i like but this is a power projection nerf because whargle garble if youve come up with a way to tesseract the hypersphere then by all means enlighten and impress medont take too long about it though please im not sure how much longer i can hold my breath
i have to agree that the jump bridge fatigue is insanely stupid im willing to accept jump fatigue and all that but having fatigue for going through a jb that you alliance owns in space you own and that you pay to fuel for each jump should not cause fatigue jbs are so we can move around easilyavoid camps we shouldnt be punished for using them
and theyre for the mass movement of fleets across huge distances almost instantly
if you get rid of all the cool things that you can build in nullsec people will start to question what the point of living their is
having lots of smaller groups rather than 2 ultra blocs who only have one fight a year is the very coolest of those things
jump bridges are still pretty cool things to have and use even if theyre not free
and that question is being askedbut i do not see that the jump bridge has been gotten rid of just that it has ceased to be the highway it once was and now pays the same penalty for swift movement that other methods do similar to the risk and reward mantra is power and costmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

i am hesitant about seeking out pvp due to not wanting the expense of replacing learning implants
this is not a good excuse please read the lecture and come fight in lowsec you will not lose your pod if you are careful
this is true the only time i ever lost pods while fighting in lowsec was when i didnt want to fly 15 jumps back home and asked for pod expressoh and when i made the mistake of flying into rancer and landed on the gate occupied by smartbombing rokhs but that was my fault for not paying attention to the half a dozen flashy criminal icons in local
i may have lost my snakes after frantically spamming the warp to button on the beacon 10km away but i guess lowsec cant be held responsible for that one 
then they better make tech 2 versions that dont absolutely suckin all seriousness with lore aside it really does look bad on sped up footage there should be some way of toggling it and not give in to the lore just because it makes more sense
i used to be against this but i have changed my mind actually id even be happy with removing attributes altogetherthe basic meaningful choice of skill training is  unsurprisingly  choosing what to trainboth learning implants and remaps add uninteresting complexity imho almost everybody has 3s4s anyway whether through cheap learning implants or genospirate sets except i assume active nullwh pvpers but why should these guys be penalized also 1s 2s and 5s are pretty much useless compared to the much more common 34sthe basic meaningful choice of pirate sets and hardwires is  again unsurprisingly  choosing whether to plug  and risk  them or not and how much isk to spendriskthe skill training penalty of not plugging in learning implants is incredibly uninteresting agian imho because it has very little to do with the competitive nature of eveplayer a investingrisking more isk than player b in exchange for a bonus now in this fight is good player a investingrisking more than player b in exchange for a bonus or a new ship next year when they probably wont even meet is hilariously uselessif it wasnt necessary to keep people hooked for years i would maybe even just unlock all level vs for everyone its not fleet command v that makes a good fc nor max skilled carrier skills that makes you good at triage or allows you to afford losing several archons while you practice nor max tradeindustry skills that makes you an isk trillionaretldr just joking on that last sentence skill training does make sense to craft your characters  provide choices  keep players hooked  reward loyal players but no need to overdo the complexity we should all be playing in space not on evemonmake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer

to csmgreetingsi am having a mayjor problem i cannot seem to create a corporation due to some alliance that keeps hunting my character and its oporations i created a small high sector based manufacturing company named emerchant family it was a donation based operation that helped new players learn how to create a stream of income yet still let them venture into their own projects it got warced by a hired alliance to stop my operation i have tried diplomacy at first and had no luck other then them trying to get me to pay for they members as they demanded 1525 billion isk just to end the war i couldnt do that as it was against my morals and still couldnt do it as isk does cost money in the real world 5617 us dollars during the war the destroyed my members vessels and pods just for the reputation at one point they corned me in a station and i couldnt even leave because someone was jelious over my characters name and the fastness of my companies growth when the total was more then 3 billion 6740 usd in damages i decided to disband my corporation and remove all members from it it was the only way i could get the war to end and them to stop trying to destoy my gametime as i am a nonhostile in nature and so was my corporation in all of the 3 billion it cost my corp and members we didnt even destroy one of their vesselsnow that that war is over due to having no other choice but to cose the corp i created another to find they still are trying to kill my operations over my toons name i closed this as well and have no choice but to not get my moneys worth out this game due to no being able to do as i like i have played for a total of little over 11 years and never encounted this problem with any of my characters what can i do they refuse to listen except talking isk i cant afford it in real life so their is no way im going to buy them plex to just kill me next month i ask a csm to please respond as i dont want to delete this charcter as he is my main character can a csm get them to stop war and blackmailing with my toon and his operations over someone who hired them being jelious over my toons nameregardsemerchant  imperial shipment
they are even threatening my other characters for all my accounts
pay fight or join a group that can do either
i am on my mobile so i cant check the ops corp history or killboard to verify if heshe is trolling or notif this is legit the csm cant do anything they are a crowdsourcing tool for ccp regarding overall game mechanics ships and modules what you are encountering are legitimate tactics and reasons for said tactics and they have been around since the beginning of the game you can file a petition ingame using the help menu but bear in mind that harassment is a very specific in eve and you have to show that you used every tool available to avoid it staying in npc corps moving to the other side of the map changing up tactics etc in a sandbox game you are allowed to do whatever you want to do but so can everyone else even if their actions are counter to yours the game does not allow anyone to be left alone this is because everyone affects everyone else for better and worse no matter how small the activity is the isds will probably lock this for ranting
honestly if youve been playing for more than a couple of years and you still think 2 bil is a lot of money especially if you seem to think youre some kind of business genius youre doing something wrongif youve been playing eleven years and still think thats a scary amount of money you cant get except by buying plex youre playing the wrong gameand as for your wardec issue can you explain why you feel it should be impossible to wardec someone in highsec especially if they happen to be a business competitorbrowsing your kb history your closed corp lost a freighter to wartargets whyt he hell would you undock a freighter in jita if youre under a dec another one to code dont fly an antitanked freighter through uedama seriously an embarrassingly badly fit navy raven and a pos you had 24 hours notice to pull downand a smattering of t1 crap but yeahyou barely lost anything and everything you did lose is entirely your own fault why should the game be changed to accommodate your total lack of interest in it
i can tell you what those are afk camper well take the isk from the game  because pve under such circumstances is almost impossible without being hotdropedthe cloackie modules need a timer where the ciycle stop all 20 minutes or something like that reactivation would then be connected to a 36 minute delay an art fatiguid system for cloaksi can not understanding this  up trip  ccp would have to know that through such actions as the afk cloaki hotdroping players in eve are expelled the then rather play something else than penetration online 247if im thinking about it i could spinthat was one of the reasons why i stopped playing with eve for a long timemore new things in eve came about and less were the old problems have been fixedbetter make new skins for stupid 800mio isk or better stupit new player mechanics  like this  sakasmwhats about walking on station  thats it alli cant understand this madhads in ccp they make what the big ones in eve hold to not leave the game  so it is only in interessting of one or two big parts in eve none balanceif the big ones crying about a new system implemented in eve which is good for new players and much saver for all the rest  they would cry like kids about getting anymore good and easy kills or why we can anymore cloaki hotdrop anybody and why why why bla bli blui know im a little digressed but with the cloakies is really frustrating one should note that in this case with it is eve is a game and a game should make possible unceremoniously funthis one is permanently penetrated by afk cloakis can not be funive been playing the game since 2004 and has to be seen the game is always more and more crappyi hope ccp and co wakeup before they lost the rest of eve playerswhere i start playing eve it was daily more then 60000k ppl in this gamenow we are reduced to lesser than 27000k  speak for themselves15000 k alliance big one10000 k alliance5000 k alliancethats mad and i have something to laugh aboutso everyone can see 20k of unprooved measure can controll everythingits like wather in the ocean  one wave and all comes with itthank you for reading thisand sorry for the one or two bad wordsd
null sec has always been a pretty low  of the total population and it is about to crash downso afk hot droppers wont matter much
ah yes the good old i didnt get what i want so the csm is simultaneously totally ineffective and yet incredibly corrupt and powerful and totally unrepresentative because the only reason any of them get elected is because tens of thousands of players vote for them spielcontemptible yet at least minimally original when ankhesentapemkah used it to con naive people into voting for her in 2010 contemptible but tediously overplayed and easily refuted in 2015
do try remember that i started this thread saying that i would like the whole csm removed and i tried to get an abstain option and noconfidence vote put in four years ago because i knew that mittens would be useless
mike dont you wonder why people are leaving eve in droves since jump fatigue was introduced
because they pine for the good old days when 00 was split between 2 blocs and there was 1 big fight per year
who i have met lots of players coming back and seen a few go out the door but droves implies a major exodus pl closing down they certainly would have a reason to if we took all their fun away
i think
right because logistics and war have nothing to do with each other so you imply that only holders of significant amounts of sov can give anything other than opinions based on anecdotes and then you call malcanis passiveaggressive wowfrom my point of view as a gateandwormholetaking scrub im sure it was nice to be able to teleport hither and yon your taxi carrier protected by the threat of a giant hotdrop if anyone looked at it sidelong im sure it felt really good to stride across entire regions uncontested ah the glory of empire the problem is that it sucked for everyone elsefor every cap thats been retired because new eden is no longer a pleasant sunday drive how many have been fielded because they no longer have to worry about sunday drivers from the other side of the cluster for everyone who sold their cap alt theres a buyer who wanted it
and your evidence that jump fatigue is the major cause is
fair question yup used jump bridges when with tole under engarde and then scdot not recently late 2012 not since because i have not been part of a null alliance since then so except for some blops work i have accumulated very litte fatigue since the effect came into being and oddly it did not seem to slow us down very muchmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
no but i wasnt the person suggesting it was it was in reference to the health of the game its purely circumstantial and the falling pcu could be many things
would you go to a plumber for informed and educated advice on how to rebuild a car engine would you go to a mechanic to seek advice on your latest physical ailment if you drive a ford should i come to you for advice on buying an audi ive stated several times that the idea of restrictions on capitals and movement by way of fatigue is quite valid however the blanket use of the mechanic without much thought given to some areas was poorly thought out and in several ways too harsh never at any point in this thread did i take on the black or white view point so many others have that its all or nothing
i just want to report that the bumping mechanics are broke big time i just lost a busterd because a little ship kept bumping me so i could not go into warp if a ship bumps a ship he should take damage at this time he takes no damage this condition has led to a tatic that is both unfair and unreasonable anytime someone iniates a bump tactic there should be damage given to the ship that does the bumping
010
ERROR
there should also be damage given to the ship being bumped right based on the speeds and masses of everythign involvedso that a 100mn mwd stabber can crash into a freighter and kill the thing in a single hit
how can the computer tell which ship is bumping which both ships are moving so you bumped that little ship so you should take damage as well
op lets put this simplyi have skinned my dread and my carrier they are good ships between them theyve survived almost every major battle the cfc has been involved in in the past three years or more 6vdt hed br5 pretty much everythign except asakaiwhy exactly should my carrier skin cost me UFFFD1370 but the exact same skin bought from the exact same store not cost a highsec carebear a single pennywhat do you think would happen to the market if it were possible for anyone at all to get hold of skins for free by grinding enough missions ill give you a hint look at the price of a reaper in jita thats about where the skins would be
time and effort investment
perhaps you missed the part where i have invested my time and effort in actually using said ships frequently and in a manner that actually allows for player interactionwhy do you feel that grinding missions is more important than this especially given that your idea would simply collapse the skin market entirely thus losing ccp whatever revenue it brings in
i am not asserting importance merely saying eve is about different paths to the same or similar goals to limit the skins market as it is is counterintuitive to the spirit of eve
and is it not counter productive to leave the skin market in tatters if anyone can obtain an infinate number of them for free they will do the things will end up at reaper prices with ease for reference a reaper in jita is under 78k iskwhy is that good for the gameand does the very fact that you can sell the things for isk not open up enough different paths to obtaining them
i think you misunderstood me or dont understand how skins workonce you activate a permanent license its no longer transferable and you cant just turn around and sell it so the proposed changes i mention mean that a player could not just make isk off of their standing they would only be able to use it on themselves
so you sell them before you activate themi have a couple of dozen of the things sitting in jita i know how a skin works under your system youd simply redeem thousands of them for free and dump them onto the market rather than activating them
i think i see what your saying i didnt mean like that i mean to say that redemption through standings would not be the same as buying with isk it would be automatically made permanent and activated to the player i agree that an untethered standings based skin system is dumb
unfortunately the mechanics of the game are very black and white when it comes to thisthe ability to rapidly move from the far side of nullsec to pick up skillbooks in lowsec is mechanically no different than moving from the far side of nullsec to gank some poor sob in lowsecthe only differences between the two scenarios are the intent and end result and a computer cannot discern your intent until it sees an end result at which point the damage is donetldr traveling quickly is projecting power and jump bridges are no different from capital jump drives in this regard they are merely stationary
this is just more obscurantism a jump bridge isnt an internal combustion engine a carrier isnt a human body the ability to cross the entire cluster easily in one of the most technically dangerous parts of a gigantic pvp game and call it a taxi as if you were just getting around midtown is so obviously a projection of power that theres no arguing it you know that which is why youre trying to fluff this into some arcane issue that only the illuminati know enough to ponderget real it takes about 10 minutes to get up to speed on this issue even blizzard eventually figured out that hey maybe letting players fly willynilly over all of their content is dumb it feels great and players get hooked on the experience but its killing the gamebut you also dodge any attempt to get a specific example that passes the laugh test whether you ever used it or not your taxi enjoyed the implicit protection of a hot drop by the biggest power in the gamebetter protection than yellow cab gets from nypd your logistics runs and your repositioning are intrinsically military i really shouldnt have to explain to a goon that logistics are strategically and tactically vital you guys have the best logistics in the game theres no separating these roles because theres no separation to be found
still waiting for a suggestion that isnt either pinkyswear or whargle garblewhen you come up with one lets continue the discussion then
thread closed
a method to log in would be even better 
i deeply support wis because it would give eve that extra somethingthat argument this game has only to be about spaceships i cant agree with if its so then we also dont need skins high resolution textures new spaceship models etc in most cases the ships are only icons and symbols on our screens or we soon get used to the sight and dont even look anymoreso why we dont just play with gray cubes as ships because just a chicken und hot water alone doesnt make a tasty soupits about the environment in which all this comes together the variety in which the core of the game is embedded the mortar that makes a house out of simple bricksccp advertises this game with the richness and its historyhaving eve source and eve universe lying beside me where is that propagated world from those books where can i find it or where should i find it if not in the game itselfeve has this unique world and ccp shouldnt hide it instead they should be more proud of it and let us dive into it and not only on some pictures in a book the technology is there it just need to be used and carried outwis alone surely isnt that panacea but its one part of it like skins textures lighting etc if eve would only be about battling spaceships then eve wouldnt be that what it ismaybe i can suggest something like plex for wis or other crowdfunding methods to get the required resources without removing these from other projects maybe a license system for the finished productor perhaps a more democratic payment system where you can choose for what as example one third of your fees should be spend for improving null sec more ships more skins wis etci can even think about a premium membership where you pay some extra money to fund and increase the development of your desired interest as long as no single fraction is favoured by those developmentsat the release day you will get the stuff as supporter for free while all others have to buy it at the new eden store or on the marketwith that everybody would get what he wants wis supporter can discover the full diversity of new eden exploring the different stations can meet with other avatars perhaps one day even explore the homeworlds of the factionspeople who dont like that and didnt supported can still play just the game they like without the impression that their resources are wasted for other players fun or enriching the product as wholeso you see walking in stations is fundable even without downscaling the development speed of other parts of the gameim also sceptical that the concept of spaceships alone as propagated by some bittervets will help eve survive against other current and future spaceship gameseve isnt minecraft or angry birds and will it never be where such a simple concept alone works
i would just like to add i took a 18 month break from eve to return from what used to be a 120k playerbase at the times i play to now a 20k playerbase sure they got rid of a lot of bots so they say but the game has gotten way too easy and i can only imagine how much players gave up because of that fact instead of making it simple for the new players and taking away the struggle to get to the point you have a solid income system be it with missions industry or pvp they now just hand you everything simple mechnics like clones why did they feel the need to mess with that because the stupid and the dumb forgot to update them died and came here to cry why is an ice belt in hisec an anomaly that doesnt need seeking because the lazy came here to cry people who like the way things are running never post it on forums for 2 reasons 1 why would they theyre enjoying the game theyre having fun with it and like it the way it is why should they start a topic saying i really like this game which 910 turns into a flamethead by people who dislike it 2 yes we might like the game but that doesnt mean we want it to stop growing an moving forwards they already made it a lot too easy to start off in this game just yesterday i was in the help chat trying to help someone figure out how to fit his catalyst he played the game for 2 days and already trying to pvp what monstrosity has this game become i dont recognise it anymore
youre right how dare a 2day old player get down to playing the game he should be forced to spent the first month or two training learning skills
hmm the last post is already so long nobody will read this but neverthelessfor me wis isnt a waste of resources its a necessity to hold up pace with other developments like star citizennew players dont have any clues about sov changes entosis link modules burner missions etc which are certainly important things for the current players but with that alone ccp cant motivate new players to give eve a trythey look and compare do we have spaceship battles yes good does it look nice hell yeah i like that rust what else do we have nothing i cant even walk in my ship or around it or on the station i docked in star citizen i can even use the toilet on my ship  and there we have a simple but effective argument to decide against eve not because of the toilet but the functionality as wholeeve online isnt sims in space yes i agree the sims is about founding a family get friends and a good paid job to buy nice things for you and for upgrading your house upgrading your house hey the sims isnt a construction simulator but still many people play and pay the game just for thatso the argument that implementing additional functionality in eve that has no direct effect on the core game is a waste of resources is an argument which cant be more wrongwe have so many useless fun items give them a use in wis something that has already been mentioned in this thread like micro transactions not everyone will use that but every paying customer is a good customerwhen i look at the player statistics i see a shrinking number of players and if wis can help attract new capsuleers what i believe and even if they only stick on their stations or dont use it at the end at all it still helps to keep this game running and thats the important pointi also say that ccp has the resources to develop it wikipedia says they have around 600 employees if they would take 1 of them for wis you wouldnt notice that on the other projects but they can continue on wis development slowly but steady the first thing could be adding more quartiers for every station type adding the functionality to place objectsitems in your room like placing the sisters of eve charity statue on the glass table in your quartier adding bigger quartiers where the current one is only the hangar waiting area here is a good opportunity that this has to be payed for in aurum open the station doors and let people meet give the players the ability to go down on planets eventually meet dust players directly and give them a ride to the next planet at this point you can implement a whole new sandbox game inside the eve universewalking in station is an important part of securing the future of eve online the sooner ccp is rethinking their current strategy about wis the better for us all giving up just because you failed once is the wrong answergo csm do something i voted for
i am surely boring the bittervets to death but there is still morewith walking in stations i dont necessary support the original plan years ago its about the opportunities that comes with it bonding with the game the environment and the people in itlets take an example maybe the last of usif the players who played it to the end were given the chance to immediately buy a second part and play it most would have done it why emotionsnaughty dog understood it perfectly to use something very human our emotions to create a bond between the player and the characters something that was amazingly well donewould this have worked with a top down view and icons as zombies it definitely could have made fun when its made solid and good but would it had the same success or even made the player cry and buy immediately a second part i dont think soso lets go back to the point eve doesnt need wis because its about spaceshipsif you are that guy who plays exactly the same thing for hours every day and year without getting bored as time is passing and if you are happy to share that experience in future with only a small numbers of veteran capsuleers left then yes wis isnt right for youall others be reminded on that i was there trailer for noneveplayers a little bit strange but for us who attended such fights not very far away from the truth and here we have again this important element emotionshere are some examples what i have in mind by thinking about wis1 be a new capsuleer and just started in the corporations headquarter on the station making some tutorials when suddenly an alarm goes on security gates get locked the program on the tvs are changing to a live view from outside the stationyou see two battleship in a fight you hear rumbling noises when debris and shockwaves hit your stationthen you think its possibly part of a tutorial but the view on your chat says otherwise then the station is shaking you look at the screen and one of the ships is gone silencethe view back to the chat tells you you arent the only one who just experienced this for the first timethe alarm goes off and you see someone entering the station you see his grim face and the medals on his chest are telling you thats not a random dude thats the one who just blow up that battleshipwhile thinking that he is passing you and heading right to the casino to make more of the bounty he just got2 getting an invitation to meet at the corp headquarter you trying to join since days so you are following the orders you dock and walk the way to the office you are opening the door and there they are lined up to welcome you dressed in their own corp clothes while you are walking down the line toward the ceo you are passing numerous awards one says this corp was founded in 2003 you see medals and pokals of past tournaments and victories there is even a bust of the ceos head this place smells like victory and its long historyfinally arrived at the ceo he is handing over your corp clothes wear it with pride and dont dishonor them and give you a certificate with your name and corp entry date on it a certificate which you place later in your own study room with pride in a frame on the wall behind your desk3 you know its lost you spend years to build up your own empire but times are changing fast you dont know how the enemy breached the defences but you know its lost they attacked your station with the moment of surprise on their side and your fleet is too many jumps away to get here in timethere are only minutes left until shields of your station are down and undocking is just suicidefor the last time you are strolling the hallways with every hit the station is shaking and groaning and the lights flicker at your quartier you decide to keep the lights off instead you are pushing a button and the wall that was just your tv becomes translucentyou see the enemy fleet out there and with every hit of their weapons your room gets illuminated you decide to turn on some music pachelbels canon in d maybe and the noises of the impacts quieten down you see that your fleet commander is trying to contact you he got ambushed and must retreata last look on the wall let you see the founding document of this station it was your second but lasted as longest for years it was yours your headquarter the starting and now the ending point of an empireyou are walking to the translucent wall to take a last view of the stars your sectora bright white flash appears followed by darkness and silence4 you played eve for more than a decade its already a few months ago when you decided to give this new eve content a try fortunately you put once some isk beside enough to buy some land on this new planetwhile looking at your land in the evening sun you are noticing this new star above you in the sky it flashes strangely then a second one four ten a fleet of spaceships illuminated by the sun there a brighter flashand gone never will you forget the pictures of an exploding ship once they were afraid of you while others watched up on you you were once a part of them but sooner or later everything is ending and here we have the start of something new with a little bit effort you can turn this land into something great something never seen beforewith wis everyone has different pictures and thoughts in his mind but for me the most important part of it is the ability to bond the player much stronger to the eve universe due and with the help of emotions and by individualizing and personalizing of experiencespart 2 
 part 1sure a call over team speak that you can join the corp does its purpose but much more memorable and bonding is what i described in 2 that sticks in your headputting a newbie in a rookie ship out in space and tell him to fly to point a does its purpose as tutorial but is it interesting exciting or even bonding no but 1 is that gives you the feel to be there even if you dont play an active role in itwis is more than staring at the boobs of other female characters its about experiencing and feeling that game way more intense than today something that even the nicest looking spreadsheet space simulation alone never will achieveemotions sell therefore eve needs wissometimes 6000 characters arent enough sorry for that
nothing but it being messy the system would have to be redone they could build in special exceptions of course but thats extra time and labor for something that will be ripped back out time and the value of time is always very important idealy wed like to see changes released completed instead of having stop gap code shoved into place
the csm cannot step in and stop another corporation from declaring war on your corporationyou have been deced and the people have actually hunted your corporation down instead of just sitting in a trade hub they want isk but paying them will probably cause more people to dec you and more isk to be demanded you do not wish to learn to defend yourself or fight back against them because you are not aggressivethere are very aggressive people in this game they will threaten your in game character and in game assets that is the game play that they enjoy knowing that the csm cannot stop the war decs and that ccp needs more than a discussion of distaste for a mechanic are their any other things that you think might help or have helped you to survive the declaration instead of dissolving your corporation
youre just completely missing the point but sure we
i like xenbut to the average player the csm is an entire waste  100 totally useless if you run on a platform to have 1 final csm and then disband csm forever i would vote for you
