"yes it would be nice, agreed. but everyone old enough to know that santa doesn't really exist should also be mature enough that barring \"eccentric billionaire pays ccp 50 million bucks to do it\" type scenarios, wis is never going to happen.i could reiterate all the reasons why ccp aren't able to deliver it any more, and aren't motivated to make the huge investment required to restart the project (essentially from scratch) even if they were able to raise the resources to do so (they can't), but you have already read and handwaved away or ignored those many times already, so why bore you with them again?so i will merely say this in all kindness: just accept it. i know it sucks. i agree that it is a huge waste of potential. i absolutely comprehend that if the wis project hadn't been utterly mismanaged and pissed away years worth of dev resources then it might have lifted eve to a whole new experiential level. but it was and it did, and it now won't ever achieve that, and those are the cold facts after 4 years, you should be well past the denial, anger and bargaining phases. use that energy and commitment towards something that will actually happen. you owe it to yourself."
"i'm wondering where you're getting the whole completely dead and they would have to redevelop stuff to restart it bit. the last bit i heard that was confirmed from ccp was basically that no one in management was willing to be the one to stand up and say they should devote any sort of resources to expanding the project after all of the blowback after the initial launch.there's certainly nothing to indicate that there's some huge tech debt hurdle to overcome here.on the flip side i know you generally know what you're talking about and aren't prone to vast sweeping exaggerations.so, in short, got a source for this?"
"stop putting words in peoples mouths. nobody was discriminating against goons. you can always have your alt1 move things from a to b, your 2nd alt from b to c, your main clonejumps from a to c, voila. no fatigue and your stuff is where it should be.multple character training, do you even use it?"
"i love the way it is now, its ofc a quick patch to a more structural issue in null sec force projection, and requires more mechanicsms, wihtout those we also not where we w<U+FFFD>nt to be. but atm if i look at kills pilots for example in provi get ,they up in numbers and isk, big time, ee have fights without the world pilling onto them, as currently wiht nc. super and cap deployment is limited and so is tidi. all seem to have fun and fatique and range add strategic choices too it.for form ups people can travel in industrials through the jb network, ceptors, and jumpclones. those combined take care of most traffic realised. so as a player and as a csm i am happy with it for now, and more intrested how it will hold under the new sov mechanics with fozzie sov, and hopefully further down the line with structures, buildable stargates and long term future. i ma also intrsted in the rebalance of titans nad supers, in combo wiht fatique.so whilst its not your ultimate feature, its a quick patch that workes like intended untiill and so on."
"i support the idea of jump fatigue in making sov less stagnant, but i also think having it on jump bridges is a little overkill but removing it from jbs would then most likely make most people go jump bridge crazy. so instead, maybe have a fatigue reduction bonus on jump bridges the same way as on industrial ships?"
"before i made csm i made a post on margin trading, and ccp answered its a fe<U+FFFD>ture, so i tried it af ee times myself and make nice isk. when i started runnign csm i stopped, so i know how it worksthere is several kinds of scams wit it. once where there is only enough money for 25 % of the inflated or rare item. those are the dumb onces, u can crash their order if u own the item, i even collect stuff they liek to crash them and make money of them. the other one is where u first sell a minimum amoutn to yourself, so there is 0.0 isk in the escrow left and a market buy value of billions. it will always collaps. and leave the victim scammed.escrow however is also used alot in legit ways that drive the economy. so the trick woudl be too keep that and fix the other exploit. it is doable since you coudl do a exception math. if the order in cant be forfilled with the minimum sale possible, then the order cant hold, as noone can sell anything too anythign on your buy list. it would leave honest owners options. so basically: buyin: 10 items of 100 mill a piece, with a minimum of 10. so minimum sale is 1 bill, escrow needs to hold 1 bill or buy order fallsbuying 10 items of 100 mill a piece, minimum of 5 , ecrow meeds too hold 500 millbuying 10 items of 100 mill a piece, minimum of 1 ,escrow needs to be 100 mill, escrow skiill overwrites, 250 minimumbit technical, but that woudl fix it, however i havent as a csm found much enthousaism for it, but its on my list. i can show any ccp life sometime how to set up a escrow with 0 isk in and buy orders of billions, rigged too collaps"
"i never really knew about this until i read this post. i'm guessing this is associated with those \"market fail order\" posts you'll see in market hubs like amarr and jita.if that's the case i'd agree with the majority, if you're gonna be stupid and/or greedy, then you'd have to pay the price. because this skill is great for traders, and people who are incapable of doing thorough research make it a great skill for scammers too :)i'd say this skill should stay, and people should instead brush up on their scam detection abilities...."
"i'm starting to regret my vote. that post is all well and good, but ignores the person being scammed and their initial intentions. how can you think of making a change such as yours, without looking to them first?so ask yourself, what was their thought process before hand. what did they expect to gain from the order, who did they think would be better off and less well off after it completed? let's face it they were simply over charged for something. they paid well over the normal market price, so ask yourself why.i'm all for giving players information to help them, but i'm dead against changing mechanics to help the lazy. because that's what we have here. those so set on ripping others off, that they fail to gather more info than the buy and sell order price. given the fact the information that helps them avoid this expensive mistake, is readily at hand.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"when you initially set-up or change your planetary facilities or schematics it's quite a timely process and i can think of some ways this can be improved to save time and make life easier for capsuleers who do planetary interaction.when placing production facilities or extractors, you have to select the facility or extractor, place it and then keep repeating the process until all your desired facilities are placed. instead of this process a better way would be to select the desired facility and remain in placement mode for that facility until you've placed the desired amount of facilities, then you can select the next facility to be placed.the same thing applies with link creation. to create links you click on 'create link' then you click on the 1st facility, then the 2nd and a link is created. then this process is repeated for every link. i think it'd work better if you enter a link creation mode and instead of clicking on the from and to facility, you'd click-drag instead, that way you can continue creating links from and to facilities without having to click on 'create link' every time.another nice feature would be an undo option in case you accidentally routed, placed or linked something incorrectly. this would be better than cancelling all your changes, deleting individual links or decommissioning individual facilities.then another timely process is installing schematics and routing incoming and outgoing commodities. this however i haven't been able to think of a better way of doing. all i can think of for now is having a schematic paint mode, different ones for basic, advanced and high-tech facilities so that a single schematic can be assigned to multiple facilities quickly and easily.as for routing to and from facilities, i think a better way would be to show it's produced commodity and required commodities in a single, tab-separated window where you can select one of them and assign a route where it has to output it's produced commodity or take it's required commodities from instead of having to go to it's 'products' option and route it's produced commodity, then having to go to the facility storing or producing the required commodities and routing them to that facility. but on this option i think someone out there might have a better suggestion?pi is currently a timely and slightly irritating process if you're not focusing on producing a single product continuously. hopefully this can be improved in the future. o7"
"the launcher issue is known, note that the csm doesnt get involved in bugs and technical issues, we have a internal bug channel with ccp, and ofc on major things like the skin bug we do get updated. tickets are still they way too sort this. and if more thne one on same issue that does help bump the importance.i agree that there is a risk wiht a quicker candence , however it also reduces several issues with long developed releases. from csm point i see developers more in control , taking responsibility for what the release and taking action, i disagree wiht bugs and such being more abundant, hard too pinpoint, e cept the launcher issue is pretty prominent ofc.keep reporting what you find, and we will ask ccp ofc as they inform us how the new candence works, and even moves to a future where stuff is released when done, even outside the windows"

"hello guys.i would like to share a few ideas i have for the situation with capitals and supercapitals after fozzisov hits. many people are panicking because they think/know that titans will become next to useless when fozzisov hits. i have two ideas that would hopefully make titans of more use.1.) buff their turret/missile damageyou're probably thinking 'whoa! they're the most powerful ships in the game! making them stronger is insane!', but hear me out. as of current meta, triage carriers (most favorably the archon for armor fleets, and chimera for shield fleets) are commonly used as a mass backup of logistics, remote repairing sub-capital fleets within sub-to-sub cap fights. those of you who were there (or if you've heard about it), remember when cfc/n3/pl dropped about 15 titans on a cfc/n3/pl vs provibloc fight just so provibloc couldn't bring triage carriers on the field? that kind of threat needs to be raised for the single titan. sure, make it so titans can only effectively hit capitals, but making their weapons stronger will mean that in those sort of engagements, only 1 or 2 titans need to be dropped to shut down the ability for foes to bring triage carriers on grid, or have it so titans have enough power on their guns to take down a flock of triage carriers quickly on the field to make them worth.but what if their guns aren't kill? that brings me onto my second point.2.) buff their doomsdaynow you're probably moving away from this forum. why would you ever buff the biggest and most powerful single weapon in all of new eden? i'll tell you why. it takes numbers of titans to successfully use their doomsday on even just one carrier and take it down, if that carrier is tanked hard enough, which is can do. the max you can get out of a carrier's ehp w/out boosts is about 5 mil ehp, if i calculated correctly. doomsdays currently do 2 million ehp per shot, and take into account that the doomsday can only be fired once every 10 minutes, and takes a fair bit of fuel to fire, and also take into account that within those 10 minutes, it can't be jumped out. i think that to make them worthwhile to bring on the field, make the doomsdays do 5-8 million ehp a shot. also, another idea would be to make the doomsday operate similar to how the remote ecm burst works. still make it so the major amount of ehp hit can only be hit onto a capital, but what would make it worthwhile is that after it has been fired, have an area of effect damage around the target ship, and at least a good enough amount to lower the tank of a t3. this would make doomsdays actually worthwhile in bringing titans on the field and activating their doomsdays. i would also suggest lowering the time it takes for the titan to take a jump home, but that would eliminate or at least lower the risk of bringing them on field, to a certain degree.if these changes do occur, and i would be over the moon if a csm member actually did think this was a great idea, then it will hopefully provide an option to risk these vessels.thank you for reading, and please reply back telling me if you liked the idea of if i've gone completely insane.o7"
"i've another idea for improving"
"hello dear community members, this was basicly a supportticket i wrote earlier allready, which i want to share. the contacted gm assured me he forwarded it to the right people but convinced me to also post this on the formus (even with a link, thanks gm spider)supportticket:\"as allways, i hope this ist the correct category, i have a hard time finding the right one.i am a hobby industrialist and like to manufacture things for profit. this is very important for the faction ship market as many people just put their bpcs in contracts and wait for a person like me to buy and manufacture them. (according to the full industry index on jita station i'm not the only one.) however my problem is, that i have to buy the minerals individually per blueprint. if i make my 5 daredevils for example thats 8x5 so 40 times rightklicking \"buy\" on the required mineral. i have found a workaround, where i show info on the outcome ship, klick info on it, tab over to industry tab, klick show info on the blueprint (there shownd as a original) and press \"show in industry\". this way i can buy the exact amounts for multiple ships with a rightklick, put up immediate buyorder. however it won't display how much i allready have in minerals. so without a sellorder for 16,84m units of tritanium, i will end up in need to buy a second time, whats left out.this is not only annying for me as a player but also a bigg issue for ccp since it creates a big chunk of jita lag on the servers.so thats why i'm asking in a support ticket now to implement a multiple run simulation for (faction) blueprint copies. so peole only need to buy their minerals one time.screenshot:"
"you've gone completely insane."
"explain more?"
"i don't have the time or energy (nor does, i believe, any other sane human) to explain every reason and link to every other post explaining why what you're asking for is a bad thing, dating back from when i started in 2007 to now.use the forum search thingy and look at the old forums."
"you mean you can't give a valid reason? because aoe dds actually did ****, and while the current dd system is great, if it worked like remote ecm, then it will add a threat to subcaps as well, giving a good reason to drop titans on grid."
"if that's your thinking, you've (1) not done your homework on the myriad other threads detailing why aoe dds are a bad thing and (2) not read the long stretch of threads and reasonings as to why titan turret damage was nerfed in the first place.i'm not your parent. you're grown up enough to learn how to search the internet."
"yes, which i agreed with, as stated. is there something wrong with reading comprehension in this forum or are people deliberately truculent?"
"both."
"because there's no tangible difference between a \"space taxi\" and a carrier that's being deployed to support force projection. how on earth is whatever mechanic you'd like to see going to differentiate between the two? a pop-up where you can check a box that says you pinky-swear you're not moving your \"space taxi\" for any nefarious purposes?"
"wow, just wow.. i didn't think anyone would have the audacity to propose something like that.titans are serving a pretty well used niche currently. bridging of sub-cap ships and killing off poorly tanked carriers off with doomsday.if you buff all those things for a titan, how do you kill one? bring more titans? hey, what about if we do all your proposed changes but make another small change. every sub-cap ship in the vicinity has the chance to engage the titan on a smaller scale, like an infiltrator ship flying inside it, docking with it and letting troops in. a mini game of space marines, if the titan pilot wins the mini-game, nothing happens. if the titan pilot loses, weapons, propulsion, jump capability and defenses are put offline."
"i do know how to search the internet. i also know how cap/supercap engagements happen.please tell me, if you were the pilot of a titan, and your alliance's nyx has been hotdropped by 3 other supercarriers, would you drop in your titan? no, because you wouldn't be able to break the spider tanks of the other 3 supercarriers.but what if your titan was actually powerful enough to mean something in field presence without having to be put in mass numbers? then you'd feel more comfortable with putting your titan on grid."
"poorly tanked. exactly. if the carrier pilot actually knows what he's doing, then he will be able to tank a doomsday, and might i add, very well. bridging subcaps? these ships are supposed to be the most threatening in the game, and an end game for alliances, but just to serve as a bridge? no, that is silly. if that game just carries on, then we won't even see titans on grid, because for what cause? new sov systems is just going to eliminate any need to have to risk your big ships. no one's going to drop a titan on a couple of carriers, because you can do a better job with subcaps that pump out more dps, but people would use titans for such a job if there was enough force to make it a considerable option.killing a titan with these new traits would be easy. if there's no caps on grid, then subcaps will just melt him, because he can't dd subcaps, and that's because these ships are geared towards doing a good job of countering other capitals, which is why it needs a bit more of a reason to use it for that sole purpose."
"you obviously do not know how to search the internet or have any idea about how supercap escalations happen if you're seriously suggesting that going back to the incredibly not-fun times of titan fleet dominance is a good idea.this whole thread smells of the usual 'a-bloo-bloo-bloo endgame thing no is iwin butan,' which is dumb and really just means you need to back to playing with elves and pixie dust."
"considering it's the one ship that takes the longest to train up for and build, i would say it's an end game ship."
"so basically, you're proposing the existing industry tab be implemented so it can directly interface with the local market.so, what happens when there are no minerals avaliable in the local station/system? does it buy the closest and cheapest minerals avaliable even if they are out in low-sec and null-sec? i presume, you'd want some kind of control over these things. so when you go \"interface with market\" you'll get the cheapest minerals as close to your industrial facility as possible."
"there is no \"end game\" in eve."
"[/quote]i agree with this. eve is a game which revolves around politics, and social organizations. religion, corporations, clans and tribes is really what we are all about. fighting in spaceships is not who we are, it's just what we do. who we are has a lot more to do with who our family and friends are, what we do in our spare time, etc. wis would/ could/ should be something to help develop the roleplaying/ and interacting with the milieu of a science fiction world. also, i agree about the potential micro-transaction market. custom furniture, clothes, books, food and drink, trophies, etc. could all be items crafted, bought and sold by players. besides captain's quarters, office space in a station could be rented out as well as a bar, casino, chapel, cafe, etc. tbh, i think even just having a corporate board room to meet your fellow corpies might be the next step. instead of just your own captain's quarters, you might have an option of taking a transport tube to 'the' board room for an 'in person' meeting. this would be just as 'boring' as the captain's quarters, but it would be refreshing to actually see your other corp-mates in 'person' at least. also, it would make sense from an in-game perspective. why would you need to run in a station that had maglev trains and transport tubes? why would there be fighting in a space station that was secured by your faction? of course, people will still want to be able to fight in stations. i wonder if this should be restricted to melee weapons? not only are they more 'fun' than pistols, but they are probably safer to use in space as well. imagine what would happen if a bullet or a laser beam ricocheted off the walls of a space station? what if they punctured the space station exterior?"
"why do you want it to turn into a first/third person game?\"ccp needs to work less on spaceships. spaceships are the best working part of their franchise. and also the least important\"oh why is that? so we should leave broken stuff and move onto creating more broken things? spaceships are the games core, so its the most important thing. calm down miner. as you pointed out, people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl... like for example illegal mining... - ima wreckyou*"
"just to add on something here. in the eve world, a space station is about the only place that is somewhat safe. the only way to not die is to not undock. ever since i first joined eve, there has been an ongoing battle between the miners/ farmers and the pirates/ griefers that like to gank them. the miners, whom some might call 'carebears', are adamant that high-sec space be safer for them, while the pirates correctly point out that no where is safe in eve, not even in high sec space. ccp has chosen to address this problem by 'nerfing' high sec, at least to the point where they are making it more difficult to 'safari' high sec player corps. perhaps this is necessary, since a lot of players are reluctant to leave the npc corps specifically for this reason. i might suggest that the wis station interiors become a sort of 'newbie' zone. these would be an area to walk around in and explore in safety, while giving your character a 'feel' for life in their chosen faction. this might even be part of the newbie tutorials, walking (or taking a transport tube) to each agent's office in the station. the starting station would have a university campus sort of atmosphere, lots of young people and students. there might also be some opportunities to make money reasonably safely doing 'social' jobs within the station. it is already possible to make money safely while docked through station trading, why not also as a bartender? i mention this specifically because eve has a tendency towards inflation. goods are becoming more expensive to buy, but missions are paying the same as they always have. many newbies gravitate towards mining because it seems like the surest, steadiest money for people starting out. if newbies had the opportunity to make money crafting items for use in the station, or roleplaying a 'social' job, there might be higher new player retention. did you get your mining ship ganked? no insurance? you might have to work in a station job for a while until you can afford a new ship. there might also be parts of the station set aside for fighting and other nasty stuff, like gambling, drugs and prostitution. i would call this the 'red light district'. i suppose this would be like the low-sec area of the station."
"do you really think giving people the encouragement to stay docked is in any way good for the game?no its not, eve is good at spaceships, we dont need to turn it into the sims in space, oh look wardec who cares i have to do some food shopping in station and buy some wallpaper for my cq, sounds terrible and doesnt add anything remotely exciting to the game.oh look corp meeting in the station, fck that lets just use teamspeak like we always have.this wis is only relevant for a few rp'ers, anything else would just be boring after day 2 and everyone would just resort back to the old and easier ways to do things calm down miner. as you pointed out, people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl... like for example illegal mining... - ima wreckyou*"
"see if you can work it out."
"naw. a special rig you can apply to your carrier that turns it into a travel carrier with no jump fatigue, but reduces your cargo, fleet and maintenance bays by 100%. also reduces your drone bay and all defenses by 75%. ship can't be repackaged or rig destroyed until 3-5 days pass."

"wis was announced 2011, and all we got until now is the crappy captain quarter and the aurum shop.ccp please, think about it, you put so much ressources on dust (what nobody plays anyway), valkyrie, world of darkness,legion etc.stop wasting your ressources.think about this a second:walking in stations -> avatar interaction -> natural zeal to enhance prestige -> much more aurum salesor maybe just give us a sign that you hear us, let us invite our friends to our quarters and give us the option to play the cool boardgame that you showed us here.edit:a few minutes after the post there came one thought.a few space sims announced this feature already. did you ever think about how much players eve will lose when these games finally come out?"
"exactly. but people are coming up with ideas on how to evade jump fatigue with an excuse that \"logistics movements shouldn't be penalized\" but \"warlike things should\"."

"it sustains me."
"the \"place buyorder\" function range function of station, system all the way up to 40 and region works relativly fine. but at times you end up with buyorders covering hostile/closed outposts that forces you to utilize hostile alts to access the modules you have bought there, or consider it as the part of your costoverhead as \"expenses\".this sort of works out, but isnt a very functional mechanic.additionally, with the coming sov changes i can see regions becoming more fragmented, which is a good thing. a more dynamic 0.0, plus, i think current alliances own more systems than they should considering their size.but a workable market require a somewhat predictable and stable system. having a even higher % of your marketyield locked in even more unaccessable stations will hurt market activity, and by proxy one of ccps visions of 0.0; a thriving playerdeveloped ecosystem.the obvious answer for most alliances/coalitions is to make hubs, where the majority of players base out of, but that doesnt change the endresult of underused/deserted outposts not useful for anything (beyond their production/research slots).so my suggestion is;make the \"range\" options include the range filters you have today in addition to a \"select regional outpost(s)\" which brings up a window where you can spesifically select which outpost(s) you want your buyorders to reach.obviously i can see this being alot of work, and ive read and seen comments thru youtube/streams from developers regarding legacy code that have unwanted sideeffects when they change something fundemental. but i really think the \"buyorder range\" filter is overdue for a tweak."
"all i can say is - you did it to yourselves. the jump fatigue mechanic is a direct response to the common place actions in nullsec - to wit, blueing up half the known universe and then blasting across the galaxy in back like you were going to the corner market, and stagnating the cluster in a way that had never been done before.you created this monster. deal with it.eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"

"which you only have yourself to blame for as previously stated. look i know you guys would love to go back to the days when the only restriction on your movements was how fast you could get a cyno alt to the next target system but you have to face reality, those days are gone for good and there are tons of entities just like you who instead of complaining or proposing 'fixes' which are simply transparent efforts at sidestepping fatigue have simply pulled their socks up and adapted how they do things.there's tons of ways you can increase mobility without falling victim to fatigue and im just going to share one of them - wormholes. wormholes are your new best friends so learn about them, track them, map them and dont be afraid to use them."

"30 days of space aids?!?!?!?excuse me, but how the **** do you not realize what you're doing wrong long before you get 30 days of space aids?if you ended up with the max timer after more than 6 months of living with jump fatigue, the true issue is with the being between the chair and keyboard here, not with the jumo fatigue system."

"i have to agree that the jump bridge fatigue is insanely stupid. i'm willing to accept jump fatigue and all that but having fatigue for going through a jb that you alliance owns, in space you own and that you pay to fuel for each jump should not cause fatigue. jbs are so we can move around easily/avoid camps, we shouldnt be punished for using them."

"and that question is being asked.but i do not see that the jump bridge has been 'gotten rid of' just that it has ceased to be the highway it once was and now pays the same penalty for swift movement that other methods do. similar to the 'risk and reward' mantra is 'power and cost'mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

"i am hesitant about seeking out pvp due to not wanting the expense of replacing learning implants."
"this is not a good excuse. please read the lecture and come fight in lowsec. you will not lose your pod if you are careful."
"this is true. the only time i ever lost pods while fighting in lowsec was when i didn't want to fly 15+ jumps back home, and asked for pod express.oh, and when i made the mistake of flying into rancer and landed on the gate occupied by smartbombing rokhs, but that was my fault for not paying attention to the half a dozen flashy criminal icons in local."

"then they better make tech 2 versions that don't absolutely suck.in all seriousness, with lore aside, it really does look bad on sped up footage. there should be some way of toggling it, and not give in to the lore, just because it makes more sense."
"i used to be against this, but i have changed my mind. actually, i'd even be happy with removing attributes altogether.the basic 'meaningful choice' of skill training is - unsurprisingly! - choosing what to train.both learning implants and remaps add uninteresting complexity, imho. almost everybody has +3s/+4s anyway (whether through cheap learning implants or genos/pirate sets), except (i assume) active null/wh pvpers, but why should these guys be penalized? also, +1s, +2s and +5s are pretty much useless compared to the much more common 3/4s.the basic 'meaningful choice' of pirate sets and hardwires is - again, unsurprisingly! - choosing whether to plug - and risk - them or not, and how much isk to spend/risk.the 'skill training penalty' of not plugging in learning implants is incredibly uninteresting, agian imho, because it has very little to do with the competitive nature of eve.player a investing/risking more isk than player b in exchange for a bonus now, in this fight is good. player a investing/risking more than player b in exchange for a bonus or a new ship next year when they probably won't even meet is hilariously useless.if it wasn't necessary to keep people hooked for years, i would maybe even just unlock all level vs for everyone! it's not fleet command v that makes a good fc, nor max skilled carrier skills that makes you good at triage (or allows you to afford losing several archons while you practice), nor max trade/industry skills that makes you an isk trillionare.tl;dr just joking on that last sentence, skill training does make sense to craft your character(s) / provide choices / keep players hooked / reward loyal players but no need to overdo the complexity! we should all be playing in space, not on evemon.make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"

"to: csmgreetings,i am having a mayjor problem. i cannot seem to create a corporation due to some alliance that keeps hunting my character and its oporations. i created a small high sector based manufacturing company named, emerchant family. it was a donation based operation that helped new players learn how to create a stream of income yet still let them venture into their own projects. it got warced by a hired alliance to stop my operation. i have tried diplomacy at first and had no luck other then them trying to get me to pay for they members as they demanded 1.5-2.5 billion isk just to end the war. i couldnt do that as it was against my morals and still couldnt do it as isk does cost money in the real world ($56.17 us dollars). during the war the destroyed my members vessels and pods just for the reputation. at one point they corned me in a station and i couldnt even leave because someone was jelious over my characters name and the fastness of my companies growth. when the total was more then 3 billion ($67.40 usd) in damages i decided to disband my corporation and remove all members from it. it was the only way i could get the war to end and them to stop trying to destoy my gametime as i am a non-hostile in nature and so was my corporation. in all of the 3 billion it cost my corp and members we didn't even destroy one of their vessels.now that that war is over due to having no other choice but to cose the corp. i created another to find they still are trying to kill my operations over my toons name. i closed this as well and have no choice but to not get my moneys worth out this game due to no being able to do as i like. i have played for a total of little over 11 years and never encounted this problem with any of my characters. what can i do. they refuse to listen except talking isk. i cant afford it in real life so their is no way im going to buy them plex to just kill me next month. i ask a csm to please respond as i dont want to delete this charcter as he is my main character. can a csm get them to stop war and blackmailing with my toon and his operations over someone who hired them being jelious over my toons name?regards,emerchant - imperial shipment"

"honestly, if you've been playing for more than a couple of years and you still think 2 bil is a lot of money, especially if you seem to think you're some kind of business genius, you're doing something wrong.if you've been playing eleven years and still think that's a scary amount of money you can't get except by buying plex, you're playing the wrong game.and as for your wardec issue, can you explain why you feel it should be impossible to wardec someone in highsec, especially if they happen to be a business competitor?browsing your kb history, your closed corp lost a freighter to wartargets (whyt he hell would you undock a freighter in jita if you're under a dec?), another one to code (don't fly an anti-tanked freighter through uedama, seriously) an embarrassingly badly fit navy raven, and a pos you had 24 hours notice to pull down.and a smattering of t1 crap, but yeah.you barely lost anything, and everything you did lose is entirely your own fault. why should the game be changed to accommodate your total lack of interest in it?"
"i can tell you what those are afk camper well. take the isk from the game .. because pve under such circumstances is almost impossible without being hotdroped.the cloackie modules need a timer where the ciycle stop all 20 minutes or something like that. reactivation would then be connected to a 3-6 minute delay. an art fatiguid system for cloaks.i can not understanding this ******* up trip .... ccp would have to know that through such actions as the \"afk cloaki hotdroping\" players in eve are expelled, the then rather play something else than penetration online 24/7if i'm thinking about it, i could spin.that was one of the reasons why i stopped playing with eve for a long time.more new things in eve came about and less were the old problems have been fixed.better make new skins for stupid 800mio isk or better stupit new player mechanics ..... like this .... \"sakasm\"whats about walking on station ... thats it all?i cant understand this madhads in ccp .....they make what the big ones in eve hold to not leave the game ... so it is only in interessting of one or two big parts in eve. \"none balance\"if the big ones crying about a new system implemented in eve which is good for new players and much saver for all the rest ... they would cry like kids about \"getting anymore good and easy kills\" or \"why we can anymore cloaki hotdrop anybody\" and why why why bla bli blu....i know i'm a little digressed but with the cloakies is really frustrating. one should note that in this case with it is eve is a game and a game should make possible unceremoniously fun.this one is permanently penetrated by afk cloakis can not be fun.i've been playing the game since 2004 and has to be seen, the game is always more and more crappy.i hope ccp and co wakeup before they lost the rest of eve players.where i start playing eve it was daily more then 60.000k ppl in this gamenow we are reduced to lesser than 27.000k ....... speak for themselves.15,000 k alliance big one10,000 k alliance5000 k alliancethats mad and i have something to laugh about.so everyone can see 20k of unprooved measure can controll everything.its like wather in the ocean ... one wave and all comes with it.thank you for reading this.and sorry for the one or two bad words:d"

"i think"
"right, because logistics and war have nothing to do with each other. so you imply that only holders of significant amounts of sov can give anything other than \"opinions based on anecdotes\" and then you call malcanis passive-aggressive? wow.from my point of view as a gate-and-wormhole-taking scrub, i'm sure it was nice to be able to teleport hither and yon, your \"taxi carrier\" protected by the threat of a giant hotdrop if anyone looked at it sidelong. i'm sure it felt really good to stride across entire regions uncontested. ah, the glory of empire! the problem is that it sucked for everyone else.for every cap that's been retired because new eden is no longer a pleasant sunday drive, how many have been fielded because they no longer have to worry about sunday drivers from the other side of the cluster? for everyone who sold their cap alt, there's a buyer who wanted it."
"and your evidence that jump fatigue is the major cause is....?"
"fair question. yup, used jump bridges when with tole under engarde and then scdot. not recently, late 2012. not since because i have not been part of a null alliance since then. so except for some blops work i have accumulated very litte fatigue since the effect came into being and oddly it did not seem to slow us down very much.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

"would you go to a plumber for informed and educated advice on how to rebuild a car engine? would you go to a mechanic to seek advice on your latest physical ailment? if you drive a ford should i come to you for advice on buying an audi? i've stated several times that the idea of restrictions on capitals and movement by way of fatigue is quite valid, however the blanket use of the mechanic without much thought given to some areas was poorly thought out and in several ways too harsh. never at any point in this thread did i take on the black or white view point so many others have that it's all or nothing."
"i just want to report that the bumping mechanics are broke big time. i just lost a busterd because a little ship kept bumping me so i could not go into warp. if a ship bumps a ship he should take damage. at this time he takes no damage. this condition has led to a tatic that is both unfair and unreasonable. anytime someone iniates a bump tactic there should be damage given to the ship that does the bumping."
"0/10"
"#ERROR!"
"there should also be damage given to the ship being bumped, right? based on the speeds and masses of everythign involved?so that a 100mn mwd stabber can crash into a freighter and kill the thing in a single hit?"
"how can the computer tell which ship is bumping which? both ships are moving. so you bumped that little ship, so you should take damage as well."
"op, let's put this simply.i have skinned my dread and my carrier. they are good ships, between them they've survived almost every major battle the cfc has been involved in in the past three years or more. 6vdt, hed, br-5, pretty much everythign except asakai.why, exactly, should my carrier skin cost me <U+FFFD>13.70, but the exact same skin, bought from the exact same store, not cost a highsec carebear a single penny?what do you think would happen to the market if it were possible for anyone, at all, to get hold of skins for free by grinding enough missions? (i'll give you a hint: look at the price of a reaper in jita, that's about where the skins would be.)"
"time and effort investment"
"perhaps you missed the part where i have invested my time and effort in actually using said ships, frequently, and in a manner that actually allows for player interaction?why do you feel that grinding missions is more important than this, especially given that your idea would simply collapse the skin market entirely (thus losing ccp whatever revenue it brings in)?"
"i am not asserting importance, merely saying eve is about different paths to the same or similar goals. to limit the skins market as it is is counter-intuitive to the spirit of eve."
"and is it not counter productive to leave the skin market in tatters? if anyone can obtain an infinate number of them for free, they will do. the things will end up at reaper prices with ease. (for reference: a reaper in jita is under 78k isk).why is that good for the game?and does the very fact that you can sell the things for isk not open up enough different paths to obtaining them?"
"i think you misunderstood me or don't understand how skins work.once you activate a permanent license its no longer transferable and you can't just turn around and sell it. so the proposed changes i mention mean that a player could not just make isk off of their standing. they would only be able to use it on themselves."
"so you sell them before you activate them.i have a couple of dozen of the things sitting in jita, i know how a skin works. under your system, you'd simply redeem thousands of them, for free, and dump them onto the market rather than activating them."
"i think i see what your saying. i didn't mean like that. i mean to say that redemption through standings would not be the same as buying with isk. it would be automatically made permanent and activated to the player. i agree that an untethered standings based skin system is dumb."
"unfortunately... the mechanics of the game are very \"black and white\" when it comes to this.the ability to rapidly move from the far side of null-sec to pick up skillbooks in low-sec is mechanically no different than moving from the far side of null-sec to gank some poor sob in low-sec.the only differences between the two scenarios are the intent and end result... and a computer cannot discern your intent until it sees an end result... at which point the damage is done.tldr; traveling quickly is projecting power. and jump bridges are no different from capital jump drives in this regard. they are merely stationary."
"this is just more obscurantism. a jump bridge isn't an internal combustion engine. a carrier isn't a human body. the ability to cross the entire cluster easily in one of the most (technically) dangerous parts of a gigantic pvp game (and call it a \"taxi,\" as if you were just getting around midtown) is so obviously a projection of power that there's no arguing it. you know that, which is why you're trying to fluff this into some arcane issue that only the illuminati know enough to ponder.get real. it takes about 10 minutes to get up to speed on this issue. even blizzard eventually figured out that hey, maybe letting players fly willy-nilly over all of their content is dumb. it feels great, and players get hooked on the experience, but it's killing the game.but you also dodge any attempt to get a specific example that passes the laugh test. whether you ever used it or not, your taxi enjoyed the implicit protection of a hot drop by the biggest power in the game--better protection than yellow cab gets from nypd. your logistics runs and your repositioning are intrinsically military. i really shouldn't have to explain to a goon that logistics are strategically and tactically vital: you guys have the best logistics in the game. there's no separating these roles because there's no separation to be found."

"a method to log in would be even better. :)"
"i deeply support wis, because it would give eve that extra something.that argument this game has only to be about spaceships i can't agree with. if it's so then we also don't need skins, high resolution textures, new spaceship models etc. in most cases the ships are only icons and symbols on our screens, or we soon get used to the sight and don't even look anymore.so why we don't just play with gray cubes as ships? because just a chicken und hot water alone doesn't make a tasty soup.it's about the environment in which all this comes together. the variety in which the core of the game is embedded. the mortar that makes a house out of simple bricks.ccp advertises this game with the richness and its history.having eve source and eve universe lying beside me, where is that propagated world from those books? where can i find it, or where should i find it if not in the game itself.eve has this unique world and ccp shouldn't hide it. instead they should be more proud of it and let us dive into it and not only on some pictures in a book. the technology is there, it just need to be used and carried out.wis alone surely isn't that panacea, but it's one part of it like skins, textures, lighting etc. if eve would only be about battling spaceships, then eve wouldn't be that what it is.maybe i can suggest something like \"plex for wis\" or other crowdfunding methods to get the required resources without removing these from other projects. maybe a license system for the finished product?or perhaps a more democratic payment system, where you can choose for what, as example one third, of your fees should be spend for? improving null sec, more ships, more skins, wis etc.?i can even think about a premium membership where you pay some extra money to fund and increase the development of your desired interest. as long as no single fraction is favoured by those developments.at the release day you will get the stuff as supporter for free while all others have to buy it at the new eden store or on the market.with that everybody would get what he wants. wis supporter can discover the full diversity of new eden, exploring the different stations, can meet with other avatars. perhaps one day even explore the homeworlds of the factions.people who don't like that and didn't supported can still play just the game they like. without the impression that their resources are wasted for other players fun, or enriching the product as whole.so you see, walking in stations is fundable even without downscaling the development speed of other parts of the game.i'm also sceptical that the concept of spaceships alone, as propagated by some bittervets, will help eve survive against other current and future spaceship games.eve isn't minecraft or angry birds and will it never be, where such a simple concept alone works."
"i would just like to add i took a 18 month break from eve to return from what used to be a 120+k playerbase at the times i play to now a 20+k playerbase. sure, they got rid of a lot of bots, so they say, but the game has gotten way too easy and i can only imagine how much players gave up because of that fact. instead of making it simple for the new players and taking away the struggle to get to the point you have a solid income system, be it with missions, industry or pvp, they now just hand you everything. simple mechnics like clones, why did they feel the need to mess with that? because the stupid and the dumb forgot to update them, died and came here to cry. why is an ice belt in hi-sec an anomaly that doesn't need seeking? because the lazy came here to cry. people who like the way things are running never post it on forums for 2 reasons. 1. why would they? they're enjoying the game, they're having fun with it and like it the way it is. why should they start a topic saying: \"i really like this game\" which 9/10 turns into a flamethead by people who dislike it. 2. yes we might like the game but that doesn't mean we want it to stop growing an moving forwards. they already made it a lot too easy to start off in this game. just yesterday i was in the help chat trying to help someone figure out how to fit his catalyst. he played the game for 2 days and already trying to pvp. what monstrosity has this game become? i don't recognise it anymore."
"you're right. how dare a 2-day old player get down to playing the game? he should be forced to spent the first month or two training learning skills!"
"hmm, the last post is already so long nobody will read this. but nevertheless.for me wis isn't a waste of resources, it's a necessity to hold up pace with other developments like star citizen.new players don't have any clues about sov changes, entosis link modules, burner missions etc. which are certainly important things for the current players. but with that alone ccp can't motivate new players to give eve a try.they look and compare. do we have spaceship battles? yes good. does it look nice? hell yeah, i like that rust! what else do we have? nothing? i can't even walk in my ship or around it or on the station i docked? in star citizen i can even use the toilet on my ship! - and there we have a simple but effective argument to decide against eve. not because of the toilet but the functionality as whole.eve online isn't sims in space? yes i agree. the sims is about founding a family, get friends and a good paid job to buy nice things for you and for upgrading your house. upgrading your house? hey the sims isn't a construction simulator but still many people play and pay the game just for that.so the argument that implementing additional functionality in eve, that has no direct effect on the core game is a waste of resources, is an argument which can't be more wrong.we have so many useless fun items, give them a use in wis. something that has already been mentioned in this thread, like micro transactions. not everyone will use that but every paying customer is a good customer.when i look at the player statistics i see a shrinking number of players. and if wis can help attract new capsuleers, what i believe, and even if they only stick on their stations or don't use it at the end at all, it still helps to keep this game running and that's the important point.i also say that ccp has the resources to develop it. wikipedia says they have around 600 employees. if they would take 1% of them for wis, you wouldn't notice that on the other projects. but they can continue on wis development. slowly but steady.- the first thing could be adding more quartiers for every station type.- adding the functionality to place objects/items in your room. like placing the sisters of eve charity statue on the glass table in your quartier.- adding bigger quartiers, where the current one is only the hangar waiting area. here is a good opportunity that this has to be payed for in aurum.- open the station doors and let people meet.- give the players the ability to go down on planets. eventually meet dust players directly and give them a ride to the next planet.- at this point you can implement a whole new (sandbox) game inside the eve universe.walking in station is an important part of securing the future of eve online. the sooner ccp is rethinking their current strategy about wis the better for us all. giving up just because you failed once is the wrong answer.go csm, do something i voted for!"
"i am surely boring the bittervets to death but there is still more.with walking in stations i don't necessary support the original plan years ago. it's about the opportunities that comes with it. bonding with the game, the environment and the people in it.let's take an example, maybe the last of us.if the players who played it to the end were given the chance to immediately buy a second part and play it. most would have done it. why? emotions.naughty dog understood it perfectly to use something very human. our emotions. to create a bond between the player and the characters. something that was amazingly well done.would this have worked with a top down view and icons as zombies? it definitely could have made fun when it's made solid and good, but would it had the same success or even made the player cry and buy immediately a second part? i don't think so.so let's go back to the point eve doesn't need wis because it's about spaceships.if you are that guy who plays exactly the same thing for hours every day and year without getting bored as time is passing. and if you are happy to share that experience in future with only a small numbers of veteran capsuleers left, then yes wis isn't right for you.all others be reminded on that \"i was there\" trailer. for non-eve-players a little bit strange but for us who attended such fights not very far away from the truth. and here we have again this important element emotions.here are some examples what i have in mind by thinking about wis.1. be a new capsuleer and just started in the corporations headquarter on the station. making some tutorials when suddenly an alarm goes on, security gates get locked, the program on the tvs are changing to a live view from outside the station.you see two battleship in a fight. you hear rumbling noises when debris and shockwaves hit your station.then you think it's possibly part of a tutorial but the view on your chat says otherwise. then the station is shaking, you look at the screen and one of the ships is gone! silence.the view back to the chat tells you, you aren't the only one who just experienced this for the first time.the alarm goes off and you see someone entering the station. you see his grim face and the medals on his chest are telling you that's not a random dude. that's the one who just blow up that battleship.while thinking that he is passing you and heading right to the casino, to make more of the bounty he just got.2. getting an invitation to meet at the corp headquarter you trying to join since days. so you are following the orders, you dock and walk the way to the office. you are opening the door and there they are, lined up to welcome you, dressed in their own corp clothes. while you are walking down the line toward the ceo you are passing numerous awards. one says this corp was founded in 2003. you see medals and pokals of past tournaments and victories. there is even a bust of the ceos head! this place smells like victory and its long history.finally arrived at the ceo he is handing over your corp clothes \"wear it with pride and don't dishonor them!\" and give you a certificate with your name and corp entry date on it. a certificate which you place later in your own study room with pride in a frame on the wall behind your desk.3. you know it's lost. you spend years to build up your own empire but times are changing fast. you don't know how the enemy breached the defences but you know it's lost. they attacked your station with the moment of surprise on their side and your fleet is too many jumps away to get here in time.there are only minutes left until shields of your station are down and undocking is just suicide.for the last time you are strolling the hallways. with every hit the station is shaking and groaning and the lights flicker. at your quartier you decide to keep the lights off. instead you are pushing a button and the wall that was just your tv becomes translucent.you see the enemy fleet out there and with every hit of their weapons your room gets illuminated. you decide to turn on some music, pachelbel's canon in d maybe, and the noises of the impacts quieten down. you see that your fleet commander is trying to contact you, he got ambushed and must retreat.a last look on the wall let you see the founding document of this station. it was your second but lasted as longest. for years it was yours, your headquarter, the starting and now the ending point of an empire.you are walking to the translucent wall to take a last view of the stars, your sector.a bright white flash appears followed by darkness and silence.4. you played eve for more than a decade. it's already a few months ago when you decided to give this new eve content a try. fortunately you put once some isk beside, enough to buy some land on this new planet.while looking at your land in the evening sun you are noticing this new star above you in the sky. it flashes strangely. then a second one. four, ten... a fleet of spaceships illuminated by the sun. there, a brighter flash...and gone. never will you forget the pictures of an exploding ship. once they were afraid of you, while others watched up on you. you were once a part of them. but sooner or later everything is ending and here we have the start of something new. with a little bit effort you can turn this land into something great. something never seen before.with wis everyone has different pictures and thoughts in his mind. but for me the most important part of it is the ability to bond the player much stronger to the eve universe. due and with the help of emotions and by individualizing and personalizing of experiences.part 2 -->"
"<-- part 1sure a call over team speak that you can join the corp does its purpose, but much more memorable and bonding is what i described in 2. that sticks in your head.putting a newbie in a rookie ship out in space and tell him to fly to point a. does its purpose as tutorial but is it interesting, exciting or even bonding? no but 1 is. that gives you the feel to be there even if you don't play an active role in it.wis is more than staring at the boobs of other female characters. it's about experiencing and feeling that game way more intense than today. something that even the nicest looking spreadsheet space simulation alone never will achieve.emotions sell, therefore eve needs wis!(sometimes 6000 characters aren't enough, sorry for that)"
"nothing but it being messy. the system would have to be redone. they could build in special exceptions of course but thats extra time and labor for something that will be ripped back out. time and the value of time is always very important. idealy, we'd like to see changes released completed instead of having stop gap code shoved into place."
"the csm cannot step in and stop another corporation from declaring war on your corporation.you have been deced and the people have actually hunted your corporation down instead of just sitting in a trade hub. they want isk but paying them will probably cause more people to dec you and more isk to be demanded. you do not wish to learn to defend yourself or fight back against them because you are not aggressive.there are very aggressive people in this game. they will threaten your in game character and in game assets. that is the game play that they enjoy. knowing that the csm cannot stop the war decs and that ccp needs more than a discussion of distaste for a mechanic are their any other things that you think might help or have helped you to survive the declaration instead of dissolving your corporation?"
