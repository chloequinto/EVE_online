i do appreciate all of the support but you know malcanis is on to something someone with a better understanding of kickstarter than i have needs to get something set up so that we can finally have wis i mean if we can get pizzas for devs in iceland in a matter of a couple of hours someone with a very clear and defined skillset when it would come to development of wis type things station environments et cetera help do a writeup of things at any rate i think it would do better than the book that mittens tried to have written to fellate his own egoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
that magnificent outfit has left everyone speechless i wish you luck in pursuing all of those items to be available in the in game store so you can have the adornments your planetary representative is able to enjoy
i vote for you top of the ballots plse players with disabilities is huge my hands are forever sore using crutches so typing actually causes me pain development on the ingame voice stuff via micrrophone andor any other disability enhancements would be a dream come true good luck  thx loads in advance will have fingers tows arms everything crossed lol 
hah hahaha hahahahahahawho the hell even likes gayfl
i vaguely remember ccp seagul saying something along the lines that if it does happen it would be in a separate clientwould be a surprising twist if the successor to dust514 turned about to be exactly that
how about players being able to make the same name as another corporationalliancecharacter while keeping the old onesgive a delay of say 10 years or so before someone else can copy a name
i also dont see why people cant be more imaginative when making corporationsalliances
the reason people were angry was not just microtransactions and greed is good but the pittingly small amount of wis that was delivered 1 captains quarters and thats it on release aside from pirate ship rebalance and fancy new turret models how many months were they working on it id like wis but id also like something added to the game in a meaningful amount as well as to the spaceship part of the gameid rather have the game change positively instead of cascading because you only get a captains quarters or other drip fed content without being tied to gameplay that complements it look at the upcoming citadel expansion for what kind of content complementing other content should go into an expansion citadels and capitals go together very wella wis expansion should be structured like citadels with meat instead of potatoes though even potatoes would have been an improvement compared to incarna people will resub when they see content that they see improves the game captains quarters on its own could never deliver that
yeah i start to like him with kickstarter there are several problems how much attention and money people will pay for a campaign which never will be realized without ccps support there is no wis in eve what stands wis for and what makes it desirable here are many good rough ideas but when it comes to the details they differ a lot so what exactly will be advertised even mittani with his public reach couldnt get much attention for his book despite the aid of others like scott m how will wis kickstarter campaign reach its patronsdone good such a campaign can put a lot of pressure on ccp done bad its a nail more in the coffinanyhow im not sure what to think about the the scope news in the captains quartierts aint that something you can call a wis feature
so would expanded standings limits
i think an alternative would be that the entire belongings would be transferred to an npc station that has both research and production slots avaliable without actually changing ownership its just the location
no op just noim a miner myself and hulk has always been the king of yield and thats why it has so many disabilities compared to other exhumersbargesits fine the way it is hulk has always been the strip miner of choice where you want the biggest yield skiffprocurer mackinawretriever were more catered to solo mining
sooner or later eve will start catering to a slightly larger audience not by softening the game too much but rather by reducing the confusion of ones decisionswith that said i heard they are eventually going to be introducing more player friendly services like name changes with name logs of course if you dont believe me then why on earth are skill injectors a thing
honestly if they gave you the option to watch the actual news reports that would be kind of coolfurthermore why not take some of the work being done on the new fps and put it toward wis i mean you already have people working on people models so why not utilize it to their advantage i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
what would happen if sov was a numerical value solely based on the following 20d averages UFFFD owned structures in system UFFFD pilots active  docked  logged out in system UFFFD supers logged or active in system UFFFD jumpbridgecynojammer in systemUFFFD hostile assets destroyed in systemUFFFD total value of items being built in that systemalternatively titans and supers onlywhat would be so bad about untying jump bridge networks the construction of supers cyno jammers and other things from sovwhat would the flag that sov is mean if these changes were in the game and what does sov mean now except that a group won the sov laser game at some pointi am not an expert on null mechanics and the last meaningful war i participated was under dominion sov this is not a troll attempt but genuine questions that came to my mind while reading up on sov changes in preparation of wwb maybe some csm can explain why we still need this arbitrary layer of abstraction in a sandbox game like eve
unless the new fps turns out to be a league of legends clone
do not run we are your friends
then he has to think up a new name
you think po1ice is imaginative
to all who still think that wis will never come because ccp said sosource skill trading in new edensource daily opportunities coming soonthat shows how much a statement from ccp is worth
wis is dead as are the reasons that ccp had for pursuing it in the first placehave a little respect and allow the corpse to rest in peace
in its original form yes avatar gameplay as general concept not
i dunno about handing out sp in the daily opportunities but i think that ccp should hand out some limited edition tear collection vesselsbecause yours are as sweet as ambrosia
even tears lose their flavour if you have too many of them and mine are too rich for your peasant tastes
stock shares maybe we can utilize the unused stock option tool in corporation management if eve charged 1 million isk a year for a corporation charter license the fee can improve eve in the following way failure to pay the one million isk payment for the previous year mandates concord to issue shares on the corporation behalf to pay their bill note active corporations could be exempt from this fee or action but i just cannot see 1 million isk bill being a deal breaker for any corporation except for dead corporations suddenly the dead corps assets and name becomes a hot commodity every 30 days just like tax auctions in real life on properties on delinquent eve corporation accounts those dead corporations must pay their past due taxes to generate isk new shares issued would start at 1000 isk per share hence if a 1000 shares sold on the open market via concord at 1000 isk minimum each the million isk tax collection bill would satisfied the dead corporation tax bill for the last year the current ceo would be credited a minimum of 1000000 isk when or if heshe ever returned chicken feed isk to be honest now lets say the dead corporation has 3 dead sticks up and unknown ship hanger items ah now we will have interest in these dead corps dare i say a bidding war could happen frankly if and when the absentee ceo returns heshe will find their coffers stuffed with isk prospective bids for the new issued stocks bids would be sealed for each of the 1000 shares in question the seven day process would reveal the potential bidders only the amount of the bid for each share is a secret now certainly a conversation could happen between the contestants for the dead corporation in a good old fashion price fixingthreats fashion that eve commerce is legendary known for but remember this eve where someone is always greedy after the closed auction for dead corporation shares feelings are hurt but the cycle of death and rebirth continues maybe the corporation in question is a one man outfit why would anyone buy that well maybe the name is cool maybe he left an old cruise ships in an office somewhere maybe the corporate wallet is stuffed full of iskies anything is possible now i have read the statement that ccp wants to keep these corporations names intact just in case they want to return fair enough point however in eve it is perfectly legal to war dec a corporation into oblivion who has an active subscription pilots so why is the player who left eve online exempt from this harsh reality of eve if anything they are hurting active players with their bloat of gaming data and their space floating items a navigational hazard in space eve has done a great job lately in fixing problems in game playing recently it is very clear they are desperate to hold onto their subscription base this idea could potentially open an entire new type of warfare stock shares could actually for the first time mean something in this game suddenly the industrialist who is lousy at pvp has an option for warfare that is more familiar to him corprate pirate hostile take over arrrggg to spur on competition for corporation charter licenses maybe there should only be a fixed amount of corporations allowed in eve at one time if i cite history and i always do there are only so many star systems in eve thus creating conflict for them if can apply the same concepts to economic warfare the caldari is made of ruthless mega corporations blab la bla what would the benefit to eve online as a whole firstly it would delete a lot of bloat data in the game johns rookie ship that has been sitting in whatamatter u space station since 2006 can finally be deleted dead sticks can be taken down for a profit not costing someone 50000000 isk and a gaming day in mindless shooting 
the corporation im in has existed since 22nd of november 2008 and doesnt fall into the category of dead corporations so i dont see what this has to do with relevance to this topic whoever was making the corp probably had some reasons for naming it suchwhat the topic is about is probably someone wanted the name of magna charta or something cool but found out it was taken already
fafer has my vote
in december 2007 i clicked on an ad for this weird sounding game i read a bit about it and it sounded awfully much like the game which ate my youth UFFFD elite frontier sometimes i jolt over the fact that iUFFFDve played this game for nine years iUFFFDve never done that i lasted i think two in world of warcraft i lasted three months in swg yet here i am nine years laterwhy did i stay because eve isnUFFFDt like world of warcraft eve isnUFFFDt quite like anything else out there oh iUFFFDll complain and moan about stupid things in the game but itUFFFDs a complaint that comes from a love of the game a love of the atmosphere of the game a love ofUFFFDsometimes iUFFFDve tried to rationalise why i love this game and it always comes back to one thing unlike world of warcraft unlike star wars galaxies or elder scrolls playing eve is not playing against eve know what i mean eve is playing against other humans eve is not playing against the system or the mechanics or the environment playing eve is to play against the multitudes of humans that dwell inside the blocks of pixels on my screenwhy do some people not like eve i think they fail to grasp this they expect to play against an algorithm an ai an npc or an environment they come to the game expecting to play against the system but doing that is terrible the npcs and the pve is just a means to an end to get a fixed contact point with other humans either through ingame interpersonal alliances or enmities or through cooperative play if that doesnt happen then eve is dry and boring and pointlessso by all means leave if the essence of what iUFFFDve described in these paragraph changesUFFFD if eve becomes a game played against the system rather than the humans then iUFFFDm most likely out of here and through all the contacts friendships conflicts and drama iUFFFDve gone through during these last nine years i can say with relative certainty despite it being anecdotal that most players are like me theyUFFFDre not like yougood bye hope you find a game better suited for youccp foxfour  the what button oh god i didnt even know that existed brb
what is the design goal around the sp gain
honestly as useless as it sounds to most of us veterans new players love this kind of stuff i have a lot of friends who really like how eve looks and works but arent playing for the sole purpose that they cant leave their ship and interact with other players face to face as their character add a lobby in every station for capsuleers maybe have it restricted in mass populated stations like jita 44 to private quarters with limited capacity no one is going to quit eve if ccp expands on this the only result is more players
it is infinitely easier to not do something than it is to do it
still goin strong
first let me define my perspective so you understand why i am suggesting an alternative rather than pushing ccp to drop the idea i apologize that this will make the post longwinded but my suggestion sounds insanely stupid and impossible unless you look at it from a particular perspectivethe motive behind ccps proposal is entirely laudable even if it is at the behest of spreadsheet managers more people in the game does create more potential for fun stuff to happen i believe this means that dailies are an inevitable and implacable consequence for all mmos as soon as player retention becomes an issue that may also be why so many of us casually link dailies with mmos that are becoming less popular when in fact the cause and effect is not as straightforward as you might thinkso if it is inevitable then the only thing we as players can do is advise ccp on better ways to implement the conceptso first of all what are the negative aspects of the current proposal the rewards are sp which is considered by many to be overpowered ccp are telling people how to play not rewarding the metagamealternativerpetc players in eve and turning logging in into a chore theres more to it than that but i think thats a fair summary of the player response so fari would suggest that point 1 is putting the cart before the horse until you have valid requirements arguing over the incentive to complete those requirements doesnt make sense so im just going to call it the reward from here on in and put that issue asidewith point 2 i would actually say its the chain of reasoning where ccp have made their mistake rather than in their final decision to implement the kill a rat requirement if the motive is to get more people online the obvious conclusion is you need a mechanism that appeals to or is not objectionable to or is simple to do for the broadest number of players if you accept that conclusion then ccps choice makes perfect sense but i dont accept it and consider it to be flaweda lot of people have commented that kill a rat is going against the sandbox principle of the game i would say instead you need to review the conclusion about reaching the broadest player base in the light of the sandbox principle there is no broad appeal in a sandbox there is however diverse appeal leave the broad appealing to the themepark mmos who do it bestthe problem is ccp do not see a way of creating a diverse requirement for the daily lots of people have suggested alternative opportunities geared towards pvp sovnull etc but for ccp to implement an opportunity for all the suggestions out there it would become an immense unwieldy feature at huge cost to themso we come at last to the crux of my argument how do you create daily opportunities that can appeal to all the diverse players in the gamemy suggestion is at its heart to allow player corporations to determine what the daily opportunities should be day by day players will have a far better idea of what other players will be prepared to do for the daily reward than ccp ever will and im sure they would agree with this too as well as be able to change them according to fluctuations in the game without needing ccp involvementwhy would corporations agree to do thisi would suggest that being a dungeonmaster dm is just as much fun as playing a wizard warrior or thief maybe not to everyone but clearly we have dms in eve only we call them fcs officers and ceos so im fairly sure there would be enough people willing to to come up with diverse and imaginative opportunities if there was a means to do so they should even be motivated enough to police the system and keep everyone playing by the rules just as tabletop gaming dms do and corporations already have the ability to punish their members for breaking corp rules which can be used to backup their policing finally they can set the opportunity to be something which helps the entire corporation thereby making even the most trivial task meaningful to the player completing the opportunityhow could something so complex be implemented in eveso my quick and dirty solution is to give the daily reward for completing at least one corporation contract it is not the most ideal format for implementing this concept but it has the advantage that it should require no more effort on ccps part than they have already invested in kill a rat while at the same time having the potential to do almost everything ive described above at the very least if it was implemented it would give us some idea of whether this concept could be made to work in eve and if it really would be a better direction than ccp are choosing
more players  more targets  more peweveryone winsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
only if there was literally nothing better that ccp could spend the very considerable amount of money on that would work better given that real wis would mean restarting the project from scratch again youre basically asking ccp to create an entire game and then give it to the existing customers for freeid suggest reframing the proposal into something a little more attractive to a business with shareholders to account to
do you have any suggestionsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
true let players place their structures  including those that require sovereignity now everwhere they want the fact that the structures are there and not shot down  means they own sov or structures if the structures are shot down they dont own sov there because  we can see clearly they cant defend their structures anyway there is no sov there are only structures its not like installing an anomaly generating upgrade prevents the enemy to see and use the generated anomalies
im not sure well see sir thanks for stopping in
catering to the noobs perception that sp really matters too many people coming in thinking that sp equals xp of other games and simply having more makes you better
eyyyy
thanks to all that voted for me i will do my best to justify your trust
i would like to thank everyone again for their support and votes during the campaign while i have not managed to get on myself id it to think we are least helped jintaan secure his victory well done allthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
the latest csm election result is probably as meaningful as the results of the latest parliamentary election in syria the ruling party of the ploons have trusted 10 of the 14 seats co2 nc and provibloc each got their candidate in co2 possibly timed their defection to milk goons votes for their representative and the apithird party tools guru steve ronuken easily kept his seatonly one candidate i endorsed made it to the csm probably because of the support of the cohesive rp focused amarrian provi bloc 11 out of the 14 candidates that were in my novote list got elected the biggest surprise to me is that joffy did not get elected despite being supported by low sec pirates i am waiting to receive the detailed vote count from ccp to see how he fared exactly on my side i got 152 votes last year for my first campaign and i am curious to see how i did this year as well as the other candidates that did not make it i am sure this data will tell stories of its own once it is released by ccpthis csm xi ends up being the most null sec centric csm i have ever seen since i started paying attention but outside of the ploons the main success of this election can be attributed to those independent voices pushing for not voting for csm this election ended up with a very low turnout 22345 votes the only lowest turnout were for csm 2 and csm 4 way before my time in eve from last year this is a drop of 40 and 73 less than the highest turn out ever csm7so this is a success for those independent voices like gevlon goblin or luobote kong that openly campaigned for not voting too bad they both decided to abandon the game despite an influence wielding that has been proven this year the ploons will rule players feedback and null sec for this coming year and actively represent all playstyles to ccp is it already the effect of their influence at work when ccp announces today that jump fatigue could be moved to ships instead of pilots if this happens the richest will just need to multiply their expensive toys and store them across all regions and with the magic of uncatchable interceptors 1 second tick servers and jump cloning have pilots ready to go anywhere like good old time for themhaving not heard any significant announcement regarding citadels passive income making or any economically viable siphonlike feature to curve it we can also listen to gevlons warning about new jita once the current world war bee outcome decides who will be in the dominant position to create it my bet is on pl which is why i chose to write ploons the way i doit is hard to know what ccp really will get out of this csm i chose to believe they wanted as many different opinions from varied playstyles as possible but they obviously chose to not interfere with a process they knew was being gamed and end up with a skewed representation of play styles despite a candidate field that had a fairly broad range if ccp truly wants diversified view points on their game they could easily have half of the seats filled by elected candidates and then select the other half from the remaining candidates here it is with me wrapping my campaign this year on these notes thanks to everyone that voted for me  keep up the good fight and value your independance oh and btw if you are not plexing your accounts you are just being taken advantage of by the ploons so they can do it keep that in mindo7
already made it in this very thread
okay let me tryshareholders like increasing login numbers and f2p shooters i count the upcoming dailies dust514 project legion and project nova as validation for this pointthe solution is project wis  a f2p shooter within the eveclient current eveavatars can be used in project wis and vice versa soe combat suits can be used in project wis combat suits from project wis can be used in eve the project wis lobby is also accessible for eve avatars interaction between eve and project wis players in project wis or eve competitions between capsuleers and ex dusters for example since project wis is part of eve their login numbers add to the eve numbers undocking and diving in into the world of new eden is just one mouse click away getting more people to try eve with more time youll find more points but this should be enough to get the idea behind itthis simply is a variation of earlier suggestions of splitting and thus lower development costs between two games something that shareholders also should likei for myself dont really like project wis but if a pact with the devil shareholders is needed to get wis done then so shall it be
we did it team thanks you
now this is what i was going for not just a suggestion but a basic model of how to put it all together instead of racking my brain for a while i do like the touch of basically having the login to project wis being the point of entry into either eve or nova basically choose your door type of thing i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hi to all the citizens of new eden  avery film and sound studios are currently making a pilot film which is being shot in new eden which will be submitted to ccp so approvals for a feature film and miniseries can be obtained to take this movie and miniseries to the next level will have to obtain crowd funding even if the tv industry does not pick up on the miniseries it will still be posted on youtube for all new eden to watch please note it will not just be a game play video but actors real sets a real film so those of you that want to see this happen please lend your support by telling ccp in this forum as the miniseries and motion picture canUFFFDt happen without the approval of ccp we are also hoping that they will be one of the crowd funderUFFFDs iUFFFDm only a small company and will have to get crowd funding for the movie and miniseries to happen but i have over 30 years experience in the industry this is my second movie as the director and producer i have entered many comps and one called shootout here in my own town we had to make a film in just 24 hoursthe larger event scenes will be shot within the test servers so only the invited players can take part as well as making any chance of lag less possible also allowing for the shooting costs to be lowered as we all know 100 isk is the cost of everything in the test servers as well as the chance for players to fly ships they can afford to be destroyed and build sets that are far less cost to the purse this is a zero budget operation the only funds that i have been able to raise have had to be put into the purchase of a high quality 4k cinema camera to allow for better resolution for our scenes shot in life unfortunately due to the lack of funds i have had to build sets which had taken many years iUFFFDm currently building one of the cockpits in my own home as this is my own film and it would not be the first time that my own house has been turned in to a spaceship i have put a link to a video on youtube that was shot for a film competition where we had not only to erect the set but also to shoot the film and edit in a lineal fashion and only 24 hours to make your film but also to introduce certain scripting words certain actors and even certain scenes as well as other items that were totally foreign to whatever script that you had plannedluckily i had already prebuilt the fake walls within the set making us able to assemble the sets in a shorter period i even was able to use components from a previous film which made our set a little bit better but please note that this film was shot and edited in camera in a lineal fashion yet we did manage to shoot it even though it was not the best but it was an experience and i still listed it on youtube i have also made a feature film called final exit which is still currently being made ie after editing we realized that some extra shots were needed so it has not been released the following link is the youtube video i spoke of
players taking part will also have the choice of having their real name listed beside their player name if they so wish please note that if they wish their real name used it will be listed in the extras section of the credits only speaking roles will gain a actors credit and yes some speaking roles will be given to players players taking part will be requested to sign a legal document ie a release form as they will be no payment for this pilot film as i have stated this is the zero budget pilot film and will be used for a crowd funding video but they will get bragging rights for sure as all their names whether being a character name or real name or both they will have to have this document signed and returned to me prior to taking part all legal papers will be confidential please note you are advised to request a copy of the signed releaseplayers wishing just to be in the film but not be listed in the credits can still take part but must follow all instruction only your ships will be used as back fill and if you donUFFFDt want a credit you donUFFFDt have to sign a release as you are just backfill you must sign a release if you want the film credit and yes there will be a extras credit list it will be long and fastplease also note standard film etiquette will be adhered to during the filming and players trying to get a unauthorized voice over during film will cause a scene to be cut and reshot continued breaches will cause players to be blocked from voiceover channel as we may not be a rich film company but film etiquette must be adhered to as we are planning this to be an a grade miniseries and motion picture even though this is only a pilot all rules will still applywith thanks anthony averyavery film and sound studios
the film set i is currently being build in singularity thanks to all the testing it has saved me some time setting up citadels  so if you want to build a city set it up in singularity and let me know currently about 4 sets are underway by my crew and more planed as well as some other sets please note if you are planning huge battles in tranquillity let me know so i can film them in 4k and they may even make the pilot or movie and miniseries players wishing to take part in set design will also receive full credits in the project please noteUFFFD project new eden UFFFD is just the name of the of the pilot any player can be in set design but must follow instructions as how to place items but set designers are also wanted but must follow the overall design and can pitch out new ideas and as they are involve structure that if destroyed wonUFFFDt stay and they can be rebuilt but citadel sets are built for whole project till end on tv series if you want to please contact me via averyfilmsoutlookcomps any actor rich or poor that wants to is welcome please remember if you are an actor project new eden is a micro budget film and not even i get paid no one gets paid for the pilot as this could be the big break you have wanted all these years please note all auditions are at actor expense as will be in newcastle australia when announced all actors willing to audition for project new eden will be notified by this thread so keep your ears on and your eyes open we are very close to start with in the years end i hope those pilots wishing to fly ships as part of shots will just receive credit for which ever they doplease also note our credits list will be at the beginning of our films so people know who and how many people took part in our film and so they canUFFFDt walk out and miss it  project new eden will become the next star wars remember before all the big names started they were nobody b grade film makers like myself with a dream well man do i have a dreambreak a leg
good idea butmakes me think that we dont play the same game
seriously your proposing a fps within the eve client may as well abandon any other feature in eve for next 34 years if you want something like that cause it will take all the dev time stop thinking eve is using the unreal engineother fps engine its noti want walking in stations as much as you guys do but you have to keep it simple and acheivable not some grand plan for another game within evei posted this a few pages back fairly basic and compliments the existing game would still take investment and resources by ccp but alot less than developing a compelte avatar experience within the game clientideas that could be implemented with a moderate amount of work add scope videos to captains quarters already done thanks ccp  use the resources of the eve 007 show and eve trailer production to put together a weekly summery on eve make it voiced and animated by a npc newsreader show it on cq screens would help new and old players get interested in parts of the game they have not tried eg could feature  sov news low sec piracy stories how to join a player corp segment economic news and industry stats new ship designs ads for player corps news on titanxl citadel kills large player battles etc etc add a room or wall for display of player trophys  achievementscould be 1000 pvp kills get you a trophy or completing 1000 level 4 missions etc etcallow miniature corpse heads or destroyed ship models with inscriptions your best ever kill or most against all the odds victory allow players to memorialize their player experience add cq to citadelsppl need to get out of caves and they will see something new thats where eve is placed not in cave  zoonrkorsairs 
no you got it wrong malci wanted something shareholders would like based on the past and current developments around eve i described something that maybe fits more their needscontrary to your comment it wouldnt take all the dev time of eve for the next years it would take the dev time of those who worked already for project nova or dust or legion wis would be a kind of byproduct admittedly a larger one but still a byproduct depending of how much features it containsif in the end the shooter is part of the eve client or not i dont care nobody is forced to use it  and yes a full functional wis means to start from scratch again
dont want to get into a discussion about this cause its a side issue but the one key point is that building a fps or full avatar experience into the eve client is a much more difficult and time consuming endeavor than using a existing fps engine and starting a brand new game project nova uses unreal engine this engine is made for fps and content for fps style games can be created much quicker using its architecture and development kit you cant hope to create a project nova style game in the eve client with eves engine in a similar time frameppl need to get out of caves and they will see something new thats where eve is placed not in cave  zoonrkorsairs 
thats right we dont play the same game im not playing im making a movieb yes im same person as bluebeard
look upon my great works all ye mighty and despair
why is this a bad thing simply put this is a sandbox game and a player is rewarded for having their account sit afk doing nothing its a nice little way to pop more sp on for people actually playing the game and a way for noobs to get sp fast without needing to grind incursions to get injectors im 100 for it i dunno why someone would be against it
jb  designed for large groups to move around in their space putting that in ls makes it way to easy for people to avoid gate camps and would make it 10 times easier for freighters to move through in hs it makes freighting too easy supers  makes it way to easy for some alliances to field supercaps just buy them from a third party cyno jammers  not in ls or hs makes it too easy to disrupt freighters and caps to move imagine someone putting that up in jita or amarr in my opinion ls needs to be more fair than nullsov null the goal of ls in my opinion is to make an arena where people can fight without worrying about sovereignty and with weapon constrictions comparied to npc null essentially lowsec and sovnull are different playstyles and if you change stuff with sovnull youre going to change ls and npc null
joining the biggest organised voting bloc in the game and sucking enough up to the leaders of said bloc or being exploitable enough for their purposes to be put on the ballot isnt really your work though someone else did that work for you as you obviously are too deluded to realise messiahcomplex and all you didnt win because of your causes you dont have any you won because you can be a tool for the cfc leadership and if one should make a bet it would be that getting you on the csm will close that institution down either de facto or de jure since it has ceased to be a meaningful platform for the cfc despite your personality your lack of qualifications your insanity and your selfabsorption you got elected someone in the cfc hierarchy decided to remake you from a joke to a weapon what made you the joke candidate everyone enjoyed before has now become a joke on us the question is who will wield you and who will you be pointed at
all shall love me and despair this should be interesting
wonder if the new csm members will review threads in this subforum and more importantly show support for the proposal presented in this threadone can only hopedmc
a list1 this breaks the sandbox instead of setting your own goals this is about a time based ccp set goal it wowifies eve using ea level mechanics which have already been proved to be detrimental to other games2 it proves that ccp are dishonest when in the skill injector blog they say while we make sure there is one single mechanism that brings new skillpoints in to the system UFFFD training it proves that ccp are no longer the same developers that sang htfu3 eve is supposed to be hard the original idea of eve being hard is undercut when you add easy dailies4 driving new players into mindnumbing pve options in a pvp game will not convince them to stay5 sp are in my opinion supposed to be a unique commodity like gold you can make money but new gold is impossibleskill extractors take from an already existing pool they evaporate some sp and the rest is in the injector this is good the new way is sp faucets in the form of dailies yay6 it damages other peoples playstyles if they for example choose to be pacifist instead of playing their way they are being driven towards the rocky shore of daily tasks7 it actively discriminates against time limited players if you only have 2 hours a week people who have more can not only always have more sp than you but also a part of your precious 2 hours are spent doing something mind numbing instead of something exciting something you would like to do instead of playing catch up8 it hurts mission running in certain areas regarding standings if for example you are doing serpentis missions if you kill a serpentis npc to get your sp you lower your faction standing with serpentis which can hurt what missions you can do if you are stuck in a region with only serpentis npcs what can you do in order not to hurt your standings
i think you missed my point but whatever so this has nothing to do with eve at all then
specials and promotions are given out based on a unfair policy where some of your accounts get an offer and others do notthis can be vary frustrating and moves against multiple character synchronization of your accounts in eve i would like to see this policy revised and changed to account for persons with multiple accounts especially for persons that havepurchased accounts during the power of play promotion any help in bringing this matter to the persons that can change this policy or assist power of play subscribers would be appreciated
