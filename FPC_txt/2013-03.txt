forcing ships on grid  problem solved the grid fu concern is highly overrated and a last ditch attempt by some to justify this broken mechanic make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i have posted this same idea since 2006 but in another vein attempt ill do so again hoping someone  ccp reads it this time i have been posting the same fix to nullsec for years i cba to go dig up the post from the old forums but they are there so here is how you fix this game a sandbox mmo thrives off of interaction and interdependancy it is the cornerstone of making a sandbox work the basic premise of my idea is you make all zones dependent on eachother but without excluding any zone for clarification when i say zones i mean highsec lowsec nullsec and wormhole its my assertion that different zones should be bonused to different activities whereby all activities are possible in all zones with a few slight exceptions if you think about society in real life and how its laid out generally speaking rural areas are where you see farms logging mining and things of this nature i like to think of rural as nullsec also secondly you generally see production happening in industrial zones i equate this parallel to lowsec whereby most commerce science technology and business happens in urban centers i think of this as highsec so how can this translate into eve and how do you balance it  how do you make incentive for interaction the aim is to not alienate players from partaking in any endeavour anywherehigh secactivities with bonusresearchcopyinventionmarket orderscontractsunbonused activitiesexplorationmissionsproductionminingrefining lowsecactivities with bonusproductionrefiningunbonused activitiesexplorationminingmissionsresearchcopyinventionmarket orderscontractsnull secbonused activitiesminingcompressionexplorationunbonused activitiesproductionmissionsresearchcopyinventionmarket orderscontracts so as you can see different areas offer carrots to different activities if your a trader or researchinvention player high sec will offer you the greatest yield profit whereas if you are into production lowsec will suit your needs best lastly if you are a miner or want to get into non wormhole exploration nullsec is best suited for you this gives each area a unique purpose creating interaction between all areas all the while not limiting what you can do anywhere only providing you with a carrot to do it in x place i know i didnt really speak to wormholes but i think its quite clear that wormholes already have a unique purpose that all other zones depend on
it probably has been brought up but i would like to see get nerfed a bit i think that from downtime to downtime is over powering and really is displeasing to those of us who prefer not to be pvp oriented for example there is this player currently cloaky camping our system cause he bit off more then he can chew and he cloaks from downtime to downtime if the device either took a certain amount of capacitor or maybe even some form of cap charges this would help eliminate the over powerness of this device he has tried extorting isk from us to leave the system which is part of the game play but just sitting there nonstop without a break in his cloak from downtime to downtime is very over powering and a game deterent for most to wanna renew subscriptions or just not go out and do anything in a low or null sec systems is it possible to find a way to reduce this items superiority over everything in this game
1 if you look at the forums page on the top right next to the forums button there is a search tool i suggest you use it before reposting commonly posted ideas2 if you really are too inept to deal with a single cloaker camping a single system you should pay him to leave sure its extortion but there are many ways to alter your playstyle and cope with a cloaker adapt or pay up 3 if you cant cope with hostiles in your system go back to highsec part of living in nullsec is dealing with dangers and the only way to circumvent the safety provided by an omniscient local chat is to utilize cloaky camping as pathetic as the tactic is until local chat gets replaced by an imperfect intel tool cloaky camping should not be nerfed
obviously you didnt get the point i was making i dont care about the cloaky camper its a natural game mechanic the point i am making is that the device is honestly more powerful then a carrier in all reality since there is not a limiter on it and you honestly just harass a playercorpalliance from downtime to downtime i dont care that they are doing it but there needs to be a limit put into place on it
the device is very powerful but it already comes with serious drawbacks  you cant move much while cloaked unless you are in a ship specifically designed for it  it takes up a valuable highslot it sometimes nerfs your sensor strength and typically has a decloak delay  your actions are significantly inhibited while cloaked like you cant target activate any modules etc most covertcloak ships also have their combat capability hindered the primary complaint you brought up was the psychological impact a cloaky camper has on you which is what my rebuttal addressed somehow you missed my point nullsec is supposed to be inherently dangerous think about that for a momentnow what makes nullsec dangerous it is not the npcs in belts anomalies or plexes it is other players when are you safe in your system when there are no hostiles in the systemwhat do you do when there is a hostile in your system option 1 you get safe until they leave because you dont want to deal with hostiles in system  option 2 you modify your play style to operate in a dangerous environment this might include basic safety practices you should already use aligned out so you can get away quicker dont warp to zero etc it might include ratting in subotpimal ships use a pvpfit drake instead of a chimera it might include making yourself a hard target rat in a group thats capable of destroying the threat rather than using any of the options in option 2 your whining its unfair a person stays online and represents a continual danger within your system but the truth is all nullseclowsec systems are supposed to be dangerous there are two reasons most nullseclowsec systems are not in fact dangerous a local chat lets you perfectly identify if there are hostiles in system or not as such you know at a glance how safe your system is b local chat instantly identifies a change in the system population the speed at which it updates and informs you is so fast that most ratting capitals dont bother to get safe until after a local enters system it is impossilbe to catch a ratter paying attention to local unless they get scrammed by a rat at just the rightwrong time you probably dont see a problem with the above but together the result in nullsec being obnoxiously safe cloaky camping a system as pathetic and loathesome as i personally find the tactic is the only tool available to put danger back into a nullsec system until ccp nerfs the intel system removing afk is very bad for the game
i live in wormholes we have cloakers in system all the time and you know what else we cant even tell they are there because we lack the omnipotent intel tool known as localhere are a few strategies you should be using whether theres hostiles in system or not1 dont afk unless docked or inside a pos2 dont pve alone in system3 dont use a pve fit unless you have a pvp fit you are ready and willing to reship to insystem4 again dont hang ouut alone even 2 or 3 pve ships are a serious deterrent to even the most combatready cloak pilot5 if hes afk qit whining and ignore himand if your scared of cynos then this isnt an afk issue this is a power projection issuebut seriously as an experience cloakser have a friend or 2 hanging with you you wont get attacked a cloaked ship is gimped by default due to devoting fitting space to a cloak which could instead be used for offense most pvepvp ships can easily kill a cloakshipand as more or less stated above me if you cant be arsed to get some players together to defend your space then maybe youd be better off moving back to lowhighsec
i tell you what i would support is an offline version of eve i cant tell you how many times i have had my computer but not been able to play with my pixel spaceships due to lack of interwebs to be hadeve has a huge active duty roster of paying clients i am sure all of us would appreciate being able to do a few missions every now and then or some anomalies when we are in the suck and have no connectivity my two isk added

1 bring the jukebox back ive logged back in and the jukebox music still plays but no way to control what actually plays silly idea to remove it
supported but only on the condition that my semirelated proposal is also reviewed the lack of availability for some mindlinks has made some them very very expensive especially the mining one this is caused by an utter lack of availability making some of them as uncommon as an officer module there needs to be more ways ie more missions where they are given as rewards or to have them drop from deadspace sites to get these links if those who use them are going to be exposed as this new proposal suggestsif this were approved and mindlink availability isnt revised i fear that mindlinks could become effectively worthless due to excessive cost used only by the very richest of players
i agree with the general principle that all securities of space should interact with each otherim also not even going against the general idea youre throwing out which looks as though its wishing to create a stream of production that goes from the outsidein and then back insideout againthe only thing that irks me a little is that the low and high secs dont seem to have any bonused actions that involve ships in space while much of the logic that would enable a system like this interactively as you said from 2006 have disappeared from the game making it feel a tad outdatedi mean i loved the notion back in the day of lowsec being a production area that saw alot of material shipped around that paved the way for piracy escorted bob and protonc hauling ops of freigthers filled with goodies for tech ii production and the like it definately makes sense but alot has also changed in that regard with the profileration of carriers introduction of jf and so forthso while i agree that highlownull should be interactive and interdependent im not sure if the production flow of old eve is the way forward even though i remember it and remember it quite fondly as a budding pirate roaming for freightrunsthe name of the game these days seem to be making each region more selfsustained and not as codependent so the challenge would be to make the securities interdependent on that backdrop if that makes any sense im trying to draw a distinction between codependent and interdependent here which i am uncertain if its literally sound what i am after is that i would like to see each area of space interactive with the other and inviting players to transgress the borders  but i am not so certain that the different securities need to be so wildly different and unique thats not sandbox to mesome flavour would be nice of course but i rather belive in having them reminisce of each other than offering completely different resources and gameplay that is mostly in fear of a dependent system not making them very interactive though since interactivity is key for me if you manage to do both all the more power to you  but priority should be interactionsome exhaustion induced raving here does it make sensewe already have a system where each area more or less have some unique productiontraits nullsec with its capital assemblies wh with its tech iii components lowsec with its stream of navyfaction commodities through l5 and fw npcnull with its stream of piratefaction bpc or implants and empire with its bottomline mining invention and subcap production it could definately be tightened up a bit but there is already a cornerstone there for some flavour while allowing the general economy to seep through all securities better ie bottomline mining isnt and doesnt have to be exclusive for empire  so it isnt necessarily so that nullsec require unique mining opportunities as much as it requires mining opportunities that meet the riskreward balance
1 in principlei think the bonus section of what you propose for highsec is too much i would move researchcopy to lowsec so that theres a real incentive to go there this would also make sense from a rp point of view as lowsec wouldnt have the same bu
that is probably the worst comparison ive seen in regards to afk whinethreads in the 8 years ive been reading themps no cloaked ship has ever killed another ship
obviously you didnt get the point he was making this topic is brought up all the time by forum trolls almost on a daily basis the argument against it has always been and still is flimsy and self servingif you could provide a rational and legitimate reason for changing mechanics youd be the first in the history of eve onlinesummary of eves last four expansions

i really like the idea of the black market it would make low sec more interestingorgan harvestingselling harvest organs required for medical technologycorpse selling self explanatorycounterfeit high sec charters allowing you to jump a stargate without a concord scan it would consume one for every jump or bribe concordfactions on other mattersviralradiotactivebacterial materials required for manufacture on certain types of modulesbacterial warfare modules that allow you to affect the pod of a capsuleer while still inside the ship decreasing his effectivenessdangerous pi command centers better yield and faster extraction but disallowed in high sec because of environmental destructionplanetary bombardment modulesnow these materials cannot be manufacteredsold in high sec but they are required for manufacturing they could also be used in black market missions that can be given by any normal agent making back room smuggling into a more viable career also bring back smuggler starlanes these are hidden one way long distance starlanesmost of it has probably been suggested before but i really like the smuggler career
been reading make lowsec matter havent yousuggestions are solid but for those of us well me at least  in the ls lobby it reads like a cherry picking has taken place and you didnt even include that most excellent idea from dammit forgot his name to move all sec gain to lowsecbut good starting point let the discussions begin again
hi hellothere have been a number of trollish replies in this thread  however i will endeavor to give a serious response so that ccp see the excellence and quality of this idea and implement it by summerrefuel in space like american fighter jets they could call this feature space docking where deep sapce transports refuel hungry hungry freightersi realise that wh residents are mostly carebears hauling t3 loot out to sell in highsec but those same supply chains could be used to bring oxygen into your wormholei commend you wanting to role play a german uboat perhaps this should be a new class of ship designed for long term undercover missions
i like but not this way oxygen would drive up the price of actual oxygen and give market exploiters something to funnel to themselves and their corps noobs would never be able to undock anarchy would insue
just wanna clarify its the third most dangerous what with local as a defense intel channels and the several hundred man alliance they should be using for defenselowsec is slightly more dangerous with its multiple smallgang noblues killeverything warfareand wormholes are more dangerous than any cause we dont have local consistently have stealth bombers logged off fleets and roaming pirates entering space we have to defend againstjust figured id clarify
how does someone afk and cloaked harass peoplei honestly dont see it and your claim regarding a carrierdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
so here is an idea i have been thinking of how about making every pos a claim unit i hate grinds and having something to actually shoot at would make the game more interesting step 1 delete and remove every sov unit in game and put the points into pos towers which wold be distributed somewhat like thisfaction tower 5 points of sovlarge tower  3 points medium tower  2 pointssmall tower  1 pointso if i wanted to rent a system i could set up a pos there with approval of course letting the owner that had 6 posses set up for moon mining know who also had a claim on that system it would also let potential attackers know who owned the system and who it was rented tostations would default to the alliance with the most sov pointsthis works two folda lof of alliances set up posses to have more then one role thus making attacking a pos a double whammy because now it causes the alliance to lose pointsan alliance could effectively ninja a system by putting up a bunch of posses even small pos could work in systems with a lot of moons and lock the opposite alliance out of their station until they undocked and foughtblew up the pos
wow youre really new to eve arent yaalready been done severely broken changed to the current mechanic we have nowsummary of eves last four expansions
it has everything to do with local for without local afking is pointless in regards to psychological warfarewhilst they are cloaked and afk the only reason you know they are there is because of local you want to nerf the only tool available as a counter to local afkingyou mention wormhole space but then fail to see that they dont ever complain about afking there is a specific reason for this can you guess what it isthe funny thing is the balance is still in your favour because locals intel is guaranteed 2357 whereas the psychological effects from afking are notthis is not a chicken and egg situation local came first followed later by cloaks and then the idea that people could attempt to subvert the intel it gives do you honestly think that because local helps you that others wouldnt try to use it against youno pilot cloaked ever killed a pilot stopped them using gates docking undocking activating modules mining ratting etc the only stopping you is youit boils down to this cloaks already have counters but not counters that would render the cloak pointless to fit so no cloaks should not be nerfed until locals all seeing eye gets changed also this would mean a package of changes so you have to work for your intel then at the same time changes to enable the finding of cloaked vessels could be includeduntil then you shouldnt gain even more intel on top of what is already a very powerful intel tooldestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
here are some ideas to how i think would fixing null 1 lowering the jump portal for titans bridgethis will make it harder for alliance to keep a lot of system and more moving of fleet black ops ships should be the only one to get a large focus fleet to go from one side to the other it should be hard to get a battalion moved out to the field a small special force group can be moved from one side of the earth to half way to the other2 take away passive income for null sec allainceand yes that need to be in caps there needs to be more people in null sec there needs to be industry toonin there that can work in null all major power in the world need a good industry to be its back bone money shouldnt be the only thing to keep you in power so industry should be there back bone doing thing l like moon mining and production for the alliance coequals should be at the lead of the null sec industry with module that can give the ventures lasers enough power to reach the moon surface this will make it hard for large alliance to make billions and and only use up 110 of there space we want all of null sec to be use not just part of it but still with in reach for big alliance to keep there space and small alliance the chance to get spacei donUFFFDt want it to look like i am picking the large alliance but we want sovereignty to be some thing everyone can get there hand on not just mega super alliance you know who you are3 destructible stationsstations should be destroyed a lot go into making a station if you blow one up it should be destroyed and deteriorate the longer it goes with out being repaired the more materials will be needing to repair it i not talking about time i like to see repair bots that we can put in a station and minerals that are need to repair and fix what we have destroyed it will take time for it to get it back to its old useable state but we are in eve and i want repair drone or something to fix it i donUFFFDt want to space my 15 dollar repairing something i just want to put in the materials and repair drone and leave let them do the hard work 4 sovereignty grindingkinda the same thing as the stations mechanicsfirst attack give you 24 hours warning a you win and put your repair drones to get the shield up byou lose the fight and it goes into armorsecond attack armora you win and you put your repair drones in and fix the armor and shield ones its in shield it can be targeted again b you lose and it go into structure thirdattack structurea you win you put in materials and repair drone and the structure is getting fix can be targeted at armor b you lose and new owner put in there drone and materials can they have there sovereignty something like this would be nice you fight win or lose go back to doing what you need to be let the drone do all the grinding but you have to be there when its out of reinforcement 5 titan back to there old glorydo something with titans make them use full again no just hot dropping alt ship bring them back to there old glory let them dd cap ships let them have a bigger buffer but take there ewar immunity way they donUFFFDt have a siege module they should have immunity to any ewar dread and carrier do because of the siege module this way titan are not the i win button if you bring a dread fleet and your enemyUFFFDs bring titans usually you will die but say you have a back up fleet of covert ops with a lot of ewar the bring them in to ewar those titan those titans will do nothing if they are jam dampen and tracking disrupted to hell your enemy will need to bring a support fleet to take out your ewar then it will start big fight everyone in null will have to help bring this kinda of fighting will bring in new players in ewar ship and old player in super together and everything in between to fight as one 6 afk cloakyshay i donUFFFDt mine people camping null sec system if they are active but it gets really bad when they close down a system this needs to be changed there need to be something a module on a tower that can work like a em blast that is system wide to decloak some one with a recharge that take 1 hour or something this way if they are active they can cloak back up you and everyone can kill him or be killed but the ship if they hot drop you if your afk you shouldnt be able to just stay there forever you need to be active or do somethingthese are some ideas that i would like to see
so before you see the name and think oh not this again i think i have a good proposal heremass restrictions inside npcnullsec stationsthis will effectively jita proof the game thus allowing the server to focus more on places where stuff is actually happening lets be real 50000 jump freighters would not fit in any station so this is essentially a proposal for more realism the secondary option is having outer docking points at stations and making players orbit the station until one is open the end game goal is to even out the market taking from jita where nobody can ever seem to jump in and allow the server to shift for battles more swiftly im sure someone with programming skills could make a system shifter so that if a spike happened the server would support it and prevent tidi form happening when an alliance is not trusting ccp to tell them when their attacks will happenthis would also apply to nullsec stations but members with access could ping the station before cynoing or docking to make sure there is space lets be real if this was a real space that would be the way it happened you could send the tower a mail saying youll be there in x time and they would say either there is a bay or not and the pilot would either wait or find somewhere else to sell their waresdock upthere are scams hacks bots and whatever the new craze going on in jita and team security just cant keep track of them and stop them all this proposal would not only help aid that but make the market more stable less like the nyse and more like the worldwide market it would also force players to go to different markets to sell their loot more balance also helping to bring up emerging markets another offshoot or secondary effect would be missioners would be able to go to any system or region not just one close to jita to do their business haulers would be more in business hauling goods from a low sell to a high buy system also allowing scammers to have more systems to play their games in
poorly thought out and non functional new players should not be posting major game changing features until they know how the game worksto everyone whos considering replying to this thread i implore you not to just let this thread diesummary of eves last four expansions
i have made lots of ideas to features and ideas forum area and there are two ideas above all others i want to bring to attention of csm i wish there could be more discussion of these ideas im not sure if any csm members have spotted my ideas in other forum and thats why i offer them here toofirst idea is roleplaying structures that could offer people chance to tell a story of a place in eve cosmos this would allow to add sketches through internet links in description part you could create your own evil fantasy place that would be visible to others
theres third idea i want to bring to attention of csm this idea would limit use of laboratory slots in high sec and increase laboratory slots in low sec this way everyone can have free laboratory slots pos mobile laboratories research time bonus could be increased so they would remain efficient alternative for station research this idea would bring traffic from high sec to low sec and from null sec to low sec
i like most of those ideas it definitely adds flavour to low but as veshta yoshida said you missed out a very good idea regarding sec status gaindestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
1 stupid idea to remove it
the hilarious part about this idea is that it wont impact the actual whbears at all as they can simply make an excess of oxygen in their home system via pi itll make burying scan alts deep solo roaming hunting pi haulers miners gassers and such a chore at best though never mind people who roam hostile 00 space where they cant exactly dock up for resupplyhave you ever stopped to ask yourself why wh people dont complain about afk cloakers in their systems

im playing the sto now and there is an achievent for many different things so me and many other players are trying the content that normally wouldnt got our attention im aware of those things and logically i dont need that but its still sucks me inor they just stick to the endgame content and dont give a damn when theyll be tired of it theyll quit the gamefor now in evei didnt tried incursions  why i have pulsar6 my money content and anyway i prefer to just buy and sell some plexes bhahaha to do nothinghave been in fw for 2 days  there was a more proffitable things to doi dont like pvp  why would iive planned to do industry and mining this char is a perfected toon for any of such activity but never had enough motivation to actually use itfor all of those things there can be an achievement which can be seen in a profile with overall achievement pointsthis will make players do different things instead of sticking to the one or two which is boring and make them quit more oftenjust in case that youre mor alive than dead yet eve developers
we dont need achievements but there are some people like you who would benefit from having them as long as you dont get any ingame advantages from getting them i certainly dont have any objections to including them
in comparison lets look at how well sto did as subscriptionbased singleshard mmo with a fairly stable player bawait
theyre called certificates you get them for achieving certain levels in certain skills or combinations of skills andor other certificatesyou can even display them on your character sheet for everyone to see no one else will care because no one in the game bothers to look at your character sheet before they gank your ass but hey if it works for you
so in short you want to fix nullsec by heavily nerfing it againno
how is that nerfing it
its not nerfing it making you work for your space null sec needs to change in a big way
or i could shove my entire battalion onto an aircraft carrier and fly them in on chinooks thats a terrible analogy besides that it does nothing to solve the titan bridge problem it just means i need to move my titan a little bit closer and set up chains which is easy enough to do in itselfokay and explain how youd set up nullsec infrastructure to balance individual income with the necessities of running a full administration srp industrial program fuel program etc etc within the current system or suggest an alternative systemand just how is this going to work how are people that may be unsubscribed and by circumstance lose all their stuff effected by this whats to stop me from dropping 50 triage carriers onto a destroyed station and have it back up and working before my cuppa is readyhave you actually been involved in a recent sov war or a sov war postdominion youre basically describing the dominion systemdo you even understand what the points of a titan are you can dd cap ships with them they have insane buffers still no you will not outright lose against a titan group if you bring dreadscarriers and are smart about it no you should always have some sort of support fleet now when deploying titans enmasse simply because they cant easily track or dd subcaps bringing titans back to their subcap ddtracking titan days will only hurt subcap warfare not make it more interesting just look at every recent cap fight for why titans are passably fine right nowand for the comments on cloakingno just no
watch certain groups effectively blockade every single trade hub simply dock up a whole bunch of freightersorcasbattleships and never undockand you cant force them to undock without creating more rules on who can dock and for how long because the games code wont be able to discern intent
its hard to talk about roleplaying in the game where you are a starship not a captain of it
what if directional scanner was able to pick up cloaked ships on the scanner it would simply say something like faint signature or something and the range wouldnt be givento further limit it you would only pick up this faint signature if you had the range at about 515 degree and if the ship is on the same grid as youthis would allow you with some time and skillful play to track down cloaked ships that are keeping an eye on you that you might have spotted cloaking near by or it could make you aware that you are aboutt to get bombed by 10 bombers if you do a lucky scan in the direction they are about to decloak fromwith the limited angle of scan it wouldnt be a total nerf to cloaking and you would still be able to hide in safespots with cloaksif you are in a covert ops cloaking ship you can warp out any time when you notice someone is trying to decloak you same goes for if you warp in 100200km off a camped gate and cloak with a normal cloak you would simply have to get away when you notice they are heading towards youyou could compare it to looking for a submarinesupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
and then wormhole space is utterly destroyedi have a better idea we implement a tearbucket for nullbears who want 100 safety and 100 perfect intel in 00
i want it for pvp reasons not for safty but for catching cloakies and creating tears and how would it destroy wormhole space would you think people would spin around rapidly constantly doing 5 or 15 degree scans just to look if there is already a cloaked ship in their anomaly thats the idea behind the limitations its not 100 free intel as it requires much more effort you can only see that they are there if you scan in their direction with a limited anglenow about the 100 perfect intel that is exactly what a cloaky on grid ship is sitting on a gate and keeping eyes on hostiles who have no chance of knowing its looking at them or even trying to catch itwith the limitation of them only showing up on scan with undefined range while they are on grid makes cloaking still powerful in the rest of the systemif you analyze the mentality of nullbears the ability to notice cloaked ships on grid with the dcan if they have the right angle and direction it might make them more likly to take risks doing anomalies or such while there is a neutral in local this will result in more nullbears being caught and killed d thats my point of viewedit heck i would be okay with it only working at a 5 degree angle it would make it very very hard to spot the cloakies around a gate or in your anomaly but it would be useful if you noticed exactly where someone cloaked at as you fly towards their locationsupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
i would have to say no no more free intel until local changes and those changes mean you have to work for itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i dont see how this would be free intel unless you misread what i wrote this is for hunting on grid cloaked ships it doesnt tell you what the ship is and it only works if you look straight at where it is when you scan at very tight anglesupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
ok i accept you may need to work a little for it but it is more intel maybe free was the wrong term to use but the point still standsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
an interesting take itd at least make those who are willing to hunt a cloaked ship on grid able to do so while allowing the cloaked pilot who is properly at his keyboard ample time to movewarp i suspect though that itd be hard to implement in a way that wouldnt be immediately exploitable
read the goons gridfu manual then imagine a group of 4 people being able to hunt down a covert ops cloaker in under a minute
lol butt hurt ftwim off to camp there space in with my super op cloak d
we did not need them either in fact i have never used themas for not looking at someone before you gank em you must be a pretty poor pilot 
i absolutely loathe achievements and trophies in gamesjust no
what this eve of yours will be dead in 5 years because of the games like sto which are developing much faster than it eve is not so bad but its not developing its was seen since the incarna fail
ah yes the achievement for not playing the game just paying for it and sitting on the stationwell im doing exactly that its nothing for me to pay for it ive just gave avay 2 characters for free recently because im too lazy to sell them
youre streaching the truth a little bit here and im not sure what for there is no signs of eve failing in fact the exact opposite is true sto on the other hand was a absolute failure as a subscription game and hasnt been a hit as f2p game either the f2p is still a success since it managed to guaranteee continued development of the game but compared to the succesful f2p games its small fry its also nothing like eve so there is no reason to believe the players from either game will migrate to the other for any reason en masse
lol  comparing sto to eve
the signswell how about the addons for the game remember the plans that they had for eve the scifi simulator in space ground and god knows where else 5 years ago ive thought there will be a stunning progress in the later 5 after theyre done premium graphics and wrote wis concept and screenshots the world that we can literrally live and what do we get just a couple of small nice things and now they increasing the playerbase by lowering the gap for noobs and promote the alts an many ways remove them and well get 7000 pilots online  whats not developing  dies
alice wtf is that thing on your face

me and many other chose the ways of piracy as stands in new eden every decision should have its consequences but what we actually get we get no highsec we get guns on the gates and we get a big black  and nothing elsewhile if you chose militia warfare u get a really good way to earn isk and pvp in same time and what are the consequences for militia actually none in proportion what pirates ones areso what to do i ask ccp for that  standing to actually meter to pirates from 5 and below each level 5 6 7 8 9 should open the doors for every pirate faction lv missions respectively 1 2 3 4 5 pirate faction standings wouldnt meter if u got negative security standingin addition to that near every militia space there should be a pirate hub small outpost npcs in space etc which would give pvp mission against respective militia factions gurista against caldari militia etc missions would be kill 10 different caldari pilots shuttles and noobships dont count or kill 10 caldari militia frigates et many combinations are possiblein addition to that the lower the standing u get the minor are the taxes in those hubs which would have its own market for completing the missions u get isk and lp which u can spend to purchase those faction ship blueprints ammo implants etcsome interesting mechanics could be added for easier drug production and trading in those hubpvp near those should be allowed without npc interference if u are a  standing and all others especially militia would be attacked on sight hubs should be guarded by sentry guns and a npc fleet incursion like with sleeper ai where if bested by the militia side the hub would enter in reinforce for 1 day the next time if the hub isnt defended by both the npcs and pirates it should enter a longer reinforce mode 3 days where the market wouldnt work and a  of items in ti would be lostjust few cents of mine gl and hfedit1 just to add few things as militia would interfere with the pirate hubs there would be missions for pirates to attack the militias plexes which would weaken their soveregnityedit 2 u dont enlist in any of the pirate factions u stay where u are corp alliance wise u just get to use that  standing somewhere it is a tool basically for us lowsec outlawsmercenariespirates to earn isk trough pvp it can be a roleplay tool also it is needed to give more meaning to the other part of lowsec not militia imo the right way is to build around militia warfare which is a great success also for lowsec u get to lay foundation for more meaningful pirate faction warfare later u can add concord hubs too just like u did with  where players would take in their hand policing lowsec and earn isklp for their effortedit 3 sansha hubs missions against everyone where u could turn in lp and spawn incursions once per month in constellations by your choosing let say 1mil is needed per month to spawn an incursion ccp put some 10 constellation of strategic importance for eve players to chose from players put lp in designated pots for each of those constellation when 1 mil lp is given the constellation pot with highest lp gets the incursion higher the standing with sansha u have lesser the penalties in the incursions u ll have
1 a carrier can only hold a bout a platoon in it the rest a maning the carrier that that not possible 2good put titans close the the front lines where they can be at some risk rather then never been seen or used 3 i sure you can find some industry corp that can mine hual and sell all that moon goo for you i not trying to take your goo away from you i just want you to mine it rather then just sit on your asss and get fat off of it 4good then go back to that maybe we get some fight 5i dont think they are fine how many titan do you see fighting and that fine but give them something to be use full and in fight now is safe where no one see then and or used for what they where for killing  dont let them get there track or attacking sub caps but somthing need to be done so they are fielded 6 cloaky can close down a indy system for allaince with no way to defend from it other then waiting for them to get bored and hope they go away
simple solution make station models bigger by 100 its never gonna happen but still would look cool
to derail the topic even further  please make the stations at least look larger than the ships coming out of themundock a naglfar from an amarr factory station youll immediately see what i mean im guess the amarr have mastered the whole bigger on the inside thing
yes that would make way more sense seriously how can a nomad undock from a minmatar industrial station
sorry dont have time to read all of it but if youre talking about some content for solo playing  im inwhy do they hate solo players so much i tell you its simple its easier for a solo player to quit than for an active corp member because of the mates who always calling him back
there is a kinda offline version of eve google itdont know if the story work on the other hand
ccp needs to do this
no my original thread about this with most of the above ideas in some form several years ago predating the making lowsec matter page by quite a biti was on the original council that mynxee headed up that was supposedly backed by ccp to make lowsec better that whole project went  up very fast as it appeared ccp really didnt want to look at lowsec at all apart from fw which isnt what the old inhabitants of ls wanted at allso no none of this is inspired cherry picked or stolen from that page at all im afraid
nice ideas silvara ill get them linked into teh original post when i have time i have always liked the idea of implant production being a lowsec activity using illegaly salvaged body parts
well i like how music works now far better than the same playlist over and over or even kust a shufflealthough its may be nice to still have the jukebox to listen to the ost sometimes
hellomy suggestion is  maps for every star system full screen showing all the planets with all the moons and all the gates and stations and asteroid belts this adds a little more personality to the game more than the right click listsomething like view in planet mode but for star systems
they already have thateditoh i see youre newopen map click button
what we need is dotlan style functional map think street map not satellite map in game
achievementsthe themepark is strong with this one
1i dont think its needed but will still support things like achievements that take practically zero dev manhours to put inif ccp decides to use this as excuse to not add real content like some mmo companies it would be bad but then they have no t
problem with piracy is the game mechanics irl a pirate is basically a mugger with a ship in eve almost all piracy begins and end with someone randomly opening fire on someone else and hoping some expensive modules survive to be looted thats not a pirate thats a brigandfew and far between are pirates that ask for ransom fewer still are those that honor it never have i seen a pirate in eve who actually says drop your cargosee irl pirates traditionally wanted the cargo food ammo water rum  these were not only things pirates could sell but also the basic things that they needed actually firing on a merchant was rare as most gave up as soon as they saw the black flag raised it just wasnt worth fighting over on the pittance they paid regular seamen in modern times pirates are usually after the ship itselfthe real problem is that eve lacks proper tools for any of this there is no special button that says autostop firing at 50 hull or anything to emulate concords drop your contraband or die in 10 seconds routine and the only eve pirates that actually bother with cargo scanners are the jita suicide gankersi was hoping that dust would open the eve universe up to actual boarding actions and ship capture but thats just not going to happen so here is my 2 cents of a crazy idea for a new pirate toy boarding shuttleshave them work just like heavy drones fit in drone bay etc 25m3 each when they reach the target the board once they do they start either depends on setting damaging modules directly like heat or start stealing cargo the longer they remain on board the more damage they docargo they stealok not the best idea but you get the idea something that works like real piracy you know theft not murder
yeah but pirates used to attack ship a ship take the cargo destroy it and run away but i do agree is hard atm to draw a line between an outlaw and a pirate

back on topic1 drone implants 5 bonus to damage and hitpoints2 autotarget your own drones for free instant lock without taking up actual target slots i should not have to waste five of my all too finite number targeting slots and wait fifteen seconds to be able to monitor  repair my own dang drones3 drone durability skill buffed to at least 20 up from current and useless 10 per level4 drone accuracy skill sharpshooting only effects optimal range what about tracking omnilink is a drag 10 drone tacking speed per level hit more often5 drone shield skill increases rate of drone shield regeneration 20 per level6 drone evasion skill reduces drone signature radius by 10 per level harder to hit7 drone repair module heals damaged drones while docked8 replace drone mwd with afterburner maybe not as fast but not a big bullseye marker either
drone implants and the autorepair module are a good idea all the others are unnecessary and seem really to be intended just to make missionrunners lives even easier
like the hireable npc vendors in swg i like it
the op hasnt really stated how these would work but a few problems i can see areif they are not destroyable then they would be perfect decloaking tools for gate campscan you imagine the can spam at every hisec gate ughmining bots could pop one next to their ice roid and continually mine and sell to the can without having to warp back to the stationalso ruins a lot of the need for transporting goods to and from trade hubs and all the things that come with that  hauler ganking zerolow sec logistics transportation careers etcjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
problem with current story arcs is that go straight from sisters of eve snooze fest to the faction omfg level ten with nothing in betweenmore story arcs with intermediate levels of difficulty would be nice
1ive heard the same song in null for literally over a month
that is something i dont understand ccp keeps saying its superdifficult to write code to figure out if the booster ship is on grid with you but it seems to me there are two separate but possibly the same thing behind the curtains things that eve does right now that determine if somone is on grid with you they are visibility on overview yes i know what cloaking devices are and the appearance of health bars on your fleet watch list seems to me if someone could have a visible healthbar on your watchlist then they could give you a command link boost i would assume the code to determine if someone is ongrid with you is already there based on these two things
titan class paper weightsfirst of all i know i am going to get a lot of hate posts and mails from this this is a sore subject for a lot of people mostly the goons but hey what can you dowhen people think of titans they think of one of the most powerful most expansive most giant ships in the game they have their doomsday they have their titan bridge they have powerful guns and they are one of the most attention drawing ships in the game but now when eve vets think about titans all they can say is UFFFDthere is no point in buying one as they are now trashUFFFD for those who donUFFFDt know why they are trash it is because they have been nerfed time after time after time they can no longer have an aoe doomsday which is understandable given that fleet fights were very hard to have when you had the UFFFDi win buttonUFFFD to end entire fleets so to fix that ccp introduced focused doomsdays these are doomsday beams that only target a single ship but then they became to widely used and they were nerfed no longer could a doomsday be used on subcapital ships to compensate for that the sandbox spit out the tracking titans everyone saw the power of that when raiden was in querious aka the thunder dome and again with the war in the north against cfc after thousands upon thousands of ships died to the might tracking titans ccp nerfed the racking on the titans so now the only thing titans can do is doomsday capital and super capital ships and use guns on pos towers other high hit point structures and give fleetUFFFDs the ability to bridge into a combat system in a momentUFFFDs notice everyone is crying for super capital ships to die in grand flames of fire and massive fights doing it but other than the asakai fight no real big fights have taken place where titans have died there is the occasional titan gank but thatUFFFDs about it the reason being there is no reason to drop titans anymore they are very expansive jump bridges other than the occasional gank of a carrier or a dread they are rarely used in combat these daysso i am proposing that we give a little back to the people who have spent years training ratting and butt loads of isk keeping their accounts running i say we give back the doomsday ability to hit subcapital class ships the reason being titans will now have reasons to drop again i will guarantee that if titans were allowed to doomsday subcaps again you would see more fights taken place with not only titans but super carriers as well super caps deaths will be more and more often than as it stands today so if ccp and you the eve players really want to see more supercapital kills and fights taking place more often then please i beg you please show your support on this proposal if you agree with me please like the post if you dont agree with me please post why and give us your idea thank you for your timeUFFFD
perhaps they need to reevaluate the concept of the aoe doomsdays not restored to their former iwin glory but script the doomsday you can bust your nut in a single blaze of glory against a single capital target or script it to be a limited 100k aoe damage over time take the total damage of the doomsday cut it to 110th the damage then spread the damage over the full 10 min cycle time this will give logi and triage the ability to stay outside the 100k range but still work on keeping those inside the area alive this will help keep blobs down as some ships will still die to the aoe but they have time to get out this will bring a more strategic use to the weaponduring the time of damage no remote effects repping and the like can affect the titanalso the aoe damage will affect the titan as well consider this a hack of the doomsday and with all modifications has repercussions
well that would be counter productive the reason its called a doomsday is casue its a head shot weapon no weapons in eve have an over time damage dealt damage style the best way this could work is to allow them to focus doomsday subcaps again and its not something that will take months to make happen if they wanted to they could release that in a patch on 24 hrs notice
the problem with targeting subcaps is they were to easily escaping by blaping the hictors the damage over time can be dealt with in multiple ways consider it like a smartbomb that cant be deactivated and surges every second like they have in some missions with damage waves to keep db calls to a minimum but as for doomsday being a headshot weapon no that would be a sniper rifle a doomsday weapon has always been historically a weapon of last resort its so utterly horrendous an idea to use that it is likely to call down the wrath of your own as well as your enemy this can also be achieved by making the damage it deals sig radius shifted the bigger you are the more damage you take so it will shift back towards capitals and battleships
well lets look at it this way yea i agree titans were able to escape in the old days but lets take a look at fleet sizes this is the era of the coalitions everyone is in one or everyone has one a speed dial so the ammount of hics and dics that can be brought to fight that argument goes out the window we can even look at it like this a cloaky saber can hold a titan down granted the titan may be able to lock him in time if the dictor is not paying attention even so dictors are cheap a titan is a 100 billion isk investment just for the hull a dictor is like 60 mil fitted a ttian with a decent fit runs 130 billion isk that titan should noty be able to be killed by a cloaky dictor and 5 battleships so let the titan dd again the dictor will still be pretty much safe if he knows what he is doing the battleships will die every 10 min and by the time those battleships die they should have bat phoned someone to kill the titan so the whole omg the titan is going to escape because he can dd the hicdic is a terrible argument in this case and lets think about it when catching a titan cloaky dics are the primary ship type when its caught and you fleet shows up to kill it then u use hics if u just bring one hic then u deserve to miss the km and the only thing to catch a titan in low sec is a hic but dont worry titans cant dd in low sec soooooooo
dude i got alts that have been in the game longer then you and by the way trolling the forums doesnt count as experience maybe i liked the other way better
you have literally reinvented the wheelbefore the current system was implemented sov was more or less dependent on how many pos towers you had up in a system it created nightmareish scenarios for attackers and defenders alike attackers had to destroy each and every single defending pos in a system before they could take it only to be greeted with more empty poss that were set up on other moons while the attacking fleets were busydefenders had to fuel each and every single pos in a system making living and logistical costs tedious at best
you had alts in the game longer than me yet you didnt know about this old broken system how old are your alts newbies need to learn how to play this game before suggesting major game changes youre obviously a newbie and its obvious you dont know what youre talking aboutlearn your eve history if you had you wouldve already known that this was in the game a long time ago and it was a horribly broken way to take and maintain sov i was there to witness it personally if you had characters older than mine you would have too which clearly you havent since this thread existsand thats how you put a tard in their placesummary of eves last four expansions
uuuggghhh you must be new the pos spam sov claiming method was even worse than the painful enough to stop wars from happening system we have todayno just no
theyre useless because theyre didnt do it properlyant its a shame both of them were able to become an amazing part of gameplay but looks like such content too much for them because while being a small company theyre wasting their resources for truly huge useless things dust stuff and wod
btwachievements its a good things for finishing the certificates idea1 its already here and just need some improvements like points for each sertificate and sertificates for more then sp achievements2 its continues the idea of already implemented certificates as the certificate can show the recruter that the player have the corresponding skills the achievement certificate can show that player have done something already not just trained pvp stuff while carebearing or have been in wh6 already
from the last thread about this
well something should be done to increase the realism of the game because i agree with the big ships and null stations i 3 forum trolls poor little things think likes actually increase their rate of sp gain id take a but of both larger stations and still having mass restrictions oooooooooorrrr how about docking fees because i know if i dock my boat it costs money to keep it tied to the pier how about that that would discourage the goons lets be real it would only be them trolling stuff from station spinning if they were getting charged 1iskm3hr for their ship being in a station in game and maybe having a 1isk1000m3 for outer less secure docking outside the station or even an orbital unloading feature for freighters so they dont even have to dock up if it is just to unload and dump goods lets see what trollville has to say about that
there is a point at which realism makes a game tedious this idea is one of the pointsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
sigh this postccp can we please have dislike buttons this is not facebook
i going to toss around a few ideas that will probably need to be refined for a legitimate proposal about salvaging salvagingwhen you have a specialized skill you become a valuable player if you can pilot a capital ship your inherit worth is a lot higher than a rookie this idea of specialization is what im going to focus aroundskillsthere are a lot of skills that go into mining to get a higher yield per cycle in an abundant amount of asteroids its a little bit different for salvaging because theres a per determined amount of salvage you get out of each wreck the higher the salvage skill the more chance you will get that per determined amount of salvage in one or two cycles i propose a set of skills that increase the chance of you getting a higher salvage yield per cycle out of what normally would yield little but also keeping the pre existing salvage skills intact that require less cyclesbasically there is no way for me to get a higher amount of salvage than the next guy the next guy can have level one salvage skill and still get the same amount of salvage when compared to miners you can get a higher yield per cycle of rock which means more iskwortha salvager isnt worth much because the skills are generalized and the yield is the same a noctis well suited with tech 2 rigs are around 200 mil the noctis being 80 mil by itself there are many ways to salvage including drones now that give you the same yield regardless of what you do it isnt worth for a person to get a noctis a waste of a ship practically it also isnt worth it for missioners and people who make wrecks to stop and get their noctisbusinessthere are plenty of corps based around the idea of a specialized skill merc pvp experts standing manufacturing pirates ect but thats because there is a market for that kind of specialized skill and experience there are some corps such as pro synergy that work off a model of contractingwhich is the market of salvagers but you could expand that market and not cause an inflation of the materials by having a specializationthank you
you are kind of missing out the point of the chance to get the salvage per cycle with a higher skill you get the salvage quicker meaning you will be able to salvage more wrecks and thus make more isk over the same time period than the level one guythe reason miners have skills for higher yield is because they have the same cycle time whatever skill level they havejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
there is a lot of debate currently on the viability of different security regimes hisec losec null wh and how to make some of the less populated ones more viable i would like to share some thoughts on this and maybe a few solutionsregimes hisec o risk minimal pvp is mostly optional you can be suicide ganked you can be wardecced you can still be tricked into pvp but crimwatch has pretty much put the kibosh on that o reward high most pve play is not the greatest iskhr but there are many ways you can mine afk or autopilot haul things to make isk with littletono player interaction access to the largest and most functional markets low sec o risk medium to high most areas of lowsec are a deserted wasteland populated by a few stubborn locals or roaming gangs of pirates some fw areas are a little more active there are frequent gatecamps as well as smartbombing bs traps o reward low the rocks arent great l5 missions or midlevel complex exploration might yield decent income if you could find a safe place to do them the markets are for the most part terrible  null sec o risk medium bubbles hotdrops etc exist and you can lose access to stations where you might have your possessions kept however most of sovereign null sec is connected by jump bridges and covered by multiregion intel networks o reward medium to high the anomaly nerf is still in effect null sec rocks are significantly more valuable than hisec but the rocks dont supply needed materials to build ships modules etc scanable sites can provide higher income the markets are sporadic and only the largest nullsec trade hubs approach full functionality it is often necessary to import the majority of your gear from hisec wh o risk high no local prevalence of cloaky ships everything you own can be destroyed a large pos tower is your biggest defense o reward high but high effort can make very good money but you need the right hole category the right group and possibly capitals which might not be able to leave the holeall of the points above are up for debate and i realize there are many exceptions however they provide us a good point to start fromproblem statements there is little reason for the average hisec mission runner to come to lowsec or nullsec there is no incentive for a smalltime miner to mine in lowsec or nullsec small groups cannot hope to establish a real foothold in sov nullsec there is little industrial infrastructure in nullsec the rocks planets and rats in lowsec arent enough to get people to come out and harvest them in any significant amount some solutionsmake it worthwhile to live in null or lowsec for the average riskaverse carebear directly nerfing hisec into the ground will not accomplish this it will just make people quit make them want to join up with others and make money incursions were a good start but they were nerfed pretty hard and the small difference between hisec losec and nullsec rewards did not make up for the added risk and forced downtime while avoiding gankers yes level 5 missions exist in lowsec but not many groups run them more often someone grind through them slowly in a passive tengu perhaps some more variety and tuning could help theremake the difference between different security levels more dramatic and or more linear right now when you go from a 05 to a 04 there is a huge difference the game even warns you until you turn it off if the rewards in a 10 system for pve activity were much worse were not nearly as good as working in a 05 ie mining veldspar in a 09 system with no belt rats and using 5 mining drones is not dramatically different from mining say omber in a 05 make hanging out in that sketchy 05 system next to lowsec where you might get a suicide destroyer coming at you with the cops on his heels worthwhile but make the 05 system sketchier maybe concord takes a break every once in a while and doesnt respond and the criminal gets away not often but possible maybe a local serpentis gang with bss ewar and tackling show up in an icebelt and make a miner spill his coffee and maybe lose his ship if he didnt fit a proper tank and bring some drones make it more random make it worth itnow that the 05 system has pretty good rewards but isnt really very safe make someone looks wistfully at the 04 next door and say to himself its not that much more dangerous and i could be making a lot more moneyalso bump the taxes in the really high security stations make it so maybe a trade hub in a 10 system isnt as attractive as one in a 05 maybe make the lower security areas be nice tax sheltersi would also suggest make building things in nullsec easier its no fun when you have to refine at one outpost and go to the next system to build stuff there is a reason raw materials sell for jita  hauling fees in nullsec and finished products sell for jita  hauling fee those abcs have ok iskhr but sometimes its a lot easier to drop a mackinaw in a hisec belt deploy drones and go make a sandwich or fire up tanks the iskhr for the ship is lower but the iskeffort is much much highersomething else that might help spice things up a bit random wormhole effects that pop up in a system for short periods from a few hours to a day these would have stronger effects as you go lower in security maybe solar storms could temporarily disable the ability to light a cyno maybe your mining lasers are suddenly more effective if both of these happen at the same time set up some scout and do a corp mining op suddenly everyone is filling their holds with yummy hemorphite that would give someone a reason to come looking for you
also exploration could use an iteration do we really need analyzers codebreakers and salvagers to loot sites maybe if these were more interesting and rewarding people would come out into the unknown to find their fortunewhat im asking for make it worth my while to take more risksto be clear i dont think we should massnerf all of hisec a few targeted areas to encourage people to move from 10s to lower security systems such as the taxes i described above would be pretty much it if someone wants to stay in their system and run missions for the same agent while flying the same ship im ok with that im even ok with them keeping their rate of income however i would like to increase the rewards to those will take more risk nerfing those who stay in their walled garden only by inflation everyone else who was willing to spend more riskeffort now has more moneymy hope in writing this post is not to start a csm run or anything i want to throw some ideas out there for the csm to run with i hope we can find a middle ground between say james 315 nerf hisec to the ground and ripard teg make hisec safer for the noobs my apologies to both of those guys i respect them and i realize i can sum up their beliefs in one short phrase if eve is to grow we need to break the stagnation up we need to get the pioneers into their wagons and get them moving to the wild west then the pvps would have someone to shoot at
a new hopeso how does this fix nullsec we arent there yet lets talk about sovereignty the current system relies on blowing up infrastructure that supports the topdown design this requires large capital and supercapital fleets to succeed this also results in the necessity to go out and own a bunch of moons just so you can pay your sov bills and infrastructure this moon income goes directly to the alliance the average grunt wont see the isk other than a ship replacement program srp instead we should want to have a bottom up system here is a good proposalbottoms up part one income and industrybottoms up part two sovereigntyunder this system i would propose that sov be earned by using the system similar to how the military and industrial indexes are generated now this would also include shooting other peoples ships since space would be much more crowded there would be a lot more targets for roaming gangs repeated failure to defend your systems from attack could jeopardize your sovereignty in that system this would make outposts more valuable because they are supporting higher population density and also require that they be much more functional in order to support increased usage and actual industrybasically the idea is to put most of the income into the players hands they would get income from pve missions exploration mining etc industry and pvp bounties and looted mods this income would be taxed by the corp and the corp would in turn be taxed by the alliance this system would also require nerfing moon income to match the new lower cost of sov basically nothing since sov is earned by activity and not infrastructure and srps since actual usage is required not using the system would mean losing it this would have the effect of capping the size of an alliances space in proportion to their size if tuned properly this would mean even the largest alliances only would own one or two regions worth of space this system would also reduce the need for coalitions if you dont have a lot of infrastructure that you rely on to generate your income you dont need a lot of friends to protect it this system would mean every player in nullsec generates value if you rat or run anomalies and complexes you are making the alliance richer and reinforcing sov if you mine you can build more ships to blow up gloriosly and you are reinforcing sov if you build you are contribution money and available products if you shoot other players you are reinforcing your sov or weakening somebody elses not to mention players in the first two groups provide targets for the pvpers i think this would allow smaller groups to establish themselves in space they could find a lesser used pocket of space and just move in unless there was an overwhelming response to drive them out they would own it one difference i would propose to similar systems is make the systems more valuable the more you use them also make some systems more valuable than other eg lower true security rating means better resources the drivers for conflict would be better resources and strategic location if i take away structures what am i going to do with my supercaps good question there are still poss and outposts to blow up fights can escalate from subcap brawls to capital ship engagments supercaps would be helpful but not required to hold sovthis post wasnt as organized as i had envisioned it but here it is let me know what you think
something to note there really aught to be two paradigms upheld risk vs rewardandeffort vs reward i have no problem with highsec incursions paying well when it requires organizing a fleet of 1030 people prior to engaging in the activity in contrast solooriented level 4 missions have low effort and a low risk and should reward correspondingly
thisi would say the emphasis needs to be on effort more than risk if for no other reason that risk is something that ccp does not really supply in the majority of possible actions inb4 but incursion rat blew up mah ship effort on the other hand is something that ccp can controlthat said reward is just as much of a weasel word as risk since a notinsignificant portion of measurable rewards are determined by player action and not ccp i am thinking specifically of all those things that are not isk generating activities mining trading explorationloot generators industry etc
quite truei guess when im generically saying risk its more like risk  effort if i fly an empty t1 frig 10 jumps across lowsec for 10 misk reward that makes a lot more sense than doing the same thing in a billion isk ship with 3 billion in bpos in the cargo hold for the same reward same effort but radically different risk  effort
the increase in ship and cargo value is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for radically different risk

ive looked high and low and for some reason i can not find a new eden space craft in modal formim sure many of you out there are aware of games workshop and its work for modeling warhammer and games alike why oh whyhave we not seen a modeling franchise of the ships we love and flyim aware that there has been a deal struck with lego and its frigate which is great to enthuse the new gamer coming of age but what about us oldies who would pay to have a ship on theyre mantelplease please if anyone can shed some light on this subject i would gladly receive it
enjoy
also the lego rifter isnt happening
i dont know if this is in the backlog already because tldr but i have what i think is a short and easy proposali suggest shortening the cooldown timer on jump clones from 24 hours to something more in the 1822 hour time frame most people due to rl constraints play eve at about the same time each night if im not mistaken as it stands right now if you need to use a jump clone for whatever reason near tail end of your normal playtime the first hour or couple hours of you normal playtime will be lost the next dayfor example joe blow plays eve for three hours on average after work during the week starting at 0000 gmt and ending at 0300 gmt on tuesday one of his corpmates gets on comms at 0230 at says ive got a carrier tackled in system xxxxx joe and his corp normally base out of system yyyyy but no need to fear they all have jcs and a small corp hanger near system xxxxx everyone jumps down and joe winds up playing until about 0500 that night and gets a couple kills drinks are had etc now the problem is that joe will be stuck in a region 30 jumps from his home system where he has no real assets in any case he needs to be able to leave that jc down there for another possible gank later in the week so he cant just slowboat it back home to add insult to injury he cant jump back until 0230 and hes still got some mild wife aggro from last night meaning his 0300 logoff time is pretty strict this is not a personal anecdote so now joe only has effectively 30 minutes of playtime that night not the worst thing in the world i know but it is still a bummer if his timer were 1822 hours until next jump clone availability he would still have the consequence of being stuck in the different region for the rest of his time online that day if he were to continue playing but by the start of his next play session he could jump back to home and get some real play time in so tldr shorten the jump clone cooldown timer from 24 hrs to 1822 hrs so that even if they didnt jc as soon as they logged on that night the following night they can have option to jc back home at the beginning of their playtimeplease thumbs up if you likey
good idea but if i could suggest the 12 jc timer rule rather than the currenteveryone in low sec has to battle with timers 1 roam to null in a blank clone wife calls you dock up and log next day you log on and find yourself stuck in null with no blues for 30  60 jumpsif the timer was lower i could leave my ship and clone in null and jump to it and pick it up the next time a roam goes that waythumbs up from me
when players start complaining about it that means its a viable solution
signed i cant believe people are defending ogb links they are so obviously over powered they are absurd and pure pay to win no skill involved just park and forget
i have friends across multiple corporations and since corporations can only have one alliance i would suggest a new feature to allow players to join multiple player corporations but only be able to represent one at a time to minimize spying adding a representer sepcific chat to corporations along with the general corp chat would prevent players of enemy corps from making new characters for spying as they wouldnt get any information that way i would love to see this feature or an adaptation of it be implemented in eve
not happening if nothing else because of the extreme trouble this would cause for corps where roles are required for operational purposes
how about something in between the two move the tcu ihubs and sbus to be pos modules this will add variety to the sov churn not the static cookie cutter we know exactly how many hp the tcu will take to pop routine bring the reinforcement of the tower into the sov game as well as guns and resists and ewar if you wish to take a system you have to have an sbu tower for every gate in the system bring a bit of the pos slug fest into the sov challenges without the pos spamming that was the days of old it just gets kind of boring slugging on sbu after sbu with little or no variety or the lone tcu sitting off station or sitting at a planet
while pos warfare was horribly flawed and unfun in many ways i cant help but feel that in some ways it was superior to what we have nowperhaps the pos revamp when it arrives will pave the way for something that combines the better features of both
ok how about this 1 get rid of sov completely make null like wormholes cept you can still build stations there the  sec status is the level of the system no more grinding or fighting for systems simply roll in put up a pos or station and make a home the sbutcu could then be replaces with buildable security for an alliances headquarter system throw guns on a gate to kill the cyno ship that dares enter your system or station guns to keep asshates from camping your undock the issue is nobody likes sov grinding 2 even out the moons this has been the elephant in the room for a while now either spawn more of the rarest moons or get rid of the more common moons to balance the moon goo market out i am not the most knowledgable about moons lets see your ideas if you dont like mine

probably going to get a whole lot less responses here than in your other identical thread in the other forumbut the repsponses will still be the same a resonding no voiced universally and unanimosly by everyone not you
what your suggesting is basically an arbitrary asset limitno matter how little iskm3 it is there is a point where it would become impossible to have your assets and not lose money every month for people who deal in station trading or longterm asset investing this would become a guaranteed loss of incomeall in all this is a bad idea on every pointhowever im all for them increasing the physical size of stationscarriersdreadstitans to be where they should
im sure theres a way to make it work this is simply a proposal i had based off a problem i see in game the definition of troll is berating someones ideas without giving a better ides of your ownso lets see what you have thats better at least im trying if my ideas are bad then yours must be worse if youre not sharingand the solution to your station trader issue if you would read and analyze instead of reademoragenoitwontworkeverevereverevertrollnonononoooomgholycrap is that there would be a function that would allow you to unload your cargo and then simply put on the market or sell from space this way a jf wouldnt have to pay holy crap fees for docking up every twenty minutes and also allow the mass of a station to stay well under the max limit like i also said fot those of you in the cheap seats next to the windows with the helmets on the outer docking stations would be a lower fee but would keep a player in space but close enough to the station that you wouldnt be noticed i would even be a fan of a station safety cloak for those docked on the outside players not logged in would not count until a half hour after they logged in and if the station was overloaded the ships that have been in the station for over a day would be moved to the outer docks and then after two days would be undocked and put into an orbit around the station until they paid the daily docking fee i know goons would try to manipulate the system but after a while the markets would just level out to the point where it would not matter i also like ripard tegs idea of allowing us to search the entire market from anywhere in game
i like the idea of having a set limit to the amount of stuff you can have in stationscurrently they are massive unlimited floating cans that can hold many times more than their volumeunless of course eve has bigger on the inside technologyproposaleach station has 3 types of docking slotsvisitor  no charge100 per station 10000m3 cargo hold 2 ships of any sizestandard  10000000 isk  month50 per station 1000000m3 cargo hold 10 ships of any sizeindustrialist  20000000 isk  month20 per station 1000000m3 cargo hold 100000000m3 ore hold 10 ships of any sizetrader  50000000000 isk  month25 per station 1000000000m3 cargo hold 100000000m3 ore hold 25 ships of any sizeobviously this is all very loose and subject to change all numbers amounts and limitations are subject to modificationnow for the real kickerstations can be full you can warp to the station but can only dock if there is room or you are renting a sloteach race and type of station can a different set of attributes as wellthis would quickly spread out the trade hubs and make traders pay for what they usewill people game this system for sure will it matter nopethe traders will move to a location that they can sell stuff at after a short while

oh and heres another downside to your ideai now have to jump between 50 diferent systems to try and buy and find all the amterials necessary to operate taking a couple hours out of my time making my life a living heck without the ability to have a centralized market with hundreds of supplies going in and out all youll do is force people to travel longer to get their stuff
come on guys no one else has anything to see about this
if i have 4 billion on the line i would say that is a lot more risk sorry if that was a bad example though i was blanking a bit and couldnt think of a better examplepost 3 in this topic has been updated to talk about nullsecedit i just saw this post on highsec by malcanis a lot of good things there
i like this idea
i was thinking at something similar allow 1 more character that can train skills at the same time with the main character on the same account after 1 year of play i understand why that is not possible now because its too useful and eve would become something like heroes or baldurs gate where you have to control 3 characters to get anything done every new player would have to start playing with 3 characters at once so make it as a reward after 1 year of play or make the alt account cheaper
i dont see why this should be implemented it honestly begs for abuse and most safety measures can be easily circumvented yuckmore importantly the notion about catching up with veterans is simply flawed lets play a game who should win the links were already available to me from an internal contest we had as a corp the unlinked kills exist if i could be asked to hunt them down rifter vs wolfrifter vs stabberrifter vs drakerifter vs raventaranis vs wolftaranis vs sabretaranis vs rupturetaranis vs hurricanetaranis vs rapiertaranis vs vagabondhelios vs taranishelios vs slicerhelios vs auto wolfhelios vs arty wolfhelios vs jaguarhelios vs harpyhelios vs thrasherhelios vs sabrevexor vs cynabalvexor vs maelstromvexor vs sfiyou dont need max skillpoints or three years of skills to fly a ship thats a straight up lie you can be competitive in industry easily within a monthyou can be competitive in trading within a dayyou can be competitive at mining within a week or twoyou can be competitive at hauling within a month or lessyou can be competitive at pvp within a week and you can be a competitive soloer within a month you dont need massive amounts of skillpoints in this game and thats the fallacy of your argument skillpoints open doors true but you dont need perfect skills to be a good in this game
people gate camp null sec is full of gate camps null sec entry is bottlenecked i propose to open the bottlenecks first by making more systems have gates into null sec second by having more gates in null sec entrance systems so that people arent forced into 1 obvious path to get into that region of null secthis does not eliminate gate camping which will still be quite viable this merely makes it easier to enter null sec
im pretty sure not all null sec systems are bottlenecked in fact most are not the most camped gates are hs  null while most ls  null gates are quiet unless its a chain system simply avoid these systems and use a scout and its no problem
i always thought 18 hrs would be good no more lost evenings or deathcloning
again with the emo i dont know how to read rage if you log out for a while and come back in you have that initial hour or so to figure out what you want to do with your items that were put into storage standing with the corp could have an effect on it too say since i have 10 with soe i can have a slot for no charge stuff like that
keep changing your argument and ill keep quoting you waah make your own stuff and that wont happen who is to say a market wouldnt stabilize and have everything you need the only way you would have to make 50 jumps is if you are an extreme penny pincher and absolutely have to have the lowest price jita is like walmart it is ruining the economy and allowing bots to make out stuff
not going to lie i was sad to see it go
count me as one more player returning after an extended hiatus who would love to see this returnedwhy a switch onoff because the new animation doesnt add anything to gameplay and its graphically annoying in other words its worse than bad its useless simple as that   kina ayami
im at a bit of a crossroad when it comes to titans and dds having never flown one or used such a weapon what i say may not have that much value either even though i have been around long enough to hear about the changes and how it has shifted things in null warsso for what it is wortha weapon that is the strongest most expensive and longest to train into should have some kind of worth that makes it appealing to go after being a one click no questions about and unconditional iwin button is a bit too much though the concept of aoe style weapons on any ship type registers to me as something all ships should have built in as a form of overloading your capacitor and inevitably power core of the ship with damage amounts relevant to the power of the non skillfitting modified capacitor a last resort that you can burn out when all else is failing and something that then renders the ship useless for either long periods of time or indefinitely possibly depending on thermodynamics levels andor how many slots you commit to capacitor buffing being the influence on the ships survivability after such an overload the buffer for an internal damage typethis might seem to go off topic but bear with me for a sec the idea and various levels of smartbombs including doomsdays can then be reworked to act as the very unpopular anticloaking tool wh dwellers then dont have to throw as much of a hissy fit since who really has a titan in a wh to make an electronics disruptingmulti spectral ripple large enough to cover a possible full grid smaller smartbombs anticloak range would only be useful to lift the veil off of an incoming bombing runs and what not a few seconds before they hit so any class of cloakys goals are still achievable they can still lurk and gather intel but the virtually norisk and all gains cloaky has some kind of counter now if you put the resources into getting the sov skills and ships to hold powerful tools to help the groups maintain the space it was born from and for would this be worthwhile as a weapon to help keep your spacei know folks want to feel that training into capitals should make you the biggest baddest thing in the eve verse but imo really their presence as main attack forces andor necessities in fleet compositions a factor in what keeps a large chunk of players from making use of and occupying null that and bubbles are large contributors to what keeps null empty and dull beefing up any direct combat related aspect of caps will only contribute to this if you really want more folks to fight and live out in null it might be worth considering leveling the battlefield where the smaller combat classes have the larger roles then massive instant win ships ive always felt capitals should be deep space excursion vessels mobile platforms comparable to pos or stations which you can seed your empires expansion to and what can act as a dry dock for when you are too far out in uncivilized space to have the convenience of an outpoststation things they already have some capability of but its pretty much agreed they are never used as used as rorquals just park it in a pos and boostcompress from a distance instead of leaving to the vast unknown for expedition type mining titans are just mobile jump bridges carriers and dreads are just common weapons that only call for more of their own types to come in as a counterslightly straying from doomsday topic but still relevant to a capitals place and roles as a weapon or resourcean unrealistic vision of mine was have capitals replace pos and capitals themselves become a form of modular tower with maybe three subsystems that only add a small piece or part to the already present capital hulls as weapon batteries do but not to the extent of full subsystem design changing with an indy core they can anchor near a moon for harvesting with the moon mining array being a sort of an orbital strip miner for real endgame mining types also expanding to mobile research platform with small scale assembly lines for keeping ammo stocks up and subcap ship supplies going when you are in deep space without them a siege core subsystem could give it the offensive abilitys of whatever kind logistics core focuess on remote repping probing fleet boosting etc the capital type itself having small skill based modifiers for such coressubsystems and acting as the difference between smallmedlarge towerscontinuing on with that theme and the idea of titan fightsdooms days having a one size kills all weapon of destruction may also be what hinders the element of this being a mmo opening your ranks to classes that can take out vessels smaller then what you are currently flying instigates team playing and effort more then single shotting anything and everything the general idea of larger ships from various sources is they do have the capacity to take on ships of their own class but need support to go against the smaller crowds which their weapons cannot track currently capitals do support this outside of fighters if you really want something stronger it will have to come with consequences beyond time and money so they are tools that require strategy not simple grinding or waiting for a queue to finish
i read this and i want to say 2 things in response 1 i am talking about giving the titan back the ability to do focused doomsdays on subcapital class ships not the aoe doomsday and the fact that you want to modify a titans doomsday device into some kind of anti clocking weapon is completely and utterly  and i feel this needs to be quoted  what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soulnow that may sound extremely rude but take a minute t reread your post i suppose i should be more understanding since you statedbut still if you have never been dded or lit a dd or been on grid with one then posting on this thread should not be for you but you should take your smartbomb idea about anti cloaking weapons to the right page the exit to this page is that way please do not drink any of the koolaid on the way outsorry to be so mean
they should make it so that after it shoots the doomsday device increases the damage dealt by the titan so that the titan deals more damage with its turretsmissiles while immobile than a dread
since i am bored i will bump thisyou would say that but you might be speaking falsely not to be confused with lying probability of loss is the only thing that actually matters since you have held static the isk value however probability is a conjunction loosely speaking of many other probabilistic factors and the amount of effort employed in mitigating those factors it is entirely possible to reduce the probability of loss to 0 given sufficient effort and the game mechanicsas such effort v reward is a much more sensible routeyou should remove the stuff about small alliances gaining footholds and reductions in the need for coalitions as it is not really true swapping structures for players is just changing what is considered infrastructure swapping static high hp predictable timer based infrastructure for dynamic low hp nonpredictable timer based infrastructure actually benefits those who have large player bases and are part of a coalition 500 people spread over many timezones is going to be less effective at defending the dynamic infrastructure in comparison to defending static point infrastructure so a large alliancecoalition can squash a start up much more efficiently since it can be done so efficiently it will also be done more frequently sometimes the only reason why a small alliance can exist in an unused system is merely because someone hasnt worked up enough motivation to overcome the effort of structure bashing
attempts to balance and make all areas interact are 1 in my book while im not 100 for all the ideas this thread is so much better than the typical ns should be better than hs garbage we see
dear ccpmight i suggest renaming cloudring region to  alterac valley im sure you know whypandas are optionalthanks
to be frank about it youre wrongnot every highnull  lownull is camped at all times making it hard to get into null i know for a fact that many arent even camped at prime time on weekendsthe lowsyndicate gates for example lowgreat wildlands lowprovidence lowvale lowgeminate via eoa lowquerious lowfountain and as for the highlow transitions on the way to these they are usually quiet tooif anything the ones that are camped mostly are tribute pureblind  geminate via bwf and even then not all the time
also add npc null system in middle of all sov null areas with a dozen gates going around like an octopus
yeah there are maybe half a dozen permacamped gates in 00when proposing a solution to a problem one should first ensure that the problem actually exists
i do have a jc but i rarely use it however i have seen this idea posted before and i do support iti am sure most people would support adding a skill such asat level 3 through to 5 took 2h of the timerthis would allow someone who does not use a jc very often to continue to jump on the 24 hour timer but for the people that want to jump every 18 hours they would have to put in some effort skillpointsjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

2 per 48 hours
yeah the 1822h timeframe also cooperates better with the 24h give or take timer on kspace exit whs
i think the goal is to keep people from using clone jumping as a means of travelling any time they like i think its a worthy goal but i too hate to wait for my timerwhy not give clone jumping an isk cost if you want to jump before the standard 24hour timer winds down something like 100000 isk per minute before the timer is up if you set a minimum timer of 18 hours that caps out at 36 million isk to clone jump after 18 hours or 0 isk to wait until the timer is up

custom chat channels are not exactly rocket science
i like the general idea because id like to see more traffic and cooperation everywhere  but i almost see some of the specifics as being ingame alreadyhighsec is bonused for market orders because people go there to buy things youre more likely to sell things there its also bonused for just about any other industrial effort because youre unlikely to lose that effort to traditional pirates  but you have to live with the penalty that resource contention is highin lowsec there are never wait times for production so you could say that production is bonused in lowsec for entities without their own pos lowsec is bonused for research copying and invention because the queues arent clogged up there is less competition for the resources this is also true of nullsec but its penalized in nullsec because its much easier to get caught and you dont want to lose your original blueprints nullsec is definitely bonused for exploration because the game mechanics cause the best sites to spawn there and nowhere else its also bonused for mining because there are some ores that are difficult to get anywhere elsei see where youre trying to go but i dont think this path takes you there
id still like to see this happen any minertype and leadership people want to vouch for this 
i personally think mindlinks are broken giving way too much potency to boosters i would much rather that the receiving end need the mindlink implant to receive extra warfare boost in other words the claymore boosting interdiction manuevers ii link provides a 32ish boost to warp disruptor rangethen the arazu pilot could pug in the mindlink to boost the bonus from 32ish to 48ish encourage some synergy between booster and boostee to get max benefit after such a change id support more seeding of mindlinks into the game either via lp stores plexes or whatever until then or until ogb is nerfed leave them scarce and rare
i disagree that mls are broken given their current purpose and use however i agree that having the pilot using them would be an interesting turnabout but the drop rate  availability would have to increase substantially to be used on a regular basis mindlinks are hardly scarce and rare  unless you consider only the mining mindlinkif all mindlinks the slot10 variety were upwards of 11  15b eg same as the mining foreman ml then yes theyd be scarce and rare until then that last statement is patently falsehrolt ceo live free die proud
ccp has stated that the whole boosting thing is being looked at as well as the leadership implants thats as far as they have committed to at this point the price in comparison to the other leadership implants is off kilter seeing as they all drop from the same mission yes this is an issue of supply and demand unfortunately the problem is with the supply side and ccp nerfing the supply accidentally if ccp are not going to remove the implants and that will cause a whole heap of bitching and gnashing of teeth then they all should be seeded out through the lp stores each main faction gives out their appropriate implant and ore for the mining implant after moving some ore stations to highsec i understand why ccp hasnt done anything yet why spend the time to fix one thing that may be addressed during another fixthe biggest problem with the current price of this implant is it is over the price of a return on investment
also plenty of wormhole routes that lead into 00there is no problem to fix here
during each csm campaign theres talk about the people that actively participate and those who drift along for the ridei would appreciate if current csm members would specify whos not participating or if a given members participation is less than productive i dont want to cause dramai plan on voting largely for encumbents this time around but i dont want to back people who dont pull their weighti would appreciate it if only csm members or the ccp individuals who work with the csm would respond to this thread

as of today i would like to start the 2nd council of eve online i think we should be setting up more council management for each areas of eve which would open reports and few ideas to ccpi think a csm would be needed to be official support of a eve council any mount of people can join the council and give much feedback as they like but only few players would run and reply to all ideas and feedback instead of allowing a small group run eve why not have support from csm ccp and allow much feedback thorough smaller groups of councils
i dont think we need more councils we do need morebetter organised playercsm chatsdiscussions than just on the forums
thats the point of this you need a pointed group to have better discussions of how things work and better input from players which other can read and not just shooting out ideas tho emails to hope things change for the best

pirates historically didnt destroy ships that risked killing a alrge part fo the crew adn turning the rest off the business and in a time like the age of pirates you needed all the emrchants on the water you could get the emre fact that most merchants knew surrendering meant surviving to make another trip actually encouraged them to surrender their cargo the second they saw the black flag historically the only pirates who ahd a real bad reputation for wholesale slaughtering of crews after surrendering were some of the female pirates

so sovholding alliance arent allowed to deny access to their sov by the common interloper through means of interdictionand who said nullsec was meant to be safe to get into
it is safe to get into so long as you bow before the banner of the major nullsec coalition of your choicelike seriously know how often i get tears adn i mean tears in local just from wandering in a group of maybe 3 frigates everyone docks up their pve ships and refuses to fight even when were outnumbered all cause they are scared that were past their great blue wallto be quite honest you guys need to start setting up more camps between lowhigh and null if it keeps going on like this all your ebars will quit and go cry in jita over how they cant make any isk in big scary nullthough i guess agtecamps wont do much against us whers unless we happen to accidentally happen across a combat system edit and by you guys i refer to more than just goons its a generalization towards a majority of nullsec

this doesnt make much senseyouve made a conscious choice to not be selective about your targets when you see something you think you can take you take it thats the benefit to your lifestyle you also benefit from noncriminal players taking pot shots at you and thereby becoming legal targets since youre simply defending yourselfwhile its true that you dont have the benefits of being in a militia you are also not encumbered by the target selection problem militia pilots bear you also have a lower barrier of entry in that you dont need to have any faction standing to start shooting random ships and you dont make yourself an enemy of any particular empire by fighting against iti do think you ought to be able to fly into highsec without any penalty other than the big red flashing that is your badge of honor  which you know would force players to police their own space once in a whilestorywise there is really no reason for any pirate faction to trust you you select random targets and blow them up  that doesnt make you more trustworthy to the criminal element it makes you either a competitor or someone to fearand finally the sansha are not pirates in the sense that youre thinking of them they are a society of slaves

there is a painful lack of basic information to answer the simple question how do we voteevelopedia has a lengthy discussion of the csm system and even a detailed analysis of the voting patterns by nation and gender and godknowswhatelse but nowhere is there any explanation of where to find the multiple expletives deleted ballot box no wonder you got only 12000 people voting out of a quartermillion active accounts nobody knows howwhy is there not a sticky at the top of this and every other csmrelated forum with a stepbystep explanation of the idiotproof variety telling just how we cast our votes for the csm candidate of our choicepardon me if i seem a bit incensed i just blew a half hour of my play time responsibly looking in all the right places for an answer to this very basic question and finding sweet fanny adams
when the elections go live you will get a popup on your login screen you know those things you normally ignore if you click it you will be taken to a webpage where you can cast your votesyou will also see a small news item on the character selection page on the right it will say what is happening and provide the necessary links to vote
great thank youbut that information still needs to be easily and readily available
take a fleet and kill the gatecampsso tired of people asking ccp to do the things they cantwont do for themselves
and why does there need to be more people in npc null and why does it need to be easier see safer to get into null
quick bump
as far as amarr goes youd think the stations in the capital of the golden empire would be a bit mroe extravagant let travelers know they just stepped into the hornets nest
as a character with industrial command 5 capital industrial 5 and industrial reconfig 5 i think its fine ultimately it is expensive yes but as others have stated there are pvp implants that are just as expensive and ultimately orcarorqual pilots really dont have as high a risk of getting podded as a guy in pvp implantsrorqualorca pilot needs one single implant pvp pilots can boost their fittingdmgtank with half a dozen different implants of varying price which they will loose and have to replace when they get podded i think thats fair
hijust a simple suggestion can we have ccp add shipnames to killmails makes it alot easier to find back where your ship could be if you miss it and forgot you got it killed also a benefit for tracking corp ships
one of the things thats always bothered me about eve is that the nomenclature of warships which seems to be based at least in part on late 20thearly 21st century naval usage has developed some aspects which are clearly not at all within that paradigm example rookie ship assault ship in current naval usage carrier has a specific technical meaning it refers to ships designed to carry combat aircraft in space terms ships designed to carry small combat craft not capable in eve terms of using jump gates too small to carry the necessary hardware as opposed to too big to fit through the gate i suppose if the majority of players in eve want to change the nomenclature so that this technical term doesnt mean that but instead means a vessel that carries as freight other vessels im going to have to live with it but i dont have to like it and i dontof course i also feel that eves carriers dont carry enough small craft while ignoring the very real problem of how many of the darn things are reasonable to have in a battle considering real computer power and the number of people available to control them ive also seen eve carriers described as giant logistics ships UFFFD logistics being another word that doesnt quite mean in eve the same thing it means in rl so perhaps carriers is the wrong word to apply to such ships in eve certainly if youre going to call ship haulers carriers youre going to have to come up with another term for what we now call carriersall that said i think the idea as expressed in the op is outstanding
bump for march feedbackfyithis document is once again being updated into a pi 30 version to incorporate allot of the changes weve seen implemented and are now familiar with since the dust open beta was releasedfeedback from pi 20 the fi forums topic beyond page 14 is also being processed and incorporated into the new version
lets get this going 1
quick fix remove the command processor module  the one that allows you to fit extra links to a shipbye bye offgrid linky strategic cruisersforces all non fleet command ships to only have one warfare link if you want more than three bonuses then you need the leadership chain in place with command ships at each level
anything that encourages boosters to fly with gangs is a good thing even a tier 1 battlecruiser roam can benefit from three boosters by making sure that the fleet wing and squadron commanders are sporting one ganglink a piece deciding which three bonuses each squadron needs to receive makes structuring fleets a more interesting exercisesimilarly when commanding a fleet you get to choose between primarying the logistics the ewar or the booster thats another interesting decision and interesting decisions are good for gameplay1 to this suggestion
bump to the top keep it going people
corppos management could do with a decent fixon the pos labs n manufacturing units it can be very simplegive them dedicated bays like you did with shipsjust make input blue print and output bay in a public and corp flavor where the corp one can be set to read only so ppl can install and deliver jobs but not take them they would be able to use the public ones for their personal stuff and make it so that the public slots can only be delivered by the person who installed the job and corp directorsthis would also open up to ppl having high sec pos renting out slots for isk
1 but i honestly dont see ccp working on this theyre way too efficient to look at something on the fringe like this unless they upgrade all station models at the same timeno offense to op just being realistic herping your derp since 19potato  url
did i just time travel back to the days of predominionthe stupid it burns
pos are just large ehp structures that take time to shoot and now instead of having 12 rf timers in a system you have 1 rf timer on every moon imo have only a few rf timers is a good thing having some is essential for tz warfare what sov needs is some element to encourage sustained activity in a system something that doesnt require a fleet but can be handled by a sinlge person and something that perhaps wont completely defendconquer sov but has a definitive effect on the sov game
thanks for the support mate lets keep this goingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 please implement bookmarks and document links into the pdf 96 pages as a plain pdf in this time of digital documents s just a painful read2 pi needs a revamp but should become a complete game within an already great game
i hope all future csm candidates take this cause up
who new all it took to get comments out of csms was a troll by one of their alliance mates puts all those weeks of silence into perspective
simple solution more taxes on all kinds of activitieshighsec  the fou empires take their cut from everything thats including corp taxes if you set up anybounties not implementedtrade in place needs increaseetc etclow same taxes are in place but to a much lower degree half of what empire taxesnull no tax and thats the beauty sov holding alliances now can tax whatever is done in their space be it ratting mining you name it and with different taxes to be set for different activities the sov holders can control on the kind of activities being conducted in specific systems constellations regions so for the most  best cost effectiveness people either have to move to low less taxes or find sov holders that welcome them with open arms to exploit their systems
i wanted to bring the following situation up for discussion  sorry if it has been mentioned before in another threadcurrently in large fleet fights target calling is usually done by pilot name that is easy to sort in the overview from a to z this brings a major disadvantage to all of us that chose a name starting with the first or last letters of the alphabet chances are you will be primaried in the first few minutes of the engagement and you will die this just because when you were a total noobie and signed up to play the game you had no clue that naming your character this way will bring you a lot of disadvantagessince it is not possible to change character name and fix this i think we should find a way for names not to display in fleet fights just giving everyone equal chances i cant think of a workaround for this matter but its really unfair to suffer such penalty if i knew this when i registered i would have named all my chars something like jldlndment just to always be in the middle of the fleet names  so with less chances to show on overview and with a really unpronounceable name so that everyone would avoid calling me a targetso i say make this fair for everyone so that everyone has same chancesidea once in fleet every pilot is assigned a number from 001250 regardless of his name ship type and everything would show as usual but his name wouldnt
this has to be one of the most pointless posts ive ever read on this forum which is saying a lotleaving aside the the many many things that really need fixing in this game and the matter of resource allocation do you actually believe that most fcs call targets alphabetically over situationally as the fight develops just when you thought the signal to noise ratio of these forums couldnt get any worse you get proved wrongi really hope your trolling
you may choose any 1 option from the list belowa play eveb play a game with a sense of fair playchoose wisely
u just described every single pilot in eve everyone can do what a 10 can lol and a 10 can do almost nothing that others canand i never said sansha that are pirates i said that like this sansha hubs can be done toopirate factions dont have to trust me they get me a mission to kill militia if i deliver it i am rewarded pirates and factions are in war so every bit helps and to nariya i really dont get what u are trying to point out the reason of your post
security status is determined by concord and has nothing to do with the influence on standings between players and npc corporations just like earning the trustbetter agent missions for the empire npc corps you need to earn the trust of the pirate npc corps by shooting red crossesunless you can provide a justification for implementing a radically different system for pirate npc corpsnomilitia space is still controlled by the empires and monitored by concord why would they stand by and let filthy pilots lay claim to permanent digs in their space what purpose does interfering with the militias serve for the pirate factions and those mechanics would be
well how about dropping the stats on the command modules then give the fleet boosting command ships a role bonus that would make them 300 more effective when on grid that would also give the commandship class descriptions more sense
back to the top  like the main post if you agree
cost is a lousey tool for balancing ships ccp realised this a long time ago and so should youand what about the titan that gets tackled by a roaming gang that only has one hictor first thing the titan does is doomsday the hictor then laugh at the bs while he caps up and jumps out should they lose their chance at a super kill just because you think titans should be able to wave their dicks at subcaps again as for your just bring another hictor arguement i think expecting small gangs to be psychic and know everything theyll come across on their roams before they even see them is a little bit on the stupid side the reason the ability to doomsday subcaps was removed in the first place was because if anything it made it harder for titans to die not easier even if you have a substantial number of tacklers with support if titans are involved the defenders will have support as well and its hard enough keeping hictors and dictors alive in regular fleet fights let alone situations where every ten minutes x number of them die x equaling number of hostile titans with no chance of stopping it
paragraph one sorry lack of planning on your part does not constitute a right to a titan loss on their part you dont bring the right tools you loose oh well go away and find more targets you are prepared for should we just let ships fit the whole toolbox because they might come across a golden unicorn with a rainbow fart in space guess what htfu and deal with itparagraph two yes that was the case it was a nerf to counter an issue as was the original buff to bring titans to play in fleets as the first buff was an overbuff the subsequent nerfcannon was an overnerf and titans have once again returned to the refuge of pos shields as they once were guess what now they have a pretty pos ornament again the real fix lies somewhere between hence the discussion of altering the doomsdays to lie somewhere between just because you tackle a titan doesnt mean it should be a guaranteed kill you have to work for it and you have to give the titan a chance to escape to make it a fair fight instead of a cow in a pen to be slaughtered for the glory of your killboard on a slightly related side note perhaps titans need another role something they are a bit more suited to to bring them back out on the field and to deal with the fleet boost issue give the titans the role of command capital if command links are going to be nerfed to grid only give titans the ability to fit 3 command links reduce the turret slots to 3 instead of 6 increase the gun damage to compensate and give the titan a 5 per level command bonus the command ships have now for a capital command link increase current command ships to 4 and move t3 command ships to 3 this will help bring titans back to the feild and provide an active role to make them want to stay on grid to risk themselves
that actually would not be a bad idea but i would say leave the turrets alone or if you reduce the turret slots increase the damage output to match that of a dread but in fairness when titans had thier aoe dd thats all they did was aoe dd or provide bonuses in pos shields and to be fair why would i risk a titan for fleet boosting when i will get 1 less by using a command ship that not even a 1 of the cost of a titan not to mention that a bonus toon has the mind link in its head titans will always have their armor implant in their head something that takes years to skill for should be able to wave their dicks at people anyone who catches a titan these days has someone on the batphone low sec pirates 00 alliances and even wormhole corps soo all it takes is 1 bubble and to completely negate your argument hictors are rarely used in 00 unless its in a fleet of 60 ships hictors are really only used for roaming gangs in lowsec and last time i checked dictors are cheap and i see them on roams all the time not just 1 but more like 34 and if 34 dictors cant keep a titan or any super for that matter tackled long enough to get reinforcements then your doing it wrong
i love the ideaeve needs more monumental displays of raw power and scale
agreed it should be huge with half finished ships since its a naval assembly plant add space docks like on the ship construction arrays etc
theres a large body of paying customers that dont get to play much for a variety of reasons many of them keep their accounts active during these periods simply to keep up  not catch up and not advance faster but to maintain advancement with those who are able to play morethose who end up in these situations vary across the years as different people have kids cutting into their play time job changes etc alts are common and the you dont need to log in with them all the time there is a very healthy amount of accounts that burn up extremely small server resources as they only log in occasionally yet pay for the same full access as everyone elseall your suggestion would do is remove all that income from ccp if they arent keeping up they wont pay for their accounts and that will end the use of those accounts  which then cuts funding of development etc
or try flying with decent fcs where they sort by shiptype and broadcast your targets az calling is so 2008
honestly sometime soon i would love it if different stations actually had the scale and visual appearance of what they are supposed to be looks weird to be at a naval yard with no yard

tho i have been inactive for quite some time it appears that in the meantime ccp has authorized a program called isboxer for people to be used appearently this software allows multiple accounts to react to a single accountive entered a system and saw 80 accounts all with the same name and they were mining ice must i remind ccp that during the early years they declared war on macro mining and that everyone even doing it for a second was banned with the use of isboxer even if the accounts were paid for they most probably were still just farming isk and sold it for real life money how the hell can i take ccp serious if they allowed such thingsthe use of multiple accounts is allowed but by allowing programs like these you submit to the fact that you will never win against isk selling that is not the ccp that i used to know what happened from the early days of eve till now that made ccp allow isk selling is it the constant line of active accounts on the servers is it the declining interest in the game start advertising on tv would be a great start get lady googoo to say i love my spaceship do you and suddenly 5 million of her followers will start playing eve
instead of whining to ccp about behavior they already endorsed perhaps you could consider killing them allif you brought this up in the crime and punishment forums and named the player and the systems they were in there might be players interested in exhumer loot
noanswer me thesewhat does those 80 single accounts gain that cannot be gained by another 80 solo accountswhat is the difference in cost between the 80 single player accounts and the 80 solo oneswhat happens if both the 80 single and solo players leaves their pc for over an hour whilst miningdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
we are not talking about 80 single accounts im talking about 1 player having the ability to have as many accounts as he want all working at the same time 1 player could topple a market faster than just 5 players mining together prices would become too imbalanced and other players would gain less out of it by doing so in this case ice mining 1 player lowers the prices of ice dramatically tho this is perfect for those who buy ice but those who sell it are forced to move to another region to gain anything from italso this could help isk farmers gain their isk faster and then sell it to people for real life money sooner as 1 player could make as many accounts as he wants then devide the isk sold to other accounts who then sell it off this tactic used by isk sellers is legal as only the account selling the isk directly is getting banned
10
you were talking about 80 accounts but i see you didnt answer the questions merely started down the strawman routeas you avoided answering ill take it you agree there is no difference ok moving on thendestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
80 x more ice per hour per playerjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
ccp has stated this app is allowed it is not macro because a human must be at the keyboard to send commands even tho those commands are repeated across more then one account isboxer is legit non macro app that works for lots of games and across those other games they are also allowed and not considered macros cheats or hacksyour problem is that isk made could potentially be sold for real world money any source of isk making that goes beyond the characters immediate need could inevitably sold for real world money so lets remove incursions level 5 mission running all 00 gravimetric plexes oh and wormholes too that way no one can have any amounts of isk with any amounts of accounts with isboxer or manually that could potentially be sold nah that wouldnt fly would itif market forces are what you are worried about then how can you expect 80 pilots doing any singe task at a time giving them the ability to tip the eve market on their own even if they do have some small effect then that means others who are also farming ice will move to mining other things in other systems or regions and the market will balance outjust because someone has 80 accounts btw screenshot or your just bsing this must mean they are selling real isk those alts probably do pi too and fuel towers somewhere in deep 00 any extra isk made might end up going to pay for plexes for those 80 accounts witch by the way would require 44b isk a month in a way they already sell isk if they use plex to manage their account they are essentially turning 44b isk a month in to 1196usd and using that to pay their accounts already that is the type of isk selling ccp likes and makes a profit off ofif you see it as such a problem then do something about it rather then just posting on a forum go war dec them or gank them several hundred losses over a month then it would become more of a hassle then it is worth to them and they will sell off the toons and stop take the path that creates content for other pilots just like other pilots have done in the past rather then bitching about it on the forumsrant
maybe hes not an isk farmer but earns isk to fuel his addiction for losing capital shipsthere are also industrial players who own freighter accounts by the hundreds but those are harder to notice should we disallow them to their isk could just as easily be channeled into rwtif you feel something is unfair shoot it until youre satisfied
the effective income remains the same that person with 80 accounts has to plex those 80 accounts which takes the same amount of time as a player with 1 account
macro mining and the use of isboxer to broadcast keystrokes are two separate things macroing by definition is an automated process that does the job of the enduser by automatically executing repetitive tasks isboxers broadcasting of keystrokes does not automate the process of doing things it simply makes the process easier to do across multiple accounts macroing allows for individuals to perform repetitive tasks without being present at the keyboard aka botting isboxer still requires the person to be at the keyboard and engaging with the client programrmt is a completely separate issue and is handled by ccps security investigation process macroing is not limited to just rmt scenarios the issues are two complete topics unto themselves and should be discussed as such not lumped together in a hissyfit
did you miss the other questionsif we apply your line of approach we get the following answers to 2 and 32 80 x more cost per month3 they stop miningyou could have simply answered the question instead of attempting to make a point but the trouble with that point was that you avoided the question that made it pointless i e number 2destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
they dont earn ice at a faster rate  pilot than anyone else isboxer is not the problem the problem is ice doesnt deplete if those ice roids popped regularly then multiboxing 80 clients would become very inefficient andor tedious

tho this would most probably cause under marketing throughout eve i would like it if it could be discussed wether or not jump bridges could be allowed throughout eve using the market hubs dodixie jita rens amarr as the 4 possible systems against a tollerable fee you could even give it a story like an npc corporation has been able to make an agreement with all 4 factions and that theyre allowed to use the latest tech in stargate bridges that the 4 trade hubs were allowed to built a 3way jump portal to the other trade hubs however to cover the extensive costs for building them and maintaining all users are required to pay certain number for their sizesas the under marketing thingy as these jump portals would allow freighters through they would have to pay quite alot to use them but it would still be far less than what trade corporations are offering per jump so it could supress the costs of transporting huge amounts of stuff from 1 trade hub to another this could also mean that prices of the 4 trade hubs would become more normalized instead of jita being as cheap as hell they all could have an equal price tho traders wouldnt like this as the jump bridges are only allowed for the trade hubs the regions outside of them should see only minimal changes in price
wellsince freighter pilots would probably be the biggest users of them i bet it would be an awesome place to sit with a scanning alt and suicide gankersor you could just use the thingys that let you jump between systems already in the gamei think someone the other day called them star gates or somethingand as for shipping marketing goodsinstantly between hubs why not ask for ccp to implement eveexthe eve version of fedex so for a fee you can ship stuff from jita to rens balance the markets and not have to work transporting it at all110
as i said traders will not like this idea and will therefor only be negative about it predictable those who wants to easily run between trade hubs buying stuff from 1 trade hub and another or move quickly between trade hubs that might be closer to a fightfor pvp it could also work out like an alliance wardeccing another alliance and trying to stationcamp them they are in dodixie station camp there then a member notices they are all at rens without the enemy alliance to react towards it they are already station camped
i agree the jita station should look like something that could actually hold multiple freighter sized ships perhaps it could also be a stations first to have multiple exits this could also counteract the station camping a little more
its really annoying when i try to set destination to my jump clones stations you might ask why would i do this when you can jump there i got a few reasons and i am sure any player who has played for sometime has the same issues1 to check the no of jumps from current location to see if its worth jumping or just burn through gates implant differences2 to check the no of jumps from the jump clone station to a particular system to know if jumping will reduce my transit times those two were the main problems for me i agree this is by no means useful but since ccp does those little thingies i hope they put this feature in one of the patches
damage you directly inflict to others logdamage you directly get from others logdamage your drones inflict to others logdamage your drones get from others if damage your drones receive would also be displayed and logged it would be easier to see if someone aggroed your dronesbe easier to see aggro changes in pveallow to track damage your drones receiveit might not be a big thing but if someonesomething attacks my drones i would like to see it the same way i see every other damage i receive or inflict it is illogical the way it is now
the large coalitions do not benefit the average player in 00 they reduce all those emergent types of game play that people go to 00 for if you say it doesnt then you are just another mindless drone or a empire noob that has no idea what 00 used to be like now a days you have 10 alliances per coalition you have no alliance identity what so ever while inside of the coalition other then how many pilots you can field in what time zones you can fight for the coalition and the hand full of key leadership you have to convey your alliances abilities and intent to the coalition if your pvp pilots fall short on participation requested ships or if one of those key leadership makes a mistake or an enemy then your entire alliance is at jeopardythe alliances identity is further stripped by the fact you will almost always fly under only one or two fcs and most often are both apart of only one of the ten or so alliance in the coalition the fits for these fights are limited and pilots are required to train for those ships and fits to even be involved in pvp at all these fleet fits can change drastically and leave you forced to change skill queues that can be as long as 60 days to start anotherif someone does directly challenge your alliance by camping your station attacking a moon mining control tower placing an sbu in your system or attacking any of your in space assets then its far safer to dock up and wait until a coalition fc comes on and get in a 500 man fleet then to risk forming a fleet inside your alliance with an alliance fc then losing the fight and looking bad to the coalitionit is stale old it is exactly what the average pilot doesnt want and it needs to change if the leadership of these alliances are not willing to break up the coalitions then it is our fault and not ccps if we really want ccp to prevent the ability for power blocks to form then the options are very limitedthe fixremove the ability to assign standings for anything other then war target faction war target fleet pilot to pilot corp alliance and faction limiting the corporation skill benefits to limit maximum corp and alliance sizes remove moon mining as the onlymain source of t2 production income an increased cost of sov managementthe outcomealliances lose the trillions isk income they get from moons so they must rely more on the abilities of their pilots to maintain a fleet of pvp ships but the income that moons brought to an alliance wallet in the past now ends up in the individuals wallet insteadalliance size and wallet shrinks then the ability to hold large sum of systems are made more difficult making way for other entities that can in turn add to the emergent game play we all look foralliances lose the ability to share assets like jump bridges and outposts coalitions lose a great deal of ability to work together also splits a coalitions assets and pilots forcing them to rely on titan bridging witch have a much shorter range then the current jump bridge networks creating more traffic between more systems and making it more difficult to defend logistic routes this adds more to the emergent game play as it allows for those systems and gates to be camped to stop traffic towers become alliance only entities with no password options available to allow friendlies more towers are needed to support bigger coalitions towers can become locations where fights happen as fleets breakup after leaving the field to safe up you could still have nips and alliances can still work together but without the ability to filter friendlies from the overview on the battlefield it becomes more difficult the more friends you have anything beyond a full fleet of friendlies on the field becomes a problem unless you can tightly control positioning on the field and keep fleets of friendlies separatedless likely to have those 2k battles with 20 alliances on the field and the sole crushing tidi fewer instances of tidi means fewer chances to advantage of it to reship or phone for more help from friends more fights are started and finish without major escalation and blobbing then their is now forcing alliances to be able to stand on their own two feet and rely on friends that live closer byi would personally prefer we as players take it upon ourselves to break up the coalitions but if the leadership of these alliances wanna blame ccp then this is the only realistic way it can be done

feel free to flame as i dont actually know much about titan dooms day devices but i figure they each get one type and because we like having something different for each they should each function differently each one would have a charge up period allowing pilots to move out of the way of the damage the aoe would be done differently for each charge time would need to be balanced around 1045 seconds or sothe amarr dd would be a giant beam heading in a straight line out from the ship it would gather energy which would have a visual effect while it is charging the beam would do approx 75k15k dps over 10 seconds realigning the ship would wave the beam over an area any sig radius caught inside the path of the beam would take damage the larger the sig radius the more damage it would takethe gallente would be a single powered shot with a burst upon impact it would be fired from a large dd emplacement on the ship which when preparing to fire would come out of the ship similar to how a bomb launcher comes out when exiting warp the shot would be for high dps on a single target with a moderate burst upon impact causing aoe damage around the targetted ship any ships in the line of fire take full damage from the shot reduced only slightly by sig size it is a much smaller attack then the amarrian dd so it is less likely to hit ships on the way in thus more damage if they get hit the aoe damage would be similar to a bomb with a similar radius so 510k damage around the targeted ship likely split between kinetic and thermal damagethe caldari would be a very large missile with high damage and large aoe basically a giant bomb its charge would be a bomb launcher or missile launcher opening with the warhead getting primed in addition it would have travel time and could be destroyed if targeted the reason for this is balance as this will pose the largest threat to fleets it would deal 4075k damage depending on how close you are to the blast it would not have its damage reduced by sig radius but rather distance from the center of the blast so burning away would be the only way to reduce damage whether or not it is launched like a bomb or targeted im not quite sure same for this weapons ehp to be viable in fleet battles but still balancedthe minmatar dd would be a large flack attack and the only one with aoe that wouldnt damage allied ships caught in the way it would be a large flak style attack within 15km of the ship its charge would be shown by having dozens of autocannon type guns coming out of its model when fired the flak damage would deal 1k4k dps to all ships not in fleet over the course of 1525 secondseach fits their race and has its own strengths and weaknesses and situations to be used hopefully without being too under or over powered and each would be highly valuable in a fleet battleagain i could also just have no idea what i am talking about in which case call me a noob and move on 
i seem to remember back in the day goons hated blue lists they have done more global resets then any other alliance in the game now they suddenly are afraid what would happen if standings were goneall this talk about sov warfare being such a chore it is a chore because of how big the coalitions have gotten the bigger coalitions get the more difficult sov warfare gets its not rocket science their is no way that ccp can make sov warfare on the coalition level when it involves coalitions made up of tens of thousands of pilots any easier then it already iscoalitions strip so much away from an alliances individuality they are basically just big alliances now coalitions have 23 fcs between thema coalition wide unified set of fleet concepts share coms for fleet engagementsshare access to outpostsshare intel channelsshare fleet accessshared jump bridge networkshared number of moons whos output has a shared agreed upon sale priceisk made being used in srps that buy the same materials from the same place and use the same route to get the materials to the same outpost for pilots to reship with for the next day of 00 warfare how do you tell them apartsov i guess and some coalitions even share that

sorry about all your dead lokisi realise its distressing for you to form a bluelist coalition of your own made up of all the washedup sovstomped failures and then get dumpstered when you try and mess with the big boys but demanding that ccp completely change the way eve works is really not a rational solution to your own failings
nice giant strawman post not ignoring the fact that most of your points on coalitions are in fact hilariously wrong
lets hope some of the ideas i posted in this thread will be in the next expansion  odyssey

wont happen againi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you may be plesantly surprised the problem i see with allowing dds to hit subcaps again is they were primarily used on interdictors so they could escape this resulted in remote tracking titans becoming a popular fleet concept which resulted in a nerf because frankly why should capital class turrets ever be able to 1shot a frigate with a transveral of 3kms the other problem is creating a good reason for people to actually use themtitans will most likely get their change at the end of fozzies ship rework hes done a great job with the changes so far so we need to wait  see what he has in store for them it might take awhile but id rather see them get a great rework that fits in with the other changes than change them now  be in the same position in 6 months time
wow i really like this post it was really well though out and was not the normal zerg of  posting that goons are known for thank you for your response mallak
so far you have not posted one idea in these forums that is not poorly thought outjump bridges have already ruined nullsec by making it too small now you want to make highsec small toolets just take out factions and 90 of the systems i eman people dotn use them much outside of traveltime rightall this would do is encourage players to cluster themselvs around these gates leaving highsec to be a similar state as null lots of highpopulation systems and vast swathes of unsued spaceso seriously no to making highsec smaller yes this response is a little cut short and might have reiterated too much but im typing on a time contraint currently walking to the car to go to work which im late for

anyone else wanna help support this proposaldmc
yes bring it back there were certain eve songs i actually like and i would play them to get me in a spacey mood i dont understand why they would take away this feature if they didnt have a better replacement 
personally i think there is nothing else to day i mean you are pretty much correctin the past it made sense to do what they did i remember back in iac when a was dding everything under the sunnow days no one buys titans unless their alliance needs a portable jump bridge and alot of times they just bat phone someone who does have a titan alreadyeither they need to be given some glory again or they need to come down in price to about 5060b
it wouldnt really have that big of an effect on markets since we have had fedex delivering goods for ages changing things to be near instantaneous would just damp the noise that small fish make the real manipulators and market makers would be unscathed1 for anything that limits fun killing game mechanics though 60 clicks and 45min to get across the map is not fun emergent play its just another useless grind that has to be done for those that do not have the means to use cynoshortcuts before your allowed to do anything entertaining its like making people enter 30 captcha in a row in order to accept a mission from an agentif ccp thought jbs were actually detrimental they would have taken the opportunity to nerf them the last time a vocal minority threw a hissy fit what is good for the goose is good for the gander
the op is frankly laughable you wont abolish coalitions by banning standings any better than you could ban war by making it illegal alliances existed in the game long before ccp formalized them coalitions came to being almost instantly after alliances did and that was back when mechanics for alliances were cumbersome and difficult they still are but we know how to use them now the war against ascn early coalition warfare people talk about the dawn of coalitions as if its a new thing its popular right now because its next to impossible for an alliance to hold by its self the vast amount of space required to support it truth be told alliances like goonswarm are clamoring for the 00 mechanics to be fixed so they dont have to hold hundreds of star systems to afford their titans and slowcat fleetscoalitions naturally limit their size by the fact that you cant get the egos of 10 alliance ceos to fit into the same chat channel if you shrunk 00 so a single solar system could be as profitable as a constellation is now and scaled the sov cost accordingly many of these larger entities would shrink down to a more reasonable size and there would be plenty of space for newer players to fight over the newly vacated systems the coalitions arent the problem nor are they even a symptom of the problem theyre just fine
heres the problem the people in the large coalitions are the average 00 player
the latest big war that didnt happen and the talk about wargames etc just makes me think that  for whatever reason  null is falling into stagnation the big boys and their coalitions often scream about the burn out theyd suffer if a real war happened but i see that as a good thing why should the current top few dominating personalities or groups remain at the top forever if they start to burn out then it gives fresh faces and groups a chance to shine current null is all about maintaining the status quo and theyll use whatever excuse they can to hide the fact that they want everything to stay exactly the same and they dont want real conflict because its a risk
we just discovered that someone with starbase defense operator role can use the pos guns to shoot the pos stick other defensive modulesi could not find this issue listed anywhereit is not a game breaking issue as once the pos goes into reinforce it will be invulnerable from further fire which should hopefully give the owners a chance to defend itcheersdark armata
sounds like a feature to me not a problem
ok though this has likely been said beforemacro mining and the use of multiboxing tools are two very separate thingsone is a pure automation tool the other allows one player to control multiple accountsthe difference is that one allows a person to log in turn their miner on then go out  to sleep  watch a movie etc while the other requires that the person still put in the commands manually though they can do so on multiple accounts simultaneouslybotting and macro mining is banned because it is an automation toolmultiboxing is not its a very fine line between the two granted but it is a distinction that has to be made
so basically what youre saying is youre too poor to afford the number of alts required for this sort of thing and therefore since you cant have the ball noone can have it so you throw it on the roof and go home and cry to mummy
the funny thing is that 00 has been mostly divided between 4 or 5 coalitions pretty much permanently since 2003 but its only today that this has become an eve is dying bloobloobloo problem
maybe an alternative to shrinking systems would be enlarging the mapthen everyone would have to fight for new land again and itll take 500 jumps to get to that coalition fight instead of 50 making geography somehow more relevant in coalition politics spam new systems until the time it takes to get from one power bloc to the other can be measured in daysalso add more lowsec to sever the 4 empires from each other sever the carebear daisy chain of easy freight give war a chance
no offense but i think your solution will not fix the problem i too want to anonymize nullsec but i think the best solution to do so is by changing the intel system id prefer to replace local with an intel system that doesnt immediately show you the name of every pilot in local something where you have to fly in space to determine who that new ship is
have you ever actually gone on a roam making nullsec bigger wont help fix the problems a lot of fcs myself included dont have the time or desire to go the 4060 jumps required to even make contact with an opposing gang let alone find a fight miniaturizing 00 is a much more viable and entertaining solution
thank you for sharing this feature that i previously had no idea existed

finally a sensible idea in assembly hall  well doneperhaps each base station could have two or three upgrades depending on player activity volume based on a 30 day averagetotal or whatevermake new eden a bit more dynamic even if its only eye candy
they could just make another category of racial station models larger ones and autoapply them to the ones that see x amount of traffic or abovemaking one just for jita would be a bit extravagant but i agree with the ideacould come along with station v3 which you know is scheduled and everything
if i recall correctly ccp was looking into making stations modular in some way adding or taking away a block or two depending on its average traffic and internal populationits been awhile since i heard that though maybe they are waiting for the v3 project to be finished andor dx11 to become more widely used

having come from wow where multiboxing by 40 isnt as uncommon anymore to see it has followed into eve is sad for players i was hoping with a macro ban multibox software like that wasnt allowed isbox and other macro yes they are macro programs multibox software are a bane to mmos as they allow so many players to act in unison with 1 click no one cares if its 2 or 3 accounts its the 40 variety that is the problem i dont have a problem with these programs for a few at a time its after seeing them pollute mmos with their presence to know 40 multiboxers are alive and well that is a concern to me imagine them running pvp fleets  1 player behind the wheel talking about game imbalance in wow such multiboxers literally own pvp battlegrounds no chance to win put them in a fw or null fleet its the same results would take a blob to defeat them because of the concentrated firepower 1 click can offera huge blob couple players like that could own territory even1 support from multiple mmo experience dealing with that tomfooleryin a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act  george orwell

like the ideai would prefer it integrated into some ccp upgrade to stations universally thoughdynamic station models based on their activity something like 5 tiersif ccp finally decides to get rid of the old npc building slots it could also be linked to the number of player owned slots rented to the stations with visuals of npc ships moving from the stations to the planets related to the player owned moonsthus linking pos  stations and pi together in one nice trinity
i think this idea have been around in variations before but thought it might need a fresh cyclebasically i would like ccp to once and for all get rid of the old station production slot mechanics its getting old and boringthe optimal way to get a whole range of player activity and game content from a rather simple solution would look something like thislink pos research and production slots directly into stationsso players can directly rent the slots and player controlled prices to other players with the station as the middle manthis way the size of pos in systems would be directly linked to station activity and actual dynamic prices would be a natural resultthis would also mena that ccp would not need to tweak or change station facilities they would simply be build by players according to needs and price finding mechanicsrenting to station would ofc demand an office also offices should get a standing based deduction in rent so grinding standing would have another added dimensionthis way local starsystem composition would start making a direct impact on game activity more moons would mean more competition on slot prices and thus cheaper research and production also smaller would mean potential wars with a clear goalshould something like this become real a boost to maximum pos sizes might be needed so pos could have quite a lot of more installations running to support the capacity needed in the systemthe balance would develop by itself since small number of moons would mean bigger pos in system and thus potentially bring higher traffic in fuels and components giving some new targets to potential aggressionmore details can be added to this idea but the basics is the above i believe its something we really need to also make null industry really interesting and lucrative since a system like this could make null interesting for new types of renters or allies
ive been hitting the report isk spammer on each one i see seems to be working latelysummary of eves last four expansions
ive noticed there is a lack of information on system names constellations and so onsystems like sahtogas have an actual little information panel although a bit vague to its meaning i feel as if when you show info there should be some sort of info there on the main screen about that system ie jita has information about it being a market hub luminaire have information about its significance and so on even constellations could have a little more information about significant eventspeople living in those areas i think this would be relatively simple addition and could really add to the immersion of the gamei also think that faction weaponsmodules should have some sort of mention of who they come from as well as storyline items i apologize if this is not the proper areaway of proposing something like this or if it has been proposed before i feel as if this would be a simple thing to add to the game and could be a good way to add more immersion to the game and meaning to certain systems and modules thank you

well if we can overcome the financial hurdles considering how heavily the entire market system is based on the already established facts perhaps there should then be talks of how to limit ccps manhour investments and how this would benefit the growth of the game as a whole
a pos overhaul is something that is strongly supported and i think even ccp is seriously focused on that now this is a concept that would change many things with rather little complexity change to the backend of the gamea lot of architecture to a system like this seem to have already been on the table in the early code something that shows on dead functions in the station and standing functionsonce the link between pos pi and station is implemented a lot of potential new aspects will be a lot easier to add to the game thus a feature like this could help a lot on ccp manhours in the long run
yes it wouldediti heard some one say interbusi said storyline so this could really help this game
a logical step that many might really appreciate would be creating a link between pi and pos just something as simple as being able to export materials from planets remotely to your own pos that would then again make it possible for corp members to access the materialssome rather awesome pospi and station networks could result from functionality moving in this directioni would also find it worth considering to let corp members or alliance members remote control planet activity from within pos anchored at moons of the specific planet pithis would create a lot of new potential roles that could then in future ccp work get new skills or toolsif pi to pos and pos to pos moving of items could be automated and remote access sort of like an player interbus system then the next logical step could be creating contract types that temporarily granted access through pos shields for a specific player and shiptype industrials mining ships and similarwith temporary access functionality this could then easy move into null sec activity for rental and standing functionalitysince the aggression of automated systems like pos could be added to ships also so parked ships could also have a simple autoaggression functionality maybe even limited script basedwith autoaggression functions and new fleet function like convoys would suddenly be an optionwhich brings another aspect of this relinquish control to fleet leader or wing leader etc thus making afk a sort of seminpc state the skills would limit how many player ships could be controlled on behalf of players the interface would be something simplified like that for dronesso again many natural progression options from simple initial changes
the whole pos system needs to be redefinedposes are usually corp assets and really need to be associated with the corp office like a pos section there can monitor the pos and handle the blueprintsfuelmanfacturingresearchinvention from that uidoesnt make sense to have corp offices when theyre not used for such activities eve needs more of an unified ui not more screens to get lost in 1920x1080 monitor filled with boxes shudderin a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act  george orwell
if you are flying distribution missions and you accidentally try to undock after accepting the mission but before you moved the cargo into your cargobay you get a message that says are you really sure that you would like to undock without your cargothis is obviously a game mechanic designed to help the mission runner i imagine it might be quite frustrating to make your delivery and realise at the end that your cargo is still at the starting locationproposal 1upgrading clones if you get podded and you have successfully reached a station with clones and you try to undock the game warns you if your clone isnt upgradedproposal 2if you are clicking on the abort mission button the game pops up a warning window which tells you that aborting a mission is bad for youi propose that the game auto calculates for you how much standing you are going to loose if you abort a mission ive lost 3 days work because i thought i would loose only a little amount of standing instead ive lost quite a loti know that the community is split on these kinds of issues there are a few who think these are bad game mechanics and should be removedreworkedand than there are some who say l2p n00b or gtfoobjective sighted target locked lasers activated pewpewpew die roid die
so that people can learn skills based on insurance so that they can make it a viable isk making business in eve you could have it so that you can insure peoples ships based on character activity with a set of conditions to stop people doing insurance jobs on there ships etc
im sure this could not possibly hurt the new player experience one bit
only to those who dont have the time only those who want to always be top of the skill sp curve by longevity and protecting turfbiggest problem is only one toon for account can skill up so to get around that limitation we have multiple accounts looks good on the 500000 active accounts summary but the truth is we have more than one account to have alts other mmos allow players to level their alts anyway they chose be it more time in game which is a reward with having players ingame populating it or casually playing 2hrs a nighti personally would prefer more work  more rewardshow thats done  and without bots ruining it for everyone  i dont know but if players want to put more time in than waiting for paint to dry to skill up why should they be punished for the status quodont want eve to become like other mmos racing to endgame in 3 days but allows the 2 other alts on an account to be able to be leveled other accounts can be for helpers as needed or to raise toons to resell as theres always a demand for more leveled toons as it is the other 2 slots are wasted as stalling the leveling among 3 toons on one account is just pushing get more accounts scheme and encouraging more accounts with less people playingin a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act  george orwell
signed specifically for the fw context as a way to discourage farmers the problem with the arguments above is that there is no disadvantage to a farmer who fits them to his ship he has no intention of fighting so who cares about the reduction in scan res etc i have no problem if i miss a travelfit ship because of stabs  good use of game mechanics to make him safer but the only use of stabs in fw is to farm simple as that sure it would only be a minor discouragement but it would sure make it more tolerable for the pvpers in fw regions
totally agreei only do fw so that i can shoot people i do not care about ccps rewards nor for artificial reasons to fight i dont need reasons to fight in fw since fighting is the reason to be thereall other priorities and opinions are wrong and should be nerfedamidoinitwright
it is awesome that we now have our orders visible via the marking option but it would be even more awesome if we could have the option to mark corp ordersadditionally i think that those with directoraccountant roles should have the ability to modify corp ordersi realise this is not a high priority as the number of corps which have vast numbers of corp orders active is likely to be very small but like with the highlighting our own orders it is a small change which would make life for those of us who have lots of corp orders much simpler
admittedly i do not have a lot of experience with null and sov conquest recently but i wanted to share an analogy for a suggestionbasically thinking of sov as a meter much like in incursions or as known from other games the way i would like this to work in eve is as followsthe two opposing forces or for that matter 3 or more is represented by a barrel on a seesaw the barrel is filled with water by different entities in the system and this at different frequenciesthus a tcu would add a lot of weight but with slow frequency a lot of small frigs drip faster but smaller amounts rof the barrels drains at rising increments so it basically looses more water due to pressure from being more full so all entites ships according to size pilots in stations stations owned pos active etc would all add to the sov points frequency the interesting aspect would be if only anchoring new structures actually changed so you could end up having some sort of shared sov compositions in systems basically allow small system and constellation ranged strategy to developwith such partial sov sleeping or dormant powers could suddenly shifttoo add a benefit too sov i would think station docking and gatejumping fees would be adequate also pi transaction fees ofc
okay ive been thinking about something i could add to this without it looking like a hollow bump as isd was kind enough to advise me that i was borderline breaking rules so with that i have come to a decision regarding the envoyclass shipsif they were designed there would be absolutely no need for a jumpcapable version as carriers fill that role nicely but when it comes to highsec logistics there is still a gap sure theres always the courier contract but why the  should you have to go through that which when youre moving enough stuff gets extremely tedious to move your own stuff the answer quite simply is that you shouldnt there is no justifiable reason for it and to the get an orca camp lets see you attempt to move all of your rigged battleships in an orca some people multispec in their training and thus have several different ship types and other than the orca not having the ship maintenance bay to haul battleships you are also severely limited as to how many ships you can fit into itso with that i am not saying that we as pilots of new eden want or desire this i am saying we the pilots of new eden need thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
what is the point of all these in game professions if all players need to do is swipe the credit card and buy plex out of game then sell it in game for 500 million isk it really takes away the edge of losing a ship and allows players to be more careless and unrealistic in pvp since they know that their isk grows on trees there is no pride in your profession whether its salvaging mining or piratinglooting since all you have to do is just buy more isk when you run out i believe that the selling of plex should be removed from the game
no plex is probably one of the smartest things ive seen an mmo do in every other mmo people have to buy game money from rmt traders if they want a quick step up here it is much easier to legitimately do it and support ccp rather than some chinese criminal enterprise which reduces the number of rmt accounts wrecking the economy it also rewards players who dedicate time in the game by letting them play for free name one other mmo that you can pay ingame currency for game timeas for people who waste isk on ship after ship full of shinywell being a pirate i say bring it onthere is nothing like catching an entirely blinging mission runner trying his luck in low secmoney can buy ships but it dont buy skill
there should be no quick steps up period plex or otherwise you dont legalize crime to prevent crime metaphorically speaking and i am fine with purchasing plex with in game isk just not selling it in game to other players it should be purchased directly from ccp with in game money it should have no in game resell value
how you think you gonna get that plex to be able to buy with in game money doing it your way means ccp doesnt get anything for the ingame plex and would therefore lose money just like it would through rmt
so your saying your fine if ccp take isk their intellectual property as trade for plex their monetary property and then let you trade it for game time or aur you do realize that players who sell plex are paying slightly more than a monthly subscription in real life currency to ccp for the plex in your model ccp is trading their property for their property and giving away game time so you can play free and they dont get paidif they followed that advice we would be out of a cool space ship gameand it is not legalizing crime plex ensures that the exchange of rl money for intellectual property goes to the owners of that property not some botscamming account hacking game ruining company that has no intrest in making eve a better game they are just looking to make a fast dollar on players who have more rl money than time trust me im not so well set in rl that i can plex my way to financial bliss either but if by its existance i dont get spammed by rmt traders like i did in wow eq2 and swg ill accept it ive played the game a long time now and have not seen a case where plex offbalanced the game other than providing some awesome km from pilots who confused shiney with invincible
stupid idea oh if it makes people more careless to loose expensive ships i cant see what is the problem with that i prefer that wayeasier and more targets with better loot  what better thing you could ask for  o
let me tell you what would happen in my instance if they stopped plex salesi would immediately go down to 1 account 15 a month i can kinda justify for a video game but certainly not 15 x the number i currently run then it would dawn on me that im not having any fun with just one character and the last account would probably gosonoushepard wong ogeko wrote u ccp should not only make local delayed in highsec but they should also require one be undocked to use it then even the local spammers have some skin in the game support a high resolution texture pack
pretty much my thoughts exactly
bloody stupid idea is bloody stupidi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
effectively making those system as one  oh god  eve is already too small1 for anything that limits fun killing game mechanics though 60 clicks and 45min to get across the map is not fun emergent play its just another useless grind that has to be done for those that do not have the means to use cynoshortcuts before your allowed to do anything entertaining its like making people enter 30 captcha in a row in order to accept a mission from an agentwhy the hell do you want to go there in the first place pls tell us why do you want to travel 60 jumps away

let not this thread die
not a bad idea id also like to see what drones have damage to their armor  hull when theyre in the drone bay that way we can send out the ones in better shape when were up to our elbows in a fight
ok im jumping in here with a few lines im looking yes actually using the forum search tool for a particular thread else ill start my own about cloakerscloak is op mkayyou can effectively shut down an entire constellation with just a few cloakers please dont tell me to change my game style or use a defense force anyone who actually plays in 00 knows those are troll statements nothing more hot drop nullifies your defense force and even when paid pvprs will not sit as long as a miner will simple fixes1 make the cloak consume fuelandor2 make it non repeatable but give it a reasonable cycle time say 30 minutes
those ideas are nothing new cloaks are fine and balanceddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i think nullsec dwellers will not be happy till there is a system upgrade module that wont let anyone without 10 standing use a cloakive both used the cloaking tactic and had it used and while it is annoying i think it is a legitimate terror tool to use against a hostile force as for removing localatleast with local you know there is a cloakeri cant imagine the tears that would flow if suddenly the cloakers didnt need to cloak cause you wouldnt even know they were there until your deadand before everyone starts yelling dscan how many ratters in their cute little drakes and hurricanes are hitting dscan or even know how to use it
i was looking through some old qens especially the stats on sinks and faucets and this crazy idea struck mewhat if we could get all types of raw materials via lp storeeach branch of npc corps would have only 1 or 2 types of raw material and price would be based on balance decided by ccp and accepted by csmthus drone salvage could be reached vi things like creodronraw ore via mining corpsmoon materials from soe or similarthe effective cost on lp should be high enough to not break the benefits but the monopolysince all these raw would be spread on a lot of different npc corps a lot of new missioning activity would developpeople would move around and specialize morealso some additional hand in to buy these raw materials could be useful maybe just plain iskthis would also make it valid to reduce the bounty and boost lp so the isk faucet could be turned down a bitalso missions asking for pi materials and paying out the upgraded versions would be usefulthe bounty prize faucet is seen here back in the last qen q4 2010
i agree the drone salvage monopoly needs to be broken it is ruining the game
this is just a simple draft idea but with some ccp and csm refining i think it might be helpfull to at least loosening the iron grip of the monopolyalso we would not have this new changes seesaw problem since players could shift activity focus in safe empire to reduce the problems of new monopolistic entities and issuesalso it might spread the bloody mission runners a bit more to create more diverse markets for smaller industrialists and newbiesto much space is dead empty
what are you trying to achieve here exactly
trying to do two things really reduce the perfect monopoly on any raw materialmaking lp store and thus mission runners role a bit more directly supportive of the player to player economythe isk printing is disruptive and destructive to new players and it seems to make older players a bit lethargic and even disgruntledwe have a desperate need of either some huge wars or a trickle down mechanism for the economythe good dr e used to say we dont have inflation but we seriously have a flow of isk and wealth problemthe irony is when current null politicians and especially csm candidates say null needs boosting while seeing the financial report from mittaniwe need to some stirring in the pot and something to shine the game up a bit its starting to feel old and dusty so much that i even see people seriously suggesting server roll backs or server resetsi also recall mittani calling the monopoly problems downright stupid
i was just wondering what everyone thought of being able to block people on the account level rather than just the character i get annoyed having to block who i suspect are the same people everyday on their new throw away characters while they blow up various local chats with terrible scams one of my account has over 5800 people on the block list currently and it grows rapidly i also wonder if this is possible from a tech stand point or not so if anyone has insight into that it would be appreciatedthoughts comments concerns
yes this should absolutely happenback in the day when you blocked someone in uo on your list it would say the account of turdburglarauto blocking based on a key word list that you can customisedoublingdoubleplexofficer modetc etcauto blocked 30 days and a email to turdburglar you have been blocked by soandso for 30 daysushepard wong ogeko wrote uUFFFD ccp should not only make local delayed in highsec but they should also require one be undocked to use it then even the local spammers have some skin in the game support a high resolution texture pack
this is a stupid ideaso you want us to run eve client just to be able to get more sp it is silly you should run the game to play it and have fun not to farm sp
o hmm so what does those alt ships do other than combatmaybe fw should give reward for pvp and not farming plexes
