this makes no sence why do many other proffessions like mining and missioning get this but the pvp field is completely left out i dont agree with how a 3 day old newb in a velator has as much right to the wreak as the person who killed the ship it makes no sence and needs to be fixed i agree with what pitboss proposses for fixes
fw fleets encounter this a lot and we are typically not set up to tank gate guns in low sec so there is nothing we can do about it

why is a cynojammer so hard to kill when a mothership and even titans can get gankedalso i dream of supcaps with siege an area effect capabilites other than dd ofcause 
as a 2 year nyx pilot i earnestly believe that motherships need a significant change its simply too easy to lose 20b iskthe proposals to motherships that i thought most viable were the ones affecting super capitals ability to spidertank more effectively and the proposal to manipulate transversal on sieged turret dreads more effectively whatever the result super capitals motherships especially need something to make them worth their cost and building effort
technically they do exist hehthing is oh gawd marauder  large wow i can just imagine
no this is silly this is what destroyers are for
this is what destroyer alts are for
i would support this but i think it would be even cooler to have a ship with a salvaging bonus some sort of dedicated salvager ship it could get bonuses in salvaging chance tractor beam range and cargo capacityhowever if this were implemented i could continue to use my salvagecane with a longer range 
yeah fix phoenix give it 3 turret slots and hybrid bonuses it even does less dmg than the naglfar by far
okay so after a lot of math the new capital artillery proposals means that with dread v capital artillery will out damage unbonused lasers on the nag by about 5 this still means that with dread iv capital beams will do 5 more than capital artillery guess ill have to update the op
just give it 4 turret slots and swich quad 3500 gun to dual 4900 gun so they can keep the awesome model same still 8 guns on each side but 4 turrets instead of 2
i like this
or add this so that you can if u wish add a password to a single pos to allow neutsor be a spy ect but have the standings option set and used for the most part
oh hell noi always get ing ed about unimportant and useless websitesgameswhatever forcing password changesif it doesnt directly involve my rl money and or income then i dont really give a  about passwordsi hate password templates just as much if i want a simple password it means i dont give a  if it gets guessedjust like lavista thingie earlier i change my passwords regulary but damnit dont force it
but didnt you hearthe pandemic legion guys are suggesting that internet spaceships is serious business
hackers get the passes from eve accounts either by key loggers or because the user is stupid and told them or someone else somewhere their pass against both a difficult pass with numbers wont help much difficult passes are usefull when someone can bruteforce the pass or even more with dictionary attack but i think ccp will notice when someone tries to bruteforce your pass
or from hacked thirdparty forumsbut thats why you should never use the same username on eveo nobody knows my username hence they would have to figure out my username and password
thats because your exercising common sensethis proposal is like telling ccp to outlaw scammingits not there fault you gave your password awaywhich is why its pointless to force changes who gives a damn if you change your passwordyoud have to change it 50 some odd times a day to make it worth whileand thats insaneif you really where that bloody worried you would issue a smart cardkey with a randomized decryptionencryption algorithm that would transmit your account informationgod help you if you lose the damn thing and all that over a ing gameand they call me crazyit is a video game right
number of passwordspins i need to remember in real life or for work not for entertainment  over 15number of those that make me change my password frequently  6chances that i am going to start changing my entertainment passwords frequently and try to remember them because some internet company that i give money to decides that i am too stupid to protect my password to my internet spaceship  0 not supportedand to save me time count this post as 6 opposed and pretend my 5 alts logged on too
1 most of the time even if theres a password being changed etc keyloggers are going to bypass all thatthe issue is that people give away their account details and such its the most moronic thing everpeople go away from the game for awhile so they give their friends the account details they come back to the game and get their account back in good condition they dont bother changing the password they do something moronic  everyone off they log him in and basically lead them into being screwed up badly etc etcthats what happens with all these hacked accounts
no its not what happens is outlined in post 32 of this thread in about the middle most of you dont even understand how the mass attack on accounts works or just how many people this attack really works onhint there are no mass trojans deployed just to steal eve accounts it just doesnt make sense they would not be bothering with game accounts if they had credit card detailsanyways im probably going to reword this idea to just be a popup warning when a password is a certain age or an emailed warning to active accounts with an old enough password because i dont think ccp would implement something that could potentially get people to lock themselves out of their accounts
so jason edwards is smarter than miss alt posts alotwow who woulda thunk it
i really like the idea of a truly passive armor faction torp boat857 seems pretty overkill in my opinionessentially make it like an overtanked abaddon with less dps
would this do
maybe a raven like slot layout would do with swapped lowmid slots
as long as i get my sansha mothership but yes personally i would like to see a gallenteamarr hybrid ship line up or a special khanid fleet lineup in conjunction with other sub factions gettgin thier own expensive but different line of faction ships
ill point out that there is no equivalent of a wardec for the market ie an embargoeconomic alliances would be interesting attack us physically and well cut off the cheap flow of goods to you this would be interestingin normal warfare asymmetric or guerrilla warfare makes it much more expensive for the agressor costdamage dealt is significantly higher for instance in reality one person can take out a substantial part of the other partys economic base making it prohibitively expensive to continue indefinitely this is in addition to the readiness cost of making war in the first place making war prohibitively expensive can be simulated and should thus at a minimum increasing the cost of the war is interesting despite the fact that the attackers generally have a superior force the defenders often have the advantage in terms of terrain etc no such equivalent exists in eve but perhaps it should
geddonapocabaddoncarriersyou can set all these up to deal 1000 dps with absolutely no ammo cost yaaay free easy killmails
caldari control tower 50 million shields with 50 thermal resistance then 4 million armor after thatgallente 35 million shields 25 thermal resist then 8 million armorminmatar 45 million shields with 25 thermal resistance and 50 em then 6 million armorim not sure if you have to burn through the shields if the tower is offline and i cant find the amount of structure for each tower so lets look at the armor only weakest armor is on the caldari tower with 4 million points at 1000dps that will take you 66 minutes 40 seconds then you start work on the structureeven worse this is assuming that they didnt use the 24 hours warning to online their tower so you would have to take out the shieldsso how do you plan to keep bordem at bay for that long last i heard concord would protect high sec towers so you will need to war dec them
very nice idea but i still think cov ops recon ships black ops and this cloak transporter should be able to pass such gates without a warningabout the cov ops cloak you cant warp with activated normal cloak so youre forced to be in local for some seconds every time you warpps sorry for my bad english
wormspace for 1 is understandable whatevercreating a 510 second delay just to lower lag a bit wouldnt hurt at all it would at least keep you on your toes slightly morebut local itself just cant change sorryin my interceptor there are many systems which i go through where the 30 second session timer from jumping into the new system jumping into the next one is still in effect after warping to the next gateif local got delayed beyond that where it would be legitimately possible for pilots to not make it on the list at all then that would be horrible
right thats why delayed local would suck
delayed local would suck recent speakers local would rock
maybe but i would like recent speakers local for cloaks only
i support this idea couse using local as intel is bad as soon as someone hostile jumps to a system anybody in war with the target using local can imdiately dock in station evading any possible causalities
thisno support until then
i fully endorse this product andor service
i definately agree with this idea having 90 of my skills at level 5 it means scrolling through far more than i should have to to find the skill i want to queue actually posted a thread about this exact idea in features and ideas a week ago before i saw this proposal
although id like to see the issue of spamming getting addressed over the scamming issue in this case it appears to be one and the same lately this should slow down at least the 999 scam although it wouldnt adress mineral contract scams thumbs up at any rate a written amount however it is determined would make a bit of sense to my red weary eyes
1 yes they are sooo annoying2 the fix is simple but doesnt really cause trouble simply spell it out kind of dealhow can you oppose this it doesnt really hurt the situation
supported because its getting ridiculous in market hubs
captian duffy endorses this proposal
signed
support thisthe scam spam is just too much
never fallen for this one either but idiots spamming local is annoying as 
i agree with scamming but i dont agree with the contract spam supported
i have a ton of contracts of stupid or pointless stuff i have a contract where i contract like 120 light missiles to my alt does anyone seriously care about thishow about the option for contract cleaning where if both parties agree the contract history gets cleaned from those ships1 person gets scammed doesnt agree to clean it then the world can see the scammers history2 person is a legit trader doesnt agree to clean it then the world can see the trader is legit3 person contract to alt and does agree to clean it then nobody gets to see stupid contractswouldnt this feature be an improvement at least
id be okay with cleaning private contracts by agreement since only the two of you can see it anyways its a ridiculously low priority but itd have some use public contracts should be permanent though  cleaning intel sources off yourself isnt something that should be that easy
private contracts are only visible to the involved parties i think that is enough of a fix for your problemtldr  no
i dont get what the deal is they go away after some time anyway
if a fw fleet jumps into 00 and a hic pilot activates a bubble the hic pilot gets a standings hit from any person in the fleet who attempts to warp while in his bubblethe standings hit is great enough if you fly with a larger and not so disciplined militia fleet that eve will eject the hic player from the militia because of a drop in standingsthis effectively means that fw fleets can not use bubbles while in 00please change the code so that bubble aggression on pilots in your own fleet does not affect standings for fwit may even be better to not get aggression at all for players in your own fleet attempting to warp in you bubble
i dont see this implemented so soon as militia is not supposed to fly in 00 and using warp bubles
do not tell us what we are supposed to do this is a sandbox game
im not in fw but i agree your fleet shouldnt cause aggression period
uh last i heard 00 is lawless so how the hell are you getting a standings hit in a nonpatrolled let alone we dont give a rip unless you kill rats 00 space
id revise this to say that agression results should be suppressed in nullsec entirely
this i fly in 00 and dont participate in fw the entire reason i like 00 is the lack of rules and the freedom from the mess of standings and sec status issues that exist in empire
sounds like a pretty silly oversight to me i cant raise this anymore but erik can so supported
this is bizarre nothing you do in 00 should count by the laws of empire space supported
makes a lot of sense
i have been soo busy though lately havent put a great deal of thought in my erm ideasso supporting
actually it makes complete sense as war decing allows the parties to attack each other in 05 space as well as low sec instead of just 00
because its 00 and theres no law to prevent it thats kinda the whole point of 00 space
err let me think no
when i first read this i wasnt sure if perhaps it was a joke or notvery very not supported sorry
i travel a lot as trader during my playtime and nearly in all major systems isk sellers post their scams directly to local this an improvement from prevoious mailing to mailbox they have grown bolder and spam several sites of text till they get banned but another character is created again to take a placei propose that local has filter that disables web links from to be posted if you are a newbie in trial if someone wants to send a guide or funny picture he should do it per private mail or public chatmany new players dont know its illegal to buy isk and when explained its too late and get account banned or are in deep red numbers so please in terms of new friendly game experience look at it
flogging the dead horse againi agree with you but theres no easy way making it known that buying isk is illegal is a better idea it needs to be outlined more clearly for the newbies
the only way i could think of to stop them is one of the 2 methods1 new accounts restricted from local chat and only allowed in rookie chat which makes rookie chat worse but its always watched by a mod or a gm and they can ban them quicker2 new trial accounts prevented from leaving rookie systems or 2 jump radius or somethingodds are they are not paid accounts and they always have random name generatorsperhaps they should prevent jdslfkjaslkgeupouw names  o p or at least red flag themand why the hell arent they banning the freaking ip for the account
no links from trials is one of the lessbad ideas but im still a bit worried about it ill give this one a firm maybe this is exactly the wrong approach make it known that isk buying is legal if you do it the right way people are willing to break the rules but theyd much prefer to follow them who would be bothered buying isk from dirty spammers when the plex market exists make sure every newbie sees if you want to buy isk do this early in their career and the spammers will get nowhere
anda few neutral logistics pilots also sit right on the gate even if they aggro the logistics and the tank is breaking they can easily jump thru the gate and gtfo dont even need to deagresswant to win empire war dont show up get in low sec at leastwe had wartargets we got into fairly deep 00 and used alt corps to move capitals and stuff for logisticsat least i acknowledge that our wartargets tried to get to us in 00 but empire war griefers dont have what it takes for 00 pvp so they basically died long before getting to us unfortunately we dont even bother spying so we dont even know when they are trying to goto 00
ah true okay i guess im supporting this
i think that when you wardeck someone all of their ships should be forced out of station and their engines and shields disabled so that its easier to kill them also they shouldnt be able to dock or shoot back until the war is overseriously guys this game has a well thoughtout mechanic yes people can undock repair and redock yes alt players in npc corps can use logistics boats however you can do the same thing so why doesnt that make it even my corp manages to get plenty of kills with all these other provisions in place were just crafty i guess
moon idea is bad really bad i mean really bad
hang on a minute youre saying you dont want to be forced to do something and yet you think its fine for you to force others to pvp via random grief wardecsok then how about thissince its possible to force others in to a combat based war how about industry corps can force the wardecers to mine yes when you declare war the defender can now choose method of engagement mining manufacture mission running trade or combat1 mining both corps have to mine as much minerals as possible and hand over to an npc no combat is allowed between involved parties the corp that mines the most wins and the looser has to pay a fine of 100mil isk to the winner2 manufacture both corps have to build as many different items as possible and hand them over to an npc no more than one of each item can be used market value or mineral content has no meaning only the total number of different items count towards victory who ever produces the most wins again the looser has to pay a fine of 100mil isk to the winner3 trade both corps have to make isk from buying and selling items on the market who ever makes the most isk wins again the looser has to pay a fine of 100mil isk to the looser4 mission running both corps have to complete as many missions as they can who ever completes the most missions wins looser has to pay a fine of 100mil to the winner5 combat same as beforeall wardec fees are removed if the looser can not pay the fee within one week the corp is disbanded and the ceo is banned from forming a new corp until the fine has been payed in full there we go no one is forced to do anything they dont want to do after all nobody is forcing you to declare warsounds like fair game to me
bad idea so farin my opinion alliances with sovereignty shouldnt be wardeccable you should be forced to go into 00 and attack them that way if you have a gripe having this be the same thing for empire is just a bad ideasure it would kind of good idea but wardecs are supposed to be simple and petty and griefy thats the whole point
that would only add to the cost of war deccing someone not supportedid rather see an increase in the price to war dec a corp though 1 mil is laughable at best
this is silly if anything just makes war deccing smaller corps more expensive and have the cost increase over time easier fix and make maintaining a war indefinitely very expensive on the aggressors
well the thing is they wanted to make something tradeablefor example gallente freighter is only seeded in gallente space people then can buy those and bring them to amarr space or stain for all it matters it also gets people moving around i might be a mission runner in amarr space i then goto gallente space for some skillbooksin reality though it is far moreso a hassle and a pain to do not to mention a 00 nerf as you basically have to goto empire to get the skillbookswhat i would like instead would be a skillbook transferance tower or something this way people in empire still have to go collect the books while people in 00 for example could literally goto charsheet goto a tab or window or something which brings you to something like the training queue except it shows you all the skills you can learn it gives you the seeded priceon top of that this only works so long as theres a communication network using pos modules connecting you to the schools with seeded skillbooks so perhaps you connect only to 1 school it is a gallente one you then dont have the amarr skills and such also the is a lightyear range kind of mechanic also

my industrial ship was blown into ittybitty pieces today in a suicide gank attack in hisec space i understand why the pirates did it but dont understand why ccp encourages this kind of activity the attack was economical solely because insurance covered the loss of the hostiles ship in the real world you cant burn down your own house and collect insurance you cant kill someone and then collect on their insurance somali pirates cant collect insurance if the navy blows up their ship so why can criminals collect insurance in eve it makes a mockery of the concord mechanic if there is no real loss and no real risk pirates seem to laugh at the security hit i know some will argue that sometimes people accidentally trigger concord but i am not buying that argument so dont even trymy question for the csm candidates is do you support the elimination of insurance payouts on concord killsalso i would like to know your thoughts on life insurance to cover the loss of implants when podded
suicide ganking is a valid tactic in eve but there should be consequences for the gankersif you put a cargoexpanded hauler full with goodies on autopilot you are asking for trouble there isnt much that can be done about that as even with removing insurance it will remain lucrative to gank careless players
if you haul around expensive items in gankable ships then gankers will hit you if you dont learn the lesson the first time ie dont haul expensive stuff in gankable ships on autopilot and take risky routes as shortcuts youll continue to get gankedccp have clearly changed the sec hit to balance this activity somewhat ie characters and have to get sec back before they can enter higher security systems again after a few ganks this is the penalty a ganker paysno insurance for implantsxavier

hey pluto nice to see you again man look me up in game some time for a chat about how things are going sorry for the late reply my initial thoughts on the subject are that if you remove ice from empire entirely ie both high and low sec the cost of ice will rise dramatically this will see a rise in the cost of running poses in empire and therefore probably see an increase in costs for people in certain areas i think it would have a minor effect on the 00 spaceholders apart from an increase in the recruitment of those ice miners currently residing in empire having seen enough ice mining operations in 00 progressing quite happily without interference for day to day i suspect we will just see an increase in this activity without a closer analysis being done by myself ie the sort of close analysis i would do if it were a proposal with a lot of support i cant say for sure but i suspect the ones who will suffer from this idea would be the empire pos owners specifically and people who buy from the market directly in a general sense as the cost of research goes up whilst i am all for increasing the tactical and strategic options for players i dont really think that in the main this will give the ability to hamstring ones opponents unless you end up permanently in control of all the ice belts in the region and then people may well just ship it in from other 00 regions thanks for the suggestion and i hope it helps you make up your mind
sort of a follow up to the abovewhat do you think in general about the presence and use of empire resources from oremineral acquistion to research  manufacturing to mission running by large 00 holding alliancesshould the games mechanics make supporting a 00 empire based on high sec resources more difficult
i vote for that guy 100 like his speech like his goals
agree with phoenix my alt vote for that guy 100
i agree with them too like his goals
vote vik luk for president p
vuk vuk hes our man if he cant do it no one can yaaaaaaaaaay vuk
few others can running can represent us in what 00 needs most terms of fixes more than vuk give him your vote in the next election please 
great to see policies that address actual problems in the game should improve the experience for the vast majority of players
vuk lau is realy the best choice
i havent heard any indication that a moddable ui is in the works and while i do approve of the way ccp has been improving the ui over the last few expansions i think that theres still plenty of room for player input on the topic im not trying to step on too many toes here but its an important issue and despite effort on ccps part still one that needs a lot of work i think that theres plenty of room for the csm to influence how they go about this in future some of them are more feasible than others i agree moving the debate to an open forum may be impractical for nda reasons but holding meetings on a closed forum and publishing logs should be no more of a problem than holding meetings in a closed chat channel and publishing logs i havent read the nda so i dont know exactly how far we can take it but thats the sort of thing id like to see happen if i have to compromise to keep the lawyers happy i will but im going to at least try for the best solution rather than declaring a compromise before i know where the limits actually are as for the csms processes they work mostly and i dont want to interfere too much with them but i think that theres still some room for improvement for example the adoption of genuine rules of order would streamline many things  csm 2 didnt have as much bickering as csm 1 so the issue has moved to the back burner but its still an improvement that can be made without upsetting the applecart similarly creating better reference stickies is hardly going to turn the world upsidedown but it will hopefully let players access csm information more quickly and easily thank you

that pretty much sums it up for me too
taken from a different forum scrapheap challengei have a lot of experience running small gangs i was the main fc for the dara cothrom alliance for the last 6 months and have run small roaming ops ie 520 people mostly hacs  recon  ldictor  logi gangs through cloud ring fountain dek outer ring fade and pureblind i basically ran one a day and ran defense ops against them as well i now fly with triumvirate which has a reputation for running some of the toughest roaming gangs in eve some of the issues i find with the small gang is that the amount of targets you can get is limited by your gang size and therefore your accomplishments are limited to what you bring you are relegated to the role of either gankee taking out smaller targets and gangs or the ganked where you get blobbed by a significantly larger gang set up on a gate and have to run away a lot of times your roam will end as soon as u run into a gang camping a pipe system and you will have to turn around and go find something else to do so basically you are limited in your engagements by having a very small fleet whereas it should be the opposite smaller fleet should mean greater mobility and a broader range of tacticsas an fc its always really obnoxious to find that you make 30 jumps to try to get a fight and when you get to your destination you find a gatecamp with 15 falcons and 30 rr battleships blocking your route how would i like to fix this give a small gang more options to get through camps fix black ops make bubbles have a smaller radius nerf warp scrams arazu with a 30km scram makes baby jesus cry increase cruiser sized ships resistance to ecm and generally just make improvements to the ability to circumvent some of the blobtastic elements of eve fast ships should be able to burn away from gatecamps and clear advantage should not be given to whoever sets up on a gate first

hey guidoim not running but i thought id throw my 02 isk worth for this subject as it has a lot of appeal to me1 not really what i would like to see though is comet mining imagine your ship trailing the comet while repairing itself from the debris and ice chunks all to get at the juicy mineral goodness at the comets heart this could fit in your concept of ring mining as far as the rewards but just in a different light2 maybe as i have heard there are some missions where you fight against concord for the pirate factions if we have a weaker concord renegade spawn with noninstakill ships id be all for it after all everybody knows that the space pigs are corrupt3 this is one issue i fought for during my term as csm and would love to see implemented something weaker but more hidden than a pos  kind of a home away from home4 this is a good idea to reduce the amount of premanufactured goods another issue i fought for in my term no meta 0 rat loot and would help to balance the rarity of moon minerals it would have to be balanced carefully but i dont see why not5 see 4 above6 yet again something i fought for during my term holographic imagers it wouldnt really work for normal ships but i could see a special type of ship like a t2 hauler that has a lot of armor and some ew but no weapons to create a decoy ship for fleet ops
hey folksgarthran re 1 indeed sir just looking for a new additional location with some more very cool graphics and artwork for miners to find currently existing types of raw materials as i see it a mineable ring around a ring planet aka saturn might be a hybrid kind of mining area with perhaps as an example both ore and ice mixed together how cool would that be very issler indeed i just think even concord has a few bad asses that are just on the verge of going pirate i mean in terms of storyline the moment a concord commander finally says frag this ive had enough of crap pay and no recognition from hq is the moment they go renegade ccp devs should have a field day with this kind of fluff bunyip good to hear from you i agree there are any number of ways that the actual graphical deception for qships could be implemented into the game im not a programmer so i wont pretend to say its easy  but given how fast this kind of game evolves im sure some rising star in ccp will enjoy a moment over coffee one morning and scream eureka for the benefit of all capsuleers everywhere and thank you all for stopping by to reply much appreciated o7
i think its an idea but they would also need to vreate with it items that would use them i agree a good thought but atm inpravtivcal until they make items thats require the components you would gain from itwell like real life you always get bad apples so it could be an interesting thing for some events or something and having people trying to find out the locations of the heads of the rebellions with maybe rewards of isk or even officer mods etc if you take them downi think to much is left in space and cusing lag as it is  yes it would be a nice added extra but i feel the amount pf player and structures there already are i can see this working but would love my own home in space even if they were to be destroyable etc to many problems i can forsee with thisthis could work it would just need an adjustment of the loot tables and another tiwst on it could be to put containers that if you have the hacking skill etc could gain you other loots too as in all systems etc you have chances of finding a hauler spawn and in a mission maybe a spawn come into drop off supplies at the base where you arei agree in total with you statement here  considering 00 is less that 15 of the total player base and most small allainces dont have access to 00 when you have large ones taking up alot of space but no people residing there you sometimes get lucky with high sec grav belts that can gain you lower sec ores  if you can find them and since whs came in gravametric sigs outside of whs are becoming less and lessinteresting is all i can say on this i will give this some more thought and will post on it once i am done
true however it wouldnt bother me in the slightest if personal habitats had a timer on them that works in exactly the same way as the timer on anchored cansonce the fuel ran out the timer would kick in once the time expired  insert popping noise here on the other hand personal habitats would not be nearly as difficult to gank as a pos so im pretty sure there would be plenty of volunteers looking for target practice too thanks very much for your response

perhaps erik and his masters should spend more time debating issues of interest and import to the game and its community than making tourism videos
tell me then why should we debate anything with you and your friends when the interest of you lot isnt to debate anything at allerik me and take care stand for professionalism and we have a vision to reach out and represent the silent majority of eve players and anyone else that can identify themself with our balanced stance and our transparant natureit is very clear from this thread that a lot of you dont have any interest to discuss anything in detail but instead just go for cheap shots to flame troll and slander us anything of importance which we say gets ignored what is the point debating with entities such as you when you use every tactic at your disposal to sabotage the very core of the debate structureall of your rabble and that of certain other people in this thread doesnt say anything about our movie or our willingness to discuss important issues it just is a blatant display of your senseless confrontational nature immatureness and unprofessionalism qualities that are not desired on a csm as we all saw on csm1 what that kind of attitude leads toif you want us to reply perhaps it would be time to show some genuine interest instead of looking for opportunities to flame
is this the sum total of your contributions and by default the contributions of take care that erik is using as evidence for his experience and advantage he has as a candidateby the way that reply you sent ccp first timeis that the reply regarding their responses to the first formal submission of csm issues i have a copy kicking about if you want me to post itxavier
are you just being deliberately stupid trolling or are you just putting your ignorance on past csm activities on display here if you would know anything about the csm youd know where to find a nice index of all the topics every csm raised and also who set up this whole system to improve transparency for the playersccp basically said the first time that ccp strongly believes that switching skill training is an activity that encourages players to log into the game and play in summery i wrote a reply how switching skills often does not promote players to actually play the game challenging their perception one of the obvious reasonings was that people do not want to play the game at 3 in the morning another was analysing how the players planned their skills and the findings were that people wanted to train skill x and y but instead picked skill z they didnt want as much just because it finished training at a more convenient time
youd have to acknowledge though that they already were considering skill training queue but couldnt implement it due to ghost training also there were countless requests for ccp to implement one even before the formation of the csmas for my knowledge of the csm and past issues i know where to find them and have prior experience of the csm you really need to do a little research before making such statementsnice plug for your wiki though but im afraid to say it doesnt help me play eve in the slightestim still trying to figure out why you seem to be doing all the campaigning for erik etc given that you have done 2 terms in the csm already meetings are closed to csm only hence you cant possibly assist during the meetings and erik will need to replydebateengage with players directly himself if he is successful in gaining a place on the csm alternatively is he going to be the public face of the take care party with the founder pulling the strings in the background
ghost training okay if you say so err wait youre just pulling that out of your ass and it can be easily disproven by the followingghost training  train battleship 5ghost training  skill queue  train 24h worth of minor skills  battleship 5yeah im sure ghost training was the big evil culprit 1 it does make people find issues more easily hopefully not raising them again on the assembly hall2 it does make the life of a csm a lot easier3 ccp demanded continuity and documentation that can be handed over to the future csms without the wiki things would be spread allover the forums and mailboxes a problem that plagued csm1 like it or not but it is the duty of a csm to write structured issue documents and keep them organized and inform the players of what they are up to1 erik has real life obligations right now but will be available later as the election draws closer2 erik has done a great job replying in his candidate thread there is just no point arguing with trolls that do not belong to our potential electorate and clearly are not interested in what he has to say so instead he spends his time more productively3 i think erik will do a more productive and professional job in the live discussions than you and that he doesnt need me behind the curtain for that
do i really need to refresh your memoryccp said no the first time around because of ghost training simple facthence why we use the evelopedia and not your wiki like xavier stateseh it has been just about only you who has repsonded for himhe has yet to prove that he can talk for himself without you speaking for him
ii think erik will do a more productive and professional job in the live discussions than youiactually you cant really comment on how professional or productive ill be in live meetings im sure erik is capable of being professional in meetings should he get the opportunityive also seen how you are in meetings and replying to ccp etc if you are hoping to bolster the take credit party i hope erik begins to engage with voters very quickly if he is that busy and doesnt have the time to campaign how will he be an effective csm memberxavier
blatantly false reread the minutes and id like to point you to the above equasion that disproves the theory as the skill queue could have been implemented without being affected by ghost trainingwhile ombers efforts to copypaste my wiki into the evelopedia are admirable its still based on my work and we reverted back to my wiki due to technical problems with ccps of course i hope that we can use evelopedia in the future but youre quite easily dismissing my hard work herethen you cant readhe already did admirably in his campaign thread
well i see how you act on the forums and i see how erik acts on the forums you can learn some things from him such as sticking to your own thread and not making all these silly attacksif he is busy now that doesnt mean he doesnt have time in the future eh another one of your silly attacks you really should stop that
nuff saidyour work was to set up a wiki it was always clear that we wanted to use ccps due to the very reasons you state continuitywhile i can appreciate that you put effort into it its hardly rocket science i know im clearly blind ed and spread falsehoods toothats not what i hear from people not can see i can see a whole lot of you responding to people and then erik talking after your mouth
writing things off as attacks is a bit easy isnt it especially when you started the attack
welcome to politics
i think its fine that eriks campaign is being run by someone else but then again i never considered voting for him anywayif people were pleased by ankhs contribution to the csm and are willing to take her word for which candidate to vote for thats fine should he actually forum troll and put in the work probably however you do have to worry about any politician who relies on their friends rather than their actual meritsedit vote weazy z p
silly me i thought the forums were publicanyway you earlier stated that erik you and take credit stood for professionalism is it your contention that cheap shots name calling and insinuations are professionalgiven that csm candidates are campaigning why should they stick to their own threads this thread wasnt started by erik so im hardly damaging your campaign or followers i just will point out inconsistencies in other candidates cvs as per political campaigning id rather engage with erik though since he is the candidate
i think this about sums it up i dont have anything else to say to you for today
so far 99 of that is done by other candidates or their troll friends just look through this threadour cv is perfectly consistant and if you want to discuss something of serious nature perhaps you should refrain from making cheap shots and insinuations
ideally politics should have no place in the csm as the csm exists to serve the players
so the whole part about voting and campaigning is irrelevant
you can have elections without politics based on actual qualifications without candidates stumbling over eachother to slander some opponent
how about without political partiesid be interested to hear what you think constitute qualifications also
concerted efforts have been made by myself and others whom feel your puppet erik and by extension take care are severely lacking in policy on certain issueson your part on eriks the multitude of faceless sycophantic alts that spring up anywhere take care is criticized and that of take care as a lobbyist entity you have evaded questioning on those issues that might be construed as controversial and specifically neglected policy in areas that might favor a pvp dynamic or pvp based platform for the csmyou continued assertion that take care represents a balanced and impartial body of individuals from a myriad of different backgrounds and play styles is patently farcical in view of your actionsthis poses an unsurprising counterpart and equal to the roles and backgrounds take care members represent in game and the limited interaction you have with the broad spectrum of playstyles in game this is reflecting in take care policyto top it all off the actual meat of what erik aims to do in his term is decidedly lacking in those areas you have seen fit to address specifics pleaseon my part i was not attempting to trolli genuinely feel take care specifically erik needs to concentrate on the issues at hand and engage with the communityall of the communitywe all want a better eve you are caught up in myths of your own importance and sovereign value of your ideas and viewpoint put down that magic mirror and begin proper discussion on issues that take care has avoided
i created my own party later today im going to make a video unfortunatly i do not have a cute tiny fuel efficient car so im calling the pta to see if they will let me drive around one of their buses after that i will string together a collection of urban landscape shots maybe some close ups of some birds
seconded if you cant handle the heat get out of the kitchen
take care is not a political party perhaps you should watch the movie again and do your homeworkas for qualifications how about being mature dedicated able to work with others able to represent other views than your own being able to format your issues in a neutral way communicating your issues clearly with ccp writing clear documents being on time and present for meetings just to name a few important qualities for a council memberunfortunately this has already been disproven countless of times in several threads take care will look after the interests of all playstyles including 00 lowsec and factional warfare in addition to industry roleplaying mining exploration mission running and everything else out there there has been a proven track record with issues in these categories and we have a pvp player on the board while i am an experienced fw player erik hangs out in lowsec this has been proven many times over so i wonder why i have to keep repeating myselfif you criticize us on not engaging with all aspects of the community then think about this can these noisy pvp candidates really represent say the interests of casual npc corp players just as well as we can represent factional warfare players i severely doubt that
thats ironic your dear friend erik stated otherwise here
you may not like to call it a political party but its a party running in a political contestid say i meet all those qualifications listed above i was hoping youd bring up communicating with ccp in a clear way and writing clear documents i have sitting in my mail folder an interesting document you wrote and sent to ccp as a csm response to the second lot of issues sent in for consideration it makes interesting reading and in it you are not professional mature or formatting issues in a neutral way above that and much more seriously you send it in a position as secretary of the csm hardly a way to gain the respect of ccp or a way to represent the csm in a professional manner it is of concern to me that you may in some way be associated with another member of the next csm via your take credit party rather than viewing players that pull you up on inconsistencies overstatement of fact and clear fabrication wouldnt it be better to actually engage in some meaningful discussion on issues i see that facebook and ambulation are stated as major issues for erik in the next csm ones hell be pushing how does this make the gaming experience of eve better and how will it affect players ingame what proportion of the playerbase will it affectxavier
lol
that is kinda outdated dont you think
i disagree it exists to hear and consult people from different playstyles and allows me to hand over my valuable csm experience to others instead of letting it go to waste we all know what happened when inexperienced csm took office at the start of csm2 i learned from that experience and will do whatever i can to make sure that it doesnt happen again oh more slandering eh and it interests me tremendously who gave you that particular document which was sent on personal title by the way not on csm title of course you wouldnt know the circumstances and context that doc was sent in or ccps reaction to it so youre just ripping things out of context and out of proportion in order to spread your message of hatei wont bother making any further comments regarding this document as youre just spreading more falsehoods anywayfeel free to start a mature discussion without fabrications and personal attacks any time you like im waiting on you herei think more networking stuff would be great in eve and that there is a clear demand for this based on the repeated player requests to have a larger character bio and more corp standing slots and ways for alliances to distribute standings ambulation was received well at the fanfest im sure it will not appeal to all players but it would be a boon for roleplayers and other people that just want to socialize a bit more being able to hold corp meetings in an actual office is a positive thing one may of course ask if it is a good thing that ccp dedicates so many resources to developing these features instead of putting them into improving existing aspects of eve but as far as i understand the walking in stations engine would be developed anyway for that vampire game theyre making do its not resources being diverted from eve but resources from the vampire game being diverted into eve winwin situation if ask me
oh more slandering eh and it interests me tremendously who gave you that particular document which was sent on personal title by the way not on csm title of course you wouldnt know the circumstances and context that doc was sent in or ccps reaction to it so youre just ripping things out of context and out of proportion in order to spread your message of hatei wont bother making any further comments regarding this document as youre just spreading more falsehoods anywayactually falsehoods and slandering implies that i am making something up of course its in your interests for players to think this however you gave me the document concerned and im fully aware of the context and circumstances the document was sent inyou were a csm member at the time you were secretary and you sent an initial response to ccp copied to all csm members ie its hard to see how you sent a personal response i quote your statement to ccp main body of letter document was attachedhardly a professional start its interesting that you view questions statements of fact and the highlighting of incosistencies as personal attacks and fabrications xavier
thank you for your clear display that you are unable to engage in mature discussion as you yourself proposed you are clearly ignoring my answers so there is no further point in debating with you so much for your own inconstancy in your claimed credentialsrather than wasting any more time with you you can consider yourself ignored from now on
was geht mich mein dummes geschwUFFFDtz von gestern an what do i have to do with the stupid things i said yesterday seriously though i have no problem with your party but i canUFFFDt stop thinking of you as some kind of middleasian president changing the law to be allowed to get elected another 4 years and while you and erik both state that itUFFFDs okay that you answer all questions in his thread while he is occupied i still think we should vote for the person we want to represent us and i canUFFFDt stop wondering if erik will find much time to work on csmissues himself if he is so bussy in rl on a final note posting stuff likeorand then asking for a mature diskussion does not exactly make you or your candidate look qualified and while you may think itUFFFDs all pvpers crying about a the fact that your candidate has no experience when it comes to big fleet battles capfleets sov etc remainswhat i would really like to know is thiswhat would you do if erik and you have a disagreement about some really serious csmstuff whose opinion would prevail judging by erikUFFFDs thread it looks as if you are in charge of take care but as you stated we are not voting a politicall party and its agenda but a single personwhile i am sure that you have put a lot of work into the csm i think you should just let go and try not to become some kind of kazhakstanstyle backseatcsmler which is exactly what you do look like when you post twice as much as the real candidate
the mature thing would be to admit youre wrong
as already repeated for a hundred times now just because he is busy now doesnt mean hell be busy later the elections havent even started and hes not a csm yet so whats the problem hell have plenty of time laterand answering the forum rabble is hardly the most important job of a csm there have been many that have not shown much if any forum activity at all during their termill be busy with my graduation master of science in game design and development this year and finding a job in the games industry so i certainly dont have time to play erik like a puppet as some of the people like to think take care exists to represent all playstyles and allows me to hand over my valuable knowledge as already stated ill just be an advisor and only when asked for the most important part of my job is already done travelling to berlin to talk erik through all the issues and procedures of the past csms in detail if erik wants to do something i disagree with then its not my business to interfereim more than happy to let go of the csm but i will close this chapter in a proper fashion and that includes passing on my experience so others may benefit
you have to keep repeating yourself as noone with an iota of insight into pvp centric aspects of this game actually buys into what you are sayingsince you brought it up ank your fw exploits are infamous namely your use of cloaks to remain in fw plexes and time down buttons and continued abuse of a standings exploit where the opposing faction rats that your militia is supposed to be at war with wont attack youpeople remain unconvinced as to the validity of the experience you and other take care candidates claim when it comes to pvp and an understanding of the appropriate game mechanics and communitybeing in faction warfare is not an appropriate pedigree yes please outline why you dont think this is the case for specific individuals
i wouldnt call it interesting everyone goes through a phase in life where that is the default response to such obstacles that rear their heads
1 there should always be a way for a person to play eve solo but it should not be the major focus mission running mining etc should all be at a point where it can be done efficiently solo but more efficiently with a friend or two dozen solo pvp on the other hand should be at the pilots discretion see ridiculous fit nightmares and should not be instituted as a ccp goal 2 yes i agree ccp should focus most of their time on improving the interface and making things run smoothly and having storyline and immersion elements on the backburner the obligatory eve has sound quote really fitsa majority of people who play eve do not play for the story and ccp needs to try to appeal to both but with different amounts of care 3 everyone likes new ships and toysccp just needs to stop releasing them pre nerfed to the point where they arent worth the initial cost and used very seldomly until they are fixed good examples of thisblack ops t3 electronic attack frigs all of these are good ideas just came out nerfed to the point where they arent very useful and therefore do not quench the users thirst for new content 4 i agree although i do not roleplay they should be allowed certain rights within reason not bob rights to help their play style i think ccp will be trying to do this more in the future with ambulation and so on 5 i dont think insurance is that bad you still end up losing a lot of mods perhaps even your implants and rigs when i lose a t2 fit battleship im out 100m isk anyway from fittings and rigs alone and also have to spend the next few days fitting a new one out and getting it moved to my home system insurance just takes away a little bit of the sting 6 there will always be people who talk about the good ol days but to be quite honest were currently living in a very healthy age for eve just go and get in a 100v100 battle and see how much better the lag is than a year ago even even without requesting a reinforced node its not bat at all i remember having lag in a 10v10 fight when i first joinedso this is a golden age 7 yes i want a hot yellow vagabond with rims everyone does if elected ill push ccp to try to make the game have a more customizable feel to it so every raven is not grey and every thorax does not look like a you know 8 yeah same as above would be nice but isnt exactly a high issue issue to memore of a nice feature that would be cool but is not that important 9 if youve ever read npc corp chat youll know why it is not a haven p but seriously i dont see a significant problem with it people should be allowed to abstain from pvp if they really do not want to and npc corps provide that if it is a place where isk farmers like to hide so be it the problem isnt npc corps its the isk farmers and the inability for ccp to fix the issue 10 as long as it doesnt introduce a ton of lag im all for it i would like to see more npc involvement with the markets and the npc trade system it would be very nice if the background commodity trading was not all bring something from high sec to low sec 11 i think eves history and heroes defently illustrate this the great wars and battles are written in the history books the stories written by ccp are just interesting background for an already incredibly indepth political structure should ccp report more newsfleet battles yes should ccp stop publishing stories no not at all
dj tempest3k will be running a brief on air interview of my between 1900 and 2200 gmt today you can tune in via links on new eden radio websiteand join us in the ingame channel  newedenradio i hope to see you all there
i would tend to think of myself as a allround candidate  as my pvp knowledge isnt the best but i am open to all aspects of eve and dabbled in almost all of them at some point
i am defenatly pvp mad i am defnatly more indusry based and most of the activites involve mining hauling and building of most types of ships and mods atm the only things i dont build are ms titans and tech 3
oh look take care alts
well if u pay 15 a month to not shoot at things i sorta feel sorry for youlike it or not pvp is the main reason a lot of us are interested in eve everything else for me is filler andor ways to pay for the toys we get blown up why am i interested in pushing changes to pvp rather than pveinventionthe marketetc because combat needs to be balanced more than any aspect in any game everything else is either opinion or interface improvements
combat can be balanced and expanded by making more and different ships available dont you think combat would be very different if t3 cruisers only cost 50 million isk to field thats a pve balancing issuefrankly even if combat pvp the market is pvp too is your endgoal the people that produce the ships you fly and the guns you shoot might not be so bloodthirsty its a very diverse game and saying that one aspect of it is most important is a little naive
i dont know about not having an agenda i dont know if i specifically stated if i had one or not but ive posted a few times and answered questions about how i feel i would bring ideas to the table regarding aspects that were put forward to me i think that even if some candidates don specificaly state an agenda we all have ideas that we want to put forth once the election is done and gone i think the best way to get views on how the candidates stand is to ask them questions get a feel for who they are where they stand on certain ideas ect
i know for a fact that i do have an agendai want to help improve evei dont really think that i would go out of my way to institute ideas that are obviously benefiting one group over another but i wont shoot down ideas because they dont adhere to my ideas about how eve should be played any good idea that will make eve more fun is a good idea i will endorse
i think its a conscious decision to distance oneself from other csm candidates that clearly do have an agendain the same fashion as a politician pushed into office by a third party has an agenda namely that of his backers or an oligarchy that stand to benefit from his election instead of having policy dictated by what he thinks is best for the electoratehardly a servant of the peopleso i can see why some people might state i have no agenda besides that which their own personal views and conscience dictatealternatively they might just be applying to the csm on a whim and have bought into the idea that it is a waste of time commissioned by ccp to do a job that should be carried out by a salaried employee so ccp can maintain the illusion that customer relations are getting betterin this case they may just be after a free trip to iceland or a hug from mitnal you cant really say until after they are elected
i would love to be able to skill up my alt characters i have three accounts but have alts on them that i quite like to muck around with trying out new features and stuff the ability to train these characters up would be awesome i also dont think the argument against that it would get rid of peoples additional accounts really stacks up this is an rpg and the ability to try lots of things out with different chartacters is very appealing
i run 3 accounts personally and i dont think this is all that big of an issue true i would really enjoy being able to train 3 toons hell id settle with 2 on the same account but from ccps perspective it doesnt make sense to implement it i use the extra slots on my accounts for research and cyno alts pilots with very low sp who do only one task i probably lost a few days training them but they are incredibly useful also i know people who buy characters using in game currency and park them on accounts that they dont plan on training due to the specialized role they fill ie trade alts haulerfreighter alts exploration alts and pos gunners in specific so these extra toons are being usedi think also that the skill training queue was a buff to these characters since you can queue up all the skills you need them to do ie skills to pop cynos for example with more efficiency than previously you no longer have to babysit the toon while you spec for its purposeso yes i agree it would be nice but i also agree that ccp needs to make rl isk pedit vote for me p
i have some scheduling challenges but i will see what i can doissler
i would be willing to come and cvhat about it
best name
youd surely win a spot on the council of stellar failment
so how many glasses of orange juice does your rl company sell a day in front of your parents house
give us back our flashy space holes
anything to make them more than a waste of 2030m thumbs up
supported there should always be risk with reward
tbh throwing the sensitive elements of motherships and titans together in one topic is a bad idea it makes it too easy to go overboard with one and forget the other or even punch through changes which make sense for one type but not the othervuk best split it up since both types are not only very different but also serve different roles in game heck they even rely on very different mechanics maybe then there will be more unilateral crunch for getting the troubles tackled besides that you know ccp never likes overall changes but prefers to handle matters to the point and in specific

thumbs down i support keeping 20km onei do support the idea for a specified salvagelooting ship with tractor bonuses
supported
its a good idea but only at its wider levelthere arent any alliance levels rolesabilities yet so why not start there to include things like the same corp based roles but at an alliance level that crosses all corporations and can be audited by all directors and aboveaddressing the whole issue of alliance mechanics and allowing it to be an entitiy in its own right instead of a vague collection of corporations would only make alliances more important to the rank and file player who logs on a few hours a day but doesnt get involved with alliance stuff as to them its just people telling the corporation what to do and when
i like the idea but i can see where others might nothow about the option to switch to standings instead of a universal change
har har
easy access to info is goodhave the counter show red if theres only say 5 days left and you use gtcs
while were at it can we save and recall the reason for setting the standing plus the date and person in the first placemy corp is 45 years old now and we have no clue why some outfits were given 5 standing nor when nor by whom
supporting a moar proper ships threadnone of this t3faction bull moar proper ships kthx
hells yes i take my ships like i take my coffee and my minmatar
if you mean as a faction bs only if there are thukker and intaki ones not sure what one caldari could have as an equivalent achura maybeunless ofc it is a t2 bs then definitely just make the khanid one the amarr one
caldari control tower 50 million shields with 50 thermal resistance then 4 million armor after thatgallente 35 million shields 25 thermal resist then 8 million armorminmatar 45 million shields with 25 thermal resistance and 50 em then 6 million armorim not sure if you have to burn through the shields if the tower is offline and i cant find the amount of structure for each tower so lets look at the armor only weakest armor is on the caldari tower with 4 million points at 1000dps that will take you 66 minutes 40 seconds then you start work on the structureeven worse this is assuming that they didnt use the 24 hours warning to online their tower so you would have to take out the shieldsso how do you plan to keep bordem at bay for that long last i heard concord would protect high sec towers so you will need to war dec themshows how much you know 1 offline towers do not have shields 2 offline tower can be killed in less than 30 minutes by 3 bss3 concord does not protect the towers and if they do put it online in the 24 hrs then the tower is technically not inactive someone is monitoring the corp mails and corporation is active i thought this whole proposal was to try and remove the defunct corporate towers of people who left the game and so forth
me facepalm
yes blowing up an unshielded tower is quite easy you should try to shoot something other than your ill informed mouth offwindjammer
new module for ships pos hacking devicenew skill pos hackingskill rank 810 reduction in chance of detectionpre requirementshacking vsalvaging vmoduleduration 600 secondschance for success 15chance for detection 110penalties100 increase in sig radius1000 reduction in velocity on activationmodule unanchor any anchored structure it is used on if successfulcan only be used on offline structuressounds like a lot of fun to me if you get detected a evemail would be sent to alliance and corp mail with the tower location saying there has been a attempt to hack security systems of the tower detection would be at the beginning of the module cycle
sorry wasted all of my ammo blowing your pathetic argument upunless you got a cap fleet in your pocket your full of crap
like ive said sounds like a new sport in the making
instead how about a set of high slot modules which you can use on towers in space to make them go away if they bother youyou could set it up to be different for each race eg amarr ships might have some kind of device that shoots some form of radiation at towers caldari could have launchers for a form of self propelled munition we could call them missles maybe gallente could use a guns based on massive magnetic fields flinging objects at towers matar would obv just have the usual barely functional ccp could even make it so that these weapons could be used on other types of space object aside from towers we could have huge internet spaceship fights oh wait
oedit sweet first on p2 oh wait this isnt caod
definitely do not support this ideago to whole space if you want a nerfed local
fixed for yahaving deyaled local wont be more realistic wait we have stargates in real life it has already been said that the stargates provide the local list lore wisetechincalmost pvp i have done has been done with the help of local to actually know theres targets in the system instead of using a probe launcher to lower my dps which already is quite pathetic
it has already been discredited that the stargates provide the local list as pilots who arrive insystem via wormholes and cynos  not the gates  show up in the local list
right and if you fly into a wh system you read something about a beacon for the local chat
this needs to be done all the scam spam makes eve look trashy to new players gold sellers are pretty rampant as well
surely this was fixed long agoim certain this was fixed shortly after empyrean ageif not it does need a fixthen again fail warfare guys in 00 lawwl fail warfare is for people who dont have what it takes to make it in 00 every single time ive seen them goto 00 they got obliterated
does seem a little silly tbh
how is this meant to make sense
im told by people in the programming industry that there are other ways by which ccp could if it wished detect and thus ban macro usersafaik none of the methods these guys so patiently try to explain to me with limited results have been used by ccpi cant believe it is because ccp isnt smart enough to implement them or cant find someone to hire who already knows so i suspect that outing macro users is a strategic low priority task at ccp
omg we have to worry about bot miners and now ppl who cant name a jet can with the eve timer showing on their screen maybe we can develop a game that is 90 afk just alot of rewards and medals for time served in training
you necrod a thread for a trollyou really need a break from this game
today im in amarr space but doing missions for a gallente agent at quafe in order to improve my minmatar standing indirectlyso this quafe agent asks me to pop some amarr ships on the intercept the saboteurs mission umm  logic error  in amarr space amarr ships arent saboteurs theyre the home team so they wouldnt be smuggling a virus in to attack an amarr world now would theyit seems that the mission generation system doesnt check for the sovereignty of the systems where the mission will take place it should and then generate only those missions that make sense in the context where the job will be locatedintercept the saboteurs blood raiders would work fine so would sansha or any other pirate factioni suspect that this sort of error is possible any time the targets are one of the empire factions and the station is located within an opposing empirefairly obviously since the empires are not formally at war with each other the stations of their opponents are still functioning further to stay functioning no gallente agent who is in amarr space will be giving out any assignments to whack amarr military units  or his station would be seized by the local empire amarr in this casethanks for your time
it has been far too long since this topic was brought up i think mainly due to the fact that there has been little response until now as we speak the csm is meeting to discuss many new revamps and this is one of them until then i have to ask just how do you remove all the old corpmail so new members dont get a billion messages to sort through on day one
you highlight each message and delete themhave to be ceodirectoror communications officer or something
the ceodirector deletes them  which let me tell you is a bad mechanic when the ceo thinks hes just deleting them from his own inbox i assume this is one of the many things that will change when the new mail client comes in soontm though
didnt say it was good just to make sure i wasnt observed to be trolling  o pthey need to allow the sorting of those evemails or they need to adopt a forum board attitudelike gmails convo chains
the mail system will be revamped as a part of the cosmos project as far as i understand
and why the hell arent they banning the freaking ip for the accountbecause ccp cant there are way many isps that assign ip numbers temporarily only when a user is connected i had this with my almost always on dsl service through the teleco  they gave me a new ip number every time the system kicked me off and i got back onbtw blocking a character should made the local client omit his nonsense from all chat i thought it used to do this but i keep seeing the dang spam
i have been scanning posts looking for intelligent conversations on why i should be pushed into low sec or 00 if i am comfortable playing my type of game in high sec is eve player driven or not the manipulation of nerfing the rock size and regeneration of belts is the same as evercraft making manufacturing limited that is steering the game not allowing natural progression there is a huge portion of players who enjoy research  manufacture  missioning ect and not losing a ship a day in low sec our corp and alliance have not enough players who can gather at the same time to run in packs as an earlier post suggests why do i have to play a pvp or pirate game so you can get better rewards when you are suggesting limiting my game play is that not very one sided many ppl in hs are squeling about the game being run to please the pvp see there are two sides to every story thanks for reading all the way thru
no simple incentive would ever workbecause if lowsec becomes more profitable then people who dont fear it already are going to monopolize and farm it pirates and large farming alliances learn to blobbecause pirates will go back to lowsec to hunt you that much harder whatever the reward if you die everytime you set foot out of highsec then you dont profitso you still woudnt go to lowsec either you learn to love pvp and join a pvp first oriented corp or you fail
incentives wont work  but not for this reason nonpirates and nonblob pilots can do very well in low sec and 00 those who want the freedom of living outside highsec dont need incentives those who need incentives will never move
exactlyi will go to lowsec when the profits from going there exceed the value of the expensive ships and implants i will lose because i went thereid love to try mining lowsec ore just to see the stuff even at the iskhour loss id rather mine an itty 3 full of zydrine andor megacyte in one go than spend half a day each week picking up buy orders at 30 different stations but if people perceive doing mining as boring they perceive watching someone else mine as even more boring  thus the difficulty of enlisting enough people to make sure that my retriever and my iteron get into and back out of low sec intactsome people like pvp  they think being shot at is fun and dont care about being broke thats fine ill sell them ammo modules ships etcbut im not going to provide them with a fat helpless target if i dont have reasonable confidence that being a target in lowsec is going to turn a much greater profit than mining veld in highsec building stuff i know i can sell for at least 50 profit and turning that 50 profit into 500 profit on the market with buy and sell orders
there are multiple avenues that could be taken to support this outcome more players in low sec and even deep spacethe one that immediately leaps to mind is to move the mission agents so that example 2 times the agent level plus one times the sign of the agent quality plus the security status of the system may not exceed some fixed value 12 perhapsif something like this was done all those lvl 4 19 and 20 agents could not be found in any space of higher security than 03 this would cause the mission running guys to vacate high sec form into bands and groups or even corps and invade low sec in order to get the very profitable missionsand out there theyd have many a battle with the player pirates  both because the pirates might try to gate camp a low sec route and because the pirates use probes to find the mission sites and invade them to gank the mission runners and steal their modsyour thoughts
troll
its called sarcasim look it up
a better solution would be to flag the ganglinker for aiding an enemy when they turn the links on
implants are a luxury for those who can afford it so i dont think there should be insurance for itsuicide ganking well i enjoy it sometimes
sometimes you die its a part of this game if you think that concord should protect you 247 maybe you should try to find something else to playsuicide ganking is fine infact its more than fine its good you think that grinding plexes to get faction loot is any more taxing or difficult than finding a good target to gank no and you need to realize that everyone in eve wants a piece of the lewt pie
i would first like to ask why ankh replies to posts asking questions of the csm candidatessnarki think that the insurance system is inherently flawed it needs work this is something id like to explore and expand upon as a csm however if you say that concord kills should not be viable for payouts then what about kills by empire npcs in missions if i take the enemies abound mission versus gallente and get killed should i get a payout even though i was technically engaging empire npcs what about faction warfare fighters destroyed by enemy police npcsi agree with les brains that implants are a luxury not a necessity to eve i think that if module insurance comes about i havent decided how i feel about this yet implant insurance will certainly follow but i feel that the premiums should be higher if youre taking a risk with a head full of snakes you should pay good money to protect that investment of course establishing insurance values on many implants will require an overhaul of the ship insurance system insuring based on market averages rather than npc build coststldr for now concord kills should still get payouts no implant insurance
i think when it is an act of piracy for money gain on a ship concord should cofiscate the insuranse payout as a fine for crimes against the empire it wouldnt cut down on piracy altogether as there are some people ingame who like to play that role but insurance fraud ingame should be the same as real life
oh look more anonymous alts voicing support
your alts you mean
i dont use posting altsthat said it seems clear someone does and that someone wants to display take care in a positive light or rather is just interested in misrepresenting the community response to everything take care does
look im not going into discussion with you any more as its totally pointless and youre not listening to what we have to say and youre not going to consider voting for erik anywayi dont care what the pro and contra alts do there are alts on both sides of the fence it seems they do not belong to take care so erik is not responsible for them and no attention should be paid to itend of discussion
incidentally my shortlist would be lark omber and erik would beid say youve successfully poisoned quite some number of votes he would have hadthen again if erik actually makes an effort im sure he can reverse the damage youve done and may tunr out to be a good csm candidate albeit on limited issues and not on the broad spectrum of topics you claim
heres my problemank is answering most of the questions thats fine they think alike im surebut the take care party isnt going to iceland erik is and as far as i can tell hell have serious problems expressing his opinions on his own no handholding outside of the forums
im a candidate that doesnt champion one issue in particulari have my pet peeves as everyone does industry is a chore 00 warfare sucks missions are repetitive and unvaried features are incomplete and frequently broken to name a fewmy first interest is in making sure all play styles are available to everyone wether you want to mission produce stuff moonmine rat plex engage in fw lowsec pvp 00 warfare or god forbid piracyas part of the csm for every vote i cast i examined the impact every change request had on each playing style and made sure that the changes were balanced thats what im about
on a note unrelated to my current campaign i would like to compliment sencnes and the folks at rebellion against big irreversible dinks rab1d on their good humor sportsmanship and understanding my hats off to you guys
im finding this quite disturbing too especially since youre still posting as cat and not in the rp section of the forums even though your csm campaign has begunand instead of updating your campaign site as was promised by yesterday
yeahthis is a bit too much on the weirdside of weird for me pretending to be a young girl to annoy peopleseriously dude
well that would have been my vote ya hadsome very nice sounding proposals thereespecially better destruction effectsbetter sound to go with it could be nicethe groaning sound cap ships made in hw2 as the internal bulkheads blew out was awsomeadded to the whole feel of carnage
hias a long time friend of weazy and after being through many corps andor alliances with him i can honestly say that he does have a firm grasp on game mechanics because i know he used to be the biggest carebear in eve and now hes hungry for pvp just the same way so he has the knowhow to make 00 a better place since hes been on both sides of the fence so to speakbeing in his roams when he was fcing was a learning experience and was a good time regardless of how rich he is what alliance or corp hes in he never stops enjoying the game and hes a real standup honest guy  although this will seem as a biased post its notcheerswhoochec
im 21
well its impolite to ask a woman her age  but i am 34 p

im not trying to start another arguement its apparent this thread doesnt need another one but in your video you state that take care represents the people in small corporations and npc corps doesnt this refute your statement of all playstyles alliance management does seem to be a style of play that attracts people to the political dynamic of eve
i thought my ego is inflated
its 6 months old thats hardly outdatedand even then are you suggesting that take care used to be a political party because if you think its outdated then the only logical conclusion is that you acknowledge that take care was political party
theres no difference between when you are being you and when you are being a csm member whenever you engage with ccp you engage as a csm member i also seem to recall that you state on your take care site that you are all about engaging with ccp in a professional manner if you cant separate your own opinion from your csm opinion then you shouldnt be doing any kind of talkingand let me refresh your mindwhen you send that response to ccp a majority of the csm was quite angry with you over it why for the very same reason that its now being used against you its unprofessional and its not something which the csm should be doing
1 i never used the cloaking exploit actually i was the one making phone calls to ccp and urging them to get it fixed get your facts straight2 the standing system is not an exploit and working as intended once again get your facts straight3 anyone with an iota of insight would call you a liar and a trolland please outline how you would represent casual npc corp players that just want to run missions and mine in highsec
it doesnt say npc corps anywhere and take care represents all playstyles as said over and overtake care is not a political party
but it does say that take care is for individualists and small corporationsyou arent answering my the question now eitherbut nice try at avoiding what your candidate said during last csm election period
not true the majority of the csm was quite pleased with it as i said exactly what most people where thinking at least im not ccps  as the answers we got were less than satisfactory and accepting them would have harmed ccps and the csms credibility in the long run ccp laughed about it the csm laughed about it and the only one griping about it is you most importantly we got the answers we and the player base deserved answers which we probably wouldnt have gotten if the csm had remained docile and quiet so yes you can thank me nowdont pull more fabrications out of your ass your credibility has already taken a few dents in this thread
amongst others yes you might want to listen to the sentence we speak before that one which you conveniently choose to ignoretake care is representing all playstyles in evefact is that i dont know why he said that and neither do youfact is that i have said that take care is not a political party you can repeat whatever you like as many times you want but that doesnt make it true
fabrications which can be backed up by mails and chat logs but wtf
but seeing as you claim 2 entirely different things which one should we trustits like a communistic government saying we represent everybody and then a few seconds later saying we represent the eliteedit and reading your websitewhats up with thatbut your own candidate stated otherwise who should we trust you or erik
funny as i got a lot of mails and chatlogs proving the contrary youre clearly talking out of your asswhat part of amongst other things did you miss are you even capable of reading what i saymore examples on how we represent all playstyles in evehow about a recent statement
no im clearly not able to read actually its an example of how you dont represent all playstyles in eve6 months old statement is a recent statement
clearlytake care represents all playstyles in eve well except trolls maybethere are far more recent statements how about this for recent take care is not a political party
yeah that must be why ive raised so many factional warfare issues and some 00 issuesway to rip a comment over a year old out of context way to go
i dont see any 00 issues but the issue by darius johnson which somehow is listed as your issue
perhaps you should read why exactly its listed as my issue for the same reason its also listed as vuks issue
i really liked the video nice work
my dear i am not running for csm nor am i proposing a puppet to do so for meyou really should stop dismissing people that disagree with you and take cares policy as liars trolls and idiots i understand that your personal convictions might leave you to believe this is the case just as they have lead you to take credit for the work of other csm members and earned the delightful moniker take credit but as a former csm member and someone whom is pushing and apprentice into the csm that has more in common with a hand puppet or catspaw than a free thinking individualthis is not acceptable behavior for anyone that intends to stand for a democratic bodywhen you and by this i mean take care through the medium of erik are ready to start taking this seriously as the process it is and actually engage properly with the people you want to vote for erik rather than dancing around issues spreading misinformation and attempting to discredit opposing opinions through any means necessary then perhaps some progress will be madeuntil then take care remains a partisan political party in the community pursuing its own agenda rather than one born of discussion and compromise with the playerbase
fw is not a appropriate sample of the pvp play styles in eveespecially when your personal efforts in factional warfare have been to avoid pvp whenever possible you are infamous in your own militia for such and the lengths to whch you have gone to do soyour continued assumption of credit for the work of and input of others on issues raised to the csm not only further damages trust in take care but is an insult to your fellow csm members of your term and thier work time and effortout of context hardlyyou are campaigning with the same mindset you did originally and take care mirrors that your continued attempts to misrepresent this become increasingly transparent as do your personal motivations and the imposition of egoyou are not representative of all play styles take care is not representative of all play stylesit is not reasonable to assume eriks term on the csm will be a fair and unbiased balanced period of development based on your assertions and the composition of take care and eriks own personal experience
that worry that im eriks socalled puppet master has already been answered and simply is not the case im not taking credit for any of the other csm members work what has been claimed in the video and the campaign text is the bare truth as has already been proven im not going to repeat myself every page or two and it would be nice if people would not ask the same silly questions repeatedly oh but were already engaging properly with the people that are going to vote for us or have done so in the past elections keeping up our promise to represent players instead of personal agendas the thing is that most of these questions are not coming from people that would ever consider voting for erik nor do the people that ask them have any interest in our answers unless they can find some other things to twist for their own purposes and use in their next series personal attackssame thing with xavier asking for my view on walking in stations me spending time on an answer for him which promptly got ignored in favor of more slander yeah really constructive and a great display of desire to have a productive debate were taking this very serious and ive personally had hundreds of emails with feedback and concerns which i all answered which i think is dozens of times more productive than arguing with some people on the forums that are only out for blood wouldnt you agree
thanks for the compliment as that mindset is one that a lot of players want to see based on past election resultsif you dont like it then take your vote somewhere else plenty of l33t pvp candidates out there for you problem solved
clears throatlavista and ankhe please take 10 steps backwards and shut the hell upi didnt post this thread so it could be burned to the ground by a hundred derails i posted it because like everyone interest should be pursued and viewedankhe was csm she is not running now erik now needs to come forward with some delivery of his own and this incessant bantering needs to stop im serious if it doesnt ill pod both of you just because i am a very very bored eve player right now and i have nothing better to doi mean it i want to hear less out of you two and more out of the general public
why are you still allowed to post
to try to answer on your original question then although it may be a bit difficult after all that racketi liked the movie although erik seemed a bit shyhowever i also interpret his demeanor as cautions and considerate in my humble opinion the fact that he doesnt engage in pointless arguments with every challenger is a good sign i think erik is a restrained type a very good qualification for a csm i think and in that sense a complete opposite from ankhe who has a much more fiery temperament she seems like a kind of crusader and provoked she uses passionate words to get her point across unfortunately people like that are easily misinterpreted misquoted and soon the mob is shouting witch witch burn burn  objectivity goes out of the window this tread so far is a real psing contest its sad
look while somewhat entertainingly sad this whole banter has gotten out of hand with the questions and verbatim responses it makes me think the players are talking to gms about the party that isnt and theyre responding with im sorry our logs show nothing of the sorti of all people know what rl is like but we havent hardly heard a peep from erik since he was announced as a candidate therefore i would like to throw down the gauntleterik if youre still around and still care about this election please drop by and answer a few questions for us1 this representation by your mentor has gotten out of hand what are your thoughts about some of the comments that have been posted in this thread2 is this lack of response indicative of your term in the csm and if not why havent you stopped by a computer for 5 minutes to say hi to the people and maybe even answer a question from your voting poolthank you and i look forward to getting some opinions straight from the horses mouth as it were and none of this misrepresentation
this is not slander slander is when someone makes something up i dont make anything up and have the documents and chatlogs to prove it however accusing me of slander lies and fabrications will not change the factual reality and wont convince intelligent players that you are correct also i asked the question to see if it really is a serious aim of take credit as i find it incredulous that someone running for csm is pushing a issues about a feature that isnt even ingame yet nor may be for the next csm term and b facebook crap and the like as something that csm and ccp should be spending their time and resources on despite numerous other features and improvements that should have a much higher prioritywhen someone campaigns on the basis of past experience of one of the party members it should be expected that questions are asked of assertionsclaims and performance of that member and by default the party thats politics erik i believe is running for the csm as the spokesperson and csm candidate so voters would logically expect him to answer questions and clear up inconsistencies in claims etc as erik will be subject to the csm disclosure rules presumably there are topics and issues he can not discuss with anyone outside of csm including party membersfounders hence its right and proper that voters learn of his stancesviewspolitics before voting for him other csm candidates who may be working with him also wish to get to know erikin short you are now one of the hasbeen politicians of eve we arent really interested in you if we ever were please put erik onxaviery
thanks to everyone who tuned in and asked questions i hope it was informative
market pvp can be more frustrating than combat pvp but the variables that affect combat pvp are magnitudes more complex i actually run a high sec research and t2 production alt corp but if making items was the main reason i played eve then i would just quit right off the bat in a game where you have the opportunity to go out and kill things at will why would you want to do anything elsefrankly where my post was going is that killing npcs is easy and predictable and boring killing real life humans is difficult and should be balanced well or the players will find ways to exploit the flavor of the month i want to help make sure that pvp is fair and fun not boring and predictable
people are often mistaking by dividing candidates by their type of play i can say that i am 00 player but i will wholeheartedly support any empire carebear or fw issue which is valid you can have all 9 councelors focused on fe fw or mining or whateva but if they are stupid egoistic without general knowledge of all aspects of game or all of that together be sure that none of the issues related to their play style will be pushed furtherthe thing i really respected in csm 20 is that councelors who didnt have much experience with 00 sov mechanics or supercaps my main area of interest showed really big wish to actualy understand what were the issues and constructively participated in discussion at same time couple of us who were not so into carebear side of the game also tried to give our best to understand the issues they brought diversity is what csm really makes so greaton top of that i disagree that majority of candidates are exclusively for pvp for the end i as a voter would never vote for someone cause of his prefferable area of interest but because of my impression of him as person and his general knowledge about the game
in this regard then i agree with you pvp is full of flavor of the month variety is the spice of life with this in mind i would love to encourage new eden to take a bite out of a jalapeno and run with it

theres also caldariminmatar missing as a faction i wonder if theyll ever implement them along with gallenteamarr theyd have to get their own space like the other pirate factions some mordus ships would be cool too
might be just a teeeeeny bit op as you describe it but yeah missile using armour bs plx
eom ships pleasewe need more npc 00 space anyway
nice supportedthey look cool the models are ingame maybe some day we get these shiny black amarr hulls
for the record it took 2 hours on sisi to blow up a large caldari tower that was offline this was with 45 dreads and a few bs i could only imagine the horror of trying to with bs and lower of course i believe a majority of towers in highsec are smalls anywayamarr  unlimited ammo  free stuff of course time  effort  i support some sort of cleanup thoughbut theres no half thumbsup so i guess signed
i would like all anchored structures to unanchor after an idle period cans included unanchored objects would then be subject to trash cleanup after a period of time being unanchored this basically means that you can let the players have a chance at the trash cleanup before it is removed to oblivion
towers that go off line losing being swept up by a salvage crew makes a ton of sense and createsa profitable careerb forces owners to properly manage their resourcesc avoids having to potentially war dec goonswarm so you can do thisi support this as its a career i really want to get into 0 buying stuff is for the mission runners hard core people steal  explode other peoples gear and sell it

my turninstant local makes the game safer for players who want to avoid pvp giving them a real chance of survival when paying attention by giving them a time window to escape certain death already in game so no development time needed and been working for years and the game is still a success helps all pvpers to find each other you warp into system and instantly know if there is something to kill and dont need to spend time finding out if the ships on scanner are targets helps alliances to effectivelly defend their space from invaders and protecting vulnerable carebear operations vital for their survval recent speakers local eve is a game with its own rules every rule and mechanic in game is ccps decision even if they are not realistic allows cloaking ships to actually be invisible and gang carebears easier introduces more opportunities to gank people you can not compare wspace with kspace  with current probing system you anyway can only find someone if he is long enough on 1 spot carebearcampafk which introduces more static pvp makes scouting actually require some skill dramatically increasing the risk for carebears with no reward as compensation no way to know for sure if the ships on scanner is friend or foe till on same grid

stop the spam its everywhere its annoying and its always the same thing fixing the decimal display will make local readable again outside trade hubs
supported nobodys even dumb enough to fall for them anyway so youre only really nerfing spam
i spotted a new variant of this scam today in rens albeit the spam was nowhere near as bad as jita spam the difference was that a contract now reads 80000000100 ive added an amendment to the proposals to compensate although this certainly makes suggestion 1 more valid
this has probably been discussed before however since it isnt implemented here it is againfleet commanders should through the fleet ui be able to discern all fleet member ship types by size f  frigate c  cruiser bs  battleship etc next to the pilots name without asking players to spam chat channels with their ship type this would also help with squad composition to see whether people were in the correct squads because organization requires too much time especially when fleets reach obscene sizes of 100 another related easeofuse for fleet ui is automatic squad watch lists aka group ui in other games add a button to the fleet ui that will toggle your squads watch list hopefully with the ship type size addition listed above now when people enter your squad program it such that they are automatically entered into that squads watch list and removed when they change squad manually entering players into a watch list and spamming chat for ship types or wondering if squads are setup correctly feels a bit silly when all you want to do is get to the action
yeah it needs a lot of work problem is but the level of data involved in a large fleet is fairly monumental there are certainly better ways to present it than the status quo but im not wholly convinced that there exists a way to do it that everyone would consider to be any good things like this are why im such a moddableui enthusiast still supported  this would certainly be a good start

might as well make the game install software on our pc that detects macro programs and disables them thats not done in any other games oh waiti dont see that happening but its a possibilityalthough that would completely break the current winebased eve for linux and make me a sad panda either way not supported i get annoyed with captchas on other sites as it is and sometimes even fail them on occasion
hehe i dont see a problem with this dont really need it but just because people are against it ill support it i mean cmon its not game breaking is it
well it has been awhile since the carrier nerf which disallowed anything which isnt ammocharges in the cargo of ships in the ship maint bayi would like reasonable stuff to be allowed in nowliquid ozone for cyno shipswhich can be all shipsisotopes for black opseven the blockade runnersi would also like assembled cans to be allowed in cargos with the same rules only ammo and charges if ur flying something capboosted a can of some size is advisable

not worth it absolutely no benefit apart from removing some good missions within specific parts of space and i doubt the system has the functionality to implement this anywayyou could make the same argument for eg finding serpsangels in amarr space instead of blood raiderssanshas too
angels attacking amarr space would at least make a slight amount of sense an amarr fleet attacking amarr space makes none supported though at a very low priority
supported but id put it low on the old priority listid also like to see more missions or rather a wider variety of available missions at some point as well

i personally feel that the interconnectivity between the 00 spaceholding alliance and the high sec market is essential to the delicate balance of risk vs reward for the 00 entity to remove this dependence on the high security core systems would make it too easy to bottle up in your space and never leave it something that i feel isnt a good direction for ccp and doesnt sit well with their game overview of a harsh and dangerous universe it is no secret that i think that the balance of risk vs reward is somewhat in favor of the spaceholding alliance but some of the recent changes have addressed this issue and until it is seen how these pan out in the medium to long term i dont think there should be any dramatic changes to further destabilise what is for many players and ccp a core part of the game that isnt to say ideas shouldnt be looked at in the meantime based on the hypothetical outcomes we expect in regards to making it more difficult for the 00 spaceholding alliance to obtain the items they need for running of their poses supplying their members etc this would be very difficult to do due to the number of alts employed in the business of out of corpalliance logistics and without a dramatic change to the way in which alts work i cannot honesty see a way possible to prevent it from happening thanks for your question dex hope it helps
lets give ankh some credit tbh aside from some UFFFDber cheesy video productions i think ankh has proven an able csm member she never pretended to be a hardcore pvper but has certainly championed some important issues notably factional warfare from what ive read of the csm logs shes definitely been more up to the task than some ffs some people in csm  who a lot of people thought would be great in the role  havent attended any recent meetings which is a in disgrace imohere comes the problem though you never see a representative in any walks of life having their predecessor talk for them erik is sitting back and letting ankh speak for him he should be leading the charge with a fresh face and new ways of tackling issues important to take care its clear to most who read the thread that ankh has chosen a dud who doesnt deserve and will not win a place in the next csm
you might want to fix the actionscript error and the css errors edit these are on your site which is linked in your sig incase that wasnt obvious tbh your platform seems decent and well rounded however the fact the video is fairly average the intros nice and all but pointless in a video where you want to spend as much time as you can advertising yourself before viewers switch off combined with the fact youre touting your playstyle as a major fact and finally the fact you have the support of ankhwhatshername means my vote will go elsewhere
politics is pragmatic action for a moral purposeeveryone who wants to make herself a picture of my position as a csm candidate is invited to watch the movie read our website and on top of that read all my posts on the forum and may she and he after reading think about what i wrote for as long as i took for writing those articles for i take quite some time and put a lot of thought into my writing as a courtesy to the presumed readerwhether or not frequency as well as content of my publications are high enough and sufficiently elaborate to make me a good csm representative shall be decided by the voters my voters by the way have not yet complained about my unavailability nor lack of responsiveness much to the contrary as to what forum regulars here are stating when they have to wait here for a few days this is a forum guys  it is asyncronous and it is for 1tomany communication for my voters i have answered to interviews and questionnaires and with my voters i have exchanged evemails and i have chatted quite personal and effective i tend to believe my voters are rather not among the regular forum flamers who sketch a post in five minutes or bloat a fiveminutethought into pompous wordsin this thread my partner ankhesentapemkah got carried away by the heat of the moment you can see she is taking this very personal and replies swiftly to every post it is an ardour which is not always helpful in keeping the greater picture in sight while i might not post as many times you surely do not want to imply that has any implication on the contents of my posts hence we like to see us as a team in take care of course all team work will be compliant with the nda between csm representatives and ccp that is selfunderstood her experience as well as her vigour in pushing issues are and will be most helpful for my work which is after all representing players who come to us and ask if we would adopt their ideadiverging thoughts about priorities and the evolution of the game are intended and welcome my posts convey the profile which i stand for it is by having a profile that i can also discuss matters which i am not particularly fond of or an expert in we can have a civil discussion about them during csm meetings these will be online and i will immediately answer
fair enough lets be civil and brutally blunti am going to ask you what i think is a important question but do forgive me should i phrase myself in a brutal mannerwhat makes you different from as you identify yourself to be your predecessors successor should you be electedin other words you got any material ideas andor concepts of your own that ankhesentapemkah had no part in as i am sure many would be shocked and amazed i would as many critics me among them seems to define you as ankhesentapemkahs obedient servant than a individual with ideas of your own

wormholes ive been talking to friends and allies who have more experience than i do with wormholes sadly i just cant make myself live there just yet and the consensus im getting is that spawns need fixing initially wormholes were overpopulated with spawns and a single pilot could happen across one clear it out and live like a fat cat on exotic dancers and spiced wine for days ccp reduced the number of spawns per wormhole but left the respawn at the initial value which im told is 72 hours in general i understand that the number of spawns is not what these wormhole residents argue against but rather the respawn rate instead of producing 20 encounter spawns every 72 hours produce 24 spawns every 12 hours in this way a single group could not reap ridiculous profit from a single venture but multiple groups could over the course of the day all engage in encounters in the same wormhole if elected to the csm i will push to improve wormholes so that all of eve can enjoy tech 3
oh so youd like to get rid of the ndai really dont understand this please explain why it should be easier to live on the frontier also do you have any experience with sovereignty or pos mechanics
thanks guys any more questions or ideassomething i would love to see that i dont believe is possible is a fleet cloaker a ship which can lay a cloak on all the ships within x km in fleet combat this would be invaluable due to keeping your ship composition but they still know your numbers
1 ring mining  yes mining needs work ccp does not seem to like the way mining is right now according to januarys csm meeting and is looking for ways to to overhaul the belts and the mining mechanics itself i am sure they have pondered with this idea of enormous belts before and it is really one of the things i would like to see ccp also stated the intention to have variable rewards and this could indeed come in the form of rare materials2 renegade concord  disagreed just killing random players that happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time is silly eve favours the bold and this would not be any different from just running random database queries deleting peoples stuff if it is not avoidable by being bold then it would just lead to frustration so please elaborate this idea by adding counter measures3 player habitats  small anchorables and colonies were already brought up by the csm and ccp looked interested mmos should always have a strong sense of player ownership and any houses or other structures would give more opportunities for the individuals to build stuff in space too i do not believe that building stuff in space should be limited to corporations and alliances there should be smaller privately owned installations too4 rare materials in loot drops  while it might spice up missioning we should be very careful here anything introduced through small quantities will explode due to the sheer volume of mission runners a huge part of the mineral market comes from reprocessing mission loot and the last thing we want is to devaluate other resources ruining different carreers by flooding the market with rare goodies either the drop rate will be so low that the individual has more chances of winning a lottery in real life or the tens of thousands of mission runners will flood the market i like where you are coming from but it should be handled with extreme caution5 reducing loot drops  i believe something should be done about the flow of minerals coming from mission runners mission runners should still get enough to produce their own ammo in the middle of nowhere but the mindless steady stream of minerals should be reduced i would prefer to see other uses for dogtags for example and a shift to other types of loot6 qships  this surely makes the game more interesting i forsee some technical difficulties here but if this is possible to implement im all for it 
unfortunately i had to send what we had due to a deadline of when we can submit the list of topics for the meeting this thread can be unstickied now btw
rather than joining this discussion i posted to my campaign thread to give all voters yet one more aspect of my profile
those two still come across as huge douches sorryhow can you claim to represent all playstyles when youve never left your starting corp edit pffhahaha i guess i should have read this thread before commenting i guess this is still ankhsdfkahjsdlkfah running since i guess erik cant take the time to poke his head in and comment every once in a while
thanks for everyones participation in my previous questionnaire thread the results of which i hope to be able to present as a easytoread spreadsheet soontmnaturally my curiousity has not abated heres a couple more absurd statements designed to ignite candidates righteous ire and make them respond thoughtlessly letting everyone see their true colours  again please not only state your disagreement but also rate how vehemently you would fight for your stance on the issue in a csm meetingchoices should have consequences depending on the choice the consequence may well be irreversible that applies to the choice of race and attributes at the beginning reskilling this is not wow as much as to the decision to make enemies of factions or to go outlaw entirely trust takes a lifetime to earn and a heartbeat to give away it makes sense to lose standings much quicker through certain actions attacking factions pirating murder etc than they can ever be gained factions may still have some dealings with a known mass murderer of their own civilians but they will not likely become best friends after he did some of the same to that factions enemieswarp to zero may have seemed a boon to some but it has turned out to be a blight in the long term travelling the length and breadth of the galaxy should take considerable time not just for the feeling of travelling in endless space but more importantly to spread apart the population make warp have a certain random deviation with modules rigs and skills to increase precisioncollosion detection is already in the game its only logical to cause structure and module damage also no more shooting through asteroids and other shipsships jumping and docking from anywhere within the vicinity of a gatestation are somewhat embarassing define some cone of space where a structures tractor beams pulls ships in and docksjumps them in one nifty animationfor no apparent reason a ship is set onto a grid before the client has finished loading said gridfactions would not offer jumps and docking to wealthy capsuleers for free make us payboth fuels and crews would offer exciting new depth to capsuleers as well as extra consistencythe local channel is just silly if you want to find out what lurks in a system make some effort and use a scanner deception is a good thing think of modules that deny or even misguide scanners turning my battleship into a freighter and vice versa until im at close range to improve things for industrialists ships and other items should list their manufacturers in their name or at least on their info tabs while blueprints ought to have some random variation between them however slightinstead of just randomly creating missions on the spot when an agent is contacted missions should be drawn from a pool that reflects the needs of the corresponding agentstationfaction and may change according to player actions and global developments missions in overrun areas would become scarce and yield lower rewards while neglected agents may become desperatethe current system of shoving missions down the throat of inquiring capsuleers could be complemented by an open market for missions where players could choose from missions offered at particular stations the old system could still serve for loyalty point focused missions as well as starting or resumption points for certain mission arcswhen the bounty system is overhauled with transferable kill rights npc factions too should be able to offer missions with kill rights against players that have really low standings with themthank you for reading and commenting
1 agreeimportant as stated elsewhere i feel one of the key things about eve over any other mmo out there is that your actions have repercussions pretty much for as long as you play although remapping can be explained easily enough with the level of technology we are at in the game 2 agreeimportant basically same concept as 13 disagreeunimportant ive played before warp to zero and after it space felt much larger before warp to zero it was also a right pain int he behind when you wanted to spend time with people you know in game it was a huge timesink and the lag caused by the trillions of bms everyone seemed to have which i was guilty in part for as i used to sell the sets of bm over the escrow system was simply a pain these days the issue isnt so much one of wtz being a problem than it is agility making it impossible outside of 00 to effect someone elses ship if they are smaller than a battlecruiser apart from smartbombs on gates 4 undecidedunimportant needs analysis of the possible repercussions to know if it would be possible to implement without causing huge issues for people as well as the lag caused by the number of additional computations off the top of my head i would say it would be too easy to exploit this for harassing people from a rp perspective if my ship was that fragile id want my isk back 5 disagreeimportant the background prime fiction about the gates makes this proposition a bit nonsensical with stations you have more of a point but there is nothing to say there should be one single docking or undocking port on a station so therefore if this was enacted it would be likely that many multiple vectors of approach in and out of a station 6 agreeimportant akin to a lag discussion though 7 disagreeunimportant capusleer craft provide much more in the way of benefits for stations they dock at than they cost to sit a ship in it the crew of a battleship number in the thousands and with their shore leave they are spending money you are using the market in the stations sometimes you are using the facilities you do have to pay for occasionally such as the repair facilities in some stations all in all stations have more to gain from a capsuleer by making berthing free than they would if they charged us gates are the same thing but on a macro scale 8 disagreeunimportant crews would be nice fuel wouldnt work as our drives are meant to be self perpetuating 9 disagreeimportant whilst i love w space and the delayed local mode in it i think the tools available to us for finding out the sort of information we need is currently lacking and therefore would only support this kind of thing once there was tools already in place to allow us to decide how much information we need to know personally i like the idea of hacking stargates information banks as was proposed by one of my alliance mates a while ago with penalties if you mess it up 10 agreeunimportant would be nice if a counter device was intorduced but hardly something to spend much time over 11 agree  disagreeunimportant names of manufacturers is a bit of fluff which i suppose someone would like but i have yet to see the attraction myself despite being a large scale producer on my alt blueprints are already variable by their me and pe levels 12 agreeimportant i would love to see this sort of thing introduced dynamics of mission running would be much more interesting with this in place if you extend it out to include variable quality based on how much agents are used i would sign on for it straight away 13  not sure i really get what you are meaning with this one if you mean you select whichever mission you want to do for lower rewards or something then no way 14 disagreeimportant just no seriously transferable kill rights should be something a player choses to accept not be forced to do by an npc unless it outside of the general missions arc
1 consequences i believe that a certain amount of leniency should be observed in the area of attributes allowing a 1time reassignment the fact is that many older players making their first characters had no idea what attributes did when i created garthran i put most of my points in memory intelligence and charisma the reassignment of attributes allowed me to create a training profile that was more in line with the skills im interested in as far as outlaws poor faction standings etc i think that the game has to be slightly more lenient than say real life in order to still be fun to all those involved this is an issue of minor importance to me2 standings i agree positive standings and security status should be more difficult to gain than to lose further if you have previously had poor standings with a particular group it should be more difficult to recover those standings i think this relates to the previous question and ill reiterate that i believe that choices should not be permenantly gamealtering but they should have significant consequences this is an issue of minor importance to me3 warp to zero i tend to agree i was pleased that ccp chose to keep the autopilot warpto distance at 15km to leave afk player vulnerable however warptozero still allows players to escape pursuers at gates and stations with minimal risk a certain amount of deviation say up to 10km adjustable by basic navigation skills would be an acceptable solution to me im primarily a carebear but gankers need love too especially in lowsec where they cant use bubbles to their advantage this is an issue of moderate importance to me4 collision on the whole i agree i know several friends who would return to eve if ramming was a viable kill tactic however im sure this would bring about nothing more than a generation of nano battleships bumping capitals to death also the shooting through objects continues to be a source of annoyance to me from an immersion standpoint but i imagine the implementation of obstruction would be fairly difficult as the game currently stands and furthermore ship facing would have to become a concern as not all turrets can actually face all targets but they continue to all fire regardless so while in theory i agree in application i believe i disagree this is an issue of minor importance to me5 dock points this is similar to point 4 in that i agree in theory but think the implementation would be more trouble than its worth also unless there was a specific autopilot function to pilot your ship into the dockjump point this kind of interaction would be too precise of a navigational exercise for eves current piloting system this is an issue of minor importance to me6 grids im afraid i dont quite understand the situation perhaps because i have never encountered it as a problem ships are given lock protection while undocking to allow the client to catch up and similarly have an initial cloak when they jump through gates this doesnt seem to be a problem to me this is an issue of minor importance until someone can convince me otherwise7 docking fees i agree fees would be nominal but they would create an isk sink in much the same way that missions create a source of isk this could help to drive down inflation in all honesty and im a fan of giving people more bang for their buck this is an issue of moderate importance to me8 crewfuel propose a rational system to me and ill agree to it thus far in browsing the ideas forums ive found few propositions that i agree with most involve leveling your crew which im against however crew and fuel management would increase immersion for me which i am in favor of this is an issue of moderate importance to me
9 local the more i play the more i agree leave local in place but make the channel list speakers only however i agree with heartstone that before local can be removed certain tools to ascertain a systems capuleer population in a general way must be introduced this is an issue of moderate importance to me10 disguises i think that a sensor deception would be simpler to implement than a physical deception and i agree with it more a high slot device of some kind to have a ship scan as something else with scripts to modify what it scans as i would be agreeable to assisting such a module into implementation but ship disguises qships decoy ships anything that would make a ship literally appear to be something else i am not in favor of this is an issue of moderate importance to me11 blueprints with the namestamps i know some industrialists produce with one character and sell with another keeping the producer anonymous the attachment of namestamps would make such anonymity difficult honestly the only purpose i can see it serving is epeen and while im all for occasionally epeen reinforcement its hardly a priority for me in terms of the variation in blueprints im all for variety but some things are expected to be consistent blueprint variations in such a technical time would be unlikely at best this is an issue of no importance to me12 mission pools this could be an interesting means of dispersing mission hubs a more detailed description of implementation would help me support this issue however while i agree that level 4s are grossly profitable it will take more than dispersion to counter the massive influx of isk via mission runners tthis is an issue of moderate importance to me13 mission market would most likely increase the isk flow from mission runners into the market and would reward people that camp the market looking for the best missions and hurt the casual mission runners in my opinion could honestly encourage isk farming i disagree with this idea this is an issue of moderate importance to me14 npc bounty assignment in any other game but eve i would support this but one of eves big selling points is that its playerdriven allowing players to become enemies of the game rather than enemies of other players is in direct conflict with this i disagree with this idea this is an issue of moderate importance to me
to clear this upthe idea about 13 is that there would be a mission board on every station where agentsstationsfactions would offer jobs they need to done by capsuleers those missions would yield regular isk rewards but strongly reduced loyalty points once a player signed up for it the mission would be stricken from the board preventing overuse much as 12 above instead a counter mission might be spawned at an opposing factions station conventional missions from agents would be reserved for actually serving the corp as a loyalist giving access to those special rewards corps only hand out to themnpc bounty missions as suggested in 14 of course would only be made available as described in 13 not forced upon players to keep milking that agent
more controversy this way
1 disagreenot applicable  as a csm rep our primary responsibility will be to be the relay for as much of the playerbase as possible as it is this would preclude us from worrying about the solo player assuming solo play in eve is something not many people do two things however work against this idea primarily the idea of solo play being a minor part of eve is an erroneous one a large percent of the playerbase occasionally run a mission or rat in belts or produce things to sell on the market all of these can be solo activities just because a player doesnt define him or herself as a solo player this doesnt mean he spends no time using content that could be classed as solo indeed most of the so called solo activity occurs either in groups or in the framework of a joint effort of some sort in short i dont believe there is a clear distinction between solo content and multiplayer content the second reason why this should not be the case is that the csm rep also has a secondary duty of care for those people who are less vocal than others but are part of our community much of the analysis for this group will have to come from secondary data of course but this doesnt mean these people should be ignored 2 agreeish sorta but not in the way you thinkimportant eve is a game lets get this straight from the offset no matter who you are or how invested in it you are it is a game for a large minority of people however part of the fun of the game comes from the immersion in the lore of the game therefore attempting to disconnect the fun from the immersion side of the game is a false concept in regards to them taking a backseat to a streamlined game this is again a false concept as one of the primary ways to introduce increased immersion in the game is to make the game more seamless to reduce the number of breaks from the immersion it causes in other words focusing on making the gameplay more efficent and streamlined benefits everyone so therefore it should be one of the primary focuses 3 disagreeimportant maintenance improvements on what is already in the game and balancing of what is in the game is quite important to allow the previous point to happen whilst there is something to be said for new shiny things i loved the last patch for example and definitely something to be said for keeping the game alive through balancing the player dropout rate with new players these things will also be helped by streamlinign the game by keeping everything that is already int he game running as best it can 4 agreeunimportant whilst i think roleplaying is an important aspect of eve it is enjoyed by a minority of people within the game myself included currently there are many ways in which we can use existing and already planned mechanics such as wis to roleplay with would i like to see more done for my people yes do i think it should be given a priority over other issues that affect all players such as point 2 no5 disagreeunimportant insurance mechanics in eve work fine as they are in my opinion sure there are things that dont make sense from a real world perspective but the majority of them are there to benefit the mechanics rather than the immersion aspect as for ships becoming better with age well that seems to me to harp to a secondary xp gain ala wow or any other levellign based system 6 disagreeimportant like much of what i said for point two i dont believe new player content and other content can be as clearly delineated as the proposition suggests yes there are things such as the introduction missions and the new startup content that are for new players only but in general much of what we use is used by the new players as well besides there has been a great deal of content for the more mature player recently as well i general i think the balance is just about right
6 cont additonally i think the new player content is a key part of player retention which if we wish to keep playing this game for a while is kind of important 7 disagreeunimportant customizable ships ergh pink thoraxes with purple heads i think not aliiancecorp logoed ships maybe if it can be shown it will cause not lag which i have yet to believe has been shown fully despite what the proposition here suggests 8 agreelow importance but not unimportant an increase in the amount of background and feel in the universe we fly through in will be immensely welcome by a number of players however there are more important things to consider i think some resources might be allocated to this is i were in charge which even as csm if i get voted in i wont be but the majority of resources should be put to the aforementioned streamlining process 9 disagreeimportant npc corporations serve a purpose for those players not yet ready or not yet willing to dip thier toes into the world of player corporations they are somewhere when someone can take a break from them as well leave them alone 10 see 811 again same basic proposition as number 4
i play at 40 fullhd 1920x1080 my eyes
whats wrong with it ive not seen anything wrong with the font
yes
a boost for all of them would be niceespecially the vengeance
so very trueout of interest aside from the massive failure that is rockets do you think that there are any other issues with the veng for example lack of gridcpu i only ask because it seems that rockets are high up on the big ccp list of stuff we really need to fix if they were to get a boost and bring the venghawk dps up to a reasonable standard with the existing damage bonus what would you guys suggest for the 4th bonus for the vengeance
i could not agree more with this post frankly whoever thought it was a good idea to implement the system this way should be fired
fantastic idea  sort it out ccp i dont care how long you take over it
while i am certain that supercaps could be improvedchanged i am also pretty certain that that alone isnt enoughone major promlem imo is that in the large scale of things they are built way to easily just look at the numbers of titans  their cost and necessary effort was maybe balanced back when they were introduced in 20056 but these days they are far to easy to obtainthat starts with logistical changes ranging from jfs to jump bridges sovereignity 4 which decreases risk and the simple matter of 00 income being way higher than back then panyway in summary  ms as well as titans should be way harder to build and cost more  pespecially if buffed
yes hell yes
i approve of this message
yes and please also in the reprocessing window
there are already a lots of data sheets and graphs you just need to findalso make missile sniping viable
i dont like this thread it mixes whining with legit issues blurring the twono support for a full range missile unnerf they were broken before patch some missiles need help and should get changed like lolkets

omg yes yes yes
post in need of extra bumpage above all the  i want new ships threds oo
nice idea
this cant be bad
i dont really understand what youre proposing here tbhare you asking there to be a khanid faction battleship therefore becoming the 6th race of faction battleships alongside the ones that are currently in the game machariel rattlesnake nightmare vindicator and bhaalgornor are you asking for there to be another t2 battleship in the game but built by khanid innovations just like in the ship descriptions of many t2 ships they state which corporation developer built the ship  for example the curse and vengeance are khanid shipsif you are asking for the former then your proposal should state the need to add a khanid cruiser and frigate as well i think that would be a nice idea as ive noticed khanid appear to be the 6th pirate faction but not really heh it would also be good to see some more original hulls and shiptypes for the faction ship users as well as seeing what bonuses or role they could fillif youre suggesting the want or need for another t2 battleship then again you need to think about the other races firstly what role would this t2 battleship fill is it neccessary how would it affect the dynamics of pvp and pveit sounds to me like you would just like to see a cool looking black amarr battleship which isnt a good enough reason to introduce a new ship classthe armour tanking missile boat would be decent but how is it much different from the numerous shield tanking missile ships aside from variety
look at the nightmare and the amarr battleships they function very differently1 for more faction ships
i like idea but there wil only bring this if they can bring a new t2faction bs for all races not just amarrcaldaribut othernews i support as it may make em do the other faction
khanid faction geddon with torp and maybe also cruise rof bonus please
thisnone of you are considering the bigger picturewhat would the caldari minmatar gallente getthis isnt an eve ship wishlistthalane you need to expand on the topicthumbs down from me sorry
booo hoooo it wouldnt be faaiir does ford check in with honda to make sure honda has a new model comming out at the same time as fords next model ship makers should be in competition nowhere is it written that everyone has to get cookies at the same time note i dont actually care very much if this proposal ever happens as i just dont like the if i cant have a cookie nobody can have a cookie positions
its already unbalanced because of sansha ships so who cares but i wouldnt mind a faction drone battleship for gallentes 
infested tentacledomi plx
my point here is that if youre going to ask for a new tech 2 bs you cant say ccp wed like a new tech 2 amarr battleship pls because i like black ships but dont bother making ones for the caldari gallente or minmatar because i dont care about themyou have to give thought to balance issues and follow the trend the game currently takes and im not saying that thalane has this attitude but she obviously hasnt thought her proposal throughat the moment for every tech 2 ship that comes out every race has one and they are balanced somewhat fairlyplease state an example of when a tech 2 ship has been released and there has been no counterpart for the other races struggling thats because there isnt such a caseso i am not saying if i cant have a cookie nobody can have a cookie like you seem to thinkalso your statement about ship makers being in competition is invalidin this game ship makers are limited to what ccp allow them to make there is no scope for us to build something unique therefore it does not follow the rl example you have giventhat competition for ship makers comes at the market where there are price wars
the op said nothing about tech 2 shipsi have a question for you lyra faction ships that use gallente skillsnavy shipsserpentisangelguristastotal 4and for amarrnavysanshablood raiderstotal 3how is that for fair 
i need a reason to start learning caldari dread skill  pls make phoenix an usefull ship currently you are better off in a torp raven wich will do much more dps than this huge crap during any op even if it is pos shooting
ill make my point with an example  small milita fleet of arbitrators engages a dominix if everyone in the fleet is from a different corp there is no easy way to quickly differentiate between purple blue and target drones unless youre lucky enough to have the drone aggrodrones already inherit corp ownership as well as wt ownership from the launching vessel all we need is to inherit fleet and milita and this infuriating issue disappears
because im that vain i want at least 1 support
supportedif i want to be popping hostile drones i dont need to be searching through a list of every drone on the battlefield in order to find them just show me the relevant ones
supported
gotta support not just cause half my kills are d from this guys fleets 
entirely reasonable
this seems to make sense
no no support for you two reasons1 i dont want to bring a prober everytime i go on a roam2 i dont want to have a probe launcher fitted to my ratting shipslocal is a benefit to both attackers and defenders its not like it favours anybody
talk about being lazy beyound belief not agreeing use the programmer time for something better
simply and good
makes too much sense
did u know you can remove them by yourself just accept them and they wont show up again  pls start with mines thx
signed i actually tried looking for a genuine contract the other day i found none
heh i dont care much either way but this cannot be bad
how they can already do the login logoff login then they show up 1mil km away
15 seconds sounds fine to me and regarding gate camps have you heard of bumping
this
right which is why this needs to be fixed 
supported
wrong that is how it is technically handled by the game it is a mechanism dont confuse that with what actually happens in the gameworld what actually happens may be far more complex and complicated but most of it is of no interest to you as a player which is why it is not mentioned one more hint the pod pilots in eve dont ever log off disappearing for hours into thin air
and laganyhow it would be good to hire npcs to move the stuff to one station
your first misstake was making the argument about realism instead of gameplay were actually not 40k years into the future were in the present playing an gamezones for the market make that part of the game more interesting aswell as reducing lagpicking up things is anoying but part of gameplaythe only point i agree with you on is the apply to a corporation which really doesent provide much in the way of gameplay but its not really a huge thing and probably gets defended with arguments like we need timesinks and it makes the gameworld seem like an actual world not just a browser
i like and second this
i agree with applying for a corp and bidding on a contract picking up stuff well yes i would rather say you should be able to set up a courier contract remotely but no npc deliveries
i agree with what op saidfor the market make another filter that says universe all regions in other owrds since we have it for contracts we should for the market you could also use the current filter for how many jumps for an item on market
the kronos is usually considered to be third best of the marauders it is quite similar to the paladin but because of the superiority of tachyon beams the paladin does much more damagea simple solution to fix this balance issue would be to increase the drone bandwidth of the kronos to 100 then a pilot could field a flight of 4 garde ii and would do only a bit less dps then a paladin with tachyons this change would also make the ship more gallentean style
speaking as a kronos pilot i would still use 5 hammerhead ii killing small fry in missions is useful and 425s are crap at it the kronos already has the best drone bay of the marauderssince it has room for spares andor the 2 heavies needed to max out 75 bandwidths dps and its not a bad enough ship that it needs a buff if you want to buff a marauder make it the vargur
i really dont see the need for this change lets face it a ship is always going to be on top buffing a ship simply because its considered the lesser ship is not a good enough reason to change it no supportisaac
naw it gets an extra turret over the mega remember the other marauders dont hence the drone bandwith
i think it is not the right approach to compare them with their base class in mindat the moment we have two marauders who are considered on par golem and paladin one who is a bit behind kronos and one who is quite far behind vargurincreasing the drone bandwidth of the kronos would balance 3 of 4 marauders out its only a minor change and i guess would only take a few minutes of developer time fixing the vargur on the other hand well i think this needs a lot more work and shouldnt be the topic of this proposal

what a terrible idea
i have a character with 73 million sp in all caldari ships and missiles i literally cannot train any missile skill any higher despite having perfect skills and solid set ups with all my ships they still well they fail against other racesfor example i am in a cnr with its 7th launcher rigged all tech 2 and i duel an armageddon i win but its close why is it even close at all geddon is 50mil isk ship how embarrassing cerberus even with ham gets d up close by other hacsreconsyou made the falcon have to get so close its likely going to die and doesnt have enough grid to really defend itself i can put a plate to give it a little staying time or i could put some medium hybrids how lame which wont even kill anything anyway thanks for the optionsthe scorpionwhat are you doing there horrible ecm strength pathetic locking speed cant really tank the thing except for plates then its slow in every way imaginablehawk no need to go there phoenix cant even do damage against a carrier without having ten webs on it youre better off in a raven most of the timetengu  the ecm set up tengu only does around 10 jam strengthmy falcon does 13 or 14 i cant really justify training the stuff and spending the isk on a ship that really doesnt do anything impressive damage or ecm wisewhy do just about all the caldari ships suck every other race has some great 1v1 ships and will just about always wipe the floor with caldari in fleets i always hear shoot insert caldari ship here first because it will blow apart like tissueplease give caldari a needed rework fix citadels they need to be able to hit carriersms that are movingmake the battleships hacs recons more tough more effective and able to stand up to their counterparts without hilarity ensuing afterwards
i dont agree about the cerb its not supposed to be as good as the other hacs up close because its better at range but caldari do have some problems right that should be looked into
just because you bought a fancy faction battleship does not give you the power to wtfpwn other battleships with ease that is a primary principle of eve battle mechanics bigger and more expensive ships can be beaten by inferior ships at times a geddon shooting em damage vs a cnr is a prime examplecaldari is the range race if you are too blind and stupid to use this advantage and insist on throwing your cerb at the enemy at point blank range then you deserve to die range jamming and tackle while the missile ships stand off at range and pound the enemy into dust if you do not wish to play in this manner then dont train caldari a lot of good caldari pvp ships they arent good at 1v1 or solo roaming this is true but that does not mean they are a broken pvp race
hawk raptor moa citadels need i say morefake edit fix the other races problems too
rokh moa ferox moar grid please these are supposed to work as snipers and yet they cant fit the guns without gimping the whole setup gr8 people say that shield tanks have make sacrifices in other areas because they can boost damage with the low slots how does this work when i need to use those slots to boost my grid and they run out of cpu as well i thought caldari ships where supposed to be advancedsupportededit cpu
the issue is that most pvp situations favor closer ranges 24km and caldari are were in the case of ew with mid to long range in mind 2450 km caldari ships lack the comparable dps at 24km that the other races can bring to bear and beyond that range can not provide even secondary tackling capabilitychanges to what is important in terms of objectives in space beyond killing the other guy may provide more opportunities for caldari shipsdesign to show its stuffcaldari are defensive as in defending an objective in nature but when the only objective is attrition against the enemyso sure look at it what is the intention of caldari design and how does it fit into the game currently
yes crapdari arent a good pvp race but they arent that bad either i dont think theyre necessarily designed for pvp except as in an ew rolelets look at what they are good at  mining missions freightersi think you see the point im trying to make here if not ill explain each entry bettermining the osprey is comparable to the scythe of the minmatar but the bantam far outweighs the burst the only mining frigate with no defensive capabilitiesmissions cnrs fill the mission hubs and make an excellent route for running missions fast afaik no other racial ships can run a mission faster than the crapdarifreighters everybody knows the charon is the biggest hauler in the game their industrials the badgers are also renown for their ability to operate successfully as a decoy and make a very decent hauler as wellhonestly i dont see a problem here yes their forte is not pvp but look at the mining ability of the amarr  they only have one ship with a bonus to mining laser yield the tormentor the crapdari dont need a bufftheyre great at what they do
910 quality troll would read again
you have 73 million sp and your just now coming to the realization that caldari arent strong pvpers ignoring that i have to say i have no support for this topic at all missiles are no longer meant to kill every ship that they run into making most caldari boats have to think before going into pvp also you completely discount the use of hybrids which are supposed to be the last the short range caldari optionpoint is you just sound whiny here and i cannot support an issue that doesnt have any merit
yes i have 73m sp when i began training the character as caldari racial purist missilesshields only caldari were still pretty good now its just laughable what does it matter if caldari have the ability to have good range if i cant tackle and actually score the kill the enemy will just fly away as 1v1 ships they simply suck tell me i am wrong for instance the megathron can fit a tackle set up mwdwebscram and still deal great damage and have an insane buffer tankthe cnr has to fit a full buffer tank just to survive an engagement with non faction bs and has no ability to tank cant webpaint anything else to help shoot smaller ships either it can hit bs hard but cant catch anything it sucks solo whereas every other race can do decent solo with their megadomigeddonabaddonmealstromphooncaldari have the worst battleships in the game their ships are just a joke and its not funny skills and set up are not an issue it is the ships themselvesi know minmatar complain about their ships sucking but really its caldari ships that need a serious look tooraven  needs to be able to slug it out 1v1 and not get taken apart like a tissue maybe if you made missile reloading time much faster i could switch damage types in combat much faster which would help a lot or give missiles a mixture of damage really why not where is the logic you can put anything on a missilescorpion  pathetic firepower  pathetic ecm power  pathetic tank  if you tank it then it has no ecm if you ecm it up it still has crap tankfalcon  the only ship i fly caldari because it hasnt been so horribly nerfed yet sure ecm is powerful but when i have zero missilesguns and no tank and only ecmit had been do the trick now i am forced to get close enough for many dangerous ship classes to be all over me in 1 ecm cycle timeferox lame i went for a period of about 2 years without seeing one person pvp in a ferox i am not even kiddingyou ruined my time honored kestrel as well it is now basically a rocket only boat id like to see an af version of it to replace the hawk just do a paintjob on it and give it more grid and more missile bonuses anyway give me some cheese because i have a lot of whineone last thing citadels need help so they can hit a moving ms
caldari are mostly fine they are long range specialists citadel explosion velocity in seige 3 ms is slower than an electric golf cart and i agree that it needs to be boosted
i support this topic whole heartedly i train mostly minmitar now cause caldari ships are not good for much other than npc yet when you read their description when you make your char they sound like the biggest badasses around what a bunch of bull
i agree regarding citadels and maybe a couple of the other complaints too however the race is broken is going way too far yeah theyre bad at solo pvp this is why gangs exist theyre not in need of a general rebalance
the caldari are the zerg i doubt they will be strengthened until they stop being so completely over populated recently i went on a tour of caldari space looking for a way to increase my faction with the caldari state i didnt find a single 5 system with less than 40 ships in it it would appear that all the nerfs the caldari have received are a ccp population control method
im sure this has been whinged about at one point or other but i couldnt find it in short i miss the old effects ive seen specific ones mentioned cap jumps anyone but i think a broad reassesment of what new effects people like and which ones should be rolled back is in ordersome of my personal thoughts on effect choices or whateverturrets in general no recoil that i can see what happened to thishybrids old railgun and blaster effects were much preffered imo i can hardly see the new ones caue theyre here and gone so fast the old effects had almost a dramatic flair to themlasers overall lasers are still good with the eception of capital pulse lasers that needs to be reworked a bitprojectiles the artillery seems a bit forced if anything and the tracers too cloudy and vague perhaps the old atillery tracers w the new impacts cleaned up somegeneral effects these i definitely have an issue with the old effects everyone knew what they meant and they were distinguishable now i cant tell whats going on around me am i webbed scrammed did i just jump and what am i listening to the audio from someones rectal ultrasound energy mods the difference in nosneutcap transfers has become so small its hard to tell what people are doing to you till youre dead once again with the identifyability being really important thingwarp scrams pre apoc i could tell what was scrambling me without looking at my overview what happened therejumping now i actually like the new jump effect although it does look alot like the webbing one but the capitals need their tunnel thing back as everyone and their dogs have already said im suretheres alot more that i could think of in time but perhaps other people can add theirs to the list so its easy to read for the csm and ccpaaaaaaand go
i support this
the info is already there this would only make it easier to access so support
just put in the mechanic which you have in wow that automatically catch any excat repeated pattern and keep track on it thereby banning the macros in this wayi know from a friend that testet the timer with some friends that a simple macro is cought and banned in about 89minutesthe best bot in wow have been cought and just removedsoo it is possible
this is eve online not wow

kind of a mechanic at odds with good sense questiondo you feel the current dockundock timer mechanics are the best of a bad situation or are in serious need of an overhaulpersonally i reckon the last thing a dock manager would do is grant a docking request to a ship which has lots of high powered ordnance battering it to a pulp that fella is answerable and i doubt he enjoys submitting a damage report to his bosses at the end of a shiftthoughts
i heartily endorse this product andor service
imho vuk has been a great csm leader and i hope he get continued trust from the playerbase
bumping because i need something off vuk and this is my paymentseriously the best candidate vote vuk or dont vote
vuk  as a great leader you are i do have questionsas a staunch opponent of the csm in its entirety what can you promise that will actually happen this is not meant to be a troll in no way at all for the upcoming winter expansion 1 will it actually be fiscally incentive for small corporations  alliances to actually move out into 002 what measures will there be to allow these small corporations  alliances to defend themselves from attack from bigger alliances3 what are your proposed changes to the customer support in what way can you make them faster at response time other then them having to hire  train new employees
ermmsiryour roles are removedi said only bumping and no tough questions
and now on more serious notewith hopefully upcoming rework of sov system general idea atleast mine is that you shouldnt be able just to plant 6 med towers and to fuel them once per month and to hold fe one constelation with adding dynamics into sov system big alliances will not be able to hold vast space with just as mentioned above few towers also with adding small raidable structures it will add more headache to the holders of big chunk of 00 cause they will not be able to effectively defend it all of this changes will open room for smaller entities also stuff like personal habitats still dont have a clue how to implement it tbh will push more ppl into 00now from the other side we shouldnt fool general population that there will be huge political changes mapwise cause its not realistic that small entities can at the end of the day hurt bigger ones but they could find their portion of 00 without being simple petsrenters i was giving some ideas about coalitions as ingame structures some people were against it cause its encouraging blobing but we already have blobing current existing coalitions already have implemented oog comms like irc jabber sms alerters facebook groups etc something smaller and new entities can only dream about introducing ingame mechanics for coalitions as integrating more alliances into one bigger entity could give smaller entities critical mass for something bigger as i said eventualy it comes to blobing but we have same situation in rl so we shouldnt dream about 1 man army pwning the new eden also as we can see from current delve campaign which involves more or less kitchen sinks from both sides there was not so many massive blobs and all the 1k in local fights tho on reinforced nodes were epic and something to remember for a long long timewhen it comes to customer support i will remain silent for now until i gather all the informations i need for this issue but yes everyone knows it will be adressed to most fail ccp department  gm team hi grimmi and nova you are cool guys really but if you were my employees
also just a little warning to all morsus mihi members next one who ask me anything semiserious will be kicked from allianceas i said only bumping and words of praisethank you
vote vuk
vote first post on this forum ever p 
vote for the man
garthran is a cool d00d apart from the whole cinder industrials thing vote for him instead of erik finnegan if youre into indy stuff cos that guy is plain thick as 
thanks for the supportat this point in the thread that only i and someones alt have posted in id like to tell you more about myself as a personmy name is alex bond im a 22 year old male from north carolina usa i work at a subway and i if i may say so myself im damn good at my job its not glorious and its not financially liberating but it pays the bills and i enjoy it about a month ago i married the girl ive been dating since i was 16 years old im a big fan of science fiction in general from star trek all except ds9 and enterprise i mean seriously to seaquest from farscape to firefly star wars to space balls eve appeals to me because it is unlike any other game i have ever played and my fellow players are more interesting than those in most other mmos ive tried i attended college for 3 years and realized i had no idea what i was doing there i withdrew and am figuring out exactly what i want to do with my life before i go back to get a degree
garthran is pretty relaxed when certian people ninja salvage his missions hes willing to talk about the profession and doesnt get upset by the intrusioni think hes a level headed guy after haveing several discussions with him hes a mission runner but he accepts the fact that some of us unsavory types may bust the misson and steal his loot as a primarily solo player myself i would say that a vote for garth is well placed as he understands that even solo play will eventually generate social interaction that may end up with a little pvpgarth  i would like to see a position statement from you with regards to us ninja types busting missionsi would also like to see a statement on suicide ganking as i have expanded my business plan recently and this is now part of my portfolio
garthran polled me for our activities in wspace was respectful of our situation and encounter some of the wormholes issues mentioned in here are a result of a conversation between garthran and myselfafter speaking to him i get the impression he really wants to listen to the people and get their opinions i would only warn him of a couple of things being that way is you cant make everyone happy so be careful of what you choose to go with also keep in mind people have agendas and a csm is a nice ear to have listen to agendas 
thanks for your support ebolakwith regards to ninja salvaging i dont like it but that doesnt mean it should be removed from the game i feel that in a situation where i am killing npcs with the intention of returning and lootingsalvaging them someone else taking that salvage feels like theft however its not theft its aggressive debrisclearing and whether i like it or not it is a valid and as i understand profitable profession it also requires a very specialized skillset this means that while from time to time mission hubs might flood with wannabe ninja salvagers few of them will be good at it and even some of those who are good at it will get bored before too long ninja salvagers tend to primarily harass mission hubs in my experience so perhaps their continued existence will help to decentralize eve spreading our players out across the universe instead of clumping most of the players into a dozen or so systems i will likely never be a ninja salvager but i will not move to change the game to prevent ninja salvagers from working in the game however i would ask that all of them take a page from ebolaks book being eloquent polite and friendly goes a long way offering to split the salvage being willing to withdraw if asked to do so i know players who have said theyd be more than willing to give their salvage to ninjas if only the ninjas would ask for itwith regards to suicide ganking there is sufficient npc protection to prevent the freighterganks of yore the game doesnt need to be idiotproof even in highsec there should be consequences if you load a bunch of valuable merchandise into a tech 1 industrial and set it on a 20jump autopilot you are accepting the fact that you might get shot at between here and there there are many ways to avoid dying all they take is a little effort furthermore suicide ganking is not restricted to autopiloting haulers many players sacrifice their isk their standings and their ships in order to remove macroers from the game this is a very respectable occupation in my opinion and to introduce mechanics to make it literally impossible would allow macroers to exist unharassed which is something none of us want increasing the consequences for suicide ganking would make sense increased security status loss local faction standings loss voided insurance when killed by concord in this situation we need a pound of cure not a drop of prevention
thanks for the support sencnes wormholes are of great interest and importance to me and i think they will become more and more important to eve as the game progresses through the years making sure they work properly now is a high priority for meand i would like to point out that while my ear is open to any suggestion i am not in favor of every suggestion im given pleasing everyone is not my goal doing what i think is right for eve however is very important to me if you have an idea tell me about it ill give it my attention and try to understand it but just because you told me about it doesnt mean ill support it
how do you feel about trade hub scammers like us
trade scammer tbh i think are worng i know it is in the rules that it can be done but i belive there could be a way of giving a security penalty for doing it in such trade hubs like jita dodixie amarr and hekor an alternative is an ebay like system with a player adjusted rating like ebay does fir its customers to rate the sellerscammer that is about in the game and when their rep gets ot a certain point they can no longet place contract items etc up on contract
no i speak here of public materials  meeting minutes past topics raised to ccp and the like right now theyre a pain to look up for me and ive been involved since the csm started so i know where to look i think that they can be made far more accessible for players lowsec has all the danger of 00 space with none of the profit depending on your profession it tends to be worth the same as sometimes less than highsec but its just as inhospitable as 00 to smaller corps the sort who might be interested in getting their feet wet at present they either have to play with the big boys in 00 or they have to earn less profit by moving to lowsec lowsec is supposed to be a middle ground but at present its a place where pirates gank other pirates the odd fw fleet fights and not much else happens those two points made are to make lowsec more profitable than highsec for more professionsminers most notably are in desperate need of a boost to lowsec and to establish a mechanism to let corps make lowsec space their own and reduce the problem of not being able to enter highsec if you defend your lowsec space too often also 00 is the frontier not lowsec no i dont have any personal experience with sovereignty mechanics though i have read enough about them that i consider myself at least somewhat knowledgeable i do have some experiences with poses though only the industry side not the whole moon mineralsovereigntydeathstar side but still some i can keep up with the discussions but theres a reason theres no 00 policy in my platform ill leave that stuff up to the actual 00 players for the most part
i had some problem with the earlier posts by herschel and some strong debate with him but i have seen him grow very quickly in knowledge and experience in eve now his posts are some of the best you can find this year i am voting for omber already decided before his candidature but he is on my list for next year so good luck herschel get a seat
cheers bro
im convinced
darth solo told me hes not available to post atm but he said hes voting for iceblock he said his pvp experience will best suit the fixing of arty and unting missiles
i forgot to say i am also voting for iceblock because he knows people like me
poasting to confirm my vote for istvaan all the other csm take this way to freaking seriouslyedit except the chick candidate ill vote for her on my alt b
thanks whooch
happyi run a small research corp and have had numerous issues in the past i would like to ask this question of you since i think youre closest to my perspectives in age and experiencei have a lot of difficulty understanding roles and properly securing corp assets and especially my research poses i would like to know how you feel about the current structure for corp security and whether ccp could improve on the layout and functionality of roles i would also like to know if this is something that you would feel strongly enough to push for in discussions with ccpa second concern ive had during my playtime in eve and especially one that concerns younger players is recruiting personally i feel that starting a new corp is far too easy it is my opinion that this ease of creation is one of the worst problems in eve the new player experience is severely hampered by the number of corps without a clue and that new player quits eve without realizing what a quality corp can offer while my opinions and the subject are highly debateable i would like to know if the csm is interested in these kinds of changessincerelymrs reaction
thank you for reminding us about this channel herschel
hello alli have been monitoring this forum every day and have noticed quite a few trends in the elections as well as other indicators therefore i would like peoples opinions on who they think will be a part of the csm and in what ranking theyll place i would ask that you please be rational  if youre running for the csm please do not list yourself nine times on the list if you feel like listing the alts too you can but it is by no means necessaryanyways to get things started ive composed my list for who gets elected and their rank in the election1 mazzilliu  her knowledge of all sides of eve and ability to think of feasible new ideas has been demonstrated admirably2 avalloc  has a good grasp of the mechanics of eve and having a major alliance behind you always helps3 omber zombie  another omnicapable candidate his job on the current csm term has been phenomenal4 dierdra vaal  her experience from the first csm term will be very valuable in this one as well as her ideas5 vuk lau  hes shown the availability and capability to lead the council while i dont see him in a leadership role this time he will nonetheless be a valued delegate6 dj hijak  having the ear of many players makes him a valuable pr tool and he has some good ideas about the games destination7 larkonis trassler  an outsider so to speak of major movers in the game i see him gathering some votes with his good ideas as well as gaining a chunk of the pirate vote8 heartstone  a candidate with good ideas and the enthusiasm to endure the constant flames of the forums9 herschel yamamoto  a late entry in the running i believe his forum posts will gather him the votes necessary for the role of delegatei would like to see how other people think the players of eve will vote i realize that its a small prize but i will award the person who comes closest to the final score on the day of voting a sisters core probe launcher and a full load 8 of the sisters core probes best of luck to all the participants
i see myself winning by a considerable margin cause i have a lot of alts
rightoavalloc  goon candidate i dont know if he won the goon primaries but hes probably best of their bunch and doesnt seem too bad  certainly an improvement on dariusdierdra vaal  excellent candidate with good ideas and a strong platform did well in csm1  wish him all the besterik finnegan  successor of ankhesentapemkah and the take care party slightly contentious choice and i understand there are doubts about eriks ability to function on his own in the role but i understand ank has a pretty serious electorial machine going and it would be wise not to count this candidate out too earlyheartstone  excellent choice with a knowledge of the roleplay community factionwarfare smallunit pvp and committee decision making his first time running and if he can energize the interest groups and focus hes running on should have a good chance of successmazzilliu  gets in on through the pandemicgoon block vote and the fact shes a girl on the internets some of the ideas are okay  some are terrible but shes a shooin due to her support baseomber zombie  another good candidate was a great alternate during my term and went on to pick up a lot of workload as secretary in csm2 i gave him one of my votes last time and wasnt disappointedserenity steele  excellent candidate was my deputy during csm1 and was supportive and constructive and i have no hesitation in commending him for a 2nd term as a strong administrative choice to protect the institutionvuk lau  gets in on the northern block vote seemed decent enough last time and deserves a second shot zastrow j  may well be the 23rd goon candidate on csm3 seemed relatively well spoken on the application text though all the talk about barrier for entry seemed to cloak more make it easier to run huge space empires rhetoric that is currently the problem not the solution for 00 regardless if the goons get their block vote out this guy may be there
mazzilliu omber zombie larkonis trassler vuk lau herschel yamamotoavallocdj hijak in a rough order of likelihood of electionim not too sure about placing avalloc there
heres my dreamteam dierdra vaal serenity steele omber zombie vuk lau herschel yamamoto heartstoneand then the people who i dont know but is quite certain will get onmazzilliu erik generic goon candidate
i think you may all be overestimating how many votes i can muster upill be surprised if 7 of the nine seats arent held by alliancenationality power blocs the other 2 being erik and larkonis
in the past two csms 2 of 9 have been held by big alliances  djbane and djvuk it might be as high as 3 here but 7 seems unlikely which 7 are out there who can draw from separate support blocs and who are serious enough candidates to get even the internal votes and while i have my theories on who will win and my wishes on who id like to win its bad form to speculate too much on an election youre in will be interesting to see if my guesses are better this time than they were last time though
i agree with herschel i see a power bloc dominated council as somewhat unlikely im also withholding predictions though i know who id like to winin conclusion vote garthran for csm
i will give you atleast one vote d i dont want to risk not having anyone for webcam sessions during meetings with ccp
unless im missing someone it looks more like 3 guaranteed and maybe another

amen
my dear herschel when will we see that chart as a csm candidate im sure you will want to show that your statements are more than just idle banter 
it will be rather contentious given the propensity of candidates to misrepresent themselves i do however think it is an interesting idea in that it will certainly promote focused discussion about specific qualities individuals possess that will make them of value to the csm
it slipped by the wayside when i was finishing up my own platform answering other peoples questionnaires and the like that said i think i just about have the right list of questions so ill probably be sending it out tonight and post it when i have a dozen or so back voting doesnt start for better than a week yet so ive still got some timeupdate the jita park thread is here and the chart itself is here
1 ring mining  an interesting concept one idea that could definetly work ifwhen mining is looked at again and redone2 renegade concord  could be interesting but they would need to be toned down slightly since concord currently is really powerful for policing empire space3 player habitats  also an interesting idea i like the idea but doesnt serve a big purpose with poss and since you have the personal hangars on stations and soon a bunch of space with wis would this become obsolete4 rare materials in loot drops  most definitely agree  harder battles could have loot tables modified to offer moon minerals instead of always modules5 reducing loot drops  modules dropped as loot could be modified with a wastage factor to be included should the module be reprocessed kind of like it is damaged because it came from a destroyed ship so only 65 of the minerals would be received when you melt it down ect6 qships  an interesting idea but would be difficult to implement if you think about this though the same could possibly be achieved with a cloaked stealth bomber waiting nearby as escort ecti dont want to discount any ideas though as with some thought all would work nicely

keep the support comming ppl p we need the swosh pop tunnel back
swoshing tunnels of doommmmmmm hurry up and read this infernal thread you mofos at ccp
i dislike the inconsistency of thier not having a 4th bonus and they are not so powerful that 4th bonus would throw the cosmic balance all catawampus seriously its not like the space lanes are being overrun with afs or would be with a 4th bonusi know that that their resists are considered the 4th bonus technically they once were listed as a bonus but most t2 ships have enhanced resistances that are not granted via a bonus this only makes sense for an assault class shippsswap the wolf and jaguar range bonuses for god sakes
signed
support
most definitely approve of this idea
cccombo breaker
and supported
quite handy
the nag is in desperate need of a fix supported
jesus make your  artists do their job and get rid of the ridiculous split weapons system theyre horrible on every ship you put them on why after spending 50 more training time can i be nearly as good as a rev  if i use unbonused weapons whoopdie fing dooas a minmatar pilot who trained torp v large projectile v and minmatar bs v  before realizing i had made a hilariously bad career choice and retrained for revs from scratch signednot kidding i was about 2 weeks away from flying nags when i started over and did revs instead
would not mind seeing both options but yea me likes idea a lot
any ceo who doesnt support this is ether a donothing or a masochist
supported but then we should also get t2 versions of the other tier 3 bss
supported khanid region and faction needs some love and a khanid bs  bc and frigate would be great to be able to fly and get maybe make them available through royal khanid navy missions as bpcs
since part of the charm of t3 ships is the ability to strategically reconfigure a ship i propose that t3 ships have a 6th rigging subsystem this module would be like a tray that housed three rigs once the rigs were placed in the subsystem module they could not be removed without destroying them but the trays themselves could be interchanged to facilitate multiple configurations and be a inexpensive subsystem relative to otherswhat is the use of having for example an armor tanking and shield tanking subsystem on the loki if i basically have to have a different hull for each set of applicable rigs
i like this idea
something of this nature could be very interesting i worry about effects on overall ship cost and t3 component demand and on working backwards to give everyone with a t3 ship one of these but other than that sure could also be interesting to see variants on the system  say one with 2 slots and 200 calibration but doubled effects either that or just say that t3 ships allow rigs to be removed without destroying them though that could get powerful in any case some solution to allow t3 ships to swap rigs more easily is supported
i like the idea of rig trays to allow you to customize the rigs to fit the new role of the ship based on the new ship modules
not a bad idea seems to work with the overall idea of t3 shipsisaac
this just sounds like a fun idea
as long as prices go up up up for t3 and t2 goes down down downim game
while im tempted to support this one just because its cool it seems to me to contradict the idea of rigging something jury rigging is kind of like hotwiring its not a factory modification its a custom job done by some dudes in a garage with welding torches its not something that can be undone at least not without involving the blowtorches again
this nuff said
this idea makes sense
agreed this has always annoyed me
not supported crawl back under your bridge trollif you cant catch people now its not locals fault you are just bad having no local or recent speakers local which is functionally the same as no local would make everything in the game more arduous and timeconsuming than it is already and chain people to their directional scanners happily idiots have been arguing that we should get rid of local for ages and for just as long the community has reviled and ignored them edit added more vitriol
agree 100def need to stop the 999 scammingi use the contracts on a daily basis and hunting down n keepingand eye out for scammers who want my iskies isnt a past time i enjoythe isk on the contracts need to be displayed by eve and not the usersno option shud be given to show or not show decimals everything shud be shownin full currencyor as suggested in wordingsno short cutspenguin ftw
this thread is full of clueless people who have no idea how many new exploits their solutions will generateand one more thing login traps is not an exploit deal with it or support nerfing local
namely the fact that at the moment fw members get a faction standing hit for attacking any militia member anywhere never thought of this but it should be fixed
derp guess ccp dropped the ball on this one should be a pretty high priority although i do wonder how many fw players actually venture into 00 in large enough fleets to warrent this concern
maybe more would if it didnt wreck their standings p
wow what a bug
yes you can order a bicycle online and have it shipped to you but the fedex truck doesnt need to cross a warzone to complete the delivery plus these are really game balance issues more than anything elsenpc shipping could seriously unbalance the game join a group of enterprising pilots who want to form a shipping company and see if theres a viable business modelfor contract bids and corporation applications i can see that the other party might like to know that you are physically nearby but in some cases it doesnt matter id support the contract originator or corporation ceo having the option to allow remote actionsemisupported
i agree with the contracts and corp applying ideas but not the item hauling due to balance issues
tachyons in a paladindont be silly
thing is they dont just make balance changes in ten minutes they test them usually a lot this would take far more time than you seem to think
it takes more than a few minutes to do changes to the game it needs to be tested and retested to make sure it falls inline and to be blunt just because you think its a good idea doesnt necessarily means ccp does isaac
the pally gets an extra damage bonus over the apoc the golem gets an extra med slot the vargur gets jack sht

i use deep space scanner probes all the time i find that they give me an idea of how many sigsanomalies there are without having to guess with core probes i see no reason to change them as they are isaac
i am not a pvper butno very very bad idea that would make it a virtual care bear game
it makes me laugh when people say caldari are long range specialists well one thing about having range is the ability to keep the range maybe if the raven could move like a typhoon we could have something nice there but as it stands its slow as hell and basically waiting for a megathron to fly in its face and shred iti am going to make a long list of proposed fixes for many of the problems i see with different caldari ships and post in a new thread i hope everyone will give feedback to that
caldari  pvp  missiles  lol any sort of dps output by a caldari ship in a pvp situation is pretty much negated completely if the ships at long range in a small fleet or at just about any range in a large fleet the target will probably die before the missiles reach therefalconrook needs tons of help the ecm nerf went way overboard and even putting on plates wont help much if the enemy fleet is of any decent size in practice falconrook used to be able to reliably disable about 24 battleshipsor 5 frigatescruisers on average against a subcap fleet at range prepatch it should have just had jammer strength reduced so it could only reliably disable 13 ships on average or jammer maths reworked so its jamming chances are balanced between frigates and capital ships close range isnt going to work for this shipcitadel torp boost seems to be in the pipeline finallycaldari are the best race for pve though any given 00 ratter picked at random is probably in a raven you can pick your damage type the slot layouts generally favor midslots which have more utility in general then lowslots so you can fit tank and damage mods shield tanking is instantaneous unlike armor tanking caldari have all that unlike all the other racesminmatar split weapon system garbage cans dont count i really dont think caldari need much of a boost except some specific ships and i dont understand why the op thinks ravens have an awful tank or feroxes are never usedprobably more because of the achura and their 3 charisma then anything else
scorpionrokhbasiliskdrakecrowcerberusare all good ships ur dumb
you are supposed to have a friend in a onyx do the tackling face facts eve is not a solo game especially not in battleships your megathron comment just shows your lack of experience for all your 73m sp
caldari have a lot of great pvp ships a slight boost to bssize missile explosion velocity medium boost to cruisersize and large boost to frigatesize exp velocity might be in order however they could also bring citadel torp exp velocity back up to the preapocrypha value even then it would still do poor damage to a carrier moving at half speed
pebkac
agreed some of the ships do need abit of tweaking
the caldari ships are great but missile explosion velocity took too large of a hit from the nerf bat the nerf to explosion velocity should have scaled with how much slower ships became after the speedrebalanced changes ie if battleships lost on average 30 velocity then torpedos and cruise missiles should have received a 30 reduction in explosion velocity
this issue has been brought up in the past csm passed unanimously and met with no ccp responcelink to original forum threadcsmwiki page on the history of the proposalsince that proposal nothing has been done and the problem has only gotten worse ded mails are now sent in duplicate or sometimes triplicate to directors any corp that has poses attacked or applications made to the corp with any regularity would benefit from an evemail improvement any user that wants to have a save box for important evemails so they can delete the trash with a nice convenient select all delete will benefit from thisi dont really have anything to add to the original proposal i want to get this presented to ccp again in the hopes they will choose to act on the idea this time evemail is an integral system of communication in this game and the interface is still ancient and needs a lot of workedit well i do sort of have something to add to it since the original was mainly concerned with auto generated evemails give us different boxes to store evemail in and make it function more like regular email theres probably enough changes listed below to warrant a complete overhaul of the system its long overdue anywayswe need a sent box so we can look up mails we already sentwe need a saved box so we dont accidentally delete mails we want to savewe need a spam box for evemails sent automatically from npc corporations like ded and owners of npc stations corps rent offices from after those evemails have sat in there for maybe a month they can be deleted saving server spaceincrease character limit very often we have to break evemails into two or three and evemail is not a viable way for people to share whole copies of killmails due to this limitfor people with inboxes with mixed read and unread evemails make the ui less annoying when using the sort by unread feature after clicking the user and reading the mail the user disappears from the visible portion of the list it can be worked around but its annoying as hellstop sending directors duplicate ded mails 
woo
i suggest that you learn what meeting minutes are said project is likely the cosmos project as was showed off at fanfestknown bug as was discussed at the qa talk at fanfest
this is from the minutes of the meeting where it was discussed and it wasnt included in the minutes on eveo forumswell now i have a better source for csm history  then the eveo forums we still need to bring the issue up again at the next csm to make sure ccp know its a priority as theres no indication ive seen that ccp have made any actual progress on it it would be worth at least finding outare all these fanfest things archived and indexed somewhere or do i just have to wish for the good fortune of attending one so i can know things have already been talked about o
it was submitted late and as such it was briefly discussed however it was rediscussed officially during the second meetingminutesno when a new csm goes to fanfest all old issues are taken a look at again and the csm is given any update there isas such having the csm reraise an issue every 6 months because the new csm is impatient is lame but just because theres no indication that cpc have made any progress on cosmos doesnt mean that they havent my guess is that they will have an announcement about it at fanfestyeah if you actually payed attention you would realize that all talks at fanfest were recorded and is available on ccps youtube thingy
no searchable transcripts im not watching hours of video to see if somethings been discussed there and nowhere else its easier to just wait for you to post in my threads 
op is nothing more than a whiner and this thread needs to be locked lack of reason as to why we should rollback the effects i personally have no issues with the graphics other than they are too high intensity for my computer but i can live with that as for you swordmaster get over it ccp isnt going to rollback the graphics are actually far better than before and i can easily tell who is doing what to me maybe you should get glassesisaac
agreed this is a whine thread and op is patheticran out of cheese the last time i looked still dont got any backapoc graphics actually degraded on my winblows tower yet on the mac they are fantastichonestly i dont give a  what the windows system looks likeas long as i am happy with my macnot supportedi do support the op having rotten vegetables thrown at him
prior to the last suicide gank nerf suspension of insurance payouts was one of the other options in addition to boosting response times ccp chose to boost response times thus making all but the easiest of ganks more player or shipsize intensive the reasons i dont know but im guessing its more to do with the numbers of noobs going around concording their first bs accidently suicide ganking is not a big problem if you play smart and at your keyboard then it wont affect you as much as i hate to make rl analogies i wouldnt go cutting around even the most affluent parts of london in a drunken daze with an ipod blaring in my ears and my pockets overflowing with cash the current system is fineref implants with the addition on jumpclones standings are no issue many people offer them either through joining corps for a day saying hello to their rorquals and making happy time etc implant loss shouldnt be an issue plus you have to be pretty brain dead to lose your pod outside of 00 in the past 13 months or so ive had 154 losses 5 of which have been pods of those 3 were in 00 bubbled and two were in lowsec 1 i was afk and got decloaked at a hostile pos the other well i was in stiches laughing at something else which i was observing in my pod but i digress treat implants like rigs for your head you kids dont know your born back in the day when isk was harder to come by implants were 45x more expensive its quite affordable to pop in a pair of 3s to a jumpclone and go and have a blast
i vote for you mazz  you go girl 
sorry sweets sniggerdly crew aint my kind of party even if you are a girl and got the same first name as me i just cant do it but good luck  one hopes all 4 of the girls make it
ive looked at all the candidates and none of them seem to even recognize other peoples play styles apart from erik i too thought that he was merely representing ankhe so i figured a good way to get an answer was to convo him directly in game granted erik is good at keeping his personal opinions to himself all though i did manage to get some answers in the end but i then realized something i was hoping to get someone to represent my views i was hoping that eriks views would mirror my own this is not what the csm is all aboutbecause of eriks ability to remain neutral he is the best person to represent any player base be it a carebear or a die hard pirate his own opinions dont matter its the collective opinions of the player base as a whole that matter that is what erik wants to represent even though i might not agree with all the opinions that he might represent im guaranteed that my side will also be given fair representationthis is why erik gets my vote and why i will promote erik for csm i am not part of take care and im not an alt of either ankhe or erik lol erik doesnt even have alts i like to pew pew and i like to carebear but some of the other pvp aspects of the game bore me to death market pvp omg plz somebody shoot me but if no one represents these players things get out of balance and suddenly we cant buy anything of the market because its too expensive or the other extreme prices drop but you have to travel 30 jumps for everything you buy because nobody can be bothered to buy and sell itall the different play styles is what makes eve its own world nay universe its what really makes eve different not the because you are free to shoot anybody you want at any time because you have the freedom to play the game the way you want to play lets keep it that way vote erik finnegan for csm
look harder
will my questions ever be answered i am beginning to suspect that you do not want your views on those issues made public
vote for da man he da man
what sucks most is the borked apocrypha audio ie proximity sound and all the popping crackling and etc or is that just a creative labs thing please feel free to take on that issue if none othervisually apocrypha is superb when i have the time to zoom in and look around i do lately ive been getting glimpses of the structure internals of space ships and stations clouds within stations are pretty cool yes things are looking pretty good good sound will hopefully followthank you meissa a for running and best wishes with it
as a former audio developer i wrote a realtime audio sequencer for mac os x a few years ago i can only agree that crackling and popping sounds is extremely annoyingto be fully honest ive been playing without sound for a while i could no longer stand the repeated sound of explosions i turned it back on in apocrypha for a little while but havent experienced anything like youre describing and i have creative sound cards ill check it outthanks for your wishes
lee thrace puts in votegood luck
there are no women in eve
from hereas to who the oldest candidate well its not me apparently im distinctly average
im 47 please vote
first time candidate but long time fanive been racking my brain since i put my name in to make a list of things that i want to put forward if i get onto the council not that i couldnt come up with a list because the list i have is huge it was trying to shorten it to something that could be dealt within the term period for councilat this point i see several issues that need immediate addressingmy main focus will be the upcoming changes to 00 making it more accessible for small to medium sized corps and alliance to exist in 00 profitable is my primary goal trying to make it something more then just all about poss and dreadnoughts eve developers had repeatedly stated they want more people out in 00 but the fact that less then 10 of players live in 00 under the domination of a couple of dozen large alliances while more then 75 of players never leave highsec shows they have failed other issuesscammers they have existed as long as ive played the game but recently theyve become a lot more annoying they clog up the contract system with useless contracts stealing space and server activity from legitimate sales and they spam the hell out of local far more then isk sellers and i suspect that customer service time is wasted with people complaining delaying legitimate problemsi think a simple solution would be to provide a warning message to any purchaser when the selling price of an item is way out of wack with the current market either with a contract or market purchase this is not something completely new eve does this for sellers when you place a market sell order that is way out of align with current market conditions why shouldnt buyers get the same treatment this solution would not make ccp the market police while giving buyers a more fair playing fielddrones theyve been ignored for too long one immediate change i would like to see made is how npcs treat drones when you dc i dont think its fair to players that your drones become sitting ducks while you warp off if everyone risked loosing missiles and ammo every time they dcd in a mission they would understand how drone boat users feel though suggestions have been made to allow players to be to reconnect to wayward drones when they log back in developers seem to have a problem with that probably why they never implemented it this doesnt solve the problem either when you dc in the last room of ae and have to fly back through 5 gates to retrieve them simple solution would be have npcs ignore drones that belong to a player whos offline that would also reduce the server work as it doesnt have to work trying to calculate hits on wayward drones especially when a bs can spend hours trying to kill a small droneinterface i cant even big to start listing whats wrong with the interfaces in eve but a major problem i have is when i waste time fighting the interface instead of fighting roids npcs and other players some small changes would go a long way in making peoples lives a little more pleasant on that list would be scanning drones emails overview market contracts poss etc
a look into runoff voting may be worthwhile i too found that having only one vote was less than satisfactoryperhaps second votes could be granted to those whos candidates did not make the first cut or perhaps the electorate could be given the option of a first and second choice
single transferable vote fptp is such a clunky system
as long as erik does not get in i couldnt care less naturally he will though

here are a few of the specific issues that i have  as always assault frigates are still by and large useless theyre relegated to gimmick ships for rich people to  around in and maybe its just the goonfleet in me but i like to see frigates out there doing useful things they should at least get a clearly defined role if theyre meant for pve give them some kind of tanking bonuses aside from the resistances etc  every race should get a sniping battleship i would propose it be the megathron for gallente and either the maelstrom or tempest for minmatar id like to see the mega lose the tracking and tempest lose the rof bonuses in favor of 10 optimal you can already see that t2 sniping fleets are going very very hard towards being pretty much only apocs and rokhs and as ccp constantly says thats boring and boring is the enemy of good gaming at the very least the tempest needs something which brings me to  minmatar battleships need a very serious looking over im not a minmatar bs pilot but theres a reason for that the typhoon is probably alright although i think it should be given a little more focus in terms of weapons and slots and whatnot the tempest and maelstrom need serious reconsidering though if the tempest got an optimal bonus id like to see the maelstrom get a little bit of a mass reduction or speed increase to make it a more viable ac boat bringing it more in line with the hyperion if the maelstrom got an optimal bonus in lieu of the shield boost bonus i think it would greatly help the minmatar bs selection with just that one simple change  pos setup is a useless time sink that is unreasonably stupid there is a whole plethora of logistics related stuff to bring up but this is one that affects potentially everybody theres no reason that you shouldnt let one person anchoronline one module each or at least let a pos handle anchoring one mod and online another at the same time  minmatar and gallente recon ships is one i almost forgot because i gave up on them after the speed nerf they really need something id like to see a role bonus for the minmatar ones that made them webbing death machines again and id like to see the arazulachesis dampening bonuses turned up so that ecm isnt the only form of ew being used which is what the ecm nerf was explicitly looking to do away with note i would not push for nor accept another ecm nerf as a solution to this problem  the eos needs another look too right now given the drone bandwidth it has the drone bay size bonus is pointless id like to see it turned into a heavy drone boat again at the expense of turrets this would bring it more in line with the other gallente t2 ships which are split between turretbased and dronebased  a fresh look at the bounty system i read somewhere the idea that concord could sell bounty hunter licenses which would allow people to shoot those with bounties even in hisec i think this is a fantastic idea and the system for administering them could be borrowed from the way wardecs work  the capital skill path is a tricky one because i understand the reasoning behind it however id like to see some of the filler skills asc im looking at you changed so that there is a reason to have it at something other than i or v its not something ive thought deeply about but im training 2 characters into carriers and possibly a third into dreads and it just es me off how many skills i need to get to v that offer no use until theyre at that level  sov 4 bonuses should make something more of an actual capital the least offensive idea that ive heard which i actually really like is upping the cap on jump bridges in the system to 3 or 4 instead of leaving it at 2 like every other system
and i also have some little piddling issues that im sure some other people share with me  asteroid hit detection is totally screwed the bounding box for asteroids is enormous much bigger than the actual model and it makes navigating asteroid fields almost impossible without running into an invisible wall and bouncing around until you find the magical path back out  the zealot should be red seriously imagine that it would be awesomemost of these issues arent huge and sweeping in scope and i dont really think any are supergroundbreaking but that leads me to my next point im very good at taking input filtering out the chaff and building on good ideas eve has an enormous playerbase and obviously not everybody will want to be on the csm that doesnt mean they dont have a fantastic idea that will revolutionize the way we play the game if i were on the csm i would look at as much of the player input as i could and help to develop good ideas and give them the time and energy they requirei recently did a writeup on the naglfar which you can read here im thinking i will have to write out specifics regarding ecm as it currently stands because it seems to be a hot button issue right nowedit man the bbcode round here is finicky
the cyno effect when multiple ships jumped to a cyno was one of the best things about the whole game mainly due to the oh sht moment it caused for the unfortunate sods being hotdroppedplease bring it back 3link
this i want my epic ship back 
i am very much in support of this it would be great if i did not have to switch out to a punisher from my retribution the second a fleet op is called
cases where the missing 2nd bonus from the t1 ship is ideal for the assault frigateharpy adding the 5 resists per level bonus from the merlin here is just so face meltingly obvious this would then bring it into line with the eagle giving us a pair of powerful ishukone gunshipsretribution the punishers resists bonus would help this ship become a smaller version of the absolution another carthum conglomerate ship on the subject of facemeltingly obvious sort out this ships midslots so amarr af pilots have somthing to fly that isnt crippled by rocketsjaguar and wolf a rifter without its tracking bonus would be a very sad sight indeed yet thats what these two have become minmatar interceptors inherit the tracking bonus from their t1 counterpart yet the assault frigates miss out on one of the most important aspects of the rifter afs should not have trouble hitting when in a tight orbit fights against other frigate hulls often end up as closerange knife fight in which case these ships are unable to bring their firepower to bear additionally when fighting larger ship classes they rely on their speed and size to outtrack their opponents in a tight orbit slowing down so you can actually hit doesnt often end well for anyone at ccp reading this i hope you can see that there isnt a whole lot of work to be done when fully half of the ships in this class can be given a cut and paste job from the t1 hulls furthermore using heavy assault ships bonuses as a template for how i believe assault ships assault frigates should be it is the rule rather than the exception that the t2 ship does not have the 2 bonuses from its t1 sibling it is true for all these shipseaglecerberusishtardeimosvagabondmuninnzealotthat makes all but one the sacriledge which has 1 bonus changed to match its different weapon systemsmoving up in size when it comes to command ships there is only one which doesnt receive the 2 bonuses from its t1 counterpart the nighthawk as with the sacriledge this is a case of one bonuse being different to go with its use of missiles rather than hybrid turretsit isnt sensible to take this argument any further up in size as the t2 bs are generally not regarded as pvp ships however i hope this makes a good case for giving assault frigates their missing bonus from the t1 hull wherever sensible keeping them in line with the other t2 ships
signing post  giving players the ability to put stuff in the vastness of space is nice making that stuff look like it was thought up during this millenium would be a good next step
would like to see this but there are other things id rather see done first supported nonetheless
there are no real downsides and it would save time supported
yes please this would make things so much easier
give both a pw and standings and for fck sakes why does same alliance have to enter the pw for a jb if the pos is allow alliance access
support but someone from galactic rangers fix your damn forum sig as im getting popup requests for a kb pass and username annoying get to work isd
the tools really need an overhaul
signed more love for khanidUFFFD
this sounds neat
i likewould need some balancing of course but good start
im a carebear i avoid pvp i detest local if its fun or useful is not relevant it simply does not fit the game world so it needs to go
supporting this thread it is really annoying to see all of that spam in local

so many other things are being exploited just as muchand no i dont think you should add in stuff for it just declare it a exploit and ban whoever does itthat simple
there is already a 30 ish sec timer as immunity goes to prevent the undock  podded eventbut good idea overall
how about thisif you log off instead of warping off 1 au then warping back to the same spot you were at when you logged off make it so that the point where you warp back to is a random distance and the location is different then where you logged off fromthat will help with the login traps but the down side is that itll hurt those that have legit disconnects
labeling every problem an exploit and telling people to ban it is not an answertry thinking before posting please
link belowmy topic
no just no
no nada no way if youre alliance is having an issue with people putting jump clones in your outpostmaybe you should fix your allianceisaac
alliance 1 owns a station members thereof create jumpclones in said station alliance 2 boots alliance 1 from their space members of alliance 1 can still keep their jump clones in the station without any means for alliance 2 to remove them clearly this is a problem with the alliance that took the station mrc
1 is it costing the alliance to keep the jump clones there no2 is it going to cause a slow down or a hindrance nothen with all due respect wtf is the problemguard the station and gank anyone who shows upseriously you people need to grow up
no support i would however support a feature to be added to deny station market usage if there already isnt one havent been to a station with no rights yet
that wouldnt realy work because with trade skills u can access markets in the region without going in station
why not let them take all assets that belong to other alliances that are still in the outpost while youre at it no
yes and all of their stuff from hangers as well taking over stations should pay handsomely
afraid of market pvp
it can hinder things yes if an enemy still has access to station you control then they can sell their assets to the enemy and pocket isk to help blow up the assets they just sold also it gives access to spies in a system so in a way it is costing an alliance to keep enemy jump clones there guarding the station for every single enemy jump clone that may or may not be activated is a misnomer
you just took over an enemy station and you expect the take over to go smoothly which game are you playing againever hear of private alliance contracts works wonders i hearlook i can get the frustration of removing a rat infestation but seriously this is par for the course in eveadapt or die im told i think that applies here
well it would make the corp spystealing stories even more amusing emptied the hangers the wallet and terminated all the corps jump clones before he left
ive always wanted take access to all those corp hangars i could view in the station mmmm yummy
this seems a reasonable request
every day now i see the following crap on local around rens accidentally purchased an invulnerability field ii buy back for 90kand its 90 millionyes scamming is a legit way of ripping off idiots i dont have a problem with itwhat i have a problem with is the ever increase size of my block listwhat i propose is the following1 take away the ability to link contracts from all chat roomsdont scream yet and finish reading my post of you forever shall be labeled an idiot2 make a new section in the market called contractsin this market tab you would see contracts of various kinds types and dealsnow i realize there is a contracts button but the contracts thing suckstheres no effective way to search no effective way to snipe for itemsif i want a bloody bpo of said item i want to search for it and not fiddle through a few hundred bpcsif i want a nomad im not interested in seeing fenrirsthey need to rewrite or make a new contract browser so that if someone wants to shop for goods then they can do it there9 times out of 10 the public broadcast of a contract are crap anyway theres nothing useful thereif i was interested in shopping ill go look the damn thing up myselfthis allows them to scam as they see fit but it kills the spamif not makes it harder for them to get the word outrough idea but its better than nerfing the scamming industry outright
kinda rough but worth supporting so it gets more attention
yes its rough but you are more than welcome to smooth it outthe point is simply this stop the spam but not the scam
the above post should be striken from all records everbut yes i agree there are better ways to make the universe seem big without inconvieniancing players also convoys should be for in empire only and should be suicide gankable to add an element of too riskey haul it yourself then nub
i support everything except delivery of goods as has already been stated if you purchase an item in a remote solar system you have to go pick it up yourself and risk your ship or put out a courier contract and pay the other guy to risk his ship
just a request to any present or future member of the council could someone please press the issue of downtime during australian prime time gaming hours pleaseevery day every night without fail we have to put up with almost one hour of downtime and before the eu and us people all start saying getting over it just put yourself in our shoes and imagine if the game you love playing got shut down during the few hours you got to play each nightyou cant tell me that rotating the downtime isnt possible make it earlier make it later just come to a compromise please i have many mates very interested in the game but are turned off by this downtime every night by the time us aussies have dinner spend time with the family and then get on the pc we have very little time before the game shuts downedit some1 got in before me but i will leave this updoes ccp even care about us aussies im sure there are other nationalities affected too or is it just egg on our faces
rotating dt will just move this problem to another tz and no offense but i think there are more europeansamericansuk people playing then australians
 you this has been explained to death use the search
noone at ccp works during the hours you want dt moved to
eve servers in londonare you volunteering to pay the 4x pay for the server techs ccp techs and everyone else to work unsociable hours that has to be around when the dt happens rather than just on call or doing their normal jobsalso shifting dt will affect others and their playing and when the subscription was take out by myself i knew dt was 1112 gmt so work around it gives me chance to have lunch etc etcits been done to death dt will not move and has been the same since eve started one or two have been missed before but only for a trial
i forgot that shanghai is near bristol stupid geography skills
maybe this will give you some insight as to why you dont get your own personilised dtedit fixd link
i of course realize that we have a lot of selfish trolls around the place so it was expected to see them come out i wonder if any of them would be so tough in real life nah who am im kidding guess i will just have to put up with the internet cowboys from brokeback mountianheres hoping ccp will one day take action though
the resemblance is shocking
how about it gos down every hour for 2 minutes or better yet at a random time drawn each day by the old tech ii lottery calculatoryou can post your request in the assembly hall to see if any reps are foolish enough to alienate themselves from the majority of the playerbase just for us aussies tho
bolded the most important partyou say everyone else in eve except you are selfish for voting against moving of a dt because you miss playtime in the evenings you want ccp to move it for the sake of the aussies playing the game and then shifting the problem to a tz which is more represented i think you are the one here who thinks of nobody but himself
you and the others of course are so right your arguments are spot on well constructed and very thought out there is of course no way possible to find any chance of a compromise i also failed to see how unselfish you were actually being by suggesting that us aussies lump it or leave it because everyone else was happy with the arrangementi also sincerely apologize to ccp for even thinking that at 9am a very unreasonable working hour or even say 4pm its beer oclock one really cant work then that they have their maintenance techs maintain the superdooper cant change the shutdown timer computer i must admit it didnt occur to me that europeans only worked a few hours a day and anything over four hours was rated as overtime bye bye
ccp also works in iceland thier window to tweak stuff is pertty limited by another hour they preplan thier tweaks in the morning get the work request done and all setup then they let dt do its thing for 15 minutes then the devs get about 30 minutes to play around and then put everything back to where it was and finish the startup all over again then they have to have the after dt meeting to get farmed numbers and tweak results and lately the devs have been playing quite alot with tweaks its propably in preperation for ambulation and other improved networking abilities like that explained in the second logi get irked by it as well too i work a shift where it does effect me but hey im getting more sleep than usually and getting more artwork done if you want lessen your dt woes dont start playing before dt starts play after its over it wont be as bad
i guess the only way ccp would be able to solve this would be to remove the daily downtime this would require a complete overhaul of how they do things currently and i think ccp is not going to do thatso while i think they do care about you aussies i am convinced that their hands are tied when it comes to this subject
removing dt not out of the question its possible in theory they are not prepared to do that yet and spend the massive revenue they dont have in order to acheive this at the current time
the ops request was certainly not unreasonable a lot of the di answers were however
if they move the dt to 9am the devs have to get in much earlier to prep for the dtif they move the dt to 4pm and somthing goes wrong the devs will be in work fixing the problem and the dt will run into the primetime for the majority of the eve playersif you do not like the current downtime where you live i would suggest changing to a country closer to gmt
whine thread is successful whinewould you like cheese with thatlearn to use the search feature moronand try reading before responding hypocritical troll
i believe that is known as a real life threat ban his ass ccp
yeah i get that its irritating thing is dt will always have to be right in someones way downsides of living on a round planet really australia is a fairly small market and your prime play hours are ccps prime work hours looks like you get to bite the bullet its not fair  really it sucks  but theres not really much possible in the way of a comprimise that moves it out of your tz that doesnt shaft some other big group of players andor ccps internal schedules
the good of the many  the good of the fewyoure on the wrong side of the inequation
i assume you are speaking of gmt timeswhat exactly is wrong with 9am if they use normal work time they would have had 2 hours to prep how much more do you need to prep for something that happens once a day id say they have the process pretty streamlined after 5 yearsmoving it in the other direction is not very good as you say that would affect a lot of players
well to be honest that dt is most convient for ccp its always going to tick someone off and apparently your one of them to be honest live with it go eat lunch ride a bike read a book do something other than eve online for an hour you wont die isaac
give it another few hours and it will be half way across the pacific that could work not meny easter islanders on here is therestfu hawai go sunbathe or surf or somthing
and just what time would that be smartass
well that would be gmt 10 according to this super dooper timezone map that would make it roughly about 4 hours sooner than what the current dt is
so what time would that be in the 4 time zones of the usahow many players are on at the timewhat time would that be in iceland and the ukif you would use your bloody freaking brain youd realize someone somewhere is going to be ed off and it dont matter what time it is in hawaii or in the easter islandsthey picked the time they did because they said soend of discussionand for the 100000000000000th time this has been raised the answer will forever be no
so 11 pm pacific time im sure the west coast students will appreciate that itd probably make me go to bed sooner some nights giving me a hard end time of 2 am but thats not always desirable also 7 am british time is not exactly when you want to do some of these things if youve got anything other than the exact standard downtime happening
well that would make it about 1 am my time 3 am eastern and midnight west coast im not sure about the uk or iceland because i generally do not look at the clock when i playand im not sure why your barking at me i personally like my current 5 am downtime while i sleep i just pointed you to a timezone map
sorry just tired of seeing this stupid assed proposal for the millionth time
dont like the idea but an increase to wardec cost which is proportional to the size of corpalliance would be handyi mean logically it would cost more to go to war against 5000 people then 500possibly concord would look at it like bigger bribe for looking the other way as the targets get bigger
hell nothen it would cost literally nothing to wardec a 5 man group with a 50 man groupmost wardecs are with smaller targetsnot bigger onesif they where bigger ones id have literally no issues with itbut most wardecing corps are in it for the sport of griefing and are cowards when it comes to challenging larger prey they would rather win not lose
you are wrongi do not support this idea
doesnt everyone
well yeah of course but im speaking in terms of contextbiasattitudewars are never one sided and rarely do you see an underdog situationbut people are having trouble keeping that in mind and when that happens they come up with stupid ideas like basing wardec fees on population
this is an unfortunate truth ccp took the rout of making caldari unpopular rather than just trying to make the other races more popular problem with trying to control population this late in the world of eve is the fact that its way too late to be effective in any reasonable length of time too many caldari chars already exist and that wont change soon ive just resigned myself to dying in any pvp situation for the next few years until populations are past being balanced out and caldari are in the minority thats what it seems it will take for the nerfs to go away til then ill just clutter high sec with the rest of the missile specs who are training into other things

basically you have never flown any other race and everything you know about other races is what you read on forumsgb2wow
caldari chars maybe overpoppulated but in pvp caldari ships are nowhere near as many as amarr or matar ships at least in the region where im currentlyjust last roaming we hadonly hacs7 muninn10 zealot1 eagle died3 cerb5 deimos2 istars0 sacri3 vagaor fleet bs opsonly bs15 mega1 domi12 apoc1 abba3 rokh12 tempest3 typho2 mael2 scorp3 ravenand usually these ratios are true for most ops
and completely worthless because youve just said that the mega is the best sniper
you forget about the chimera which is one of the best carriers hands downthe pheonix is epic for pos bashing which was the primary use for dreads according to ccpfalcons and rooks have a wicked part in roams and fleetscerbs are wicked inti snipers with precisions good dps boats with heavys and hass the eagle is the furthest sniping hac in the game afaiknh is a wicked command shiplevi is an awesome titanmanticore is the best stealth bomberthe caldari inties are awesomethe flycather is the fastest locking of the dictorsthe onyx is tied for first for best hicgolem is a wicked maurader for ratting in deep 00 and missioningthey have the best jf if im not mistakendrake is the best mid level mission runnerhave i missed anything cause thats a lot of up sides to the race
realy have i i thought i said that caldari is the least used race in pvp oh noyou must be right the raven should be the top used with its awesome dpstank while still having 200km optimal
bobbeh if thats all true and caldari ships are so great then why do nearly every fleet i fight or fly in only fly one caldari ship consistentlythe falcon
chimera oh then it is only me who thinks carriers are realy balanced outphoenix sux even at pos shootin right now delay dmg sux they deal the least dmg durion our ops and just not talk about fleet fights for the phoenixfalcon rook well still needs some time to decide if they are still good enough or not i could just bring a zealot which would remove enemy permanently from the fightcerb inti sniping with precision do you mean assault launchers with caldari navy bloodclaw because precision missiles are so useless it still has no tackle gear and medicore tanklowmedicore dps oh and missiles not good for snipingeagle is still the worst sniper hac muninn zealot are much betternh is not a command ship it is a t2 price tagged drakenothing elselevi okay althou all titans are awesomemanticore is not the best sb  that would be the hound or the much cheaper puricaldari inties hmm i thought there are much better inties for tackling which they should doflycatcher devoterbroadsword  onyx thats what i hearedgolem yep i still wouldnt use it in 00jf no not the best i would call the matar the best one but all jf are the same more or lessdrake another pve related priceyes you missed the rokhharpy which are the only usefull railships for caldari
caldari have a lot of problems with specific ships and weapon systems most of these issues arent gamebreaking but they could use a fix nonethelessand bobbeh i disagree with a lot of your points the chimera would be great if the meta didnt favor armor so strongly the flycatcher is actually the slowest locking dictor not that it matters for bubbling now having the lowest speed that sucksthe lev has the best damage type on its dd the bonus is inferior to the avatars and erebus caldari have one great inty and the worst intythe manticore isnt the clear cut best the hound and purifier can fit three damage mods and are faster wether thats worth an extra mid and more cpu comes down to personal preference i wont comment on the pve stuff now for problemscitadels fail in capital fights  the secondary role of dreads as stated by ccp theres two reasons horrible explosion velocity and slow speed speed is getting boosted but that wont make them good in long range engagementsevery capital sized weapon system has a long and short range version except missiles which lack capital cruiserockets again explosion velocitycruise missiles are lackluster in pvpthe nighthawk badly lacks grid to be worth using over any of the alternatives in pvpthe caracal lacks grid for a workable ham fitthe moa is inferior to the rupture and thorax it should lose the worthless extra high and gain a mid 644 is a bad layoutthe ferox needs an extra turret to be on par with the brutix the raptor needs something changed more grid would be good more speed would be great currently there is no reason to use it over the other tackle intiesand then theres the hawk  enough said reallyso while i dont believe the race as a whole is broken i do think some changes are in order
yes you have implicitly equated popularity with superiority implying that since the mega is the most common sniper bs in your gang it must be the best but its well known that the apoc and rokh are the best snipers and that the mega and tempest are distinctly inferiorbut since were talking about caldari thingies that need fixingcitadel torps need to be more effective against moving capitals need to be faster being fixedcitadel cruise needs to existhawk need to do more damage than a kestrel needs more cpu needs shield boost bonus switched to shield resistrockets need to be less hilariously allround badcruise needs a role probably impossible to fixcaracal needs pg to fit 5x hm ii lse ii and mwd iraptor needs something to make it worthwhile in a galaxy that has the aresnighthawk needs a cubic litre more pgi dont think theres a fundamental problem with the moa or ferox the brutix and thorax arent particularly attractive ships these days because of poor rangesand related guristas ships need to be not utterly worthlessnidhoggur should be shieldtanked to restore capital tank balanceshield transfers should not require all your ships cpu and then some more
the ferox and brutix follow the same design as rokhhype how would you feel if the rokh had one less gungranted that wasnt an entirely fair comparison because the brutix cannot reach fleet engagement range while the ferox can so it does have that going for itthe moa though if you fit it for its intended role with rails its a mid range cruiser with low dps and no tank it fills a niche that isnt useful in game it lacks enough midslows to both shoot and lock at fleet range and if you fit it with blasters you run into all the problems a blaster thorax has with none of the plusesit doesnt have any kind of advantage that would justify having only four midsthat said i dont consider these to be critical issues
yeah i agree completely about the moa filling a role that isnt useful problem its the same problem that cruise has  whats the use of a longrange antibs missileeft suggests that the moa can be competitive in a blaster fit lse buffer tank full tackle better optimal but the lack of drone bay hinders it the other problem with moa and ferox is to make them work in their intended sniper roles you need good skills  but if you had good skills youd be in an eagle
no change ingame yet then you have my support no need to bludgeon op for something coming soon if anything this just shows ccp we want it sooner i think ccp needs some communication tool upgrades in general forumswebsite need work ingame email needs work
in fact in rl you have a higher chance to be robed if you dont pay attention for your assets in eve if you haul expensive stuff afk you asume the risk of being blown up in pieces moreover if you haul that in a tech i hauler with nothing else then cargo expanders even you dont need much isk to fill out your empty slots with tech i mods you dont deserve your cargo and there are repercusions ship loss most of the time someone else take the wrecks loot you are flashing red to all players around and they can shoot you without to get a killright and beside that you need to do lots of dmg in very short time before concord to shoot web scram neutralize and jamm you reward sec status loss and most of the time good things are destroyed and the remained loot do not worthit anyway is a matter of luckin fact concord is overpoweredonly the wise players that haul expensive things afk in a unfitted tech i frig or industrial should be blaimed for high sec ganking
hello allno im not a candidate in this election i did feel like posting a reply about this thoughrecently i lost nearly all of my possessions well over 2b isk worth in a highsec gank while i was tending to my kids it hurt but thats eve and i recovered eve is a dogeatdog world and if you act like the lame gazelle in the bunch expect the lions of the serengeti to feast on your remainseliminating insurance payouts is a good idea and it wont do a thing to stop highsecurity piracy considering the profit margin is usually much more than the loss of a sacrificial vessel implants should never be insurableits like asking ccp to pay for your clone if you die in faction warfare rigs modules implants buying insurance t2 discrepancies etc are all prices one must consider the cost of when engaging in any sort of pvp whether highsec or lowsecjust my 2 isk
the topic of applying the same effect of local in wormholes is a bit of a mixed bag for me im not fond of it being implemented without the addition of more game mechanics that function off of itto give you an example there needs to be a benefit to holding sov in a given system when hostiles come into your territory if local were changed an advanced warning system that notified people friendly to the sovholding alliance would be ideal i would also urge the addition of a way to disable this advance warning to give crafty invaders a way to penetrate enemy territory
im going to be slow to respond to further inquiries until sunday evening the 10th since ill be attending evevegas if by chance youll be there too do not hesitate to come up and say hello ive also updated my web site with new content and will be adding much more on monday
that flashgame has my vote
i totally agree with your view as i have been trying to point out earlier in this thread balance is the key word hear some of the challengers only pay attention to the detail personal views of the candidate instead of focusing on his general attitude erik has a neutral approach and a skill in diplomacy so to add to your important voice fille i would like to once again emphasize those are the main qualification to get results with ccp and as far as the take care is concerned i think that erikc cautions approach and ankhes perseverance and passion makes them an excellent team vote erik
so heres some more tough questions proposed capital ship changes and future of said shipsnow im not wanting the removal of cap ships so lets say thats out of itnow with the upcoming cap changes and the proposed bandaid fix to the naglmao and the phoewho what can i expect of you to push for and why and what about carriers  motherships will we see a buff to their actual use rather then a ship hauler and thats it ie will my mom be useful or still a over expensive pos and i dont mean a starbase pos lol
just to add i am looking at voting for you but just want to make sure that my vote goes towards the right person so 
vuk is cool guy with good ideas for players vote for vuk 
o
i like that bit it is easy to forget sometimes not sure who i am voting for yet but smaller gang emphasis would be a welcome change to pvp blobfestsi am curious if you have had any experience or feelings about doomsdays and titans
i almost experienced a titan once got briefly involved with a failtastic alliance associated with atlas before the great retreat was on my way to participate in a fleet battle got podded about 2 jumps out from the jump bridge while alliance mates ignored the fight and continued on to the jump bridgeyeah that reminded me why i love 00 alliances so muchso no i have no direct experience with titans or with doomsdays ive only seen capital ships a handful of times most of my time is spent in highsec i spent about 3 months living in lowsec and now i semiregularly venture into wormholes theyre a great source of amusement excitement and profit and theyre rarely blobbed to hell
you got my votei like your view of 00 and lvl4empire inbalanceedit i have some questions would be kind if you could answerthose are topics im interested in1 what are you thinking about the current situation with supercapitals especially titanand do you see are problem in the increasing numbers of them if yes do you have already ideas at hand to stop fleets being victims of multiple dds one titan per region one dd per system changing dds etc2 whats your opinion to great powerblocks in eve like the nc or the antibobcoalition do you see any problems there should it be possible for big alliances to hold that big amounts of space3 how could 00 be easier accessible for the mediumsized alliances without having to napevery powerblock around causing biggerbigger blobs is this in your mind when you are discussingthe reform of the sovsystem do you see a problem here
i have not really taken a standpoint on this but i do agree that there is a problem especially when one can field upto 10 at a timeone dd per system region etc i think can be exploited eg friendlies dd somewhere in system or in the region to prevent hostile ddi am kinda fond of the idea that when a titan dds it can not warp or jump for 10 minutes i believe a titan should not be what we say in norwegian tUFFFDm og rUFFFDm which basically means ejeculate and run you should ejeculate and stay nowhere to run and nowhere to hide nomatter what kinda whale it might bei see this as a problem currently the problem lies in the players with their napsquadtypeofleadership safetyinnumbers analogy and game mechanism due to how sovreignity works with poss all you need is to blob the enemy to kingdom come and youll win that is what i am trying to achieve with a change in the sovreignity system i really hate the numbers game and i truly hate the tedious system where one have to shoot poss for hours and hours this is a game it should be challenging and fun not boring and monotonus

small chimp had a good idea about making a chart to tell csm candidates apart at a glance so ive shamelessly stolen it and created a questionnaire to help people make their decision about who to vote for without having to dig through 40 campaign websites its not complete obviously but its got a fair bit of information and i hope it helps more answers will be added as i get them candidates ive sent all of you an evemail but if youd prefer you can answer below view the chartwhat is the single biggest issue you will attempt to work on if elected to the csm what is your single biggest activity as an eve player rate your knowledge of the following aspects of the game on a scale from 1 to 10 where 10 is high 00 warfare piracy pve industryrate your general happiness with the following aspects of the game on a scale from 1 to 10 where 10 is high supercapital ships sovereignty mechanics low security space local chat channel minerals and t1 items in npc loot players being allowed to join npc corps at will the user interface
herschel i will send you my reply on monday im off to evevegas so my access till then will be very limited
excellent chart i hope it gets filled out so the voters can make a rational decision on where the candidates stand thank you for taking the time to do this for the voting pool in general
reply sent
this would be of far greater import if all players were measuring from the same benchmarks and frankly if they were making honest appraisals rather than vote grabbing
to be honest i tend to agree whilst i appreciate the sentiment of this questionnairegrid thingy the fact that it is self appraisal mixed with a lack of clear measurement added to the fact that everyone wants to be elected and therefore their answers may be a bit skewed from the reality makes this sort of thing a bit of an irrelevance to any voter who actually cares about the issues id much rather see people questioning the candidates closely for themselves and making their judgments based upon that
sent reply
thats a problem especially with the knowledge questions so far the average level of knowledge exhibited by the candidates is 728 which is probably a little highthough i put myself down for 825 so who am i to talk the single biggest issue and happiness with questions are harder to abuse similarly though  you cant please everyone with your answers and were seeing a wide variety so far also im up to 16 answers from candidates so im updating the chart now
i will log in and reply tonight
what is this doing on page 2i know the current graphics are probably placeholders until the new epic jump graphics are finished but please at least tell us that they are indeed coming
this 
yes
why the hell would you change the old effect
i see a discussion going on in gd with mixed results so might as well give it a try herewe all know about the corporation wallet divisions to seperate the isk into various categories to make it easier to track why not allow this for personal wallets as well of course to prevent it from using too many server resources there would likely be only one or two additional divisionsthe reasoning behind it pros1 makes managing incomeexpenses so much easier2 would fit easily into eve why in this day and age are we restricted to one account when the average person has more than that3 reduces the likelihood of overspending how many of you have accidentially spent too much money when you were saving for that shiny shipmoduleskillbookwhatever that you wantedpossible cons1 nerfs scamming by making it more difficult to get people to spend lots of money on a contract2 increased server lag now i know a lot of people will jump on the fact that it will nerf scamming but really how many people will micromanage their money all the time i personally would like it to keep track of how much i make doing whatever missioning mining and it would help corps by allowing them to seperate and distribute income from selling minerals on a mining op thus eliminating the penandpaper aspectthoughts if youre against it please say why so it can be put up for discussion
i think this is sometihng that has been brought up several times and i think ccp has said that its a possibility in any case signed
i guess i should use search more often i end up posting things as i think of them before they run away with my other thoughtsits happened before wait what was i thinking aboutoh rightsupporting my own topic
scam protection a nerf na screw a scammer
want
do want
this idea is a keeper
i agree
i could have sworn that this was raised earlier but i dont see it listed on the csm wikinevertheless supported
would be useful
i could have sworn that too
same
raised before raised now  whatever my answer remains the sameyes please and thank youas for nerfing scamming  not really if theyre successful scammers this really wont hurt them and if theyre not  well they should be thinking of another line of work anyway

i wonder if the devs have eyes sometimessuper signed
supporting this
i fully support the fact that supercaps need a serious rework many good ideas in this thread
i agree although i dont think i would use this as i generally have my second account on the second screen but still a very nice idea 
i support this idea just make it so you can inject any skill if you have all the required skills already even if they arent at the right level thusyou could inject cruiser once you have frig level 1you would not be able to put a single point into cruiser until you had frig level 4you would be able to queue cruiser to go right after frig 4i think the issue about having to carry a skill around with you for a day or week before you can train it isnt something we need to worry about but thats just me
this is a great idea although maybe not so drastic range boosts going from 20 to 30 and then 40 is plenty going all the way to 80 is a bit excessive
yes i thought of that before its really neededits annoying typing the range in middle of combat
though i prefer to give da bytez with lasers i have realized that many do not choose this route in fact because with all other weapon systems one has to be paying attention to the game to resume firing after reloading some people have trained into laser ships specifically for afk shooting purposes things that are useful to take out like station services and undefended starbases if ammo using weapons system resumed firing automatically after reloading it would put them closer to being on par with lasers when doing this sort of afk shooting obviously one could still run out ammo in the cargo hold but it would go a long way toward making hybrids projectiles and missiles more effective at shooting these kind of highhitpoint undefended targets also useful for my nonrevelation dreadnought brethren when shooting poses summary make hybrids projectiles and missiles automatically resume firing at the previous target after the guns finish reloading
posting to say i support giving da bytez for prolonged afk periods without using lasers
jumping on this for my poor nonlaz0rz friends
useful for dreads yes but also for a lot of other things too  this would be handy for gun ships in missions also for that matter lasers using factiont2 ammo would like this too i cant think of any real downsides offhand either supported
ccp fix this tia
i have to support this or i will get da bytez
supported
another month come and gone and no word from ccp about this would we be too optimistic to expect an answer that shows some evidence that ccp is in fact working on this ifwhen its raised during the upcoming meeting
awesome idea
as a ceo of a corporation with extensive wormhole operations this would make things a lot easier support
yeah no need for a new skill just add to the existing one
imo 5 isnt enough for the normal tractor beam it would only mean a 1 km increase per levelinstead raise it to 2550 per level or just increase the base range of the tractorbeamsor even better introduce more tractorbeam modules like mediumlarge
i would love to see this implemented
i like the idea but think it should have 4 mid slots so less likely overpowered costs should be around 150m
the nightmare has 7 mids 5 lows if they introduced it as a regular ship i agree it should have one less slot
yesfor one setting up contracts on items that are bought in quantities like ammo and drones is ed in my viewi think a corpalliance market place would be an awesome addition to the game im a ceo of a corporation and ive said many times that such a thing as this is soo neededthank you op for posting the proposal
sigh
number of users in local chat ruins the gameat least in 00ruins all strategy all pvp in eve is based on local chat its the main source of information for a fleet commanderi dont have the right words to say it but its very metagame intelwhen i play eve i like to feel inmersed in a space ship universe and local ruins it it dosnt have a meaning where does this information comes to your character jedi powersscanner and probbing should do the work you just need to add on the scanner if a ships has an user inside or not thats it dosnt have to say who is the character or if he is friendly or notfor me a player fully dedicated to pvp local chat intel is the worst thing in eve
for sure you cant train them so they shouldnt be listed of course i just drag and drop from the main skills window i dont bother with the skill queue window but im sure plenty of people do
not one to fall for scams like this or waste time using them id just sell a time code what irritates me is that it reduces the usefulness of the mechanic watching contracts in local while shopping in jitadisplaying the price in text in the contract is a good idea also contract links in local could include the contract price largest denomination 999m some contract only 1 million rather than some contract only 1 mil
agreed its not the scam thats annoying its the channel spam and reduced signalnoise ratio when looking through contracts spam is bad no matter what form it takes or what communication channel it infests
i agree having it round to the nearest thousand million or billion depending on which is most appropriatealmost 150 millionover 150 milliona lot easier to read then 149999999 i mean heck i even had to put commas in to make sure i was typing the right number of 9s in there
i fully support scammingi also support people having to put some effort into it
100 in
badly needed
supporting a good idea
the specific idea im not sold on but the proposal more generally of creating a better interface for contracts im all for tentative support
ditto marks
didnt realise that happenedobvious bug is obvious
that would be why this is a bug
support but only if the prereqs are in the queueexcellent idea
i agree with this
isnt that allready possible with a courier contract maybe
only up to cruiser size as a courier contract is limited to 120000 mUFFFD
i dunno about that just because something can fit in a room doesnt mean it can fit through the door the loading bay doors on a freighter arent as large as the cargo hold itself can you put a automobile inside a room yes  but you have to take it apart cary the pieces in and then put it back together would this be much more difficult or even impossible with custommade or weldedon rigged vehicle parts yes i like a tug boat style ship solution
this is a fallacious arguement at best they currently make cargo aircraft where the entire nose and tail swing aside allowing for a doorway with exactly the same inner dimensions as the cargo bay itself theres no logical reason why an internet spaceship couldnt do the sameunless of course spacecraft engineers are dumber than aircraft engineers at any rate supported
support
exactly those are specially designed vehicles for transporting complete vehicles or other very large objects that cant be disassembled they also make quite a few cargo aircraft that have regular loading bay doors  in fact this is far more common your average fedex or ups cargo plane doesnt have the military flipup and roll out a tank fitting
true but they also dont have containers that can store 30 more than their exterior volume
its an annoying feature that doesnt add anything to the game so supported
the idea the op has isnt really the right way to fix the stacking issue but i do think that there should be some kind of change at the very least it seems kind of odd that i can use 5 cap rechargers and they are all fully effective heck the 5th one is the most effective of them all based on current mechanics and fitting 8 cargo hold expanders well there is no penalty and again the later ones are more effective a single 22 cargo hold on a 600m3 hold isnt much 8 gets it up to over 2944 6001228now take a look at armor hardeners t2 give 55 to resists suppose you start at 20 that means you are taking 80 damage a single hardener will change you to 64 resists 36 damage 55 less then none right now the second takes you to 812 188 damage 47 less then one the 3rd takes you to 871 thats 129 damage or 31 less then with two a 4th will take you to 891 resists which is 109 or 15 better then with threenow i realize that its hard to make something that trends down towards 0 balanced but they did it with cap rechargers so why not resists with fixed static numbers it could look like this damage takenone 36two 3655162three 365555  729four 36555555  32805  967195 actual resistnow thats clearly over powered or is it fitting 4 hardeners of a single type might make you almost immune to a single damage type but the other types will suffer for pve yes its overpowered maybe not so much for pvp but im not sureanyway so with no stacking its overpowered with stacking the 4th or 5th modules are rather useless perhaps we can find some sort of balance that lets people use a 4th module without too much penalty without letting it get down to such a low levelon a side note if there was no stacking penalty using base values for an eanm ii 7 of them would increase a base resist of 20 to a total of 83 thats also a bit on the high side but if you are fitting that many omni tanks you should get something for your money right now fitting 7 will give you 571 resists with all level 5 skills it changes to 886 with no penalty and 639 currentyay math i guess taking those courses was useful after allso to sum up my postthe current system only puts a stacking penalty on some modules not allthe 3rd module for stacking penalized systems is weak 4th pretty much not worth havingremoving the stacking altogether would be overpowered for resists and anything else that trends from 100 to 0 or from 0 to 100things that have a larger scale or scale upwards cap scaling down from 1000 to 0 or cargo scaling up from 600 to 3000 are currently not penalizedshrugi do support that there should be a change i dont support the change the op put forth because its broken
maybe that just isnt true while i think the idea is bad there are certainly games which do everything from the base stats
pity support
supportcan we please play the game instead of ccp treating us like carnies that have to jump through our daily quota of flaming hoopsonly complete masochists who find themselves well invested in drudgery will think anyones getting away with anything if the game isnt so demandingone of the cool factors of a persistent universe is having lots of player interaction all over the place confining the reach of players within this persistent universe is the same as lowering the player density
i agree with most of the stuff being said hereeither more range and tracking or higher damage multiplier to compensate the poor damage from bad tracking
bumping allowed in here
i could see this as working if you had to take from the top first untrain bs before you can untrain cruiser etc and could only untrain one at a timeput the points into a pool and then have a second queue that trains out of that poolyou cant put any skills in the bonus queue that are in the normal queue and the bonus queue trains at half speedso no skill points would be lost they would lose the skill and have to buy it again but changing out a 30 day cruiser 5 skill would take 60 days to empty the pool into other skillsmake it so they have to be the same attributes to prevent exploits and that you cant untrain a skill while there are skill points in the bonus poolhows that for an idea much better then the ops idea

i find that the current dss probes are sort of useful in that you can drop a single one set it to 256 raise it high above the system and then hit scan and you will get a listing of every sig and its relitive scan strength because the probe is like 100au away from everything so the distance effect is lowyou wont know where anything is but then you can decide if you want to start scanning the strong ones in wormhole space likely to be gravladar sites or the weak ones likely to be radarmag now that we have the ids in place we can just pick the topbottom id off the list scan it down with cores and then start over again with the dss for the next on the listi do still think the dsss should get a bit of a boost or that there should be an advanced core probe that cant scan ships but is stronger maybe 10 stronger then the normal core probe but also allow it to expand all the way from 025 to 256au that gives people the choice between dss which can pick up ships and something a bit stronger and more useful for explorationand of course allowing more then just four probes to be used is huge since the main exploration skill gives you extra probes and you start with four having both the minimum and maximum useful number be four is rather stupid keep the check on where they are so that you still have to be careful about where you place them although with more skills you could be a bit sloppy without too much of a hit but you cant just throw them at it and expect it to workon a side note sometimes when we have 3 probes touching a spot we get a sensor echo where we get two results for the same sig the second result is hidden though could we have that fixed so its visible again the echo should be kept we just need to be able to see both results
i tried reading the comments here but they degraded into useless flaming far too quickly so ill just state my opinion and move oni posted a petition about 2 years ago regarding this problem and was told ccp were working to address it australia is not the only country that has dt at an inconvenient time so all of you that are saying we yes im australian are not important enough can go take a look at your tz mapi think everyone needs to take 5 and have a look at what youre all arguiing about for instance one person makes the point that by moving dt you would just inconvenience another country well obviously but thats the issue isnt it that one group of countries are being inconveniencedi suggest now as i did 2 years ago that dt be cycled let us all take turns at dealing with having eve shut down during our prime time heck you could do something as simple as swapping it by 12 hours every second dayi support this thread and i am highly disapointed at the childish selfish and many arrogant comments i was forced to wade throughedit to the person who linked this image 
sounds like a good idea maybe make it a 20 hour cycle rather then 23 hour cycle

bump for the eve criminal elements candidate
well if it will get me a vote or 2 i turn 40 at the end of the monthdont worry about any expensive gifts your vote will do fine
im the youngest candidate wootopps les posted with alt by accident
why not normalize the answers divide each number by the mean of that candidates numbers and multiply the result by 5chip
i should have just put all 10s for knowledge
one some candidates do genuinely know a lot it is possible for someone to justify 4 10s though unlikely secondly i trust the bull detection capabilities of the average voter  if someone puts down numbers too high it gives you some insight into the sort of person that they are if you think someones numbers are unjustified yell at them in their thread people dont say bad things about themselves but this is why we all have opponents
the good old question that always makes it clear where everybody standshigh sec low sec 00 you know the questionshould highsec be more secure eg ninja salvage can flipping contract scams be made impossiblein shortmost carebears will love you smallest part forum membersmost griefers will hate you biggest part forum membersmost 00 wont careplease replay candidates and give your view about the subjectsehi
ninja salvage can flipping contract scams are fine the way they are the contract scam spam is a bit annoying though for people who arent going to fall for it anyways and just want to buy their stuff and get out of jitaedit and while you didnt mention it suicide ganking is fine as well just be conscious of how much value you put into your ship and keep it below a certain level then you dont really have to worry about suicide gankers
high sec is exactly that high security not total security i think right now the balance is pretty good keep your wits about you or even blunder about like a blind spastic in most cases and youre pretty much guarenteed safety can flipping was implemented at the behest of miners who wanted a way to combat ore thieves and now look at them bemoaning the mechanics i can see similar apoplectic whines from mission runners should changes be made to salvaging leave the system as is for every carebear that scores a touchdown for democracy as he one volleys a salvaging destroyer with his golem another four or five will lose them tbh the fallout from this though hilarious and profitable probably wont be worth it one could make all sorts of rl paralels salvage rights etc etc leave it as is to save a lot of carebear butthurt see im helping you guys out herecontract scams unless youre completely brain dead youre not going to fall for one its good that eve has means of equalizing ones iq and wallet balance in such ways contract scams being one of many
as lark said hi sec is just that high security not absolute security there are way to protect yourself against ninja salvaging can flipping contract scams etc that people chose not to use them is their choice and they must accept the consequences whether this is the popular answer or not is irrelevant the important thing is that at a fundamental level the lack of complete security and accepting consequences of your choices is what eve is really about
high sec was never meant to be 100 safe if you are stupid eg hauling 1 bil of stuff in iteron v you will probably attract unwanted attention whereever you go ninja salvaging can flipping etc fine as it is pirating fine as it is ive read all the posts regarding dropping insurance for pirates on their ships frankly this is a poor idea and shows little understanding of pirating a good pirate can afford to lose a few mil in shipssince she will be targeting far juicier preycontract scams are annoying waste everyones time and clog up contracts however if players want to waste time doing such things rather than get out and about and enjoy the more active part of eve let em just one less idiot to shootof course not allowing contract links to be posted in local might make local a bit easier to followxavier
short and simple no
i agree with everyone else thus far high security does not mean complete security you want a world with no consequences and no risks go play wow
nope its fine as it is i may want a bit of tweaking around the edges but the fundamental mechanics are fine
another month come and gone and no word from ccp about this would we be too optimistic to expect an answer that shows some evidence that ccp is in fact working on this ifwhen its raised during the upcoming meeting

afs need their fourth bonustheyre 40mil ships that can barely kill a destroyersure they work in gangs but anything works if you outnumber your opponent enoughthe weber nerf helped afs bit but the missing bonus would be just enough to balance the cost effectivnes out
as someone whos considering acquiring afs i fully support this motion especially because i want to be able to fly a hawk
this i dont get  the retribution is explicitly a fleet ship imo and its great at it the ability to project solid dps to 20km and melt faces at point blank whilst at the same time eating damage  thats what the more ganky afs are for surelythe point about the vengence weapons is spot on  it is completely insane that the majority of fits mine included opt for projectile weapons as opposed to rockets but thats an inherent problem with rockets if they fix them then im still not sure i see where the extra bonus comes from without making it overpowered 100120 dps hopefully  lets see what ccp come up with though and the ability to tank like a beast is more than enough isnt itmind you i rather like the afterburner ideamore discussions afs are far from perfect but they do now rock a little at least the trick is to chart a course that doesnt attract the nerf bat and im still not sold that 4th bonuses are the way to go im willing to be convinced though so get to it
well the thing with a retribution is you can fit an omen or even a prophecy to do better dps and tank better for less isk the advantage of an af in fleets is its speed and agility in fleets this means it serves best as heavy tackle im not saying its totally useless and i can see why people would still choose to fly it but in terms of balance an uninsurable 20 mil isk ship should have some utility over an insurable 5 mil isk shipas for the second point its pretty simple to me all other t2 ships get 4 bonus with the majority getting the 2 bonus from the t1 version i understand your point about not making them a prime target for a swing of the nerbat but they will simply be in line with all the other t2 its just a case of ensuring the bonus are balanced hence ive tried to provoke a bit of discussion as to what the bonuses could be
frankly assault ships need to either have a fourth bonus or have one of their bonuses changed to a role bonus and then be reassigned as faction frigates with the resistance bonuses left in place or slightly modified as a prelude to faction ships in general being boosted
supportedtitans role totally should be revamped and dd removed as its ruining 00 warfare
49 2 nights ago is a perfect example of why dd need to be removed 2 titans logged in were in warp in under 3 min 40 bs and more support killed relatively equal matched fleet jumps in and goes balistic bc they now have a large advantage with all those ships killed ahead of timetitans removed a massive amount of our firepower in the blink of an eye before the fight could even begin id have rather had a disabled fleet with half their mods heat damaged than dead ships so we could have had a better alternative to fight it out
yaay let us enjoy few more months dding you guys d
doomsday adds more strategical options into the game which is good of course but the downside of it  reduced amount of conventional fleet skirmishes  is way too bad in the eyes of majority of players i reckon

the ingame browser for eve is a joke it barely and i mean barely works what is the point of having an in game browser if it doesnt allow you to browse the internet i do not think it will be that hard to fix only good can come from fixing this issue expand on it if you wish
theres a browser
oh come on eves browser is great sure you have to hit alttab before you use it and if you click on a link without doing that it opens in some godawful piece of crap instead of trusty firefox but firefox itself works just great more seriously i proposed a topic that touched on this a year ago and the response back was that a fully new igb was in the works i assume this is part of the same project that will fix evemail as wellthe whole eve facebook thing yeah we all want it but its coming and im not sure how much we need to ask for it again
this may have been brought up already but i didnt see it when i lookedwhat about paint jobs for ships nothing too detailed but  anything would be better honestlywould it be hard to implement different colors details what have youi think this would just be something hopefully easy to put in that would change up the montony of seeing the same thing all the timealso if it is possible please please dont make us train new skills for thisie if i wanted to put racing stripes on a kestrel which i dont but if i did i dont want to have to train straight line painting technology to level 3 to do itskaneditor maybe now im running off on a tangent here but if we did have to train up perhaps some expensive paint that would decrease your signature ie stealth make it harder to target someone iono im done p

its already been brought up please quit being lazy and use the search feature to find crap we dont need 1000s threads for one ideaisaac

hello skandim worried about this too i had a lot of support on my thread in a method that made sense imho but the csm didnt advance the issue maybe it will advance to ccp next session but for now nothing can be done more
seems like most people are stuck on the lag parti dont see it being a huge issue myself and if you give the option to turn it off i really dont see the problemskan
1 look harder2 excuse isaacs slightly foul mood  o but he is right3 lag is a valid concern because ships load once you arrive within the local area of wherever your warping too each one would invovle textures for each variant and paint jobs would number in the thousands of if not millions depending on how much freedom you have in painting itat this point i would say no whether you can turn them on or noti would say paint corp logos instead
corp logos would be nicehow about and i think this will go ahead and beat most of the naysayers a set of optionssay iono 5 different paint jobs you could pick fromwould still let you make it your own at least a bit and they are already loaded so the game doesnt have to load up a paint job someone spent 9 hours onhonestly i dont think it would make a whole lot of lag it would have to be tested to see for sureskan
fewer options means lighter loadlets to a bit of mathlets say you have a picture and the picture is 50kb thats killobytes1000 kb is 1 mb megabytes and 1000 mb is 1 gb gigabytes and so forthwith that in mind each ship has a different size bigger the ship bigger the picturefor kicks lets say a frigate is 1 picture and a cruiser is 2 pictures and a battleship is 5 picturesnow multiply that by 1 to 200multiply that yet again by the number of high sec systems currnetly busygetting the picture
eve could give predefined hull patches for each and every player to color any rgb or hsb way he likes and it would still not create any relevant amount of load at allthe textures are already all without coloration most dont seem to know that the colours and hullpatch data is all shaders and alpha channels apoc eom apoc khanid apoc paladin all the same texture just different shaderpresets this data is already handled by your client the only change would be that instead of telling the client which preset it should use it would transmit a variable in the mass of transmitted data that would no make any relevant differenceit would be different if all ships were prerendered instances of one universal archetype but they are notadding corp logos to the hulls would be no impressive calculation either that is just a prerendered texture with an alpha channel slapped onto the hull texture would cause a helluva lot less load than the calculation of avatar images when you meet someone for the first time since most of all that is handled on the client side it could easily be load adjusted fit with a low priority so that it is not loaded when other factors put a lot of strain on the clientthe possibility to do it is not worth any discussion really it is possible easily the only true question that remains is whether or not ccp wants to do it if they want it it is a cakewalk to put it inas long as it is subtle and as long as there will be no ships with 8bit schlongs on the hull i am in favour of any such flavour addition
im all for allowing selection of a a preset group of design patterns and primary and secondary colors im not for custom paint jobs proudly displaying billys emember in full colorim even okay with it costing isk to apply a new paint job to a ship  heck id pay itmy only concern is that we wont be able to tell t2 ships apart from their t1 counterparts but thats what the overview is for anyway
sometimes there are connection problems sometimes there are other things that cause this for example loosing electricity for 1 second and having your computer autorestart or some few hundred people jumping into the region and lagging you out  lost dronesso youve been missioning ratting or whatever if at this point you loose connection to server then npcs will most likely kill those drones sometimes these connection issues last only a few seconds and you are able to login right after but you still loose your drones because your dominix or carrier takes 10 minutes to drive all the way to your drones my bad fighters not affected removed that partthis issue is fairly old and it serves no practical purposethis same issue used to plague probes but now we have a button reconnect to probes therefore i propose adding a similar button for drones or simply have them never be lost perhaps set a drone loss timer for 1 or 2 hours like wrecks have it so that once you login your drones are still controllable
and of course im supporting myself
i support this i hate that drones become uncontrollable after a disconnect  accidental warp even if you quickly return to the grid within control range of them againand since you cant move drones from cargo to drone bay in space scooping them dosent help much

not a single candidate mentioned fw as their primary point of concern there was at best 2 mentions of it at the very bottom of the pile of things they said they want to support most are overly concerned with 00 but not all of us care about 00  fw is pvp its not the pos siege or mass gate camping you can find in 00 its not the same but is still pvp while many mentioned that they are about the pvp not one of those people mentioned fw so that leaves me to believe that all of the csm candidates fail at representing a segment of the eve population i was going to enter the race butno passport and it would be closed before i could get one that leaves me to ask who of you mangy sobs actually participated in fw which one of you will actually help get fw moved in the right direction instead of nowhere anytime soon what we need just off the top of my headreasons to join fw 00 alliances gain systems for their efforts so far we gain nothing but a name to change as to who is controlling the systems in fw there is nothing gained from it im not one of those give me stuffz and ill pvp i have more then enough isk myself so i do not need to rely on any kind of prizes from fw to keep fighting i want the killsnothing more yet there are those that have gone back to carebearing because they felt they got nothing for their efforts how to work that out im not sure but then again im not a csm candidate looking to get votes we also need additional stuff so that fw seems more alive fw should be a mixture of pvp with some pve elements outside of plexes there should be some sort of scoring system where assualting a system and destroying interactable targets is the objective not just speed tanking a button until the plex flips i point you to wwwplanetsidecom the reason is that it is a mmofps game where players gain control of areas and gain some benefits from what they capture such a system should be mixed into fw what we would gain could be similar to benefits gained from leadership skills not just isk or stuff give people a reason to want to participate in the pvp mixed with pve fw is pvp yet it is also pve as players are supposedly a part of a supplementary force for the 4 empires this means fw should have aspects that are not a part of 00 where players are the empires of course some things introduced into fw could end up being part of 00 id like to be able to put up some sort of defenses using anchoring skills something that allows players to fortify systems at their own expense if we have a reason to fight or defend systems other then i guess rp reasons then people will want to spend money on deployable defenses im not talking poses on the gates but player controlled turrets or other things such as deployable repair stations  objects that you might have seen in missions structures that are anchored but not a part of a pos it would give mini objectives for gangs to attack or defend basically there is a lot that fw can introduce things that can also find its way into 00 one way or another so which one of you is actually going to represent the fw players out there also how do we know you will actually represent us
a wrong board should be in jita parkb fail troll is failedc reported
lol whut your kidding right good luck finding a candidate whos sole concern is factional warfare hell good luck finding anyone who actually can go to iceland to do it factional warfare is a pvp ground before 00 it was never meant to be a permanent state of mind by the way wrong forum jita park is where you need to goisaac
good luck with that report ccp needs to look at the descriptions before handing me anything based on a report for posting in a section where we bring up topics to csm if there is current csm members around apply my questions to youas for the other guy thanks ccp needs to look at the descriptions again and make it less vague ill be heading there
hello shardowccp knows about this problem and has been working with eva to find a solution fw is a great concept that was never implemented fully for fear of workarounds or other issues right now although fw does occupy a portion of the population ccp has things that are in dire need of a fix that affect a lot more people ie mining wardec mechanics 00 space just to name a fewid expect them to fix it but not soon they have a full workload and are cranking through it very well imho patience is a virtue
as much as it pains me to have to agree with someone from morsus mihi i have to support this idea
thats a great idea however i do object to supporting your own thread
ok so most will agree the current sov rules are out dated cause lag blobs and mean that there is quite a lot of luck involved in pos warfare ie stronting to the right level kiting poss to try and get the end of rf in your alliances prime etc etc etctherefore how about this as a proposal for candidates to mull over have a game mechanic based upon the fps domination game system where you have points in the system you have to capture but once to have captured them through whatever the decided mechanic is the sov begins to turn to you once you have sov at level 1 then small gate guns are onlined automatically in your favour and small poss can be placed sov 2 medium gate guns plus medium poss can be placed sov 3 large gate guns plus ewar and large towers can be placed plus the cyno jammers etcetc i this way you need to conquer a system in order to benefit from it you cant just kill an enemy r64 and place your own in their territory however when you have conquered it you get greater benefit than now it also mean to conquer a system you need to get past the border posts but also if you have a system that an enemy can block off you need to defend to sov 3 to get the ability to jf past the blockadeconstructive comments please
my opinion on these types of fixes to sov has always been if you want to play factional warfare go play itand i dont see how this will cut down on lag blobs since it still behooves you to stack the system so you can defend the control point more easily
i think sov needs fixing from what i hear anyway havent experienced much of it myself however i dont think this is the way to do it sorry
to be honest pos and sovreignity should be split
the reality is moving to another model will be difficult without disrupting artificially what tens of thousands of pilots and years have built nothing should be done lightly or with a broad brushi am of the camp that the sovmodel needs to be fixed with a scalpel not a battleaxei do however think our current pos model lends itself far more to manufacturing and storage facilities than as the focus point for 00 warfare something needs to be done but we have to be careful how it is handled fwoccupancy rules could theoretically be blended with the sov model after all its that way in lowsec and should be on the table but not as an outright replacement ammath for csm
in a realistic situation a large ship with 6 or 8 gums shooting at a smaller fast moving manouverable ship would not fire all shots to exactly the same spot as happens in eve but spread them out to give a greater chance of hitting the target and doing much more damage with the weapon grouping such a skill should be possible i would expect it to be a high level skill needing tracking and large guns to l5 and possibly advanced to l3 or 4 but it would help give a battleship pilot at least a chance of killing a few ships when attacked by a nano type gang so a volly skill for guns and salvo for missiles is what i prepose
wow no support for a topic i cant seem to figure out the problem of please lockisaac
hes proposing the ability to aim your guns parallel to each other so its not possible for all of them to hit a small moving target but more likely that at least one will hit the target rather than focused when aiming at a very hardtohit target approximately that means more successful hits but a lot less potential damage per hit with any kind of gun which is handy for a battleship trying to damage a ship that its nearly impossible to score a hit onhmmm maybe its potentially very unbalancing to the game if the effect is significant but if the effect isnt significant no one will bother to train such a highlevel skilli give this a provisional thumbsup creative and realistic idea ccp might well reject it out of hand if it even gets that far though
think flak cannons isaacits a fun idea for surebut it has its draw backsthe odds of nailing a target with that kind of setup are even worse than my maelstrom nailing a frigate at 10km with 8 1400mms thundering awayhowever if you had the skills to do a shotgun type of shot with the damage ratings be balanced enough to say oh maybe only 1 to 8 of the shots nailing its targetand the skills increasing the probability of nailing a bullseye with all cannonswould be a fun way of using heavy firepower in a close range aspectlong range doesnt make sense as the laws of physcis granted eve breaks them frequently would say the further the shot the farther apart the spread making it rather uselessim not going to support this until its refined but ill be watching o
i like the general idea i also like the idea of flak cannons but thats another subjectid like to see some refinement of the proposal around the idea of making it acceptable while not overpoweredone potential problem is how would you turn it off there are after all times when i want them to all fire at one place not bracket my target
thus the title says proposal not issuethat wasnt hard to figure out huh
well put simply treat it like a smart bombyou dont necessarily have to target you just need a general directionso you target a ship in a general direction so the cannons point at the target and open fireand god help anyone between you and your targetas for turning it on or off slave it to grouping controls or a on off switch for shotgun mode or something
howdyive been asking about flying in amarr t2 frigates especially the malediction but every time i do someone says that rockets are an awful weapon with serious problems im not experienced enough to do the number crunching with this but the sheer number of replies suggest that something is wrong perhaps someone with more experience could explain in detail what is wrong with them and why they subpar compared with other light weapon systems such as lasers and auto cannons
i havent used rockets in a long time but i think that the main issue is the terrible dps i think they need less range and more damage to fit with the unguided missile group rockets hams torps to my knowledge rockets havent been changed despite the introduction of hams and the changes to torps ages ago not everyone wants to see their range nerfed but without it i dont think theyre going to add enough damage to them because of balance
for current fleets to move around numerous amounts of rigged and unpackaged ships in todays eve is highly annoyinga simple way to fix this would be to buff carriers but that is unlikely as far as i seei also support the transportation of rigged ships in cargo but i believe this is an alternative if ccp doesnt like that option carriers today are too inefficient at this job only able to hold 2 battleships at a time at mostwhat i purpose is a modified version of a jump freighterthis ship would not have any fitting slots would warp  jump just as far as a jf warp just as fast and would even have the same hull as a jfwhat would be unique about this ship is that all it can hold is ships unpackaged only in a special hold called a ship bay with a 15k general purpose cargo gold for modules and fuel its ship bay capacity would be about 25 million m3 amd would only allow unpacked ships capitals would not be allowed also since this ship would not be as versatile as a normal jf it would have its cost reduced to about 15b  2b the ship would require a new skill capital transport ships which would have the exact same prereqs as the jump frieghter skill and would cost equally as muchunlike a carrier it would not have a ship maintenance bay and would therefore not allow fittings to be changed near it also it would not contain a corp hanger array inside eitherthis ship would enable nomadic use of fleets without an overpowered ability to move entire fleets in one jumpit would also shift the emphasis of carriers to not be used as logistic vehicles and instead the battlecentric ships that they are with that in mind however it would still make carriers necessary for a good logistic team and a viable option for those who cannot fly or afford a capital transport ship it would also still give jfs and frieghters superiority for carrying conventional supplies and packaged shipsoverall i believe this ship will enable logistic pilots the ability to move what is needed in a timely fashion and a lot less fuel
you might consider looking at this threadproposal to move rigged ships in cargo
i like the idea of a specialized ship for transporting assembled smaller ships i do not think it should have a jump drive there are way too many jumping ships already we need the risk of good old fashioned frieghter runs back
noit would be better to allow the transportation of unpackaged ships in a freighterwith or without jump driveunpackaged ships take up alot of space as it iswe dont need a new ship to do that when we have on already
umm last i checked a carrier does the same thing easilyor for highsec orca no reason for changeisaac
im of mixed opinions about rigged ships in cargo holds they shouldnt be packagable but i think a specialized ship that can haul rigged ships makes better senseheres an extension of your idea instead of a freighter with an internal ship bay how about a tugboat it hauls other ships on its exterior dragging them in a line behind it instead of calculating its hauling capacity in volume it has a limit on the number of ships it can haul and the combined mass of ships it can haul the tugs speed and maneuverability change depending on how much mass it is towingthe ships being towed must be vacant so no hauling afk pilots this way vacant ships can be placed in tow in stations only the tug and all the ships it is hauling are each individually visible and targetable in space if the tug is destroyed while hauling other ships the other ships are left intact and adrift by the wreckkralin what do you think
the carrier can acomplish this task yes but not easily for small to medium sized alliances that only have a few carriers at their disposal but a numerous amount of battleships and support ships attempting to relocate can take many jump and hundreds of millions in jump fuel as at most they can only hold 2 battleships at a time
i have read and i swear i posted and supported it anyways i agree with that topic but this is not a duplicate thread i am simply offering an alternativean interesting idea while i like it in theory i can also see it as a vast change to current hauling methods and thus could be confusing also if the ui for this was anything less the awesome i feel it could become quite frustrating in operation
the current disparity between loading times of lasers and other weapon types is far from ideali understand the instant switch of crystals is intended as one of the benefits to the weapons system but it is one of several factors that has lead to a a prevalent feeling that lasers are overpowered in direct comparisons with other weapons systems taking into account cap use on bonusd ships t2 base damage and t2 cystals the phrase scorch crystals online ring any bellsi dont want to nerf lasers but i do want to shave the reloading times down from ten seconds to something better suited to the current environment of buffer tanks in a hypothetical situation where you have two bs doing each aprox 1000dps but one has to spend a 10 second reload time every 15 minutes it is easy to see that there is a huge disparity in damage output over timeat the extreme the damage loss over time from reloading large artillery tiny clip sizes has contributed significantly to the weapon class consistently under performing against other long range weaponsi propose the introduction of a rank 1 mechanics skill call it munitions logistics or whatever the skill reduces reload times for turrets and missiles and alternative launchers such that at lvl 5 it takes 5 seconds to reloadis this an issue of interest
why is this constantly coming up lasers are fine how they are all other weapons are fine i play caldari too its necessary no support no reason to change current mechanics
you cannot compare a 1000 dps emtherm laser setup with a 1000 dps kintherm railgun setup and neither is clearly better than the other unless a lot of secondary effects are factored in reload is not the only variable
bump remove the needless and arbitrary restriction on what ships can carry in the sma and just limit them to their base hold size before skills and expander mods to prevent maxed out industrials being used to haul
yea if you are taking a standing hit for anything you do in 00 it is a bug and should be reported as such

why what was in the video
the thing is he seems to sacrifice so much for the sake of maintaining said neutrality that in the final analysis it is fairly unclear as to what erik finnegan actually purports to represent given i his reticence in posting here his official campaign thread and ii the monstrous heavyhandedness with which his partner ankhesempatankah operates on his behalf i am of the opinion that he might well turn out to have the viability once in office and intracouncil member charisma of a wet paper bag i mean no disrespect i merely use that example as an analogy with no value judgements i might be wide off the mark here and if so  i apologise however given the fact that the poster above has had no answer from her questions despite having to quote herself yet again doesnt bode too well in my mind

it would appear that your entire csm run is based on a newcomer to null sec players gripe with pos warfare and the riskreward from empire00 i would like to know what expertise the ceo of a 34 man corporation that appears to really only have been in one spaceholding alliance for a month can bring to the table that is fresh exciting and is not reminiscent of the previous csms that spent the last year pounding their heads against a wall to get any sort of meaningful change to 00please understand that id love nothing more than to stack the csm with 5 or more representatives from 00 alliances so that we can get some meaningful discussion to come out of the group instead of more empire carebear circlejerking and promises to look into changes at a later date i have concerns that you dont understand 00 well enough yet to formulate an answer to several questions that wasnt a reiteration of an obfuscated point you made earlier or shows any real understanding of sovereignty or space empire management
yes but then all you have are 00pvper circlejerks e though i do agree with your other points
one spaceholding alliance for a month one spaceholding allianceoneever heard of an alliance called stainhell even the original v or freaking smashi hope you realise iceblock as been playing for over 5 years and that the game isnt as old as the dotlan logs showhe has an insane amount of experiences in all fields more than some out of game website shows
i dont understand why i even bother to make an effort when you obviously didnt but i will try to point out to you how wrong you are and hope that you in the future hire people to do the research for younormally to such response as yours i would simply write hi im iceblock i live in and around jita where i mine veldspar and has been since 2003 i too like to carebearto prevent any more misunderstandings ill just proceedhi im iceblock i started playing in 2003 i am what you can call an eve veteran i have been a ceo for over five years i am what you can call a ceo of a five year old corporationwe have been in stain empire which controlled stain npc region fyi so does not really count paragon soul and esoteria you were not yet bornwe have been in veritas immortalis which controlled great wildlands npc region fyi so does not really count and scalding pass you were still not yet bornwe have been in smash alliance which controlled geminate 1 npc system fyi but in this case still counts again you were still not yet bornUFFFDhowever in the last two years you are right we have simple not bothered with pos and sovreignity because its boringthanks for your time
this is my idea for faction warfare to make it more dynamic on basislevel this is all of ideas i have to offer for faction warfare im afraidnote1 station and gate sentry guns should have no effect in faction warfare nor have anything to do with faction standings they are for concord use onlynote2 this is just a draft of what i was thinking maybe not all makes sense etc but it is just an ideaeach faction has one region or constellation of no more than 1015 systems these systems are so called safe systems with 10 security status and are newbeginner system basicly the 1015 systems consists of 10 which can not be taken these systems are sovreignity 4 by default and can not be changedeach faction should have a number of statistics that can be influenced by the players income size strength and systemseach system has a faction sovreignity unsure of timeframe accomplish each levelsovreignity 0 means that the system is contested each of the contesting factions has small to large miltia npc presens around their appropriate gates with the size and strength of the miltia dependent on faction treasurysovreignity 1 means small militia npc presense around the systemsovreignity 2 means medium miltia npc presense around the systemsovreigntiy 3 means large miltia npc presense around the system aswell as enabling faction income from said systemsovreingity 4 means large milita npc presens around the system militia npc commanders those we hear about in the chronicles etc etc and provides standard faction incomethe income of each faction should be from player run agent missions aswell as additional systems ownedconquered by said faction each system has an income modifier depending on their security status the higher security status the higher income 09 giving best incomethe size of each faction should be from the players currently in the militia the size determins an extra income multipler to compensate for the large size difference between the factionseg random thingcaldari  1000  20001000  2amarr  250  2000250  8minmatar  250  2000250  8gallente  500  2000500  4the strength of eact faction is dependent on income size and systems in controlthe income of said faction is used to determind the size and strength of militia npc each militia npc lost drains the faction treasury by x amount so for the players to weaken the other faction one can destroy their npc presense when said faction has 0 treasury npcs are weak and consist mainly of frigate squadronsthe sovreignity of said system is gained by player presense aswell as miniplexes on each planet these miniplexes are just something to show that you are invadingconquering the planet max attainable sovreignity is 3 one can only contest a system which is next to a system said faction already owns this due to faction logistics the miniplexes are complexes on each planet in said system these complexes contains planetery defense and planetary platforms in orbit you are suppose to destroy these to be able to take the planet
ammath for csmvote or diei have been playing this game since beta i have lived in empire and done manufacturing missions and trading i have smashed my way into 00 and carved out a chunk as a pilot in an alliance i have been part of large powerblocks and seen how they work and i have led my own 500 pilot alliance through the struggles of sovereign 00 and npc 00 space i have lived in every compass point in new eden and i have seen which groups of pilots get representation and have their voices heard now is the time for those of us who still struggle on the frontier to build our own empires to have a voicebasic platformi would like to insure that the small and medium sized 00 alliances which are not directly associated with major powerblocks have representation in the csm i strongly feel this group of players needs a strong voice to speak for their needs and their playstyle in the eve universe furthermore i do not feel that individual pilots in 00 space have enough ways of enriching themselves not their corpalliance to keep up with the isk machine that is empire l4 missions trading etcmy detailed platform website

not a single candidate mentioned fw as their primary point of concern there was at best 2 mentions of it at the very bottom of the pile of things they said they want to support most are overly concerned with 00 but not all of us care about 00  fw is pvp its not the pos siege or mass gate camping you can find in 00 its not the same but is still pvp while many mentioned that they are about the pvp not one of those people mentioned fw so that leaves me to believe that all of the csm candidates fail at representing a segment of the eve population i was going to enter the race butno passport and it would be closed before i could get one that leaves me to ask who of you mangy sobs actually participated in fw which one of you will actually help get fw moved in the right direction instead of nowhere anytime soon what we need just off the top of my headreasons to join fw 00 alliances gain systems for their efforts so far we gain nothing but a name to change as to who is controlling the systems in fw there is nothing gained from it im not one of those give me stuffz and ill pvp i have more then enough isk myself so i do not need to rely on any kind of prizes from fw to keep fighting i want the killsnothing more yet there are those that have gone back to carebearing because they felt they got nothing for their efforts how to work that out im not sure but then again im not a csm candidate looking to get votes we also need additional stuff so that fw seems more alive fw should be a mixture of pvp with some pve elements outside of plexes there should be some sort of scoring system where assualting a system and destroying interactable targets is the objective not just speed tanking a button until the plex flips i point you to wwwplanetsidecom the reason is that it is a mmofps game where players gain control of areas and gain some benefits from what they capture such a system should be mixed into fw what we would gain could be similar to benefits gained from leadership skills not just isk or stuff give people a reason to want to participate in the pvp mixed with pve fw is pvp yet it is also pve as players are supposedly a part of a supplementary force for the 4 empires this means fw should have aspects that are not a part of 00 where players are the empires of course some things introduced into fw could end up being part of 00 id like to be able to put up some sort of defenses using anchoring skills something that allows players to fortify systems at their own expense if we have a reason to fight or defend systems other then i guess rp reasons then people will want to spend money on deployable defenses im not talking poses on the gates but player controlled turrets or other things such as deployable repair stations  objects that you might have seen in missions structures that are anchored but not a part of a pos it would give mini objectives for gangs to attack or defend basically there is a lot that fw can introduce things that can also find its way into 00 one way or another so which one of you is actually going to represent the fw players out there also how do we know you will actually represent us
fw  pvplowsecpvp00pvpempire wardecpvp i want that up there to start the reason is that many people look at fw and say thats not real pvp others turn and say its not meant to be permanent pvpits a stepping stone i feel both are extremely wrong also any ccp worker that says anything along those lines needs to reexamine how eve works i thought eve was about pvp of all sorts not just lowsec or 00 not just jita market on certain items not just in certain highsec systems i thought pvp meant it was a long term feature imagine if ccp announced that 00 is not meant to be long term pvp instead you were all supposed to go into wormhole space and finally reach the pvp promised land if fw is meant to be temporary pvp at what point does it shut off what is the planned date and time clearly this limited pvp is not based upon sp as i have far more sp then new players yet there are players in fw that have far more sp then i do it is not based on isk the same is true as the previous line its not based on standings or any other form of measurement of some type of progress at what point is pvp long term and valid and when does it become short term and invalid why is lowsec valid pvp if 00 is better will we have people come out and say that lowsec is in fact invalid short term pvp the same with empire wardecs i know ccp nerfed the system to prevent alliance p from shooting up the damn place but at what point is their pvp completely invalid and meant to be short term i was always under the impression that eve was a sandbox last time i was ever in a sandbox i never had anyone say hey rhino its time to move to the other corner of the sandbox youve been here to long we wont support your sand anymore if fw is meant to be a temporary thing then the idea of the sandbox is destroyed if you scoff at such a thing imagine if they decided that 00 regions were temporary what if it was your pvp that was crapped on fw is valid fw fills the gap in pvp that existed due to the differences in the other forms of pvp available not everyone wants to be in 00 not everyone wants to pirate not everyone is looking to start fights in empire not everyone wants to be in a corp that tells them what to do but at the same time didnt want to be completely alone not everyone wants to pick on targets that didnt want to be shot at within fw you will find a range of players from brand new players who just got the game to people that have done the 00 thing as well as former pirates they all have their own reasons to be in fw and reasons why they are not looking to participate in the other forms of pvp so while people say that only new players are in fw they are wrong those that say fw is dead check the numbers in the end fw is pvp pvp is supposedly what eve is about eve is also supposed to be about choice not being shoved to another area of the sandbox or be berated for your choice of where you play fw is also unique within pvp because we are working on behalf of the npc empires not other players i understand that unique means extra work personally i would expect ccp to be up to the challenge to offer us a really unique experience within each type of pvp style saying one style of pvp is meant to be temporary sounds like an excuse to not do some work aka taking the easy way out i thought that was for mmo clones
actually i did mention continued development and support for old content as my primary concern this includes but isnt limited to fw as for your other questions yes i have and still do participate in fw in an ancillary way on my main and fully on my alt as a director of star fraction and as an active fc and combat pilot within that organisation i have participated on the fringes of fw for almost as long as it has existed whilst not being directly involved in fw on heartstone i have a factional warfare alt in one of the militias who i use to gain a better understanding of the mechanics as a sf pilot i also fly alongside factional warfare pilots quite often and have a good relationship with many of you i think that this relationship is the key to unlocking factional warfare further for youi would like for you to consider voting for me in the upcoming elections for one simple reason that reason is you whilst i absolutely will not be biased towards one militia or another in my deliberations as a csm member should i be voted on my main source of information in regards to the problems and possible advances in fw that could be implements would in all likelihood come from my daily interaction with the militis a few people have already given me their thoughts both from the minmatar militia and from the amarr militia but those are just a few i will be immersed in the issues i am trying to solve for youfactional warfare is one area that ccp announced and then seemingly let stagnate if you chose not to vote for me then fair enough im not the only good candidate out there that deserves votes but any that come my way would be appreciated
i guess i am one of those that has faction warfare on my very bottom of the pile of things however i still have some views and ideas check my csm thread to see
you could list both the raw numbers and seperately the normalized ones what do you think
that could work but the whole point of this is to be strippeddown to normalize 4 numbers from 110 is something players can do themselves i think it adds more clutter than information also ive got a couple more answers  fully half the candidates have gotten back to me now  so im updating the chart
nice but you forgot to add roleplay
ccp seems to like to promote that in eve this ever changing universe is influenced and changed by the players and our actions this is true for oo but unfortunatly from what i see this is not the case for low sec or high sec as an example in faction warfare we have many corperations 1000s of pilots all fighting for their respective factions but in the end if even one faction ever conquers the enemies turf nothing will respectively happenas a csm what will you guys do to try to change this so ccp can stand true to their word that the players do in fact change the course of the game in all situations
tough question and no real good way of answering without hurting your popularity with someoneccp owns the game and has a strategic vision of the game and how it should evolve factored into that is how the game is played by the players but sometimes ccp has to make hard unpopular choices to balance the game or bring it back to their vision to keep it a growing and successful game that we can all play for years to comebasically having all the different playstyles of eve represented powerblocks pirates empire folks smallalliances etc is the most important piece to make sure ccp hears from all groups in how the game is played so they do not get a skewed perceptionammath for csm
as ammath said it is a tough question but not because one might loose some popularity but because of the question of balance and the role of the csm in regards to factional warfare it is one area i am very interested in ccp spending some time and resources in developing along with other projects they have seemed to have released and then let drop by the wayside in favor of more shiny things the lack of material benefits for the capture of a system seems a little bit out of balance with other activities in eve if i was elected though it is important to realise however that as a csm rep i would not become a junior games designer so some such equivalent for ccp but an advocate of the what the players would like to see as such i have my own ideas as to what benefit you could theoretically get from capturing systems personally i would like for it to make logistics harder for the enemy faction by denying or limiting docking rights and associated costs going up in the enemy captured systems but as a csm rep i would putting forward those ideas from the community of players that seem both balanced and appropriate to solve the issues at hand so what would i do for you i would support you i would bring your ideas to the table and see that ccp took note of them heartstone ps nice to see out outside of igs invelious  
they want the game to still be playable for everyone and the fact is faction warfare only represents capsuleer combat the empires still have their respective npc navies that we hear about only in chronicles and storyline events however dont you think that if a gallente fw fleet tried to take jita the caldari would bring the hammer down with great prejudicethere are some of us who are by standings kos in certain empires if 1 or 2 empires suddenly conquered all of eve what would happen to those people who are kosthis kind of system works in games like pirates of the burning sea because a the maps reset once one team has obtained victory and b there are no serious consequences for docking at a hostile port a map reset would completely break the immersion in eve and the removal of personal consequences would eliminate whatever was left of the originality of eve and even in pirates of the burning sea there are some ports that are simply uncapturable specifically national capitals newb towns and market hubsthe fact is when you get down to it and ive said this before in relation to npc interaction we are capsuleers revered immortal elite there are comparatively speaking not very many of us no matter how fabulously wealthy or insanely influential we are we cannot alone define the direction of empires of trillions of people influence yes define no faction warfare is an interesting mechanic that offers gamesupported roleplay pvp but it will never be a mechanism to support fullon conquest
ok so most will agree the current sov rules are out dated cause lag blobs and mean that there is quite a lot of luck involved in pos warfare ie stronting to the right level kiting poss to try and get the end of rf in your alliances prime etc etc etctherefore how about this as a proposal for candidates to mull over have a game mechanic based upon the fps domination game system where you have points in the system you have to capture but once to have captured them through whatever the decided mechanic is the sov begins to turn to you once you have sov at level 1 then small gate guns are onlined automatically in your favour and small poss can be placed sov 2 medium gate guns plus medium poss can be placed sov 3 large gate guns plus ewar and large towers can be placed plus the cyno jammers etcetc i this way you need to conquer a system in order to benefit from it you cant just kill an enemy r64 and place your own in their territory however when you have conquered it you get greater benefit than now it also mean to conquer a system you need to get past the border posts but also if you have a system that an enemy can block off you need to defend to sov 3 to get the ability to jf past the blockadeconstructive comments please
my opinion on these types of fixes to sov has always been if you want to play factional warfare go play itand i dont see how this will cut down on lag blobs since it still behooves you to stack the system so you can defend the control point more easily
i think sov needs fixing from what i hear anyway havent experienced much of it myself however i dont think this is the way to do it sorry
to be honest pos and sovreignity should be split
the reality is moving to another model will be difficult without disrupting artificially what tens of thousands of pilots and years have built nothing should be done lightly or with a broad brushi am of the camp that the sovmodel needs to be fixed with a scalpel not a battleaxei do however think our current pos model lends itself far more to manufacturing and storage facilities than as the focus point for 00 warfare something needs to be done but we have to be careful how it is handled fwoccupancy rules could theoretically be blended with the sov model after all its that way in lowsec and should be on the table but not as an outright replacement ammath for csm
there are a lot of independent nonpowerblock voters in eve really if you want your voices heard and your votes to count you should vote for the people with the best chance of actually supporting your enjoyment of the gamesilly and idealistic i know but thats how i rollammath for csm
my answer is no but i would like to know how you would propose to make contract scamming impossible
not much needs to be said everything have been said already
i support the 4th bonus
youre absolutely not wrong about the omen  my shield omen hits harder aligns faster and has more ehp than my buffered retri coming from fw though there is a key point about them and similar afs that makes me nervous about having another bonusagainst cruisers and higher  the other day part of my fleet that i was with caught a rupture at a gate the pilot either realised that his chances of escape were slim or thought to make a fight of it but either way turned his attention to my little retribution  which sat there and laughed as his guns nibbled fitfully at my buffer had i been in my omen id have been a mite more concerned battleships are the same storyagainst frigs and destroyers  this is the main bonus in my view  good dps and more than twice the scan res of the omen means that frigs and even inties melt almost as soon as a few of these appear on the field when warping a fleet into battle i often give the order for weapons free on small ships before we consolidate on a primary a because seeing 45 enemy ship simultaneously detonate 5 seconds after youve loaded grid is very very cool and b nothing demoralises a fleet like having a quarter of their number in pods before their fc has finished saying what the primary target isretributions work especially well in this kind of role because of the advantages of scorch ammo and if they are hit first they last a lot longer than say a thrasher in the same rolein smallmedium gang knife fights like this then when paired with interceptors assault frigs of all flavours except maybe the caldari ones really shine and im concerned that any bonus you could add would make them a little blinding consider the options for boostingehprepdpsspeedsig radspeed first yes there is a case for making abs more effective on afs but either the boost is insubstantial or were in the realms of reaching the speed of an ab inty and we justify thatsig rad afs are already a bugger to hit for solo targets im not sure we can argue that onedps yes i know  the vengence still lets wait for the rockets boost for that one the others though all do good solid and in some cases insane dps i dont think we have a case for making them even more potent in this departmentrep my instinct is that the vengence is probably as good as we want to go on this making the other tackle afs match that is probably the best we can do and that can best be done by tweaking existing bonuses rather than adding new onesehp most af can already almost field the ehp of a light cruiser with the aforementioned buggerness to hit i dont think we can justify any morethere framework for discussion laid out
excellent post foolish bob ive seen you flying around in your vengeance btw ill say hello next timeok so you have perfectly valid concers and i think to be honest the only way to address them is on a case by case basis please forgive the eft warrioring here first of all im basing this on the idea that assault shipsfrigates should be to cruisers as heavy assault shipshacs are to battlecruisers smaller and faster but with similar dps and tank in exchange for a lot more isk given the popularity of hacs in guerilla warfare style attacks this is definitly worth the isk however when people want to do the same thing in frigate hulls it seems taranises and stealth bombers are the way to go for further reading join the channel garmonism  note ive used fits from shcbattleclinic to try and keep all examples used reasonablewith that established im going to compare assault frigs as the are now to cruisers and do the same with hacs and battlecruisers i want to look at the harpy first as already stated i believe it should get the 5 resists per level in common with every other caldari railboat this would give it the same 4 bonus as the eagleharpy blaster damage control iimagnetic field stabilizer ii1mn afterburner iifaint epsilon warp scrambler ipatterned stasis web imedium fs9 regolith shield inductionlight ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge slight ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge slight ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge slight ion blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge sempty high slotantiem screen reinforcer iantiem screen reinforcer iusing all level 5 we get 210 dps just under 10k ehp and a cost of 47 mil isk according to eftmoa blasterdamage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer ii10mn microwarpdrive ij5b phased prototype warp scrambler ilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mmedium nosferatu iiempty rig slotempty rig slotempty rig slothobgoblin ii x3this gives 410 dps 25k ehp and a cost of around 24 mil isk after insuranceso for twice the price youre getting 51 of the dps and 39 of the ehp this seems ok but now lets look at the eagle and feroxeagle blasterdamage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivej5b phased prototype warp scrambler ilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mheavy electron blaster ii caldari navy antimatter charge mmedium nosferatu iiantiem screen reinforcer iantiem screen reinforcer i438 dps and 58k ehp for a cool 143 mil iskill continue in another post with the ferox

give them their 4th bonus
i dont accept your comparison hacs and bcs are both anticruiser platforms with an option to providing dps on other targets a cruiser is not an antifrig platform  thats the role of destroyers inties and af and ofc frigs so whereas hacs and bcs operating in a similar battlespace if we can coin that term should be equivalent i would argue that theres no such requirement for afs wrt cruisersin those terms then i think that any boost has to be made on its own merit for the role an af has  which is not to say that 5 resists on the caldari af wouldnt go amiss  indeed anything that makes them more worthwhile would be welcome but we cant use cruisers as justification imo
i fully understand what youre saying it is very hard to discuss balance for afs when there is nothing to really compare them against in my mind the question is this i have 100 mil isk to spend should i spend it on 2 afs or 4 cruisers take the example of a well setup and flown rupture you could take on any other cruiser frigate or af and kill it on the other hand when youre flying an af you first of all can forget about taking on a decent drone boat then anytime you engage something youre rolling the dice if they start dropping ecm drones or hit you with a neut or two thats it game overi accept this no ship should be unbeatable in every circumstance far from it but the range of situations where an af can be used without getting laughed at and blown to pieces is quite limited because of this i want them to shine in their niche role vagabond deimos these ships are absolutely awesome at what they do are they overpowered no theyre t2 ships thats how they should be why are afs not theyre ok at their job butwhen you pay 40 mil isk for a frigate hull ok isnt really enough
i would like to see this happen along with more wallet divisions basically just more tools to separate and organize your stuff
bumping an important threadalso anyone have links to previous proposals where this was brought up itd be interesting to see how many people want this
absolutely
this would be very very nice
signed
i would like to see this happen
so im wondering which csm candidates from the current election pool supports a fast resolution along the lines described in this thread 
agreed
if you have discovered a means of getting corpalliance members to agree that nothing in the entire world of eve is more interesting than watching miners work while guarding them from pirates and belt rats please share that methodhiring guards costs isk ill mine in lowsec only when i can be certain that ill make more isk than in high sec after paying the guards and accounting for ship clone implant and cargo losses
signed this would make mining alot more interested when combined with other things
humm i dunno if this is exactly the best idea but i do know that mining needs a revampi was thinking that adding a new type of asteroid just like veldspar only higher yield to 00 might help with the trit imbalance its kind of annoying to be sitting in 00 and the most valuable ore you have to mine is veldspar no jokeim thinking something along the lines of a 200 or 300 boost to the amount of trit per m3 as compared to veld while right now that much trit would be worth almost as much as the abc asteroids it would go down very fast and balance out to likely around the ghhj level which is where it should be for a low end 00 asteroidill support the idea anyway mainly because mining needs a revamp rather then because i think this is the best idea
i would mine
i agree and support though dont see why this has to be limited to orbit keepatrange could use some options also
totally support
i would love to be able to sort by meta level i use the icon view rather then the list view but even if its just available in the list view that would still be great

nopeto easy to move about new eden it isnot supportedand yes ive heard every excuse reason idea argumentsearch the boards youll see it24 hours is the focal point of balancethe only way ill support it is if the skill causes an increase in the slight chance of losing sp due to frequent jumping
we have too many threads on this please quit posting about italso no support bad enough we have jump drive and jump clones moving around eve right now is too fast and too easy we dont need to encourage more of it give me an actual reason why we should enhance itisaac
jump clones should be nerfed not enhanced id actually prefer they were removed but thats just not going to happen
ive gotta vote no on this one too being able to move across the entire eve universe once per day is really enough i like the jumpclone concept mostly because i like to be able to go to unsafe space without carrying a full rack of 5 implants along for the ride but i dont like the quicktravel options it gives though new eden is supposed to be a big placeid support this skill only if it came along with a 4 jump clone limit secondary effect but i dont know if eve can handle 2 effects on a skill you could then choose between being able to jump between only 2 locations quickly or several locations once per dayedit added paragraph to split up the small wall o text
most of the inconsistencies in eves background come from the material t0nyg has written himself and it would be a very sad day for the people who actually care about the immersion of eve it if he started changing the material that predated his work to match his visionif retconning is to be done then the changes should be made only to the material he has written so that its more in line with the preexisting material
agreed though im sure there is more to the project than t0ny making his word lawat least i hope so
nothing to add to that post
how can this be an issue before an actual dev blog listening exactly what they are changing has been releasedno support please be patient and wait for the changes to come isaac
yeah i mean its not like tony g introduced inconsistencies are the only onesfor example i wouldnt mind them fixing inconsistencies such as when did the caldari meet the jove or how the hell could karsoth be both chamberlain to doriam and heideran just to name the two at the top of my head
maybe they just kept him on as he seems to have been such an obviously likable and effective guyhaving for some perverse possibly latently masochistic reason read through the book i dont see the need to wait for some damage to be done before firing a warning shot
i know after having read the novel imho tony g is the uwe boll of authorshopefully abraxas has some influence over the retcontrain i like abraxas and his style
you are correct there were conflicts in pf before t0nyg  but finally hammering out those isnt the issue the issue is that t0nyg who has proven he cant be trusted with pf has announced he going to be doing some retconning the only retconning that he should be doing is on his own material the only people trust worthy enough to touch anything written before 2006 are abraxas and ginger waiting for the changes is just silly because once ccp make a decision they stick by it and their people even if it was a bad one
the concern is that the retcon will make changes to material that should have been used to write later material example the scorpion according to ingame materialpresumably from when the game was released is very new newer than the ravenin ruthless written by tonyg the raven is brand new and the scorpion an established shipworkhorse of the caldari navythe issue is a concern that instead of correcting more recent material that should have drawn on the previous material to begin with the older material will be changed to make what more recent authors have written the correct versionsmaking ccp aware of the concern before they make exactly what they are changing knownasking hey why did you not change ruthless instead of the ingame description concerning the scorpion after they have already done so is going to result in ccp going we made everything consistent be happy we dont care if we changed the older sourcewe dont want ccp to do what lucasarts did
everything has been said already
fully supported please let ginger be the lead on this one
youre right the op didnt say anything about tech 2 battleshipsbut her second post suggested that she originally intended the idea to be a tech 2 bsits okay to want something and create a proposal for it but as ive already said you have to think carefully about what the other races will get in returnif the op was suggesting it to be a faction ship they wanted then there would also need to be a khanid cruiser and frigthough im sure somebody already said that beforeif you look at the faction shiptypes currently they all have mixed race bonuseswell there are 3 gallente and 3 minmatar but only 2 for amarr and caldari so why not make the khanid faction shiptypes have bonuses to caldari and amarr then perhaps make them proficient in missiles and drones as thats the only hole that remainsagain though ccp will have to balance this right and make sure it fits in with the storyline
even if it was just a repainted apoc with torps instead of lasers id still like this idea doesnt need any fancy t2  faction bonuseses
id love to see a khanid bs i think it was mentioned as a possibility when the khanid ships were all overhauled but no word since then i cant decide which would look cooler a khanid apoc or a khanid abaddon
we already have two t2 battleships and both have the pve role and the pvp role down a 2nd type of marauder would serve no purpose especially if it were pvp orientedtoo expensive rather have a cap etci think that with the need of improvement with factional warfare six new faction ships could be introduced all with a new look preferably they would only be purchasable with fw meritsor whatever they have over therei propose 6 codesigned ships purchasable from a fw store2 frigates a minmatargallente hybrid and a caldariamarr hybrid2 cruisers a minmatargallente hybrid and a caldariamarr hybrid2 battleships a minmatargallente hybrid and a caldariamarr hybridthis would not only give a point to factional warfare but also give new shiny hybrid ships you want an armor tanked missile bs you got it and all sorts of other wacky crazy hybrid stuff
they should just turn the redeemer into a khanid ship black ops where a caldari invention the other races just copied the ideawouldnt it make sense that the khanid translate this caldari tech into an amarr hull 
this is my wet dream
the ui is falling to peaces many controls and displays are inconsistent many features just dont work focus fire drones for example many core functions could use overhauling and new bugs smell of horribly inter meshed spaghetti codeso i would propose forgoing new content and instead focusing on rewriting the current code base so that tweaking thing a doesnt always break things c and dsome examples of the problems currently are the pos code all in a single class when it could be easily modularized per pos module see the dev blog about the pos exploit the cargoholdcontainerhangar code is said to be too fragile to differentiate bpcs form bpos some containers seem to use different mechanics for addingremoving stuff than others atleast the orca cargohold was bugged but no other ships were affected the same a container class should use the same methods to do the same things in all cases etci for one dont see the value of adding a bucketload of new features when we need to wait months afterwards for all the things they broke to get fixed ifaik some outposts still have their manufacturing slots messed up from apocrypha 10
the bpcbpo issue is due to the database setup and double the database lookups required to view containers in eve its not a ui issue ccp has for good reason determined that database changes are not a good thing and they are trying to avoid them at any cost because a database structure change could very easily break pretty much everything in eve or cause incredible performance losses until they rewrite every bit of it to use the new databaseon the rest of your suggestion i like bug fixes polishing some of the old stuff like scanning before trying to put new shiny things out there would be great the downside is that mmos operate like a treadmill if new stuff stops coming up players start to outrun the game and eventually take off for greener pastures so a certain amount of new shiny stuff is required now and then
well some new content would be required i agree to that but i rather have less new content that works than more halfthought halfworking new content and old features brokena rewrite of the core functionality would almost certainly lead to more maintainable codebase and thus make it easier to add new features in the future without breaking everything also with cleanly modularized code ccp could add unit tests for the core functionality to catch the worst bugs and exploits before the code hits the live serversbeing a master of tech student with cs minor i can tell that rewrites almost always lead to better faster and less buggy code but the rewrite takes time and marketing droids are scared of devoting developer time into something that doesnt add anything new now just makes adding the new stuff in the future way easier and kills a ton of bugs in the processalso a quick fix to the bpobpc issue would be to just make bpos be a different item type in the db so you dont need to do a join to get the is this orginal bit from the db just the same kind of query as with other displayed item types implementing this shouldnt be to hard and migrating the existing db to the new item ids shouldnt be rocket science no schema changes needed just new item ids now item id x  bp of item y item has in its db entry field if its orginal or not new  item x  bpc of item y item z  bpo of item y you can even keep the legacy is this orginal field in the db just change the icon of item type z
rendering of pages is very slow this is true not only with the integrated browser interface but also with the character logon screen news column and with agent interactions perhaps theres a way to test what the real problem is it could be the browser the users isp throttling content based on type or address or even ccp doing the same who knows whatever the case you have a good point gduran
such a great idea implemented sooo bad
i support this motion s
supported
i support this
i def agree with this
i support this
i support this sorting through drones can be such a hassle
i actually hate trolling and some other people do too especially around this environment which has got extreme high caldari kiddie trollsas you might know the internet meaning of french often was meant as coward wine  cheese people french bread etc and of course in our universum gallente the main problem with the gallente history lore is that it might actually demotivate new people from joining the gallente because of the french thing it also results during the game that people are being trolled and especially at fw for obvious reasons read easily surrendering dontcarebears and vastly outnumbered by adhd consuming caldaristate kiddiesi advise for the future that the french nationality must be changed to something else less frenchishi am joe and i was this late night very drunk sorry if i messed some things upplus a doesntworkonyourself support thumbup rightjoe
dont know if troll
this is talking what comes out a cally mouth is called trolling in a normal mans perspective although i combined my statement with alcohol
ebay entry  french whine for saleopened onceseriously what is this about
heh its good to hear ccp is thinking about this i would love to see something like this reconnecting to lost drones would be great doesnt matter if its because eve crashed your little sister hit the power button on your computer or because you cloaked your ship without calling in the drones first any and all ways of disconnecting to drones you should be able to connect back to them
would be handy after a reconnectextreme lagin every other situation i have no problem to pay for my carelessnessunawareness its eve after all
damn agreeing with neb here 1
i have a proposal read your contracts before accepting no amount of special colors will make a damn difference if you dont read it
as its been stated before the csms do not represent the general playerbase they only represent their own personal issues those that either directly or indirectly benefit their corp or alliance mates or whatever fotm issue everyone is complaining about just to get the votesonce elected they become nothing more than parrots sitting on ccps shoulder repeating everything they sayif the general playerbase has an issue they want addressed they must completely bypass the csms
im not sure what is busted about mining i dont know how big of a change normal wardecs could possibly need i know ive mentioned things that wont get implemented though they would resolve the problem of people attempting to evade wardecs does ccp have a full workload i should hope so and im sure they are doing their best with what they have however that in no way means i should be patient and just sit back and not say anything about itthe way i saw the csm was that these were democratically elected representatives of the playerbase just like in rl sometimes certain things are given a higher priority then things that would better suit the whole people vote for those that will represent them and help get what they want changed changed so while i completely understand your answer i will have to say that i completely disagree with the idea of sitting back and saying nothing i make it a habit of voting in rl and try to rally other people that i know to vote not in favor of what i am voting for but just to go out and vote and get heard instead of shrugging and doing nothing so my statement stands that the csm candidates do not represent me and all of the other fw players out there if i see no one that represents my interest then my vote will stay with me this isnt a case of well my guy isisnt going to win so why waste time voting instead it is that no one is representing a single thing that i am interested in sure some say they stand for pvp but then they go and say 00  to me that means they represent 00 pvp and maybe the changes they push for will trickle down to the rest of us as for the idea that all csm members end up being parrots i dont know its entirely possible that they are nothing more then puppets in a false democratic system designed to represent the playerbase so until i see a profw candidate that has ideas of his own and a will to get fw pushed forward on the list of things ccp wants to do i have no candidate while fw may not have as many players as 00 it does not mean we should go without a voice saying such is equal to suggesting that minority groups in the us should wait until the government has finished working on all of the stuff the majority wants done until then sit there and stay silent we may or may not be the minority of the pvp crowd of eve but we still deserve a voice to be represented on equal footing with the 00 crowd until i see anyone step up and make actual commitments i see the candidates as being a vanilla group of mass produced clones that have nothing more then an avatar to distinguish them from the others
cyprus black does not represent the general playerbase
you are correct i do not represent the general playerbase but then again i never said i did
your tone says otherwisethe csm can speak for themselves
someone correct me if im wrong but i could have sworn this feature was in the game years ago and vanished after a patch or expansion a long time agolike around castorexodus either way lets have it
1 this should have been implemented years ago
should behave exactly like refining imho select multiple items  repair to hangar and repair etcit would be neat if you only get the option to repair something on damaged items  if it doesnt increase database load by a measurable amount ofc
the easiest and simplest fix would be to move sov from moons to planets its not that pos warfare is horrible its that theres so ing much of it required
or do like ccp is planning to do
echoing sentiment of fellow pilots in that the idea seems too rough i really do agree however with a marketesque contract system or at least some massive overhaul to the functionality of the current oneas for the elimination of the autolinking of contracts in local i think that might be a bit too brash while i hate the spam sometimes you actually do hit a gem of a contract that someone throws out in local that isnt 999999999 iskthen again with a vastly improve contract system you might be able to find those gems much more easily and without necessitating someone posting it in localhowever im not sure which side of the fence i am on with that issue specifically to be honest i like the fact that people can advertise their contract much more directly by autolinking it i dont like spami think we need to harvest more ideas on removing spam but im not sure if the removal of autolinking contracts is the way to go now maybe we could have a color change for contracts that exceed a certain marketcontract average possibly have the contract average based upon jitaso if you autolink a contract in local and it exceeds the average the autolink color will be red and if it falls under the average it will be greeneven this idea will not eliminate spamming though all that would really do is make scamming just a bit harder and i dont really see a need for thattough calls but lets see what some other people come up with
i support the revamp of the contract systemi dont want to derail but didnt ccp wanted to introduce the storefront a new corpbased contracting station service around qr what if they roll the two ideas together
the contract search should be improved 1 i do not like this linking contracts is very neat esp in corpalliance chat and somewhat local2 simply no market and contracts are totally different things
i support this topic i think it will be a very good step towards making battleships the winsauce they deserve to be
thanks for the clarification although an idea like that has some merit dont we have enough smartbombs as it is an intriguing idea but one that i feel that is not needed atm isaac
using a firing solution would better than just picking a direction because of the massive ammount of vectors of approach available in 3d space using a firing solution will also cause you to never bring all your guns to bear on the target so it wouldnt be too overpoweredmaybe someone far better than me at math can tell us how many different directions there could be just using degrees mils would be a bloody nightmare
explosion velocity 1275for a weapon thats designed to be used against frigates thats far too low
so why dont you just move your battleships with pilots and in fleets i still fail to see why we should make it easier and safer to move logistical stuff if you dont have the technology then fleet up and move it down altogether our corp has worked just fine with this method im pretty sure your alliance can do the sameisaac
i like the idea  youve given it some thought but i dont think there is a need for the change if im honest speaking as a minmatar piloton the battlefield these days ive noticed there is a rather even number off each race atleast in terms of battleships compared to how things used to be admittedly i think theres a fair few more gallente ships than others but not a huge amount and as thats the case i think any change in reload times would just incur a further increase for those races whilst amarr pilots slip back in the pecking orderccp have the game relatively wellbalanced at the moment id say missiles definately need some love though but that discussion is for another timehowever i think its worth discussing the topic i think the skill would have to be rank 3 or 4 though so it would take some effort to reduce your reload time
here is why i dont support any changes to missilesyes i realize its one weapon system that you talked aboutyou are immune to most ewar effects only fear is jamming you have no optimal range just a rangecan shoot at weakest resists so guess what lasersaffected by all ewar effects have to constantly change crystals to stay in optimalonly have emtherm as their damage optionsso there is why reloading is there you would be too overpowered otherwiseisaac
i know heartstone and really think highly of his opinions so know how ill be voting
thanks for you comment james in regards to docking mechanincs i am sure that there is no pvp player out there who hasnt at one time or another been frustrated with the ability to play docking games at the same time i am also sure there isnt a pvper out there who hasnt saved his own bacon by using th mechanic i personally feel from a rp perspective and a dark gritty universe perspective that it should be made harder to redock once you have committed to undocking at the same time though there needs to be some way to establish if you should undock or not people joke about having portholes in stations to look out of but it isnt far from the truth why these giant behemoths of stations cant tell you what is outside them is beyond me it is possible that a prelaunch scanner could be introduced a very short range scanner say 20km circle around the undock port with a skill attached to increase the range or maybe the answer is to have undocking and docking ports being separate cones on the station with the same scanning mechanics brought into play i would certainly like to see something done about the whole docking games side of eve pvp
i have updated my ops to give you another view onto my agenda issues which i want to push as they are my personal interest
a heavily biased opinion usually comes from a heavily biased person these people dont get far with most people and the people they do get somewhere with are usually of easily swayed caliberi myself am very often biased in my opinion and i feel that leaving my personal feelings aside it becomes much easier to negotiate with people and thats what the csm do they negotiate on behalf of the players a biased opinion has no place in such negotiations that just proved that you are trying to negotiate for yourselfccp isnt usually swayed easily they only take biased opinions in to account if there is substantial evidince to back it up or if there is enough support for whats being proposed some of the things i would like the csm to bring forward is mainly supported by the not so loud majority of eve people who cant be bothered logging on to the forums because theyre sick of reading the loud minoritys repetitive poststhus i believe erik is a good candidate to represent my needs
much better could you elaborate more on lowsec incentivizing and particularly on the balance of risk vs reward between highsec and lowsec specifically not taking into account 00
i read your interview you did with hallan turrek with some interest erik it is nice to find out there is another candidate who is strongly into rp in eve what is your take on the instances of pf contradiction specifically such inconsistencies as the wetgrave contradiction
i just appreciate your stance fixing the current system before new features are addedso all of my new ideas those are really just fixes to the existing system
as a long time pirate myself id like to offer my support to any pirate who can provide input and the alternative viewpoint to ccpfirstly what are your thoughts on the unsettling trend that allows care bears to warp cloaked in transportswhats next a cloakwarping freighter it has become very difficult for those of us trapped in low sec to get great loot from any player with half a brain as just about anyone can more or less enter a low sec system with impunitysecondly i object to the fact that low sec status players cannot even enter high sec in a ship real criminals walk the streets in rl every day we should be afforded the same treatment but if we do something silly concord should be able to have a 6080 roll the dice shot at catching and killing usmuch like real life it certainly would make the game more interesting for pirates and certainly help eliminate the macro using miners and afk players who get richer by the day lets keep the care bears on their toes i saylastly rather than nerfing falcons i like the idea about an antijamming skill to train it would also be nice to add an additional rig slot to every ship hat can only fit an antijamming rig of some sort that may even the playing field for those who will dedicate time to training and who are not afraid to spend the extra iskies without nerfing the falcon
fw is one of the main points of eriks campaignalso there has been an other thread about this which provides some additional answers of some of the candidates
you can also find a more recent thread here which is ostensibly about fw
i have begun work on the interviews they are being posted daily on my blogi actually believe ive gotten about three quarters of the candidates and more are coming in every daygo read
sniff boohoo you need to ask
wasnt so much forgetting as not knowing what to ask i cant ask how familiar people are with it because its an attitude not a skill set i cant ask how much people like it because so far as i can tell most people have about the same feelings on the topic  it should be better but it shouldnt interfere too much with normal gameplay theres no real contentious issues like there is with local and t1 loot and theres no general consensus of it being terrible like there is with sovereignty and lowsec its a broader field than i would really like to leave untouched in this kind of survey but there was no real question i could think of to ask about it also given that better than half the candidates have answered its a bit late to change the questions now
the easiest and simplest fix would be to move sov from moons to planets its not that pos warfare is horrible its that theres so ing much of it required
or do like ccp is planning to do
 the fact shes a girlalthough this being her selling point is debatable from what ive seen
i used to have a job porting a menu driven pc game to playstation i  ii its a harder thing to implemement than you think  each and every menu will have to be messed with to get it right involving surprising man hourshowever  it needs doing i have perfect vision i have also just bought a 40 lcd tv im also a returning eve player whos been away for three years i have to run the game in 1368x768 to be able to play it without straining my eyes lots which sucks add in the antialiasing issue and its a real ball ache that you pay for monthly in this day and age there are going to be a lot more folk with big screens requiring high rezzes like me appearing every day i know its not as simple a thing to do as it sounds but please ccp you are going to have to do it sooner or later and youd make a lot of people happy by doing it sooner
font dont matter as much new font size would be vary welcomei love my eyes ccp why dont you
there used to be an unofficial fix for this i was using 14 point verdana for the main ui font no major issues with screen layout or the restthere is no valid reason for keeping your players from being able to read the screen easily
agreed big monitors are getting more common and the font problems dont help
signed
larger sized font yes please maybe its time for a new more legible one as well in descriptions and such the current body font can easily become a wall of greyish things the content does not exactly jump at you in the way the text of a book might or might notalso since eve is larger menu driven its not always the easiest thing to quickly find the option you want with the current fontas for choosing our own font this could be a very bad idea as long as the interface is not resolution independent you might break the interface its all a bit tight already typefaces differ in a plethora of ways besides the pure aesthetic differences in the letter forms base line differences letter spacing etc all that matters maybe if ccp prepared two or three fonts that we could choose between but that should be the limit of choice in this respectbut larger font sizes yes please preferably a somewhat more legible one subjective of coursetbh i kind of miss the serif font showing your current location in the topleft corner of the main screen but thats a more stylistic preference
yes please
please please please please please ps please
yes
signed
at least allow the increase of font in mail boxes like its done in chat channels
yes please larger fonts would be nice being able to tell if the 00 system is 5i or s1 would also be nice d
yes we definetly need bigger fonts even with my glasses on i have trouble reading the 12 point font all my chat channels i always increase the font size trying to trade is very painfull seeing those small digits
as above  get off the second page grrrr
yes
if you compare an af to a cruiser ask yourself which ships can i engage youll be disappointedwith afs the question is more which ships will the af allow me to avoidin eve both questions are important
well weve arrived at the reason i fly afs almost exclusively i have to confess to being an outlaw and i fly along heavily contested fw pipes in my jag i can laugh at the blob camps although flying my 400 plate wolf is exciting at times but on the subject of avoiding fights afs work best with ab and scram in lowsec if things start to go wrong when fighting for example a mwd  disruptor fitted cruiser chances are you are not going to escape the things are so fragile there are so many circumstances in which you will get obliterated by something that costs a fraction of the price because of this i want them to be amazing when used in the right situation a 4th bonus will give them a nice little boost without suddenly changing the roles they are able to perform
this is already ingame  mark all your containers rights click open container will bring them all uptip merge them into one big window with as many tabs as you like you only need to do this oncetip2 double click on the window title bar to see only the tabs esp useful for sorting your lootps you can buy station containers at every station just keep in mind that they cant leave the station 
oh i know i have voted on this very subject before
ive been thinking the same thing for quite a while  a method of banking your isk this seems like a simple and easy method to implement nice idea
supercaps need a rework i support this
still think they should either totally remove super caps cant be done or remake them totally let them be giant moving poss meaning that they are a large pos that can be set up in 1hour and packed after 24hours in 1 hour moms could be the support type pos and titans could be the gun type
bss dont have the abillity to lay their full dmg down upon cruisers or frigsmoms have the abillity to lay the full dmg down upon any ship sizesooooo nobeside the extra dpstank is not nearly as effective as it looks because of the size difference5 frigates well fitted can take out a bs a ship costing 100200x more then those frigates5bss will be killed slowly and painfully by 1 mom a ship costing ow wait 100x more the cost of those 5 bss hmm so where is the difference againbesides the mom being overpowered compared to the normal costeffectiveness formula for t1 ships which it still is
crest you are in no way comparing apples to apples ship scales when 5 smalls can kill one big is so heavily dependent on factors outside of the norm that its just silly yes it happens all the time but youre not equating pilot skills ship fits etcsuper caps are typically static fits because they are all geared towards single functionswei am not asking for a huge gank and tank platform were asking for a rework of a borked platform that would make more sense by your logic our platforms are actually better because they benefit smaller ships more titans should not be one ship fleet killers it removes fun for the other 200 people out there in fleets every time doomsdays go off and while the titan pilot has fun counting kills everyone else gets y that they didnt get a fightmoms are problematic because cost v reward ratio is so skewed out of its favor that most people just revert to carriers most of their problem is derived from focus fire from dreads and the inability to tank in any substantial matter in a cap fight both are issues that need looked at
supported been annoying me from the moment i flew my first ship
i would also ask for the same thing for keep at and warp to ranges
this is indeed needed
good idea
lol
laz0r crew checking in and chuckling at the very idea of reloading and again at having to reactivate after reloadbtw also would also be appreciated if someone could fix autorepeat in fleet battles so that at the very least we can all continue to fire between reloads
o awesome idea
yes this will greatly assist afk missionfarming
no it wont as one would still need to target new rats what it would greatly assist with though is the boring stupid grind that is ccps sovholding mechanicin short youre a moron
fofs dearest goonie
this topic has my support
thumbs up for whatever its worth
next saturday ill hear moredont worry i wont drop this issue and neither will erik if he gets elected
anyone who thinks this would lead to large spaceholding alliances dominating fw is kidding themselves spaceholding alliances have enough to do feeding the machinery and killing kennybut obv fw will never be a stepping stone to the main game in 00 if new alliances cant move between the two
one of the principal ways to recognise the weaponsmodules being used offensively against you is sight far too often this visual recognition element is removed due the the need to reduce lag would it be possible to extend the range of graphics effects options allowing players to better balance system performance with graphical immersion in the game the current graphics options areturret effectseffectsmissile effectscamera shakeship explosionsdrone modelsi propose that the following additionschanges be madeturret effectsdoomsday devices be added to the turret effects option turret effects are perhaps more likely to be used than module effects during a fleet fight the more likely place a titan will dd players can then enjoy the glory of a dd more often and also judge more accurately when it has been firedmissile effectssplit missiles in flight engine effects from explosions this will allow players to see missiles in flight without the heavier graphical load of explosion effects on impact players with a higher performance machine can ofc enable botheffectssplit the effects from modules into two groups local modules ie sensor boosters armor hardeners and offensive modules ie nos target painters this would allow players to view effects for offensive modules and better respond to their affects based on a quick visual recognition while at the same time remove the heavy work of rendering 30 or 40 sensor boosterhardener effects in a fleethopefully these changes would provide better visual stimuli for a combat pilot to respond to increase the ability to manage graphics lag and generally improve the immersion and playing experiencezos

post needed additional bumpage
absurd and insulting anyone should be able to speak their mind on a game they pay to playjust becuase you dont like how much or what people are saying dosent give you or anyone the right to shut them up people have built tools to block goons or any alliance of your choosing  if you dont want to read it you dont have too
one of the proposals was to delete the forumhow is this a solutionyou dont like what happens in the forum so youd rather see it gone even though hundreds of people probably enjoy frequenting it this is a game after all were all here to have fun
as a counter proposal how about we give people the option to choose not to open their browser navigate to the eveo forums open caod and spend their time reading itim not a technical expert how difficult would this be to implement
people use that forum
it may be some thing in your ideaadvanced infomorph psychology rank 8 look betteryou have my support for this
personally i just think we should be able to take out the implant but they can only be used by us this would remove the annoying element of jumping just to switch implants would have no problem with this if the first was applied so i can switch through the different sets of implants as i liked 
also here is another reason whyits ccps background if they decide t0nyg is the guy to do it then that is that we will not be able to change that fact it is a corporate decision and csm has very little influence in this area isaac
you may be right but if we dont voice our opinions now we have no right to complain after the fact if things dont go the way wed like
first off i did not think the book was too bad ducks but in regards to whom id like to be the gardener of prime fiction i have to say i trust ginger and abraxas more

i suspect a big part of this is the changes necessary to support devs wasting time on the vampiresinstations betaso support not doing that obv
the csm can make it known there is a concern your argument could be made concerning every part of the game and thus invalidates the very existence of the csmthere is one thing we can do should we be dissatisfied with changes made  leave whether many will do it or not i do not know and it would of course depend on the changes made
to quote a famous space opera line i have a baaaaad feeling about thissome canon inconsistencies are to be expected as not everything can be perfectly checked however between the empyrean age novel and theodicy tonyg has shown me that he is intent on rewriting the story of eve to fit his own storyi commented on the dev blog comments about this to so ill be succinct this could either be a fix all the errors actual inconsistencies retcon spree or this could be a stealth edit older items to fit my view retcon spreefor the love of all that is holy i hope its the first kind
inconsistencies should be reconciled by giving preference to the aspects of the storyline that the players have embraced and relied uponafter all why should we incorporate any of the story into our gameplay if its just going to be dumped later to accommodate one persons  lets face it  less than popular idea of what the eve universe should be
this looks alright but ccp should give chance to wardec corpalliance to bribe back concord and leave war with bribethe amount of bribe that need to be pay like that must be much bigger from amount it was paid for starting war
i disagree with your idea the point of war is never winning or losing you could lose every engagement you enter and still meet preset objectives such as being bait or simply distracting people away from an objectivethat being said the objective of war isnt to simply inflict damage  the point is to violence inconvenience and otherwise frustrate your opponent or to achieve any physchological or political condition desiredthat means that 90 of these objectives cant be measured in killmailsfurthermore war clearly favors the aggressee  they not only get free pvp but they also have the option of simply docking and wasting the aggressors hard earned cash
quit lying and get back to wow in eve bad things happen to good people  get over itand lol  properly flying concord battleships at gates
1if your definition of fun is making it impossible for others to have fun then there is something severely wrong with your idea of fun
i wonder how loudly the people who want to force me to throw isk into space via pvp would be screaming if eve contained a mechanism by which i could force them to either mine or hide in station
they would leave the game in the same way if you dislike a mechanic such as pvp so much then maybe you should consider leaving the game yourselfit has always been made clear that eve is a pvp game and crying about how you dont like that is hopefully futile there is a reason very few pirates in this game play wow or any other pvp flagged game in the same way if you want perfect safety then eve is not the game for youas for the topic at hand i feel that any change you try to make will only worsen the situation what you are effectively trying to do is set up a series of conditions which determine whether a war is legitimate or not this is akin to trying to make a computer determine whether an act is morally right or wrong aka almost impossible you can get a mediocre approximation such as wars cannot last longer than 2 weeks but that will still allow griefing while preventing many legitimate wars victory conditions are another terrible idea since any griefers can set unattainable conditions for a unlimited duration war the only solution which the carebears here will find satisfactory is a human level ai which unsurprisingly is completely out of the question
point provenif you can force me to either play in a way i find a boring waste of time or leave the game why shouldnt i have an equally powerful mechanism by which i can force you to either play in a way that you consider a boring waste of time or leave the gameif combat pvp is the beall and endall of existence why arent you playing team fortress ii insteadeve is a game with many aspects not merely a onedimensional shootemup scenario the current war mechanism is a problem because it reduces a complex game to a single aspect  turning it into team fortress in spaceif combat pvp is fun to you as a thing in and of itself it would be just as fun for you if you fought an opponent who also thought it was fun it would be just as fun for you if you had to declare an objective to accomplish when declaring wareveryone who threatens to stop playing if they cant wage unrestricted war against unwilling opponents without any objective in mind to accomplish is admitting that pvp for them is only fun when they are making easy kills against opponents of lesser combat capability this is proven by the intensity of their reaction against any suggestion that would make easy kills harder to achieve
in game as in life the only person responsible for yourmy safety is you or mewardecs probably need some kind of overhaul but by no means should hisec be safe or pvp freeevery time someone sells an item on the market reprocesses mission loot to ore or mines out a belt or undercuts someone else in the market or finds and clears exploration sites  they are doing it in competition with other players if you get loot from missions and sell it below the value of minerals that can be reprocessed from it you negatively impact miners activityif they took all the elements out of the game that impacted or competed with other players playstyles  that would pretty much leave you with a singleplayer gamei dont have any suggestions or solutions just want to say that new players should and do get some protection from being in npc corps and while learning but ccp hasnt been in the handholding business as far as i know since this game came outit is my opinion that they shouldnt start now
yes wardecs are broken yes they can be fixed nobody has suggested a suitable fix yet though
actually you can force pvpers to either pve or quit if you play a pveonly game such as hello kitty online then either the pvpers agree to pve or they dont play the same game as you solved what you fail to grasp is that open pvp is one of the core tenets of eve it isnt the only thing you can do sorry if my post implied that but 90 of activities involve some form of pvp and you cannot actually completely avoid pvp what you seem to be saying is that every game should cater to every type of player which by definition is impossiblei am not playing tf2 because believe it or not i dont actually think pvp is everything however i do believe that if there is a way to avoid pvp people will exploit this loophole to the point where pvp becomes 99 consensualyes pvp is fun if both parties are consenting but unfortunately if all pvp was consensual piracy would all but die out as a profession piracy is one of the things that makes eve great and tbh i dont want it to become another one of the numerous lets all get along and be friends games the point i was making was that creating objectives or time limits is completely pointless as it wont achieve even close to what you wantalso if you bothered to pay attention to anything you would have noticed that i am in a 00 alliance morsus mihi specifically has a nrds not red dont shoot policy in empire space so i dont know where you get the idea that i am only interested easy kills
some good news from ccpwhile we still dont know when this will be fixed this is a great first step towards balanced capital missiles
a little update would be nice  or even just a return to trinity rendering speeds
dont suppose you could suggest changes to it other than it sucks we all know it sucks to a degree now why dont you suggest changesisaac
its 2009 not 1994 does he seriously need to enumerate the features of a quality browser
i dont mean to sound mean but an internet browser does what the name implies it browses the internet i dont know how i am suppose to suggest changes except to make it work
proposal corp friendly fire highsecso my thought ran over a few things if some one is in your corp and decides that he want to kill of the members of the corp in highsec against their will yer there are a lot of s out there and think it could be profitable if finding the right target then he can do so without concord intervene and without any consequence besides getting kicked from the corp but face it if he does this i dont think he caresso i propose that you have the ability to set friendly fire onoff meaning that it will give a double warning about this when friendly tries to shoot you and concord will react as if it was a hostile attacking you if they decide to ignore this warningjust a fast thought
troll ban finally cool downnoif anything that switch needs to be set for alliances not corps
well i dont really care if it is set for the alliance the corp or the individual member if it is just there i am happy it just seems odd that you cant decide to say hey concord i dont want people shooting at me at all even if they have the same helmed 
less spam more scam
just append 00 to the isk amount display19999999900not rocket science
i support this
not you general ideas1 just more ships the t3s are nice but what about just new t1 bss cruisers and frigs just to add more to options2 cmon lets get some new mining ships a barge with on stripper and a large hold or on with almost no hold that can mine or move faster3 revamp destroyers some make them more viableeveryone complains about making 00 more fun or better personally think only thing wrong with it is that the big alliances control too friggin much of it yeah they worked at it but now they got it they keep other out and then complain that their is no good pvp anymore at least when gooh and bob was at war they was fighting not resorting to infiltrating the other so the shut it down kudos for doing it but just seems to be since you couldnt outfight you we going do it this other way all im saying is that there is no chance for newer corpsalliances to compete unless they join or align themselves with established 00 groupsequals stagnation and hence no fun everyone complaining about 00opening jove space is not the answer since the big boys will just grab the good systems for themselves and not fight for it
is this a whine
no i dont like this
personally i think that we should make the whole outpost stations more realistic meaningwhen you take over a station everything that is in that station now belongs to the owners of the station
they usually do and thats the point they only speak for themselves and their favorite issues often to the exclusion of what really mattersim glad you noticed
hint for the op dont use an abbreviation like fw without stating its full meaning at least once somewhere in your post i didnt know what you were on about until poster no 3 stated itdamn these boards are prone to that error  
the only thing i noticed is your steaming pile of arrogance
hahah you must really get lost when having a convo with most people in game i remember when i started i had to stop everyone to ask what the abbreviation meant guess thats what happens when you are in 00 on day 1 most convos in game though are basically alphabet soup for those that havent encountered the abbreviation before
and this is different from any politician because xd
private contracts are not just visible to both parties corporation directors can see them its a huge problem that makes spying needlessly tedious when obfuscating alts
one slight oversight a ship type counter for the fc only listing the totals would remove the need for manual ship type counting at all it would be great if players could mod the ui and i bet what they could come up with would easily be far superior to what we have nowits been done in other games successfully
delete post  some kind of bug made an empty post
i like this you have my support
my proposal standswhat i am talking about is a new forum channel where the threads posted in there are made with the intention to share a eve related appthat is only threads for posting applications not to share thoughts if you want to make a post related to a particular app you should do so inside that apps threadthe eve technology lab is not suited for this there you have channel to ask post everything related to technology but it is not a repository to quickly find eve appsthat new channel would be the right place to go and find eft evemon and many others including my ownthanks for reading
moved to assembly hall
i also think that sov system need some change but not like this
what are your feelings on the t3 problemwhat are your feelings on the rewritting of eve canonps bump you had slipped to the 2nd page ozzie 
ahh akita as much subtlety as an atomic bomb my thoughts on the problem is that t3 production was introduced prenerfed much like all new content brought in over the last few years but as far as i am aware ccp are actually monitoring drop rates so they can tweak them over time to reach their desired level i know they originally hoped for strats to be reasonably priced but as someone in that thread pointed out certain combinations are ridiculously powerful for ships of their size so making them too cheap would create a similar problem with the capital proliferation in 00 and lowsec keeping all that in mind i do think the gas either needs its m3 reduced so more can be shifted more easily or its unitscycle time increased so that less time is spent cutting your wrists watching your ship mine i am also aware that there seems to be a major bottleneck in the datacores needed so the droprate for them should probably upped slightly toobasically im willing to wait for ccp to adjust things slowly on t3 rather than go too extreme in any direction on it  making it easy and then nerfing it breaks the game just as muchabout bloody time
vote for this man
shes got my vote
anyone who has been on endlees pos ops should vote for this guy
i sent a completed copy of your interview to your gmail but do not see it posted anywhere did it get lost in the interwebs
this is an awesome idea nothing could possibly go wrong you should propose this in assembly hall
but yeah this would be more logical given the structure of the csm
indeed i had not been aware of this method beforehow diffiult do you imagine would this be to implement would it force every voter to place a number next to every single candidate if it can be done simple enough so as not to alienate possible voters i retract my original suggestion in favour of this
moved to assembly hall
i also think that sov system need some change but not like this
this topic has my support
thumbs up for whatever its worth
next saturday ill hear moredont worry i wont drop this issue and neither will erik if he gets elected
anyone who thinks this would lead to large spaceholding alliances dominating fw is kidding themselves spaceholding alliances have enough to do feeding the machinery and killing kennybut obv fw will never be a stepping stone to the main game in 00 if new alliances cant move between the two
larger fonts please
yes pleasedifferent font option at least one and bigger size would be great
yes
highly dissapointed in the lack of interest ccp is giving this is there anyway to run up and smack them anyone in iceland want to do that for me and friends of the oldcurrentnew csm wanna point them in the direction of here i mean i dont know how much more i can do but get your continued support in this group effort but sitting around and waiting doesnt feel like enough
this man doesnt even know what hes talking abouti support this moms are just useless since hid what the point to risk a ms when u just can field a fully insurable carrier which can do exactly what a mom does  epeen  no thanks
agree
should have been done long ago
that is correct but currently theres not much incentive for 00 especially for industrialists and even less for lowsecthough i would say they should bring moon mining into 04 lowsec is lowsec is lowsec imhoas for this i agree and it should be easy for a formidable fleet to wreck that sec status down to the bonethis would give true sec status a new meaning because itll be really hard to bring security to a 10 system also i think they should make all orbital objects actually orbit its kind of annoying that they are completely static and if we had planet sieging itd add a different tactical twist at x time on y day a warp from point a to point b could be z seconds but change the time variables and this all changesthis also goes into how i feel all ships should have different accel and decel rates when going into warp sure all ships align at different rates but all ships accel for 30sec and decel for 30sec the only ships that really notice their warp speed are titans and freighters other ships dont notice unless in 90au systemsremoving the 30sec acceldecel on all ships rule and giving them varying numbers would make planets orbiting give you a tactical advantage or disadvantage true orbits would also boost ambulations warroom idea where you could go into the system map in the war room zooming in further than the star map showed in the video ccp linked to about ambulation and plan attacks based on time of day fastforwarding and reversing time on the map to show planetary placement this could make for some very rewarding military operations and make eve feel that much more like the living sci fi novel it aspires to beramblesorry didnt mean to derail there op and kween fully 100 supported
tractors as they are are fine if adding med or large then make it so you can only use one tractor beam and that they have massive range but slow speed this would solve the 00 stuff as you can still approach and it still comes towards you but not fast and only one item at a time
we meed to improve orbit settings
i like this idea also one other thing especially in gate camps would be the direction of orbit i would like options in which direction to orbit a gate this would help setting up gate camp bookmarks
i support this very time consuming to sort what stuff to reprocess and what to sell
yep
im minny guns in pvp and caldari in pve and i think the loading is part of the weapons we dont need to make the game a one click game if you can go out in a passive tanked nighthawk with fof heavies and afk a lvl 3 or the easy lvl 4s then we have a major problemif your going to do auto firing then make it so it does not work with fof or mines as these could be used to mine the space to and from each warp gate on major routes to take out cloakers by simply orbiting the damn gate and launching minesi think the current system is fine i don think this needs changing
thumbs upmaybe it will make reloading guns work better in lag or is that too much to hope for
it should have been implemented long time ago
what about a new dronesalvage dronesopens up new skills for everyonei believe salvage drones was mentioned in a eve storyand a industrial that can carry a few along with a tractor beam boostthat doesnt cost 400mil
its not happening ccp declared its not going to happen isaac
stop trollingccp didnt introduce salvage drones for technical reasons they never excluded putting them in game at some point
wrong again troll please try harder next time
actually there is a nonpublished skill for salvage drones  it used to be listed in the evewiki though i dont know if it got removed with the apoc update  i havent lookedas far as i can tell they have just never been implemented most likely for technical reasons of one form or another
no there is already to much easy afk money in mission clean up adding med  large tractor beams or salvage drones makes the isk  time to high and whats worse it makes the game closer to one click and win gameseve is a game where you need to micro manage making it eaiser for wowmonkeys or prople to watch tv is not needed there is no major problem here i dont think it should change
would be very cool
some of the ships like drake manticore hawk have visible launcher points on the hull so some of the ships only need some launcher effect upgrade on the models the ships that dont have any integrated launcher need launcher points like the turrets havei support this
i have always wanted this since i first started playing
i support this so the entire galaxy can see for themselves caldari engineering is ugly even when it comes to launchers
sure
this is way overdue at the moment missiles are not only the most boring in my opinion anyway weapon system to use but also the fugliest
signed
a individual acts of piracy and wardecs against corporations are not the same thingb when debating an issue its a mistake to take arguments personally any given alliances policies in null sec and lowsec space are irrelevant since war decs are a highsec phenomenon
this needs immediate attention ccp just needs to change one number around and the problem will be solved or at least have a great band aid on until a more comprehensive change could be madecitadels need to be able to do damage approaching that as their other dread cousins against a moving mothership or other moving capital shipas it stands citadels are a pathetic joke against carriersms

well if they have pregend paintjobs for ships perhaps theyll have the same thing for t2  t1 or maybe ohmigod maybe the ship will actually look just a tiny bit differentskan
supported lag is for ccp to figure out i just want customizing
im all for preset paint jobs even with the limited set of templates we have now for the t2 ships i think itd be a nice addition allthough more templates to choose from would make it much nicer paint your fleet in ishukone urban camo or roden shipyard red adds a bit more diversity to the game
i like the new scanning system its more hands on and i think its true to the eve philosophy of making the player engange their brain rather than just grinding skills all the timehowever i agree with the issue raised here the new texture is icky and makes it hard to see it also seems to cause ridiculous lag when the probes warp and my highend pc nearly burst into flames earlier today when i was trying to chase someone and uncloaked hit warp and tried to recover my probes all in one go it took it about 30 seconds just to restabilize also theres a lot of bizzare green flashing on the system map when probes are launched or warped i think thats what the epilepsy talk is about to be honest though the warp line graphics are neat theyre really not necessary and also a lot of the time they dont even displaythe filter problem mentioned is also sort of a pain though i think its merely a minor oversight in the code if hes referring to what i am then the problem is that when you open the scan window the nonfiltered state is active but the filter name displayed is the last one on the list of filtersalso ive noticed that after the last patch theres a problem with the system when a single signal may be in one of two locations a ring hit still displays okay but when a third probe is moved in to triangulate from there only the correct location is displayed for that result rather than both potential locations i dont know if this was intentional or not but please put it back how it was the new process is cool should not be dumbed down for people who cant cope with primaryschool scienceoccasionally when scanning with multiple 7 probes ive noticed that sometimes the system icons disappear which makes it difficult to determine whether results esp ships are near gates or stations etc closing and reopening the map doesnt fix it it takes a session change to get the icons backsometimes its hard to move a probe around because the labels get in the wayfinally id like to note that it can be extremely difficult to manage the camera at close range when far from the central object an object nearer to the target can be selected as the rotation focus but sometimes no object is available for that purpose and i dont think a lot of people know how to change the rotation focus it would be nice to be able to rclick an icon including scan hits and set focus to help with moving the camerai know all that sounds critical but overall im impressed and gratified with the new system and would like to thank everyone who put work into it as well as everyone who works to make eve the best game available
some of the new effects i like  the spinny effect during the scan proper i really do like the look of the lag is completely unreasonable though and the graphics trump the actual usability of the interface a little too often for my tastes  the fact that the probe boxes are almost invisible when the plane of the system is between them and the camera is done terribly and the fact that we cant turn our camera perfectly vertical like im pretty sure we could before is fantastically annoying however minor i like the new scanning system and i like most of how it was implemented but it needs some tweaks yet i wouldnt phrase it as stridently as the op but i do basically support this
i do think the problems with the new graphics outweigh the benefits
i think this is a good idea would make combat more interesting using ship scanners probes or corps having system scanners at poss would be a good substitute only if you chat in local would you show up or if you are an outlaw
i dont support this no changewh space is fine with no local fits into story and was planned that way changing empire to that i disagree leave known space alone
this and this
fully supporteddelayed local like wspace would be awesomeits safer in a lot of ways for both players and pirates aswell as more dangerous for bothsure wed get less local chatter but it wouldnt change highsec much and itd make lowsec easier for carebears to mine without having to worry about pirates as muchsure pirates could find them but theyd have to probe them outthis would raise lowsec incentive to an almost high enough level to be worth itdo this and remove meta 0 loot from missions and lowsec will be totally worth itgiving us delayed local in all space makes military reconnaissance more of a job and less of something thats easily available youll actually need good pilots to recon and the team with better recon will be able to sneak up on fleets that would normally outnumber themlocal chat should be used for occasional general chitchat in highsec for advertising contracts or for showboating not as a spy tool delayed chat fixes thislook at wspacesure there are lots of pirates but your odds of getting ganked are still lowerit changes the tactics on both sidesthe only people who really lose with delayed local are the large fleet griefers that depend on local to blob everyone they see in localediti would also like to add that delayed local makes cloaking a much more entertaining joband possibly there could be some kind of cov ops scan probe that only finds cloaked signatures but has like a max 4au rangeedit
so let me get this straight what youre proposing is that a corporate thief can invade a corp make off with all the goods and if any retribution is tried concord comes over and smashes the people whose property was stolen sorry i dont see that happeningthis concept is ripe for abuse and exploitation so im gonna have to go with no on this one if you dont like the player corps start your own oneman corp or stay in npc corp trust is a hard thing to earn in this game so make sure you trust the people whom youre going to be calling corpmates
if you cant trust the people in your corp then maybe you should look for a new corp the situation is analogous to corp theft if someone can come into your corp and steal from hangars and you cannot turn that off then you should not be able to turn off other legitimate forms of corp shenanigans
ooc repping sucks should have more consequences
i support this if you cant see covops cloack fitted ships but you can see regular cloacked fitted ships ships that not designed for cloacking and you should only see the cloacked ships if they are try to move i have an idea for prototype cloack nerfyou can cloack from radars because your ship absorb the incoming radiations so your ships after some time should overheat afters some time in cloacking your modules get a damage like they are overloaded
so this will nerf cloaked ships with a legit reason for being there intel on a gateposbelt and not nerf afk cloaking ravens or what have you in safespots brilliant
you dont need to broke cloaking in general to solve problem of cloaking ships who are on the 1st place not supposed to be cloaked as i said earlier the best solution for this is to increase cap consumption while cloaked on all ships except bombers force recons coverts black ops and blockade runners or just simple to increase cap consumtpion on all cloak devices except covert cloak device for all other ships you can stay cloaked only for certain ammount of time cause in couple of minutes of being cloaked your cap will be dry and your cloak will turn off
cloaking isnt broken dont fix it

hi meridiusnice to see you again in regards to fw there have been a couple of threads eg on here in recent days asking about fw and which candidates consider it important whilst i am sure youre corp will not be voting for me anytime soon ill answer you points anyhowa a discussed over and over on the forums disallowing war decs for corporations within fw will provide a far too powerful advantage to fw corps over normal empire corps as long as they have no need to leave their chosen faction or allied factions space they will be almost free from be able to be attacked by anyone additionally to this it would also be a way of making a pos effectively invulnerable a better change to consider might be the idea of if you war dec a militia corporation the other members of that militia get to choose to dec you back for free without incurring the use of one of their war dec spaces b just a small niggle but you arent establishing sovereignty but occupation the idea of denying docking rights to the opponents of militia specific stations would be a nice idea and one that has come up before and so far i havent seen a good reason deny it as to other station services being denied an occupied region i like the idea of substantially increasing the fees per day the system is occupied but im not sure about denying them altogether yet as i would have to look in detail at the possible ramifications of it in terms of what you do if you are badly on the loosing foot and have nowhere to do anything outside of low sec as this would effect those people in fw that cant enter hi sec due to their sec status so yes in principle your ideas are great but complete denial may make things just too hard for the guys on the backfoot to have a chance of coming back c yes utterly agree not argument or thinking about this one needed from me at leastd i think it wouldnt hurt to give a small lp reward to fw pilots in exchange for handing in their vps maybe the amount of plexing that is needed in fw is rather large and for those militias who rely on a few people to do all the plexing for them minmatargallente im looking at you it is a thankless task some sort of reward beyond a rank is certainly in order but it shouldnt be anywhere near enough to make people consider it as the main reason to do it and certainly not to draw people into plexing for the lp i personally would go with equivalencing the lp to a rough translation of 1020lp per vp which would mean a large amount of plexing would need to be done in order to gain anythgin substantial from it in the main however i would like to see ccp continue to develop fw beyond the point it is at now ccp are great for launching new and shiny things on us but not so great for continued support for these things fw offers a great deal to a great many people but the interest in fw has been waining since release as broken or problematic mechanics go unfixed and new content for it isnt delivered a promise was made to the players of fw at the beginning that this would be an important part of eves development to the extent that ccp hung a whole expansion off of it but it seems to have been left to rot along with so many other brilliant but unpolished ideas they introduce to the game if elected fw is one of the things that i will pay a great deal of attention to i wont be biased in this despite my characters allegiance as what will help one side will invariably help them other i hereby promise to spend at least one day a week if elected talking to anyone from fw who wants to raise issues with me and furthermore to pay attention to what i am being told when raising an idea i will talk to all factions involved in fw and get their side of the story factional warfare could be so much more than it is
if by just about anyone you mean blockade runners who were nigh on unlockable before they got covops cloaks anyway10 players are perfectly capable to move through lowsec just dont stop or slow down as for keeping carebears on their toes see for yourselfive always been keen on a skill which increases your sensor strength given that all the other ewar mods have a relevant skill which counteracts the effects to some degree i think it should be added as for some sort of eccm rig yeah why not
this is quite a hot topic for every small gangsolo pvper i talked to so here is your opportunity to score some extra votes by showing your support in case you dont know what i am talking about here are some threads about the issue and why it is a bad idea
i constantly use this trickid hate to see it go away
i disagree with your assumptions skirmish gangs do not normally fit cloaks interceptors are used to scout gate camps not mwd align cloaking badgers
ive camped a lot of gates in my time and cursed those who use this trick ive also used it to get past many a gatecampi feel its a pretty lame tactic doesnt stop me using it and is probably not intended but i will be very sad to see it goas a previous person mentioned it wont hurt combat gangs mainly ratters haulers etc etc it will hurt recons and covops who find themselves caught short in a bubble
that has come up in the other treads linked above and sufficiently answered there as well but since you apparently havent read those im gonna humor you anywayan inty might still be able to survive a camp or get instapopped happens frequently also truebut i have to disagree with your other assessment roaming gangs do indeed fit cloaks not only on their recons and bombers which is kinda their trademark so it would be silly not to fit cloaks on them but also on hacs for which you pay a price with the scan resolution and lock delay penalties which is balancing it out they do that to be able to survive gatecamps better and be able to avoid getting scanned out and killed when they inevitably get boxed in by a fleet 10times their sizeso are you saying an inty should be the only ship able to maybe survive jumping into a camp but recons covert ops bombers blockade runners and the like should just die in every competent camp they come alongit even makes the recently buffed black ops a joke as how is your covert cyno ship supposed to infiltrate hostile territory if it just gets killed in any camp it comes along on the wayit is this kind of catering to blobs territorial powers and gatecamps that has made eve a less fun experience for everyone not into that kind of stuff like people trying to fight while outnumbered behind enemy lines etc and we certainly do not need another nail in that coffin but that does not mean it is impossible to catch people using a cloak it just means your camp or the one you were facing was not competent enough or just unlucky a good camp can frequently decloak and catch ships using cloaks up to and including recons and covert ops ive had it happen to me and have done it myself with these changes even an incompetent camp will be able to kill anything coming in it will be like shooting fish in a barrelat least this is true for 00 space where there are bubbles aplenty these days in low sec where even bs can use the the mwd cloak warp trick this is indeed a problem i can imagine but to fix a pure low sec problem by breaking 00 combat variety is just wrong there has to be another way
as a nonterritorial small gang pvper myself i have seen this trick being used on numerous occasions and i am in two minds about it being dealt with as it is by ccp in regards to its effectiveness at evading gate camps in 00 a well setup gate camp should be able in most cases to decloak and destroy most ships coming through it with the possible exception of cov ops ships even if they do use this trick attempting to go through a gatecamp into 00 is already a tough challenge for most small outfits unless very specific ships are used in regards to using a cloak on hacs yes i have seen it done and i dont really find it provides enough of a boost to escape a gatecamp setup in 00 anyway and this change should not effect their ability to hide when they they need to when already in a system so from a 00 perspective it will negatively effect the ability of a few ships to enter a heavily camped 00 system however it must be said that for every system that is camped right now there is usually a way past all but the most core systems of someones territory additionally to this i feel the change will have an effect on a minority of ships as the vast percentage of ships that could use this trick on a properly setup gatecamp is minimal certainly a hac shouldnt be able to get past a well setup 00 camp with or without this trick currently in regards to low sec there are currently many things that need to be looked at as it is simply too easy to avoid fights at the moment the agility of ships is far too high allowing ships to escape combat whenever they wish to given an example i was on a gate with my corp mate today who was in a triple sensor boosted phobos with the current level of agility of ships we had a dominix get past us because he wasnt able to lock it in time i mean obviously the dominix was setup to do just that but when a battleship can align and warp before somethign with nearly 1000 scan res can lock it there is something wrong the cloakmwd trick is just another example of how low risk empire fighting has become indeed right now there is few ways to force an engagement from an enemy if they do not want it whilst i am sure that appeals to many in eve it does strike me as contradictory to the cold dark universe ccp have stated new eden is meant to be whilst it could be said that this change will effect the small gang 00 pilot i do not honestly believe it will be a huge change from the status quo for the majority of them the big hit will be against the solo ratters and industrial pilots who fly around 00 without wishing to push voters away on the eve of election it is about time that vunerable ships were escorted in so called dangerous space anyway but looking at it where does most combat in eve take place a cursory glance at the map on any day will normally show a vast amount more ship kills in empire than in 00 given the additional difficultly of forcing a fight in empire it would seem to me that the majority of combat simply must happen in empire as a result bring a change that will being eve closer to the ideal that ccp want for eve would seem to be the way forward for the minority of pilots in 00 that this will effect it will be another challenge to be overcome but not a great one as little will actually change for the majority
i also submitted my interview a while ago and i still dont see it posted
same but to be fair he said he was posting them daily and had 30 or so that said 30 posted daily means that the last ones wont go up until the voting is over if our friendly host could speed things up a little make sure that theyre all posted before voting starts itd be appreciated
 heartstone actually i dont i can see for most candidates if they display some affinity with roleplaying in their posts in the candidate section considering only 3 or so candidates did that my vote will go to either of those or my ceo my ceo did
in my humble opinion i think strategic votes are stupid and not strategic at all in most cases
somethings should stay the same plz return the show
yes please i love that effect
old effect was fine new is uglysigned
supported new effect sucks
huh i think were at the stage where we need to decide on what the accepted role of an af actually is i dont do much solo work so i wont comment on that but in a fleet setting i use them asa heavy tackle  the ability to hold onto a target without dying long enough for dps to arriveb frigate superiority platform  killing frigs and destroyers at a disproportionate ratio to ship lossesespecially when paired with interceptors i really cannot stress enough how well they perform these roles  especially if youre dealing with smartbombing battleships  as is often the case for usso the questions now are1 what solo roles do they fill2 why are they lacking in fleet or solo roles each ship3 what bonus would you propose to solve this problem each shipfrom there we can have solid options to evaluate
agreedafs really are small counterparts to the hacs each individual ship may excel in a certain role but the class as a whole is designed to provide ships capable of performing well in many cirucmstances where high performance is needed couple with agility and speed looking at the bonuses of the afs and hacs a lot of them are cleary designed to be used in a similar wayharpy  eagle ranged dpsretribution  zealot ranged dpsvengeneance  sacriledge heavy tanker ishkur ishtar drone bukkake enyo deimos blaster boatthey individually have quite different characters whilst at the same time being versatile enough to perform well in a variety of situations for example in fleets as you have mentioned they also work very well in the role i use them in which is solo or with another af wingman killing much larger targets with an ab and a scram they are able to speedsig tank even when webbed and take down much larger ships whilst at the same time being fast enough with an ab to make the initial tackle and nimble enough to evade gatecamps that would catch a cruiser or larger ship so my point is this afs are able to and should continue to be able to perform well in a variety of roles whilst still having distinct characters therefore as with hacs im against giving the whole class the same bonus that bolsters their use in a specific role rather they should be given their bonus on a case by case bonus in keeping with the general character of the ship the problem with afs in general is that they simply are not worth the isk they were initially given a 4th bonus which was to resists however when this was incorporated into the hull as with other t2 ships they did not receive a new 4th bonusi feel like im starting to repeat myself here as i have given some examples of the bonus i would like to see before but ill quickly summarise my thoughts hereharpy inherit the 5 bonus to resists that the merlin gets completeing the merlin moa harpy eagle family of caldari rail boatsvengeance bring it into line with the sacriledge and give it a rocket rof bonusretribution not sure on this a zealot style rof bonus may be overpowered answers on the back of a postcardhawk i would suggest a rof bonus here like the cerb and also a boost to fittings so its possible to fit with t2 launchers plus tank and tackle without fittting mods ishkur probably a 5km per level drone control range bonus is suitable here a drone damage bonus for example would make this already superb ship completely overpoweredenyo how about a falloff bonus to match the incursus both falloff and optimal bonus this would become a very flexible shipwolf and jaguar 75 bonus to turret tracking these two differ from others in that theyre both used in similar roles ie with autocannons or artillery and so im in favour of a bonus that is helpful in both roles they still retain their characters with this the jag being the more agile shield tanker and the wolf slower sturdier armour tanke while were on the subject its worth noting that a lot of people want the falloffoptimal bonuses to be switched
as i stated before in the post im of the mind that the containers arent good enough i do understand that the basic functionality in the end result of what i am looking for is already present with cans but the truth of the matter is that they are terrible for a whole host of reasonsmost notable is the fact that they cannot be opened remotely through the assets pane to be able to peek in and see exactly what is inside you could set up a contract for the can itself but that only gives you the base stack of the items in the can and not the amount of each stack also there can be nothing done about managing those items remotely either ie contracting and suchi use cans and it sucks you have to open them each time and then if for some reason you have to reinstall the client but eve never craps out then you have to reset the settings on every one that you have because all that info is saved clientsidelastly you cant sell items directly from within a can which is another pain in the coloni would advocate a change for cans as well as an implementation of the itemtabbing idea but i still think given that we have a corporation hangar that encoporates this function it seems only natural that we have divisions in our own personal hangars that follow suitthis issue had prior support by at least 2 csm members and i hope that the new guys pick up the torch keep the ideas coming though guys and gals
supportedallow us to make custom tabsmaybe we can partition hangar space for each taballow this for ships aswellthis would make station containers useless but you cant search containers in your assetsoh and if this is implemented let tabs show up as expandable trees in the assets window just like corp divisionseditfor those that will whine about all their organized station containersccp turn all station containers into tabs of the same name tab  if the container isnt named and automatically reprocess all station containers into ore 3edit

supported100and please dont render the game across two screens if people want that put an option for it let us use that space for windows and overview and allow us to clean up our game screen to look at this beautiful gameas another option but would have performance issuesvveve is a tactical game so having two cameras wouldnt give you an advantage it would just make multitasking and fleet commanding easierthis was done really well in supreme commander and would be awesome with only a mild resource hitbut ignore my derail there what i really want to see is my windows on one monitor eve on the otherhell allow us to just deattach the game windows from the eve window when in windowed mode kind of like newer versions of photoshop no reason for those windows to be locked in game  but implementing this would probably be harder than just true twomonitor support

i might support this later well see i like the thought but with how tractors are right now two new middleclasses would feel redundantmaybe if they had different strengths and two people could tractor the same object tractor tugowar style then we could go with the 10km range per middle size with higher strength tractor velocity excuse me call it what you want or go with the ops stated 100 and have the larger ones not as strong as the smaller onesthe idea of the ops proposal is nice but tractors need to be reworked a little this could make fighting ninja salvagers pretty interesting especially if you go with shorter range increments for the middleclass but make them stronger they could waste all their tractors on more wrecks and hope to outsalvage you or they could try to outpower you by putting more tractors on this should only raise tractor strength not velocity this is why i used the strength term earlieroooh to expand on that just combine the two make larger tractors have higher strength but lower speed this could make for some interesting salvage battles 
supportedsimpleeasyuseful
so obvious really
as a moros pilot i support this idea 100
this is what makes amarr unique if you want autorepeat train amarr
i do not supporti feel it makes sense that amarr weapons autorepeatother weapons reload then you reengage themyoud prolly lose a hand loading a 1400mm artillery that started firing once loaded 
much support for this this doesnt fix pos bashing and make it fun but it definitely makes it less suck
a corpmate asked about this issue at evevegas this past weekend and it seems the devs said flat out that alliances will never be allowed into fwhow very disappointing
i closed my eyes to do not see that im supporting a goon
please fix that and the bses
great idea
seems like a no brainer to me
caod could easily be an interesting readable useful forum like shcs war and politics forum it isnt at present for two reasons1 people who have something to say not saying it there and2 people who have nothing to say posting for the sake of itforums are supposed to be a means of communicating of passing information from one person to another it would be wonderful if there was one accessible to those who dont rp where they could actually you know talk about what theyve done in gamethe rules on caod ccp said were deliberately lenient presumably to allow some measure of smacktalk between enemies but most of what we see now isnt even smacktalk its just talk
i like caod as it is just a bunch of bros chilling and having fun i dont see the problem maybe if we all decided to respect each other and not judge each others posting habits we could all work together and build a better forum one where we can all just relax and have fun
now all we need is someone bold enough on the csm to bring it up
this game has had many of its more adult references sanitized for the release of the boxed version there needs to be some outlet for channeling the nerd rage that fuels the stories and intrigues that make this game enjoyable to playif you think this is a good use of csm time that will affect very few of the actual playerbase ok i think there are larger more pressing issues they can spend their time on
how do you afk mission cleanupmore salvage would make rigs cheapertoo much iskhour compared to what pvp theres no real money into missions compared to other aspects of this game youve been fooled missionsunners are together with miners the slaves in eve
funny how when gs makes a post all of gs supports it right away loli sure am gonna miss those times when wartargets try to bump my frieghter so it cant warp and end up bumping it xxkms into alignment for my warpout hahayes please fix this ccp its awesome but no im sorry its just wrongeditdidnt see the dates on the posts oops im guessing its fixed now
the challenges of live events are beyond what tranquillity can muster perhaps another idea is to host live expeditions into wormholes with a single corp or alliance running security with perhaps another against themfor players that avoid or are in small corps setting up temporary expendable fleets for insane objectives through the contract systemset this up with volunteer players and live agents interacting with players and corps chosen by criteria based searchingexamples events in factional warfare daring slave rescues by the minmatar assaults against a rogue drone controlled titan 00 events like taking over an ancient space station or setting up colony worldsthats a few seconds of thinking what could ccp come up with with a team of thinkers that would know how to set this upfinally i apologise for my ad hoc suggestionits all straight out of my mind
this can only be brought back if there is no reward for participation ccp can never be trusted with reward based events again
i forgot what ccp mentioned 2003 or 2004 about this but none the less fn supported

signing thismissiles are boring to look at if you link all 7 turrets on a megathron you still get 7 gun trails shooting at the target if you link all your launchers on a raven or golem you getone singlemissile sized glowy ball thing before linking when you actually had to fingerroll f1f6 on a raven you had a chance that all 6 would fire at the same time and youd launch a giant glowing ball of doom that at the very least looked somewhat menacingmake missiles fire like turrets give each launcher a specific point on the hull that its mounted to and have each launcher launch an individual missile toward the target and make missiles look like missiles a little 5 point elongated pyramid would work with a big trail of fuel color coordinated to damage type that slowly fades out after a few seconds
sure

pgood idea
apologies if this has been raised before i did have a search through but didnt see anything on this but could have missed itanyway i recently purchased the new eve box set with 60 days of free game time this inspired me to create a new character and actually run through the starterepic missions just to refresh my memory of what it was like to be a new player in evewhat i have found is that ccp have made significant improvements to the new player experience  its gigantically better than when i first started to play eve 6 years agohowever one thing that i did not have to contend with back then was constant isk seller spam now i am aware that you can block spammers however the spammers rotate these so you have to go through the same process on a regular basis as a vet i think it is particularly sad that the first thing that greets new players are isk selling adverts the frequency of which often stifles reasonable conversation in newbie channelsnow i am sure ccp are aware of the issue but i do think a special effort should be made moderate the newbie corp channels and kickban offenders on a regular basisthere may be something that ccp simply do not have the manpower to deal with but at the moment it seems to be being ignored so i would be interested in csm members investigating this issue with ccp in greater depththanks
you think thats badstop by jita or rens and watch local for a bitcontract scammers galore
hello hardini understand your pain being in a newbie corp myself however even if ccp did monitor the channels the spammers rotate so much that it would be a lot of effort for nothing the block command is simple to do and gives you the same amount of protection from the annoyance as a ccp dev would beill admit that something needs to be done but it should be on the coding side not the monitoring side and im not even sure if anything can be done about that
what ever happened to right click  report spammer function why has it not been implemented ingame yet whats taking so long
lol dodixie is worse than rens nowadays but yeah the top three systems are worse than channel spammers
this is a ms change idea to give them more of a combat role this would only be one aspect of their overall changesfighters with one shot very high alpha firing a stealth bomber type bomb with less explosion radius and requiring higher sig radius of the target to be effective after that one shot they have to return to the ms to reload due to the constant motion you would probably need them moving fasting than normal fighters while mwding the bombers would be designed to anti capital work but would probably also be effective against fighter clouds just due to the amount of them being thrown out when assigning these to someone they would stay at the ms until the attack command was given at which point they would enter warp as a normal fighter come out a certain range from the target make their strike then return to reload different races obviously using different damage types give the carrier skill itself a bonus to their mwd and warp speed or the typical damagehp bonusto offset the fact normal bombs cost isk to fire make them reload by drawing topes out of your cargo or god forbid a fuel bay if it ever gets put inand for anyone who is reading this and thinking stealth bomber these wouldnt cloak so dont post saying cloaking fighters is gay etc etc
supporting because im pretty sure eve is one of the few if not the only spaceship game that has no bomber class to compliment fighterspros will note my use of the word compliment before they words on about stealth bombers
supportedthis would be neat itd nice to see carriers have more use in capital warfare other than dyingand the aoe explosions would help balance out the massive damage shouldnt be too hard to program drone ai to only lob bombs from certain distancesi really like the reload idea aswell
anything that makes carriers more interesting in a fkeet fight is something i will approve
sorry bfm i dont support this one a simple adjustment in build cost to maybe 68b per ms and leave them otherwise the same would be a good compromise their current cost is clearly not in line with their usefulness but the answer isnt making even more powerful big ships could you imagine a wave of remote stealth bomber attacks on a single target while the mothership chills out at a safe pos that would be as broken as remote doomsdays
1 they wouldnt be stealthed they also would warp in a specific distance from the target not the person commanding the drones specifically to avoid that kind of abuse to assure the person receiving the attack had time to respond and encouraging people to use support fleets on the same grid as capitals2 ms are 1013b min cost as is dropping it by 24b wouldnt even begin to give them a real purpose just make them a tiny bit less worthless they need a niche nothing else can fill
i hear some corps have as many as 5 motherships that they could use at once in the same system could you imagine coordinated attacks of this nature with those weapons while the motherships stay perfectly safe
no support in current form looks more like a proposal for a giant capless remote smartbomb flack cannonas an aoe damager or a heavy hitter mss would start encroaching on dreads or supports rolesbombers would be cool but should be just larger fighters that are slower hit harder and track less slow enough that when they orbit they have trouble shooting bss damage somewhere in the 2k range for a carrier any more encroaches on dreadsbombers should be a tradeoff from versatility to firepower like every other weapon system
against someone not deploying any kind of support fleet or simply failing to react it would be devastating the same anti support ships that completely romp tacklers would be ideal for killing these t2 fighterswhich would be no means cheap when a fighter is deployed the moment you see it take damage you can recall it these would be forced to finish their run even if it meant their destruction the days of sieging 50 dreads and then sitting back knowing nothing short of 100200 bs pose any real threator more dreads than you would be gone and the fleets would be more active as a whole positioning support alertness and capitals themselves would have to adapt in pos warfare currently if you arent a cap or bs you have very little to do unless a fight breaks out these bombers would give them a role in the offtime and increase the chance a fight does break out 5 ms of these would do a lot of damage 20 ms even moreso but through methods like size you can limit the number each ms can use and through price you can make losing them extremely painful to the ms pilot a fighter that costs 6070m a pop is not something im going to gleefully suicide 20 of every given chance that said if a group can routinely field 20 ms and they can all afford a full flight of bombers and you cant manage to kill them fast enough to justify losses you take then you probably shouldnt be doing what youre doing anywaysedit look at that i responded to everything nande said too without ever seeing his post
instead how about explore alternate roles for the mothership maybe a deployable platform allowing repairs for ships nearby while it burns some sort of material to maintain the deployment phase a super repping platform maybe it can deploy fire and forget drone killer drones that just fly out in a cloud and kill drones independently until recalled anything other than a more powerful remote damage dealer because that whole philosophy was terrible when it was first dreamed up
i love those ideas too im just putting forth an idea i think has potential for the devs to spitball over i would love to see ms get any change to make them more useful just to show they are actively looking at them and tweaking
the idea of throwing your mothership into the middle of combat doing an aoe repair on ships in your fleet while in something like a siege mode would be awesome and an interesting twist on how to use expensive supercaps
supporting a good ideaalso first
i like your idea a lot but this is in the wrong forum you should really go post this over in features and ideas
your idea is incredibly interesting but it feels totally incomplete something along these lines could probably work but i dont think this idea is in finished enough form to pass along to ccp no support right now but id love to see this come back in a month
how hard would it be to implement a lite version of mozilla into eve it is all opensource 
the problem here is copylefting firefox is open source yes but it requires derived works to also be open source i have a funny feeling ccp doesnt want to release the source code to their primary business
hahaha right the gpl whatever thing hmmi was gonna say they should call m but then almost choked myself to death so
guys not to zombie but if you do support this can you make sure youve ticked the i support this box all statistics help thanksand if youre reading this and thinking it doesnt affect you  please consider supporting it anyway if it makes sense to you for one day it might be you in that situation and im not kidding when i say it can mean the difference between ganking and losing a ship
makes sense

edit following comments edits in bolddropping cans etc to have a fight is all well and good but it does lend itself to abuse sometimes and there could be a much better mechanic for random fights in evei propose the intstant battle mehcanicsomebody wants to fight youthey right click on your ship and on the pilot section is a request combat buttonthe player who you want to fight gets a message saying this person wants to fight you just like you get when a convo starts you can select yes or no clicking no closes the window you can set it to auto deny battles to save freighers getting spammed to hellif you select yes then both players get a new instant combat window with a few options available and an eve voice channel similar to the fleet mechanic it allows players to fight without concord intervention in the options for this section is a begin button a surrender button and a few settings to agree terms for the fight to determine the winner ie leaves the feild  lose structure damge  lose you can invite non combatants to your battle to place bets  and they get an expanded watch list of all the combatants similar to how it looks for the tournaments you can move people around the instant battle window into groups the combatants sides and the spectators side spectators are unable to lock combatants to prevent sneaky remote repping  randoms joining the fray and you cant move or invite new people once the fight begins similar to the trade window there is an accept terms button once all combatants fleet commander clicks accept thre is a coundown of 60 seconds where combatants ships are invulnerable and cannot move  lock anything  or launch dronesif the surrender button is clicked by the fleet commander then that side becomes invulnearble and the battle is overother sides can no longer lock that fleet and the person who surrendered is made imobile for 1 minute then ejected from the battle like if you light a cynoyou can have multiple combatants per side who can arrange themselves into squads and give bonuses just like in a fleet and create as many sides as you want for the ultimate free for all tournament mechanic edit over
stopped reading right thereno
this could be heavily abused but i support itif youre agreeing to fight someone then youre agree to fight on eves terms which do not favour a balanced fighti do disagree on the autobattle timer though sure itd reduce afkrs and macrors but itd be abused more often than useful it was a valiant thought but the execution wouldnt workif it were just a do you agree to fight me and my fleet yn that could time out like a fleet invitation then its your fault if you get blobbed after agreeing thus not really exploitable just a war against stupid which i firmly support sure the person could be lying about his fleet size but thats your fault to agreeing with a legal skirmishbut i can not stress how much i disagree with the autoagree it should just time out like a fleet invite or a chat invite just like the soontobeimplemented sex0rz me yn feature
maybe you gotta click yes then was just thinking how it could be used to kill macro miners etc i guess pirates would just spam the local channel
yeah you cant really hurt macro miners without hurting players in a way that they will not enjoythe only good antimacro fix i saw was in darkfall where they have a specific group of gms that ingame watch players and talk with them if they think theyre macroingbut the overall idea of the op is really good
thinks of all the afk haulers and freighters yeah i support this it will never make it in the game because it breaks immersion and doesnt exactly make a lot of sense concord looks the other way because the pilot was afk for a few minutes
i disagree about it breaking immersionwith the timer sure but without it can easily be kept out of the immersionbreaking mechanics listmake it to where it can only be done off grid of stations stargates and other npc owned structures like data centershave it not affect sec because it was consentual combat between folksas i said this is exploitable but all you have to do is say no
hell no wow is that way if you want dueling
i remember a time in eve when you could attack gang members that werent in corp and concord wouldnt careitd made testing friends tanks out easier if they werent in corp and made fighting friends that werent in corp easier than having to deal with a lame wardec when all you want is to fight your friends for an hour or so before you go do some missions togetherthese arent duelsi did mention that fleets could get involvedthis is consensual combatwe have sport fighting in real lifeplenty of people would enjoy sport fighting in thisand sense eve is a sandbox other people could jump into the fray and suicide bomb it or it could be in lowsec and pirates could interfere etc etc etcthis isnt dueling like in wowthis is a consensual fight in a public placeyou friend cheering you on can jump in if theyre ed at how the fight is goingthat drunk guy across the street couldve heard the yelling and thought he heard someone say something about his momma causing him to flip out and just start swinging punches or in this case smartbombsallinall comparing this to wow is fail consensual combat and strictlyruled duels are two very different things
hmm the op post realy similar to dueleven if he ads squads to it also after 35mins it allows the agressor to engage freely wtf wtf wtf wtf will prevent that i wont see 100 duel requestsseconds in my freightershould i log off if i have to be afk for 3mins wtfthis idea is just plain stupid if you want to fight without concord go play faction warfare or go to 00 those options are already there
honestly i agree that the timer is stupidit needs to be like a fleet or chat invitationsend invite if they dont accept it times out
it is really impressive how often this selfcensored griefer concept comes up why not add other options too request isk for example if you dont click anything it is assumed you want to give the requested amount of isk after 3 minutes the only thing worse than spammers and bots are the wannabesheriff fascists and their flaming sword crusade against them apart from that the average bot is already smarter than those guys which means it would just click no whenever one of these brain oozing combat requests would come in
nice to see how people only ever read the op and never the posts after op you should edit the timer out before people troll your topic off the board you have a great idea advertise it better 
saying no to a screen full of spam fight requests everytime i fly through hisec in a haulereve does have a mechanism for consensual pvp already namely entering lownull sec while appreciate this doesnt meet the agreed 1v1 that the op is looking for that can be found by asking in local for this kind of fightnot supportedzos
no i dont like this
i can support a duell function one that just cut out the formality of dropping a can and reduces the extent of aggression counter compared to candropping accepting a duell will give participants a 15 minutes personal aggression counter to each other only meaning comrades can not intervene in highec no guarantee for ship survival smaller ships could be oneshot anywaythe antimacro autoaccept proposed in the op will actually only hit afkers macro programs will be scripted to detect the fight proposal afk is not a crime nor should it be
i dont really see the point in a random encounter who would ever challenge someone they couldnt beat and therefore why would anyone accept such a challenge as has been said there are already reasonably satisfactory workarounds to do duels and this mechanic would be abused extensively just to annoy peoplesorry no support
because a lot of people believe in honorable combat and other people like the idea of appearing weak to a larger opponent and then wiping the floor with them
honorable combat is a function of honor not game mechanics a honorable fight is possible with existing mechanics enforced honor is no longer honor
going out to lowsec to go fight with friends only to be ganked by pirates isnt honourthis is not enforced honour you could get blobbed by your opponents friends but by saying yes you both have the option to be honourable without concord or pirate interference
support for this
do want
you have my support on that my notebook which runs eve struggles with the stationanimations too i am a manufacturer and stay 237 in station and it would be nice to have an option to turn it off because the whole system is stuttering does anyone miss gammacorrection options in eve when i enter eve i always have to adjust the screen to make it brighter and when i get out again problem is to run in windows mode 1024x768 and browse the web eve is to dark again and my web is to bright
very much signedfor the last year and a half or so ive had to have the map open while in station or the station environment on or off as it could be set in previous clients ate my cpu and gpu in a most disgusting manner viewing the starmap is only a partial fixbesides you took away the gallente pleasure palace environment the only one that was fun to look atlet us select a single static rendered frame that doesnt run our gpus at full load or let us go for a good ole black background
i can see by the dates and responses that thiis area is a waste of time
you created a waste of a threat stating the obvious
ive been searching through this forum for this and have yet to see anything talking about iti love the idea of faction warfare but it feels really empty being locked into lowsec and not really having any hold on the game world itself other than making some areas of space more dangerous for nonfw participants than other areasand how cool would it be to do missions for guristas and join the guristas militia out in 00 and fight in fw on a side that has no alliesthis brings fw out into 00 and bring more life into fwall pirate factions have no allies and have bases out in 00 making it harder to work for themthis also lowers faction standings of coursebut by killing players of one of the four factions you raise standings with their two enemiesthis coupled with allowing alliances to ally with militia would bring new life to fw something that did fairly well in the beginning and seems to be slowly dwindling out of existence it is most definitely not true that you can not ally while you ally
when i spoke to ccp during fanfest that was one of the things that was originally planned and never got implemented with all the problems related to fw that still need fixing one year later i wouldnt hold your breathid love to see it though
fully supported hope to see this one day
absolutely id love to see this someday
ERROR
i agree and support this the payout of mined minerals to corp  alliance is another example we have to create seperate spreadsheets to work out the payments then make manual transfers with a corp  alliance market we can set the price of specific items and members can sell directly to the corp the market can be linked to a specific wallet and the funds transferred automatically to the seller from that wallet this will give directors more time to play the game and organize ops and less time doing admin tasks which some do in real life at work then escape to eve just to be confronted with more work sales tax should be linked to the tax rate the corp  alliance has set as general tax
this a better contract interface will do the trick a whole second marketplace is overkill and could get confusing
supportedi understand the contract system does this but only at a small levelallowing for alliance marketplaces would be a very neat feature because you could put up a lot more orders than you could make contracts and be able to trade within alliance without having to be onlinethis doesnt make for easier money it just makes for less hassle alliance trade
like tinting the metal certain colors or have a primary color and secondary color would be swell
signedcorp logos wouldnt be that hard either if the logo spot on a ship was predetermined maybe give 3 possible locationsconsidering corp logos are made of layers of preset images these are just a couple more lowbit variables to pass down the pipehaving rgb on various parts of the shim main  2nd  detail would be very win and with those options right there you get tons of variety from three variables all of which would probably be very lowbit and handled clientside var 1 rrggbb var 2 rrggbb var 3 rrggbb etcyall argue lag i argue willtoimplementi wont hold it against ccp if they dont implement it but i really would love to fly a white apocalypse with black and red details with my corp logo on it firing infrared and multifrequency lasers at the camera for the corp photo op
i allways wanted a pearl white domi
forgot to support
this is a game where we can be anything and being identifiable by our ship ships colors should be apart of it ask any b29 bomber pilot from wwii what p51s they wanted escorting them and they would all say the red tails the tuscogeesp i knoairmeni was just looking at my hookbill and noticed that there is the vs on it like you would find on current day military vehicles operating in the gulf these could easily be replaced with our corp logos while i would love to paint my ship urban camo jet black or any other color i can think of i believe that the corp logos would add realisim to the game and give it that bit of personalization to it
should just release the same ships with different pre rendered painted schemes not player designed
this this a thousand times thissupporting even if this is the 9001st thread about it
agreethe nice fancy triangle polygons on the spheres can stay but tone the glow down or make the polygons larger so theres not so many of them or use some similar solution to tone down the visuals while probingalso ot why does a signature found by 3 probes report a single dot pre 11 it was two dots as it should be
i like it as is i dont see any reason to change the graphics theyre not ugly and are quite clear the new probing mechanism was the best change ive seen in eve in years also

your a damn moron you obviously have no experience with macroratters or people who are most likely using bacon if that crap is still around or are in the category yourself when you jump into a system and within 2 seconds the raven poofs off the scanner and cloaks that is total bull at that point its impossible to kill and i am not badto the carebears crying about not being able to tell when pirates are coming after you start supporting better intel tools but realize the same pirates also wont be able to see you in your precious localat least when your rats mwdd off of belts you could still kill them op supported get local out of here
not supportedjust the thought of having to click every few seconds to check out local is mind numbing and boringlets make changes that make the game more fun and stop trying to do things that turns it more into a job not to mention things like hunting down wartargets in empire would become virtually impossibleundocking would give anyone outside the station too much of an advantageespecially if they were a cloaked gangplus it would probably result in a lot less systems being used in 00 as most would start rattingmining in the dead end constellations with a scout giving them plenty of warningalso if you use a system that is well traveled even by youre own corpalliance you would have to repeatedly get safe everytime you pick a ship up on scansince there is no way to tell wether its a friend or foesame when youre traveling or scouting how could you properly hunt targets down there would be no more big roams you would get bored continually scanning and hunting down every scan hit within about 3 jumps probably take a few hours to travel that as wellchecking out every hitespecially if you had to get the ship on grid just to see if its friendly or not
what he said
not supportedif people think that removing local will help increase the incidence of pvp they need their heads examinedthe majority of people playing eve are risk averse removing local will simply ensure that those risk averse players will do more to limit their exposure to risk in other words they will stay docked or in poses unless they really need to travel and when they do travel they will blob up even more than they do now to provide mutual protection in busy systems the scanner is pretty useless for detecting potential inbound hostiles and the result will not be that more people will be caught in belts  but that less people will be in belts to start with in my view the removal or local will actually damage pvp by reducing opportunities not enhance it
this would damage it in some areas and enhance it in others you are either blind to the truth behind how awesome it would be or have all of your fun hunting these atrisk people because its super easy for youhaving it this way makes it more challenging for pirates but also make it more safe for bothit wont lower pvp because most pirate gangs i run into have at least one member with combat probes it would just raise necessity for mining gangs to have one aswelltechnically this all makes life harder for the miners not the pirates because they have to counter probe to be safe pirates are already probing to find out where people are anywayits easier to probe for offense than it is defenceim also not saying we remove local i like delayed localall of this also brings back more of the unknown to spacesure itll feel safer but you wont be able to do a thing without be mad paranoid instead of how it is now where most dont even bother trying to do anything because its too easy for one side it needs to be balanced for both sides without stupid security rules or anything the best way to help this is by instead of adding some lame mechanic that nerfs piracy in lowsec or some nerf local to be delayed this puts both pirates and miners on an even playing surfacethe current way local is imho its cheating and im not even saying this because i get ganked a lot i use local as my hunting tool there is something seriously wrong thereand i heavily disagree here sure some systems will feel more empty but overall system traffic will go up because less people will be scared to go out and highsec traffic will probably lower slightly spreading the eve population out a bitimho if this were to happen wed see a lot of highsec corps move to lowsec because it wont be a useless lowreward suicide trip
i support this what other pvp game tells you the number of people and who is around death spam in local is one thing however it takes away from the game having this
its truehow awesome was it in uo getting snuck up on by a playerassassin in the woods you had no idea he was in locali cant think of a single mmo that made it anywhere with openworld pvp and a list of everyone near younot saying that eve isnt makin it it most definitely is but instant local doesnt make sense especially when you start getting out into lowsec and furthermaybe keep highsec instant to keep highsec wars goodthis will also add a different form of risk because no ones hidden in highsec so suicide gankers wouldnt start ruling the world again and wars could be fought the way theyve always been fought until you have to chase your targets into lowsec for a real fun game of can and mouse
not supportedif you accept an application to a corp that means you trust them enough to allow them to test your tank for freeif you arent sure if you can trust them or not then you should do some research on their employment historythere are always ways implemented ingame to deal with asshats hell corp member fires on you against your will kick him from corp before you pop then your good little friends at concord will deal with him if you arent a director then sucks to be you and you can take it up with your superiorssorry if you arent a director or a ceo but its called hierarchy deal
do not supportmaybe a 30 minute timer instead of 15 for being an concord needs not meddle in these things
war collaborators should be flagged for the rest of the war
this
id sign this idea in its own thread if you rep someone involved in a war you should become permanently involved in that war and become a permanent target of the side fighting against the side you just aidedfor example if x corp and y alliance are at war and z player reps a member of y alliance z is now permanently aggro to x corp until the war between x and y is concludedmodify the wars tab to include wars that the player has interfered with also indicating which side they are now on and have them sent a mail by concord at the conclusion of the war so that they know their permanent aggro is gone allow members of the at war parties to see character links to players who have collaborated with the enemy as well either make collaborators show up as war targets or give them a similar tag on overview and in localleave concord out of it the less they interfere with player activities the better
so your intel was wrong your badthat is against common sense actually in most civilized countries it is illegal not to get involvedall these concepts are nothing but nonsense if a character has more friends than you no matter whether they are mains or alts it is your bad luck not his i recently helped a buddy who was being shot up even though he was no in my corp why would it be illegal for me to do that does it really make sense to you to stand by and watch while an ally gets shot up even though you could help him that is just sick getting concorded would be even sicker wardec means concord isnt watching you expect them to suddenly grow a conscience when someone steps in on one side and helps out
glad to hear that the powers that be are considering this losing drones to a minor power flicker is a major annoyance
sign
how do you get that thumb up icon if possible this suggestion has one from me tooah found itdoh
scamming is good spamming and the encouragement to spam mindless eye tricks is bad people should be rewarded for the effort of creating a good scam not able to set them up with a few clicks and a bot
i dont fully support yet evolve this a biti mentioned in the nerf local thread about how if we had delayed local in all of space we could possibly have special cov ops scan probes that could only detect cloaked ships had a maximum of 4au and were possibly faster at scanning downit would only take one probe to know if a cloaked ship or fleet existed but that one probe would have really short range so itd take time to comb a system with these probes to see if its completely clear and of course itd still take normal triangulation to actually warp to said ship maybe instead of making the probes stronger just give a hidden cloaked sig radius attribute that is like 250 pick a better number this is just an idea the normal sig radiusima keep an eye on this op i like the basic idea ill possibly support it soon keep those wheels turning
if you can see it you can lock it maybe you wont be able to lock it instantly but within 5 seconds interceptors are going to bump that cloaked vessel no support this breaks fleet intelligence and does not fix cloaked ravens as mentioned earlier
no it is not good idealeave cloaking alone as it is
i think the cloaking mechanics are fine as is
nope
i support this nonidea1i think itd be neat to see some more variety of shipsmaybe some crossfaction ships that arent just overpowered piratenavy shipslike maybe theres a gallente cruiser with a laser bonus or an amarr frigate that specializes in rockets and dronesthese would take some extra time for a character of that race to grab and when another character is training into another race it gives them a ship that they can get into sooner while also boosting the amount of visual variety in the game2i also would like to see some more faction mining ships surely ore isnt the only faction in the galaxy that mines and the mining ships for factions are complete crap maybe some comparible faction mining barges that are easier to get into but not as good as their samesized variants like an amarr mining barge that can armour tank really well can use two strippers but only gets tank and cargo bonuses and no mining bonuses or maybe theres a gallente frigate that can use 5 mining drones and a stripper with a mining drone yield bonus3yes destroyers should destroy things that are already alive not destroy wrecks somethings wrong here 
mh yeah ok then i agree a little1 what about bcs and destroyers but yes caldari could use some more rail boats come on merlin split cormy not so good moa okish ferox needs moar grid to do what its intended to do rokh one of the best ships in the game imo but then thats all some more would be nice and minmatar could use some more dedicated hp layout ships ie more ships dedicated to one weapon system and amarr could do with some ships that actually have a role other than scorch online tm gallente need some serious help and i dont mean croissants oh and yes adding t3 when t2 has become the norm maybe balancing the current set of t1 ships would be better or maybe adding some more useful t1 ships2 yes agree the current selection is a bit limited3 make more destroyers destroyers with bonuses that allow them to use medium guns maybe t2 destroyers that are more like assault ships i would love to have some of that00 and the whole sov system needs some work and yes it needs doing fast however since everyone seems locked on the idea of reinventing shoot a to remove alliance bs sov then place a in system b i dont really see the point of making any changes at allall in all supported with a few adjustments
supported though i think 10 seconds is more reasonable
no support for the opthis would eliminate one dilemma and in turn create a massively exploitable game mechanic
i cant imagine a massive exploit of not being able to shoot or be shot for a few seconds after loginso i support this i would withdraw my support if someone showed me an exploit thats worse than the current exploit of this not being implemented
i supportstation owner should be able to boot jump clones and assets should be moved to impoundedthis makes perfect sense and can keep the old alliance from having a backup reinforcement fleet ready to spawn out of your own base with ships already in hangari honestly think this makes perfect sense
we all know ppl complain about low sec in one way or another pirates hate wtz the lag etc etc fw hates the lag no rewards the pirates etc etc and the carebears hates low sec hell even the 00 guys hate low secbut there are a few out there that loves low sec with all it brings and hopefully some of those that love low sec are csm candidates so what i ask of you is to tell the rest of us your views and hopes about low secbasicly why should we overlooked low sec players vote for you
because i live in and love low sec its where i spend 99 of my time im chronically aware of the problems faced by pirates casual pvpers and industrialists operating in lowsec i conduct all three activities across my accounts i want to see more incentives to bring players to lowsec without nerfing highsec well at least not too much
low sec is an area often overlooked by ccp and players i agree that many that inhabit high sec well empire where concord response gives a degree of safety dont ventue into low sec enough it should be a testing grounds for pvppve before graduating into 00wh space alternatively its a decent area to live and earn a good income however that saidit could do with some additional content for sec players ideally something like pirate npc corps permenently at war or periodically changing dependng on player actions that players can join make content for these such as stations with pirate modules etcim sure there are many other good ideas about for improving low sec ill be looking out for such ideas once in the csmxavier hayes
i think low sec ought to have a boost i suggested an issue recently that would force people doing lowsec hauler missions to carry valuable items instead of the 1 unit of quafe they usually domostly to solve the macro hauler problem but will also boost lowsec we need to increase the rewards of lowsec to convince people that they will make more money in the end despite the danger involved going from lowsec to 00 is a rather small step but i think there needs to be more effort made towards helping players overcome taking that big step between highsec and lowsec
ive made fixing lowsec a major part of my platform with no less than three separate proposals for how to make lowsec more profitable and betterpopulated nothing directly to boost pirates but pirates will gain enough from an actual choice of targets that they dont need any direct boosts just a vibrant lowsec to prey on ultimately lowsec needs to be better than highsec at pretty much everythingthough not as much better as 00 is in order to compensate for the increased risk in some ways it is already  l5 missions bring people in fw brings people in faster line times at npc labs gets people moving stuff in and the moon minerals while nothing like 00 alliance income can also bring in a decent amount that said lowsec missioning is not as wellsupported as highsec lowsec mining is a bad joke and not much of the other content seems to bring people out either i dont want it to be overbalanced or to have people abandoning 00 for the mad profits of lowsec but it should be a place where corps who cant hack in in 00 can still go get their feet wet and have some higherrisk higherreward fun
i have been an advocate of fixes in low sec from the begining of my csm focus a lot of the out of band conversations directy with ccp in iceland was about how we can improve the low sec experiencebasically low sec is not correctly balanced in terms of riskreward and needs a revampissler
i think the current issue ishisec cool beans mission mid ends from refined loots high ends from drone missions mine trit labs etc etclowsec mission for more lp than highsec and maybe get ganked mine mid ends lol i can mission for that stuff do exploration i can get that stuff in hisec if i look hard enough i can build caps jump freightersno risknullsec excellent missions in npc 00 good rats good ore good plexes can build caps in npc stations or outpostsright now theres not enough to set lowsec apart from 00 or indeed lowsec apart from hisec right now there needs to be some sort of compelling reason for the average player who isnt into pos reactions or building caps for venturing into lowsec bs rats were a good start but really it needs expanding on i would like to see all t1 meta 1 loot removed from missions and a good deal of the ice removed from hisec after all its capitals and poses that use ice and these are mainly lowsec00 things that use these but am well aware of the knock on effect this will have we all hate our chinese brothers who mine 237 in the ice belts but praise them for our cheap isotopes but yes perhaps it is time for a change
i do quite a bit of low sec exploration and i like the added danger without the hassle of 00 politics but i have to agree with larkonis right now there isnt a whole lot of benefits to going to low sec versus the isk alternatives of 00 ill be honest and admit that i dont know how it could be improved but id love for low sec to be more than just the bit between 00 and high sec
move the positive quality level 4 agents to low sec giving people who want to make more isk have to take a risk while making it it would increase the traffic into low sec making pirates happier even the the majority of isk makers would rather stick in high sec doing the crappier quality agents but more will venture overall to 00 also gives pirates a better ability to make isk and fix security status on their off time if they decide to make one of these systems their home
whats your stance on the mwdcloak situation especially the gimping of recons and cov ops thats currently happening on sisi are you for or against any changes to this tacticbugwhat are your ideas in regards to small gang impact on sovereinty is this is the wrong thread to ask stuff
its something that should have stopped a long time ago and finally is ccp needs to figure out a better way to allow coverts and recons to do it tho under the current sov system  none but as ccp are currently working on a new sov system ill wait to see where they are heading and if it needs ideas for small gang combat then suggest as appropriateask away
i shall be voting for you despite that growth on your chin and inherent gheyllenteness
hello omber you have my votes anyway but what do you think about current volume limit on courier contracts also do you think that standings made with social skills should count for brokers fee reductioncheers

compared to other races of the same ship class people generally dont use naglfars or minmatar battleships in fleets unless their skills force them to in sniper battleship fleets minmatar do the worst damage at long range nobody recommends that you train minmatar carrier over amarr or gallente carrier etc
i have been playing eve long enough to understand the diversity of this game i understand the issues that many players address from sovereignty in null space to alliance logistics in hi sec i know without a doubt that heartstone will fully address and assemble solutions that are in the best interest for allmy votes for heartstone
voted for heartstone i think he will make an excellent csm representative
it is a very critical period for many aspects of eve gameplay in the next six months  faction warfare and 00 revamp right at the top of the agenda its important that we have candidates on the csm that understand faction warfare and what needs to be done to improve and enhance this area of gameplay  just as its vital that the interests of small unit pvp and raiding playstyle is represented in the new ideas for sovereignty development as a result i fully support heartstones candidacy and would advise anyone currently wanting ccp to pay more attention to faction warfare and small unit combat to cast their vote in this direction
you see redsplat the csm will never be able to design game changes for ccp consequently ccp has repeatedly asked the csm to comment on the larger picture of where we would like to game to be developed i know that has already led to frustration where the csm is called a pr gag of ccp to keep the gamers in linegiven this landscape i would be highly satisfied if we could incentivize ccp to talk about radical changes in the game they have gotten more and more conservative and cautious as the game has grown in the recent past once we have started talking about bringing pilots out of empire space they will have their own ideas where we can then again intervene and shapeif you want to hear a radical idea of mine the security status is today much too artificial it should not be a cause but a consequence look at my concord refactoring idea if the sec status is just showing how many marshals are around and not triggering any stupidly automated npc police then a well organized pirate force could bring even luminaire down to 01 hearstone i must admit that i am already happy when ooc remarks stay out of my corp chat and that we have abolished tendencies of colleagues to bring alts into the company or even to have an alt at all i am not too familiar with the history if not published in the more popular capsuleer news casts since 105 i admit im basically reading the scope you are running as well for the office i am looking forward to discussing backstory impact more regarding the future not so much clearing past contradictions with you regardless of both of us one or none is finally elected
going over this thread i am reading all posts with a heavy sense of ambiguity ill recognize that ankh has been very prolific towards both ccp as well as theeve community as a whole whether a concerted effort of all csm members or bygrace of her tenaciousness alone she did manage to push through the skill queuewhich has turned out to be a very popular and much appreciated feature so in thatlight i would say that im happy to have voted for her in the last election however and i will largely be addressing my misgivings here concerning mylittle corner of the eve sandbox i find both her and your addressing of fw issueshighly suspect with anks unsuccesful bid to introduce even a modicum of change andnothing but vague intentions on your end i am beginning to suspect take care onlyincludes fw as an issue in order to garner votes from a sizeable part of the evedemographic ankhs activity in fw has been limited to advertising her csm campaign and brieflymaking a cameo during a ccp event in which she promptly switches sides in the hopesof attaining a ccp issued medal though her ingame loyalties are not for anyone toscrutinize one would have hoped that  at the very least  she would have takenthis opportunity to gauge popular opinion in both militias she has partaken inno such thing happened however and in spite of many of the more heavily involved corps trying to get their viewpoints across to ccp she never showed any effort to acquaint herself with these issues let alone represent themnow you are asking for the votes of those that partake in fw advertising yourself asbeing the only one who has fw on the agenda but by my estimation your credentials onthis are even worse than ankhs do you have eyes and ears in all the militias do youknow what the common issues are or what people have proposed to change this if so canyou more carefully delineate your propositions if only to show you in fact have your finger on the pulse of fwkind regardsanwar
i understand the vagaries of the csm i just wanted to get some kind of idea what you thought the big picture was as you have been keeping quiet on a number of issuesregardless you have a vote incoming from my alt i am despite what you might think interested in a balanced eve and thus a balanced csmthat said i may have misjudged whom is going to win seats and everyone is going to be lumbered with a carebear monopoly on the csm

meowr vote for vuk
vote vuk lau for presid erm  csm 
vuk has my vote
you got all my votes
voting booths have opened and im right there at the top easy to vote for also a slight update to my website i had a whole lot of ideas to add but i seemed to forget them to moment i look at the websites content management system 
there have been half a dozen threads already
i too will vote for one of the candidates that takes fw issues seriouslyin particular i also want system occupancy to give some advantage to members of the militia in that system it dosent have to be huge if i get say 5 shields  armor in every minamatar occupied system thats greatalso make the militia store operate on victory points and give militiaspecific items they dont have to be better then the faction ones just different so we have something to aim for and be excited about
ankhesentapemkah i agree ccp do need to adjust their mindset regarding fixing the many shortcommings of factional warfare there are many threads that capture the specifics the op dex on this thread has mentioned a number key areas that need to be fixed fast if as you say ccp are interested in launching new content to obtain additional subscriptions for percieved profitability then this sounds like flawed logic and short sightedness surely a subscription saved is of equal value to a subscription gained over time i have seen many pilots come and go from the fw ranks and id say roughly half of those that depart unsubscribe their accounts while the other half explore other facets of eve we the fw players have a right to a standard of service from ccp as paying subscribers who every month make a decison to vote with our real life cash to support the product i and a large number of the fw pilots are looking for a csm candidate who will hold ccp accountable to their commitment to build and develop the fw game content we are looking for a candidate that will lobby and passionately represent a shift of focus from introducing any new content until the existing content issues are fixed csm candidates there are likely thousands of votes on offer on the fw content all votes that are free from the usual alliance  00 political voting lines we could be the marginal voters that make or break your election campaign voters that will respond favorably to a candiadte representing fw are comprised of all current fw content players plus the many who have either left or avoided the broken content and would like to experience the thrills of pvp on demand that fw does offer give us a candidate we can confidently endorse and we will give you our votes and our trust to represent our community
yup its herschel and omber which represent the two most sensible candidates fortunately we can vote with each of our accounts so theyre both getting my vote 
vote larkthe answer is yarrrrrss
be sure to get your votes in guys 
hey thanks for addressing my post youre right i didnt check your employment history when i logged in so i suppose i had that coming that being said when i apply for a job i usually list my previous applicable employment and references on my resume not just that i worked at mcdonalds one summer when i was 15 and then hope that the interviewer asks for other references
vote for iceblock and get rid of poskilling gangs once and for all
done and got some votes for you in my alliance too
is this some kind of false advertising to get votesfrom another threadand the reason web was changed was the nano nerf and people complained to die in web range to easy unfortunaly many people donUFFFDt understand the real meaning of web range for blasterships that have not billion isk tanks and 90 faction webs like in the fancy vid you refered to also mwding in range donUFFFDt hurts it is the basic thing that seperates blaster ships from others and should be her main drawbackand we allready have preaty deacend lasers for people that donUFFFDt like this to low damage to keep up with the heavy tanks of today and a to weak web to hold down and hit your target on the other hand actualy are problems that are very realthe problems of solo blaster ships that fighting in blaster range
good luck on your application and now a list of my peeves hehefor drone options but good for other menushave the option to disable or hide certain menu items like abandon drones vs ordering drones to return to drone bay they are right next to each other and so easy to accidentally choose the wrong one in the heat of battle sure it asks if we are sure but then u gotta hunt down the no button then redo what u wanted to do losing very precious timesomething to remove the ctrlq logout exploit maybe if we send a tell to a person in local even if they dont accept some sort of timer beginslarger asteroids on respawn day kinda lame that roids dont fill at least a canmedium webber drones maybe an option to rename our chars game can show name history like employment history but how many of us have alts that have names we like but cant use because we didnt think of it and our mains are to high to changean option not to be ejected from a station when we undock going uber speeds takes freakin forever to get my orca to slow and align in the right direction for warpage prob same for capital sized ships etcbeing able to align to bookmarks if i have a station bookmarked i cant align to it
vote early vote often
bump and vote for me
a bump and a shout outthanks to eveyone that has contacted me directly with your support i am definitiely still in the running and committed to the values i have stated previously my alliance recently experienced two wars back to back and it renewed my commitment to focusing on making wars have more defined purpose and clearer rules for declaration and definition of what constitutes winningi hope the bears of eve will support me in my run for a second term in the csm i hope i can continue to offer ccp the feedback that the pveindustrialcasualmissioningsolosmall corporationnonpirate players of eve would give in a manner that keeps eve a great experience for the full range of pilots in the verseissler
could the csm candidates please also state what they think should be done instead if this tactic gets killed off since the inception of cloaks and thus the mwdcloak trick remote sensor boosted hics have been introduced and wcs have become extremely crap and useless anyway  see hics the current system is balanced if you have semi competent decloaker bumper in your lame low sec campedit btw the domi example sounds pretty unlikely i think he got lucky with the random you fail to target nothing locking bug that happens quite often a full inertiaed domi still needs 5 seconds to get in warp a 1000 scan res hic should lock it no worries unless you get the locking bug
gatecamping is boring i dont like giving people more reasons to do italso this takes away one of the few ways interdictors have of surviving past one bubble in a fleet fightbesides incredible luck and i generally dont like having valid tactics taken away from us
the god awful new player experience was also conveniently neglected by the csms just like last election and the election before that
just wondering what if you have any is your take on missions and do you have any ideas to present to ccp many of us believe that they need a bit more substance to kill some of that repeatitive feeling you get grinding them out i think storylines need to be more drawn out and in depth making you really feel connected with the corp you running them for what do you guys think
i think a full roll out of the epic arc mission system would add a lot in terms of immersion to the mission running side of eve i spoke to a dev involved in them at the fanfest last year and if what he described as the plan for them wasnt 100 alcohol induced i think we shall see some marvelous things from it if it ever does reach the light of tranquility it is certainly something i would like to seewhilst i do have a few ideas of my own in regards to missions i wouldnt raise them with ccp without consultation with the playerbase so i will post them later on the sister forum to this but to give an idea one of the main things i am in favour of looking at is dynamic agent quality based on player usage of said agent
i guess this issue i raised might make hauler missions more interesting
i believe there are already some exciting new missions in the works ccp wanted to get the new mission infrastructure in place and now that it is i know they are bus working on new and exciting mission contentissler
thismazz has hit the nail right on the head herei still believe eve is a pvp game by all means go and mission for isk but too many people are penalized for taking this route early on and digging themselves deeper and deeper into the hole that is negative faction standing there is currently no way to recover this beyond certain skills and they only delay the inevitableref epic mission arcs i havent had the chance to try them thanks to my terrible sec but i have heard good things i would like to see more involvement by ccp and perhaps a reintroduction of the aurora team albeit with massive oversight giving the average bod more involvement in the day to day politics and functions of the universea new expansion is out the slaves are free wat id like to see the players affect the story of the universe a lot more
can do hadnt really put the schedual together properly theyll all be up by next monday will that work
yeah thats halfway through voting but i suppose you dont want to just spam your own blog with another 20 of them that should be fine
just gonna resurrect this thread cos its made by my internet lover lana 3 3 3 3
she didnt run i was so disappointed
tara alt spotted
and you heartstone and thanks for the responses to all of you
a corpmate asked about this issue at evevegas this past weekend and it seems the devs said flat out that alliances will never be allowed into fwhow very disappointing
seems we were missed in 12  can everyone thats supporting this topic please get there friends to support it as well maybe it needs to hit a certain ammount of pages before ccp pay attention
ok now that csm elections have begun maybe if a candiate who would like several hundred votes might like to step forward and support this as well
wang jing is making some really solid points here that i think will provide a boost to the afs of all races without destoying either game balance or ship rolesas a minnie pilot i agree wholeheartedly with the proposed addition of the rifters tracking bonus and a swtich in the optimalfalloff bonuses atm i tend to fly a jag fitted as tough tackle as someone mentioned above which is great fun useful just very dissapointing when i cant orbit at speed and hit for  due to poor trackingi wouldnt argue that the jag or wolf needs any dps boost other than the improved hit ratezos
yep my thoughts exactly even though they put out less dps than some of their counterparts minmatar ships should be able to use the flexibility of their weapon systems combined with their natural speed to compete for example when fighting an enyo with a wolf you need to get out to 5 or 6 km where the falloff you gain with barrage ammo allows you to outdamage him on the otherhand a harpy or retribution will still cause you problems at this range and so you should be able to get in tight and outtrack them unfortunately this simply does not work without a tracking bonus
i also want to mention that since assault ships are getting a nerf to agility this coming patch giving them a boost is all the more essential
sigh too right they will struggle to get past camps with a proper tackler after the patch and that is a huge nerf
definetely useful especially if you can designate certain wallet divisions for certain tasks such as seperate areas for buysell orderssupportedem
i am all for it since i do the trading for my corp and often given isk to pick up items for individuals when out and about makes it easier to track that way

as it is now motherships are more like faction carrier if we compare megathron to vindicator for example  while little better vindi is much more priceyso indeed  motherships need to be given own unique role to make them useful again i dont think they should become solopwnmobiles like they used to be but something totally different

would be nice if you could save your primary orbit and maintain distance numbers to the ship fitting profile so you dont have to reset it when you switch out weapon systems
still supporting this
as i recall it was fleet motd  but the principle is still the same its a good and useful idea and needs to happen ccp need to be reminded of these things term to term i support motds for corpalliance and fleet channels
was wondering about this the other day as it happens and why we never put corp ops into a motd obviously it cant be donebe good if it couldzos

fof missiles anyone
heres a brilliant idea disable it for fof missiles not that you cant already use drones for the exact same purpose in missions its not like lasers arent already the best weapon systems by a wide margin giving autofire after reload to missilesprojectileshybrids would hardly change that
looks like we get a fix people go fly your nagls this weekend tell me how they fair
yes yes yes oh god please yesin case anyone hadnt noticed im fully in favour of this idea
theres nothing that cant be improved in this game by ccp banning the right ten per cent of its players  not that many of us will agree which ten percentdefinitely worth a try
one click and win from drone salvagingcan understand the afk but then againwe have them nowso whats going to changethe iskie spammers even now spam local yes ccp blocks thembut they just start another 14 day account and start overwithout the slaves the pvp players wouldnt have those toysso givea little respect

i support it if the base lvl 0 jump time cooldown would be longer and that advanced infomorph psychology at iv would make it at 24 hours or something similar maybe lvl v would make it 18 hours
wowyou can actually come up with a rational idea shockingbut yes id give up jump cloning for good if that was available as an option
but yes id give up jump cloning for good if that was available as an optioni support this  the ability to switch out of implants combined with the removal of jump clones
i dont support the op but i even less support thisyoure stupid to think they need to be nerfdif anything they do need a couple boosts in a couple areas mamas need the ability to let jump clones jump out and a few other minor changesthis removes the whole point of implants
a solid and intelligent arguement youve turned my opinion around entirely
how do you figure thatimplants come in various sizes and flavors and do all sorts of stat changesyour still likely to get blown up still likely to spend piles of isk for themstill likely to lose them upon deathso i fail to see what the problem is in the logicor are you just trying to trollepic fail if thats the case
thisa report and block function would be even more handy
wouldnt surprise me if ccp is being blackmailedlike pay us a zillion yuans or usd or we will keep spamming till there is no tomorrowi feel bad for the people in the newb corp who apparantly have to deal with monotonous isk spam every 30 second  it shouldnt be a csm issue though but perhaps they could push for getting some comments from ccp about the prospect of dealing with isk spammers
id obviously like this to get fixed but im not sure what the solution is having someone in channel who can channelblock them would helpbe they a paid gm or an isd volunteer having rightclick reporting would help but macroing together trial accounts to spam with is too easy for eradication to be possible the best overall solution is probably making sure new players know about plex and that they can buy isk legally instead of having to do it illegally yeah you might get twice as much but its not a deal if you lose all that money to ccp caching you
isk selling is one of the few things that actual gets under my nerves in this game so yeah i agree that ccp needs to overall need to watch it better but even more so in the newbie corp channels i think that perhaps one way to do this would be first add a right click option for reporting isk selling spam then automated counter would alert a gm after so many reports gm could check chat records to see if they were spamming and then bring down the ban hammer
titans costing billions hasnt stopped anyone from ninjaddding overpowered with relatively low risk leads to whoring in selective circumstances leading to virtually no vulnerability and total exploitation at least the nanotitans finally got nerfedagreedi get it now there have been a lot of posts about subcap anticaps and lots of angry responses about how this is nothing more than a fairy tale luke skywalker hull this is more like putting a flock of luke skywalkers into the hands of a ms pilot though so the circle of insanity is complete at the capital level and as far as blowing up fighter clouds first of all you have remote ecm burst and second of all anything that blows up fighter clouds like this will have an even more devastating effect on support fleets which have larger sigs than fightersi see how youre trying to enforce support fleets as an essential part of eve by necessitating them through the anticapital threat but doing it via a capital tool isnt the way when you look at subcap combat the reason why its not always about who fits for the best speed dps and tanking etc is because of ewar mixing things up right ewar makes the wrong gang mixup a total loss what we need are better recons that focus on capspersonally id like to see mss get some kind of really nice uplink mod that could be activated on a logistics to turn it into a motherphocking awesome logistics d would see layered spidering and more elaborate fleet organization uplinked ms feeds 8 logistics a constant supply of cap armor and shield to let them do their thing with higher scan res and more individualized loving
while i agree with you almost completely every time ccp suggests a subcap cap killer you get hordes of cap pilots who dont like their 2b isk ship being killed by 23 100m isk ships
subcap cap killers always go the wrong direction by and large none of the stuff i threw down in my idea for upscale recons would result in capital death directly therefore they are not cap killers and you still need a lot of isk in ships and pilots cap or subcap to do the killing parti mean if you increase turret cap you can cause a relatively low intelligence moros or rev pilot to burn up their defensive cap the antispidertriage mods would undoubted affect the survivability of lone carriers and carrier groups but the siegemod damage reduction would provide a way to respond by gimping the heavy hitters in cap fights thus lowering the overall damage flow anywayanticap force multipliers of the upperechelon subcap price point i think would be a fair solution for everyone that would really add a lot of unpredictability to large scale combat as well as adding more need for tacklers and recons to both aid and intercept those force multipliers
ccp is about to release the new patch to change citadel torpedoes but they arent changing explosion velocity the thing that actually needs to be fixed is being ignoredccp stop being ridiculous and fix explosion velocity on citadels or at least tell us what your reasoning is for not fixing them now it only requires you to change 1 numbercmonend the speed tanking motherships
i havent seen anything like this here in the assembly hall so correct me if im wrong braces for incoming not another one of these threads plzkthx trollsread this very wonderful post by the great mittani
good writeup of the festivitiesit was actually a lot of fun brainstorming this with mittens and the others at the table we definitely saw a need to make losec different not just more lucrative in order to lure people there and make them staypersonally my favorite idea from the session was corrupting the docking manager and bribing him to extend the redock timer on some stationhuggers ship by say 60 seconds
if theres something eve really needs its a methnaught p
lol lol yeahand i liked the idea of directing npcs and sentriesmaybe even have the ability to pay npcs for more defense in the system note that this defense will just be rats which are a lot easier than players but could possibly come in swarms memories of one of the few mechanics i actually enjoyed in sins of a solar empire paying off npc pirates and having them attack the lowest bidderi really like this post a lot and it would help greatly in making lowsec more funcouple this with my topic about pirate fw with pirate bases being in 00 lowsec turns into a very dangerous battleground full of drug runners privateers faction warfare and pirate interference
if you look at the apocrypha trailer the ui is much cooler looking i personally think eve should have a more futuristicholographic ui just look at the map scene and you will see what i am talking abouti really wish the ui provided more information on random stuff maybe if you have a ship scanner it would work like the trailers scanner did a 3d ship image popped up and the different modules were identified and you could click on them this could also be utilized in the fittings areai know this isnt a pressing issue but i think it would add more cool to the gameif not this then please allow custom uis made by other people i know we all hate wow but my cousin plays it and the custom uis that some people have made are pretty nifty they allow you to see information the way you want it to be seenagree with me or let the flaming begin
i support this though i really like the ui how it isthe only reasons i support this are1 as much as i love the ui how it is its not very intuitive and a lot of things that should look cooler do not like scanning for instance a perfect example my friend2 people might argue the need for speed clause i disagree for this would be 100 clientside maybe even have the option for classic ui for the old schoolers that like the current look like myself now yall have nothing to complain about gtfoi would love to see a ship scanning animation or maybe when you use a survey scanner a pulse goes out from your ship with dx9 and highlights all the roids it hits for a half a second for looks not for use you get all the info you need from the scanner itselfor maybe a codebreaker brings up a password roller that goes while the codebreaker is on again purely asthetic or an analyzer could actually act like it was analyzing the object scanning different parts of it and whatnotthis is a much unneeded change but i fully support it happening
so tired of opening the igb minimizing it doing something else for 34 minutes and checking to see if anything has loaded yet oh and if i thoughtlessly try to browse to another page before the current one has loaded the browser does not stop loading the current page even if i tell it to it loads the current page then starts to load the next one though from an earlier comment made here it appears that i may be wrong in that impression and it just takes the browser that long to render a page which is really scary since most page i go to have no graphics just text and links no way in hell it should take that long to render a page full of textigb didnt used to be this slow by any means i dont know what changed but if ccp thinks this was an improvement someone needs a brain scan seriouslyedit punctuation and support
actually who knows maybe m is the solution here internet explorer 10 would be a massive upgrade and its probably cheap these days
please lets not bring ie into the mix thats all we need is a world of security issues dropped on eve online headi realize its an improvement but lets be rational about this
ok i take back my statement as long as its ia superold ie build i dont mind  wait a minute yes i do but i agree itd be better than what we have right now
how about just an option in the settings to open links in the default system browser or the igb eve already does this with all the links on the login page
that makes sense id like to have control as to what kind of crap comes flying into my computer other than eve itself
without doubt it makes no sense that if ive filtered out showing friendlies i sure do not expect their drones to show up when im trying to shoot enemy dronesit seems strange as the drones already hold the corp tag of the user so why does this not seem to be taken into account in the overview for militia and fleet memberssupported with a loud jumping around arms waving person

this should be in jita parkme gags on stench
as seen by the dramatic increase in bomb usage the mutiple changes introduced by ccp recently regarding stealth bomber abilities and bomb costs have been very succesfull the considerable volume of the bombs is well justified as a game balance feature to make firing bombs a tactical choice rather then just spamming them at every opportunitythis is however severely limiting the ability of bombers to carry the void and lockbreakers in addition to their standard racial damage type a typical bomber carries two bombs in the launcher and two spares in the cargohold in this setup it is not possible to switch ammo types as the two bombs need to be moved to the cargo first and that is not possible the restrictions in reloading requiring the jettisoning of bombs which has a timer affects the ability to cloak and creates a warp to point could easily be avoided by changing the way reloading worksas it is now the ammo is first moved from the weapon to the cargohold and then the new ammo goes into an unknown parallel dimension while the reload timer is running to appear back in our reality once loading finishedif the ammo present would also be able to utilize this tear in the space time continuum it could first be moved out of the launcher only to appear in the cargohold once the ammo being reloaded had also left that space
loli support the op but this through my head on a tangentwhy not make bombs work more slightly differentlymaybe you put empty bombs in your launcher and cargohold and have warheads that you can put in these bombs that take up very little spacethis would allow you to change damageutility easily without making it easier for people to have more bombs or changing the size of utility bombs
why not give the bomber a bomb rack or separate hold for the bomb ammo not loaded in the launcher this would eliminate the ammo issues i agree but with a bit of tweeking we could really go out on a limb and request a rig mod for bombers only to make this possible have the rig affect the speed similar to a hull expander in the low slots
no support for this if you want to fight someone start shooting who care about the concorduken
this feature is already in game get out of hisec
not supportedyes the mechanics to fight someone in high sec are a little indirect but they exist none the less and require trustdont trust your opponent to honor a 1v1 dont fight him or have a backup plan when he does bring friendsalthough i wont lie i wouldnt mind an arena to bet on matches  duels personally i think there should be more gambling in the eve universe
the current mechanics for 1v1 are nigh nonexistent both the current mechanic and the proposed require trusti dont know about the op but i am not looking for an arena i am looking for the ability to fight friends in highsec without concord intervention and without some stupid killrights exploit just to have a fightwith consensual combat you could have fleet battles even purely for fun with your noncorp buddiesthe least ccp could do is bring back free friendly fire in fleetlet me shoot my noncorp fleetmates if you agree to be in fleet you agree to have no issues with people blowing you upsure people can whine about how lame it was that they got cond into a mission squad that ganked their ship mid mission and looted their deadspace fit raven this is part of that whole dont do it if you dont trust them thing also called not being a freaking moron
that must be a highsec mentality i can tell you then when i fleet up with my mates the last thing im thinking is that they are going to shoot at me i fly in nullsec and fleets are for allies and friends
please ask ccp to immediately halt this nerf until larger discussion with the players can take place this has the potential to seriously unbalance the game and shift things even more towards blob warfare and gatecamping than they already are at minimum if this goes through then the cov ops cloak should allow ships to ignore bubbles please do something before small gang and solo pvp gets even more hosed
please explain or better yet provide a link that explains what youre talking about
hey chicken little or little chickenhow about providing a link or proof before screaming the sky is falling ehmoronsps i scoured the boards currently there are no ccp stickied or marked topics talking about this crap so unless theres proof theres no credence to this
patch notes
and how does this affect cloaksall i see is a rebalance of lock on times for ships which honestly is a good thingshould make things a bit more interesting for a changenow if your complaining over a glitch that being the mwd cloak trick please get a backbone manits a glitch i never used it anyway and i seem to do fine without it
im guessing he means item 4 under modules if a ship cloaks all active modules that modify attributes such as ecm will stop immediately and the icons showing the effect will disappearwhile ecm is used for the example this would affect that one cycle of mwd or ab that people use while cloaking to get away from camps this would be a pretty hefty boost to gate camps especially bubble camps i wasnt aware bubble camps needed a boost
it was never a boost or a nerf to begin withfor people who use cov ops cloaks its a waste of time to debateyour going to warp anyway in the case of an dict bubble your still going to cloak and have full throttlenow if your flying a big assed ship well what did you expectstandard cloaks are ineheritly dangerous due to the inability to fly away at top speed minus abmwd and warp awaygate campers have whinedcomplained bed nonstop about iti feel this is a good compromise to get them to stfu o pthis also encouages teamwork scouting parties and what notthis isnt the end of the world as we know it
the problem is a brute force change intended to counter falcon pilots now at much closer ranges to their targets doing the uncloak  jam 1 cycle  recloak thing has eliminated the 1 reason people fly 4 classes of ships in 00reconscovopsblockade runnersstealth bombersif you jumped into a large anchored bubble or dictor camp in a covopscloak fitted ship you simply moved off in a random direction and got 1 free cycle of your mwd to coast out of the nowarp zone a smart player could usually get away from the gate although some luck was still involved if the campers had good interceptor pilots now if you jump into a dictor camp your choice is 1 fight your way out or 2 hope you can make it back to the gate coincidentally this is the same choice noncovops cloak ships havei want my skillpoints from recon v transferred to hac v please
here come the tearsi fly blockade runners honestly i dont see what the big deal isi never needed the mwd trick i just cloak before anyone can spot me
not supportedcloak shouldnt use active modules its part of what cloaking is all about if you want to target uncloaksure if they can do this it gives them more usebut delayed local is a much better way to keep cloaking useful allowing ships to do something that doesnt make sense well doesnt make sensemaybe theyll add a cov ops ecm down the line or something but dont hold your breathas for mwd cloak glitch interference from your cloak does not allow you to use this module or interference from your propulsion does nont allow you to use your cloaking module these seem to sum it up i dont know why you can glitch and get an mwd on while cloaking but it doesnt make any sense
drake you are right that noncloaky ships battleships for example should not be able to use the cloak warp trickbs should not be able to escape interceptors at gate camps recons blockade runners cov ops and bombers on the other hand are absolutely hosed by this these are the ships that are supposed to scout which means they need to be survivable their cloak is a big part of their survivability as is their ability to quickly move away from their last known location so that they dont get decloakedbut the really big thing is that ccp never discussed this change with the players it appears as though they have given very little thought into the wider consequencesnamely the fact that they have just given a buff to blobs with jump bridges how for instance are black ops supposed to get into a system if one cant reliably insert a cyno pilotthe solution to this is fairly simple ships with a cov ops cloak fitted should be allowed to ignore bubbles gate campers get their cloak nerf cloaky pilots dont get the shaft everyone is happy
you dont live in 00 do you
i agree this is pretty suckyi want my cloaking skills changed to something more useful now
last i checked you could cloak in a bubble as long as you arent too close to the emitterif you cant cloak in a bubble then that needs to be fixedtheres also no reason a cov ops ship should be able to ignore a bubblethe reason ccp didnt talk to anyone about it is because it was an unintended glitch that didnt have a place in the game stop whining about how much youre going to miss your exploitsbtw i fly a blockade runner and a stealth bomber live in 00 and never had a problem and last time i ran through a bubble last i remember i didnt have a problem cloaking on my way to the gateso many cov ops pilots feel they should have everything given to them its really disheartening to the people that are actually good at flying said cov ops ships
if this is an alt you are posting on i am going to ask to be forgiven for what followsyou have one kill and 17 losses on battleclinic losses are all pretty much low sec losses of drakes and caracals however two of those losses are manticores one of which was lost to a pilot from empire blobs you corp the irony is killing me right nowagain i apologise if this is an alt you are posting on but please comment on what you seem to be publicly qualified to comment upon rather than offering ill informed opinionson topic this change worries me a lot since i just trained into a rapier so i could enjoy solo roaming and enjoy the scouting role too my anticipation is that reconscovopsbombersblockade runners operating in 00 will feel this pretty hardall of these ships rely upon a cloak as their principal defense for sure however the ability to swiftly move away from the last known location is vital to making that cloak work effectively if you cannot move away from the spot you cloaked with some reasonable degree of rapidity then the cloak essentially becomes a mute point due to rapid decloaking at the hands of a half decent fast ship pilotfurther i am unsure on how this delay to mwd after cloak works but if true then a recon that is decloaked has no way to even run away or to the gateseems pretty scary that four ship classes become sitting ducks in a bubble with one changeall that is bad enough but the real issue for the csm here at least in my eyes is ccps lack of communication regarding the changes either proactively or in response to player posts raising the issue noticed on sisi no dev blog no response to questions no response in the threads today a very poor service and with such large implications for gameplay it is something that should not have been ignored
wow i love how people think when someone disagrees with them its obviously an alt how about a nonalt perspective i think the change is fine it gets rid of the exploitbug in the game and actually forces some player skill at avoiding gatecamps why do people think that they should be able to solo everything in this game so your ship got nerfed its not going to affect players who actually had some skill and will be able to avoid the gatecamps as for myself ill still be flying these ships ccp never intended for these ships to last forever which btw ive only lost one the 2nd one has survived countless gatecamps qq more emoragequit the game ill still be here isaacps currently thread has no supportsinterestingppss fit some speed mods in the lows
you dont use your brain before you post do youcry some moar
i think maybe you missed the pointwhen a player makes a post on a character it is often useful to evaluate the validity of their opinion based on information available from killboards eg battleclinic if someone offers an opinion on a shiptype they have never flown or flown very little and in circumstances different from those on which they comment it is reasonable to assume their opinions are not based on experiencetherefore i offered an apology up front if it was indeed an alt post and the pilot may well have experience on another character posting on that character would cast a whole different light on the validity of their opinion however if it was not then i think the point stands in relation to the pilot offering opinions on a subject they have little or no exprience ofmuch like asking for a medical opinion on an internet forum i am pretty sure you would check that the offerer of a diagnoses was in fact qualified to do soa perfectly rational and reasonable evaluation of validityas regards your qq emo rage quit cry more posts well maybe try offering a considered and thought out contibution to the discussion
think about this before you start griping peoplethe point of a cloak is to cloak not to be abused or to sneak in a shot or to speed past gate campsits to be not seen and give you the chance to evade detectionthere are risks for too long people have endeveroured to find that one little gtlich or one little bit of edgeccp says no moreend of discussiondont like it gtfoi for one cannot find a single argument to declare there decision wrongso demanding to be heard is like asking for whine rightsi have to ask to what point to say you cant get through gate campsguess what they say they cant stop you anymorewhile im in favor of evading gate camps i am not in favor of disruption of balance or mechanicsso forgive me for labeling you an idiot if you cant see that
when you start giving us considered and well thought out posts ill start but like every person who hates people that dont agree with them you automatically assumed it was an alt or someone with no experience last i checked assume  ass out of me and u isaacps thread is derailed get off this damn subject of who is who get back to the main problem and quit attacking other people the cloaking abilityloss is fine with me ill still fly the ships i have yet to see another problem with this nerf other than it nerfs the ability to escape gatecamps thats not enough reason to notnotnerf this issue why you may ask its because there is more than one way to escapeavoid a gatecamp even in a covops
actually no this is a reactivated pretrinity character back when kill mails were in evemail and i have and this is not my blockade pilot i will admit this is my main my blockade pilot is my altand fixing a bug without announcing its existence in my honest opinion is a perfectly excusable thing that ccp did theyve done this hundreds of times before hell most mmo devs interact with the playerbase even less so show some respect for a company that is as active as ccpwe dont need discussion on something that was broken getting fixedif you think your ships are now sitting ducks then we should suggest better solutions than keeping an exploit ingame
i really wouldnt classify mwd then cloaking as an exploitthe problem with this change is that it has been in the game for years and has been well known as with the thread in the game development forum there has been alot of reasons why this is a bad thing to implementthe main ones being it encourages gate camping and reduces further the option of solo roaming no one is asking for a iwin button as recons and covops can be killed at present with a skilled frigate or inty pilot to decloak someone in a bubblenot allowing the mwd to cycle in addition to a 3 second delay after decloaking and faster locking times just doesnt give someone a chance to escape of course if you like the direction that brings jump through a gate and watch yourself lose a shipor get a second account and get the noob alt killed and come back with a bigger blob than is sitting on the gate great stuff not
thank you for qualifying your opinion with a little backgroundlet us assume that for the sake of argument the mwdcloak mechanic is an exploit if indeed it were to be measured as such then i agree it should not be kept in the game and better solutions found however to simply remove it without finding any better solutions effectively nerfs whole classes of ships and styles of gameplay and that is rather game breaking
fixing an exploit first before it becomes a problem and then discussing a solution seems pretty viable to mei do agree that those ships need more work but keeping an exploit before they get something new seems more realistic i also dont think cov ops cloak should avoid bubbles but its a definite start on this discussion and i approve the direction but i think ecm ships need a lot more work still stealth bombers still need some work too but they are starting to have a real role other than the solo pvp lolz they used to have

guys i have good newsin the apocrypha 12 patch they state teh following in the patch noteschanges to shader textures and modelling will no longer put excessive stress on older graphics cards this means they will no longer overheat while players are docked in a stationnow i hope that will solve our problem a little or all gamma correction would be a good thing too 
not trying to be ungrateful i respect ccp for making an effort i just hate to see wasted effort the solution here was very easy and had exited in the game why not just turn it back on anyway i reserve my judgment on the update patch until i see it i hope to hell its faster then it is edit  after reviewing the patch notes i see  if load station environment escmenu  display  graphics is not checked and a player clone jumps into space to a clone vat bay the picture of the station environment will stick to the screen instead of space being shown overview and brackets will be rendered normally docking and undocking at a station or relogging the client brings back the normal space rendering to avoid this issue you can turn on the load station environment option prior to clone jumping it can then be turned back off after the jump if you likethis has lead me to believe the option to not load the station environment has been added yaythank you to everyone to supported this topic after confirmation of the patch i will request this issue be closed
locking this thread isnt a waste of time as i get paid to do it 
bump for the dayanyone else have any other thoughts towards or against this id really like to see some discussion here maybe some ideas thrown around of how this could work and possible ramifications this would have for 00i honestly see this making fw suddenly all worth it again the only reason it was worth it before was because its free pvp for people that dont want to move to 00 but right now all of that is kind of broken by the fact that everyone who does fw is either caldari who outnumber the other three races combined rarely ever actually online or in that jokeofawar minmatar vs amarrid love to see some sansha players interfering with amarr military operations in minmatar space or some caldari pushing a front to lower serpentis resourcesand the fw scoreboards could be a lot more interesting
first i dont want the old system chanded its finejsut we all know it can be cheatedthats where my idea comes into the gamei thought about an somehow additional bounty system where it would be possible to choose from a list on bounty hunters maybe some new thing like the military academyonly for bounty hunters youll need to be in it to get to the hunter liston that list the victim can choose the hunter he trusts in and offer him an contract to kill the piratethe ammount of money offered by this contract will also be added to the bounty shown at the charater sheat but it wont be possible anylonger to get killed by an alt or friend to get the moneyif you set up the bounty the old public way it will still be possible
i like the goal but whats the difference between this and hiring a mercenary
its makes the living as an merc hunte esierit makes sure that the money the victim spents will go to the merc if he kills the guy and not to the pirate or his friends
bzzzttry again nothing is stopping from someone putting a large bounty on there head and joining said merc team with an alt to collect itfeel free to be creative but you get the pointyour idea has merit but it is holier than swiss cheese
agreed the current contract system does not function like an in corp alliance marketplace shouldand corp hangers can easily be stolen fromit would be great to see this implementedsigned
well if we bring it up enough theyll have to do something about itskan
i will only support if im given the option to have discoballs and large speakers on my domi for the epic disco domi fit
all gallente ships are ugly its a racial trait favours drones and hybrid guns is good at armor tanking enjoys being ugly as sinhates green ecmis gallenteyou might as well ask for ravens to stop using missles
i use the domi all the time i even recently bought myself a sin i like them how they arei still do wait on the infested dominix
cva carebearin busy systems the scanner is pretty useless for detecting potential inbound hostiles and the result will not be that more people will be caught in belts  but that less people will be in belts to start withyou obviously do not know how to work your scanner well my friendin other words they will stay docked or in poses unless they really need to travel and when they do travel they will blob up even more than they do now to provide mutual protectionid rather this than every raven havign an i win cloak isnt caravans more what this game should have
anyone else have opinions on this
points raised here against are valid that said ceos and directors should be able to enable or disable this for the corp as a whole or it could be made a votable topic for corp politics
though i could see where this would be nice no corp would ever leave friendly fire onit just doesnt work with the eve universedont hire people you cant trust and youll be fine
umm never said i would turn it off wouldnt even consider it as one of corp rules is never go afk in space unless you are in a safe spot enforced by putting your ship into structure the first time you are caught and putting you in a pod the second
i had hoped some of the csm candidates had more spesific ideas on how to fix low sec and im also a bit sad that a lot of the established csm like vuk lau doesnt even reply to a question like thisguess it goes to show that the 00 players mostly dont give a rats ass about low sec
honestly i think low sec needs some help but i dont have any immediate solutionshowever dont you think expecting a response from all csms saying exactly what you want to hear in 28 hours from first posting is a little impatient
back in january at the csmccp meeting in iceland it was pretty much decided that the limit should be raised to the minimum freighter cargo size as that would be the least exploitable why this hasnt been implemented yet when ccp admitted it was a relatively easy solution to implement is beyond me  and it will come up for review in the 1st meeting of the 3rd csm all i can do is ask politely while holding a large stick why it hasnt happenedbroker fees are an interesting thing i still have yet to see a concrete fomrula of how they are worked out to me it makes more sense to use both actual standings derived standings skills and trader volume to figure out the fees it makes no sense to me to use a broker that refuses to give you a discount when you are pumping multiple billions of isk through his hands and you can choose to go elsewhere unfortunately those brokers have a monopoly so you have no choiceif at all possible i would love to see players acting as brokers at some point in the future of the game i think it would open up an entirely new way of playing the game for some people and add some much needed diversity to the game of course there is always the risk of that broker running off with your goods but hey this is eve
while you are at contracts can you please check out the revert contracts idea you already gave your support for id love you long time 
i already said i supported it also just so eveyone knows as it doesnt seem to have filtered through yet  csm 20 cant raise any more issues for discussion our last meeting with ccp is this weekend and as issues need a minimum of 2 weeks lead time when sent to ccp anything raised now wontcant be discussed until csm 30 starts

of course you can take many statements out of context if you chosei was discussing with a player why i was offering a chance to win stuff that particular statement was in a thread regarding the implication i was buying votes by offering the raffle my rebutal was the above statement im open about what i am doing some candidates are buying votes im not periodplease note that anyone can enter the raffle as i have no access to voters who voted me hardly briberyxavierps i am also rich ingame but give away a lot of stuff as many can atest
looks like somebody found windows movie maker
you should vote for avalloci did
please remember that youre talking to one of the biggest minmatar whiners ever to grace this game  im not disputing the comment  i was just in shock from who it came from i was going pick you for s and giggles but now thats in there its turned into a semiserious vote
i think this says it all these are some very needed changes and i think it will take level headed people to help guide and direct from a player aspect of the game i voted for heartstone becuase i have heard him speak many times on these issues he has a open mind as well and a great knowledge of the topics
oh god theyre killing my game
from known exploits to stupid spawning  so you are saying that taking plexes after their spawn is exploit oh my god but then again ankh did not see any problems using her high standings to plex attack plexes without npc attacking i know that ccp said it works as intended  which sounds odd but ankh was not willing to do everything to change this bug or stop to use it because she was gaining advantage and causing unfair game to other player like good griefers usually does ankh was plexing afk and wanted good reward from it even medal were asked for being afki do not like exploiters so i do not vote for you and you can blaim ankh for that
vote vuk
i promise to stuff the slot with all my alts for vuk
vote for vuk o

thanks for your support 
hello amaldor themodiusover the past year ive been the fw csm sometimes to the annoyance of the rest of the csm as i tried to raise yet another fw issue a large part of my csm issues were fwrelated and ive written large documents about the problems with fw and been handing them to ccp since august 2008 i was there in the fw roundtables at fanfest ccp is completely out of touch with the fw players and despite them making all kinds of promises they didnt live up to a single one  not even alliances participation has been finished despite them promising it would be in every expansion since empyrean age 11 im now raising that very basic issue for the third time because ccp still hasnt deliveredsame thing with the cloaking exploit that thing was unfiltered in my bug report list for almost a month i still have more fw bugs that are unfiltered after months and despite half a dozen emails to ccp and even phone calls the exploit is still there  ccp obviously doesnt carenow my time is running out although i still have one more csmccp meeting to go i passed on all my documents and issues to erik finnegan which will be my successor for csm3 and hell be the next fw championwe care about fw even if ccp does not
ankgiven that you are not running for the csm i find it interesting that you are answering questions for candidates erik i believe had internet access and time to campaigni find it amusing that you think you know a lot about fw when you have yet to pvp i believe you sit cloaked at sites to hold them gaining standings within the faction in a way many would find unacceptable i doubt this is what would constitute fw in any meaningful way
please stop this anhk we know you have lent your support to erik but a position on the csm is not an appointed role if you are serious about fw getting sorted you should be passing your documents on to all candidates not just your chosen one i have stayed out of these things so far but i am fast getting fed up of being told by you that erik is the next this and the next that there are a number of people who care about factional warfare who you are dismissing erik on the other hand has seemingly more interest in working with people and not saying he is the one and only which is how your support of him comes across
ankhe i have followed your efforts to address faction warfare since you began on the csm i voted for you both times with at least one of my accounts it is disheartening to see that ccp cares so very little about this flawed expansion which released with so much fanfare it is still a great mechanic if only they would address these handful of issueswith the said id be pleased to hear erik discuss briefly each of my main points in the first post clarifying his position on each of the arguments ive made above for changes to fw
just my points as person who has been in fw from almost day 1 in my opinion fw works pretty well so far but here are few things1 i do not want alliances to join fw last thing we need are 00 people coming to get their lolkils from less serious minded people2 isk rewards no dont want them its war it should not be profitable unless you are good being in fw does not stop you from running missions or ratting in lowsec today i got dg implant hello several new ships also you can already make the isk by looting tags from plexes takes a while but doablei can agree that militia stores could have something nice though with plex vps and missions giving access to it hell just having an option of buying vanilla blackbird with caldari camo colours or one of the orange gallente battleships would probably encourage a lot of people4 occupancy if you start doing radical changes this will simply get flak from people who did not bother with system capture before and in worst case get people to quit en masse or demand ccp to do a rollback to captured systems again leading to massed number of people quitting throwing a small bone like cheaper repair costs might be an option5 bugs cloaked plexing is annoying so is standing bug surely it cannot be that hard to make the npcs open fire on anyone not belonging to proper militia rather than some esoteric calculation where faction standing  charisma  npc ships random bad day generator score determines if you have npc backup or notalso i will not vote for erik because of what ankh did in fw neither will i vote for heartstone due to his allegiance right now it appears that i will simply abstain from votingdamar rocarionbrigadier general
i would just like to say that this is a bit of a mistake erik isnt anhk and im not my character its your vote to do with as you will but i suggest you might want to think again and vote for the person most likely to raise the issues that you wish to be addressed whether that be erik myself or another candidate as 8 people will get on the csm and will be presenting fw issues to ccp so you might wanna try and make sure that its the people you can stand the best doing it
ankhe is posting on the forums as my team mate because her temper is much more suited to the general behaviour here and i thank heartstone for his seemingly flameresistant charactermeridius your points add some good extra legitimation and application use cases to my more general ideas for change please have a look at my program and it will all make perfect sense to youhere are some mindlinksa fw  war dec  i want to bump the standing system and make the standing between capsuleer entities meaningful both from a roleplay perspective that makes sense and can be used to solve your topic  is it not naiv today that you can war dec an individual corp and friends and allies have no way in intervening war dec mechanics should allow friends by proven standing history or allied with the corp by milita status a reasonable low entry barrier into that war war is never likely to stay contained between the two initial parties if it is war and not bribing concord to be able to grief without their intervention then again i want to get rid of concord in the long runb sov impact  clearly stated  factional warfare must be meaningful for the whole population i want it to be the endgame of empire space system is occupied  too bad for the loyalists including the pacifists of the defeated sidehere of course from a marketing point of view of ccp we will have to include some large scale corrective measures asymptotic in order to make sure that neither of the empires ever wins sorry to say that but it would be catastrophic for ccps sales if new eden were entirely occupied by the federationc plex spawning  this is too obviously wrong and too often told i want playerdriven spawns ie depending on general player activity not a simple onecauseonereaction relationship or even capsuleer built plexes which require resources etc to keep up yet reward you with sovereigntyoops i meant occupancy d fw rewards  you do not fight for the honour but for a living yes definitely both the direct rewards must be greater and the indirect reward occupancy paysoff see above through carebear activity just as we want alliances to be rewarded for providing infrastructure to bears why should a militia not be rewarded through its faction for the bear activity which they improve thanks to occupancy  take care is a team in order to improve csm performance for you all  is that so hard to bear  this platform intensifies exchange of methods and best practices and provides a long memory for issues which have been discussed where in the forums a thread is forgotten after it scrolls on page 2 so stop whining you have the right to remain silent everything you write can be used to improve the game
fair enough but i did say this at the start
it sure as hell is notif one could instantly appear at 0 km anywhere with a blaster ship it would be fine however a blaster ship is a damage ship mwding 30 km hurts no matter what and you apply little damage while speeding forwardi just stated what i think is the basic problem how we fix it can be manymore damage when you first come close you should riphigher falloff to make damage while you approachbetter tracking when you first come close you should hit goodetc etcpersonnaly i prefer more damage but i wont limit myself to one option so how they get fixed does not matter just that they get fixed this is not my opinion im afraid if you see on the start of the posti was posting it for a friend sorry for not making it more obvious
got my vote and my alts
i would prefere damage to still i see the need to sort kitting and tracking issues within web range firstpreferable with a slight bonus to the web power to bring back the solo and heavy tackling abilty that made this ships still dooing ok during the nano ageif you managed to catch someone you actualy had him tackeled not like slowed down a bit with the actual 60 websdont get me wrong im not only interested in this one point and preaty mutch agree on the many other thing like rocketsand some other missles and aksartis since the problems are also preaty obviousim actualy happy to see all this points at least in one candidates opener that also recognize the need of some readjustments to the patch that is now allready over 6 month on the server then accept my apologies didnUFFFDt get this
well my dear future csmswho of you actually wants to adress the issue of scam spam in evei dont say completely ban it but some minimising of the amount of scams or such would be dandyas it is at the moment your more filtering out scams when checking contract then actually finding none scamsisnt there any way to make it a bit more training intensified to scam so scammers would have to do more then just roll an alt for a few days without any skills or training just to scam on the sidemake scamming a tad more work then its nowthat way you would atleast decrease the amount of scam alts because if people also have to invest more time in atleast some skills for the alt before they can start scamming they might reconsider because it might take training time from their mains
well the one nice part they are doing to help the contract scam comes in effect tomorrow by putting all totals in words at the end on contracts will stop contract scams but my opinion of scammers is really low but i think an idea to help us know which scammers are which is to implement something used on ebay once you have bought something from somebody or you catch one scamming then putting an option like ebays feedback page would be able to work in eve and if they end up with say 50 players rate him as badscam artist etc he take either a really large isk deficit on items he sells or has to pay a fine etc to get rid of the reputation or a variation like a secruity penalty so they cannot go into certain trade hubs
contract scams are annoying to be sure and have basically made it impossible to sell to a legitimate wtb contract however eve is a harsh universe in many ways harsher than the real world because consequences for many actions versus players are practically nonexistanta seller rating system not unlike ebay at first seems like an excellent way to counter this if the sellerbuyers rating is low you doublecheck the contract for loose ends first however this would be a fairly simple system to grief through casting doubt upon a buyerseller through aggressive and unethical market practicesthe main issue i have is local spam jump into a market hub and your are assaulted with links to phony contracts often the spammers post multiple contracts or post the same contract with different characters in order to avoid the letter of the law when it comes to spamming yet another situation of following the letter of the law but disregarding the spirit in which it was intended sure you can block the spammer but the same bot will be posting with a different character name tomorrow i would like to counter these spam tactics and i would be willing to hear reasonable ideas to address both spam and scammingedit i did not see any other responses to this post when i clicked reply did not mean to make an attack on shatanas idea sorry 
well i can see several solutions depending on what results you wantmy biggest issue is just the spamming that goes on jita local is spammers hell 1 prevent trial accounts from posting links in local and npc corp chats no contracts or urls would also fix a lot of the isk spammers they hate so much 2 if you spam too much in local or npc chat you get a warning 2nd time you get blocked for a time spammers would use alts to get around blocks to there main player so block the whole account this would not only apply to scammers but anyone who thinks we need to hear there message every five minutes in localpeople cant stand spamming in rl why ccp thinks well quietly tolerate it in game is beyond me also wouldnt surprise me a lot of scam spams are done by macros i cant think of any skill that would only target scams without making it harder for any other legitimate player scams by there nature are ment to hide amount legitimate contracts and the current change only reduces 1 kind of scam doesnt fix the faction swap scam where you think your getting a navy issue ravenif you want to almost completely eliminate scams just put a warning message when your about to buy something on market or contract that is way out of proportion with the general market say 200 sellers by the way get a message showing how above or below market the price is and a warning to prevent them from accidentally listing say dysporium on a sell order for 100isk a unit my only question with scams themselves is how much it clogs up the petition system and the contract server i and most people wouldnt be happy if it turns out they have to wait an extra 24 hours for an answer from a gm because they have to spend a large proportion of there time replying to scam complaints
i agree that eve is a harsh place but the creation of disposable alts without any training or whatever and leaving them in an npc corp so you cant retaliate without getting concorded or so is more protection of illegal handlings then protecting the socalled law abising citizins in empirein fact the clerks and concord protect this kind of action and that is where its off balanceits way too easy to scam and get away with it no repurcusionsas far as i learned that no matter how harsh something is there is always a way to get back this system as it is however prevents that without losing even moreccp prides itself for socalled balancing i dont see any balance in this however
its pretty simple i want to be on the csm for one principal reason to change the way the game is rebalanced right now nerfing is the only way the game is rebalanced outside of expansions i want to change that check out the full story on my site galant3s websiteenough reading go vote vote for galant3
voting has finally openedhopefully people will vote for whom they feel can best represent their area of concerns in eve and we can get a good balance good luck to all the other candidatesammath for csm
just wondering if there is a list already before i start trudging through everyones platforms
its pretty much heartstone this time around roleplay faction warfare and small unit pvphopefully he can twist ccps arm on finally delivering alliance corps in fw and well see the ushrakhan able to properly crush the 24th crusade at some point
i got friendly with hardin in the back of a geddon once  but im not sure that counts as being rp friendly
i asked about that at eve vegas this past weekend its not gonna happen regardless fw still needs some love in general for those active in itill read up on heartstone
erik finnegan is a roleplayer and has a lot of rp things on the agenda and is the main fw candidate as wellwatch the movie id say
i killed hardin and pie several times in the past while flying with friends of matar 
bah given the amount of times weve had topics supporting this move presented to ccp in the past and given what we were told on csm1 about the technical viability of it  id be very disappointed if the devs have now decided an aboutface for some reasonall the more important to get some strong representation on the council for this session there and make sure the case is still argued
i think torda and crante may also be somewhat rpfriendly but i think heartstone and my ceo erik finnegan may be the best choices
what theyre so gonna die in the csm meeting next saturday i raised this topic for the third time now so at least they cant avoid it
bah for raising topic when im asleep both erik and myself are from what ive seen so far the only rp candidates from my understanding eriks corp are rp heavy in their corp and with thier dealings with other and well you already know who we are both erik and myself have a strong fw leaning in what we would like to achieve i would be grateful anhk if you would stop referring to erik as the main fw candidate as it is rather rude to dismiss other peoplebeyond this there are many differences between myself and erik which you will have to judge from yourself from what we individually written
i think youll find there are others who arewere rpers over their lifetime of playing eve you can always ask your ceo about when i was a director of jf granted it was a long time ago now sure im not promoting myself as a champion of rp but then again im not promoting myself as a champion of any specific group at allas i have said from the start of the csm i think having a broad knowledge base of all game style preferences helps on the csm rather than being entirely focussed in one or two areas
sorry oz youre right i worded that wrongly what i meant to say was the only candidates who are currently active in rp to my knowledge i know other candidates you especially have experience and knowledge of it sorry if my quickly typed comments offended anyone
for what its worth ank i think you and i were definitely the strongest supporters of fw during csm1 and i do acknowledge and thank you for the continued support of fw during csm2 i think it would be healthy for eve and very good for the interests of the thousands of active faction warfare players out there if both heartstone and erik get elected to csm3 and can continue to press ccp for much needed change and improvement of the fw system
heh i remember you dont worry oz and i hope you get elected too
i love rpedit  hhahahaha
apparently the nerf already made it in tomorrows patchnicely disguised but that doesnt change the massive issue that arises for small scale warfare if mwd are still included in this and since it doesnt specifically exclude it like it should i assume it is still affectedfrankly i am quite disappointed not to say enraged at the complete lack of comments from ccp about the concerns risen by the community
ive got one vote spare convince me 
i just silently hope ccp changes their mind and do not smash their nerfbat into skirmish warfareif even specialized ships cant bust a camp anymore whats then the role of a covert ship besides scanning down whs plexes and ships in your homesystems
unfortunatly the few ships which are affected include those which need to be able to get through gate campstwo examples scouts can only do their job if they can get out of a gatecamp and find an alternative route covert cynos can only be lit if a cloaky ship makes it into a heavily camped system
this will affect us in a big way running into a gate camp with a cov ops frigate or stealth bomber you will die there is no tank to speak of on either ship and the only tank that they do have is a mixture of the cov ops and pilot skill i agree that a domi shouldnt be able to escape in a situation as mentioned by heartstone but i disagree with the full cov ops nerf perhaps make it specific to ships so that only ships that can fit a cov ops cloak still have some chance of escaping blobs and gate camps exist but will now become more the norm and the small gang and solo pvp will become a thing of the past this is not a good thing for anyone
i agree with you entirely poreumai what i said above was not to say that this change will not have a negative effect on the role of these ships but to point out the idea that it is nerfing all ships across the board isnt accurate i think that these ships will indeed suffer quite badly from the mwdcloak change and these ships are very disadvantaged by this change to me the only answer in the current expected mechanics seems to be that you must infiltrate these ships via a different route or find an alternate route in general whilst this isnt a major boost for the space holding entities it does boost the effectiveness of well setup 00 gatecamps and gives the defender a further advantage which isnt something they really need given the current state of sov mechanics the current aim of the mechanical changes in tomorrows patch seem to me to aimed towards creating more nonconsensual combat between pilots as it also includes the agility changes as well as this change the question to be asked of ccp is whether this boost to nonconsensual pvp should be to the advantage of one pvp style over another personally i think the change is welcome but something should have been done to mitigate the effects of this on ships expressly designed for infiltration maybe to make it so the change only effects non covops cloaks
quite simply it will kill off a huge part of the game for smaller  those in larger alliances with the balls to go out and roam it will stop ppl using a part of pvp that some people have no understanding of hacsrecons market will suffer as less  less people will want to roam wow suffered when devs who played the game decided on what they wished the game to be  is this another case of a dev who likes to carebear in peace everything about this game is centred towards the defender who holds sov  the one thing left for us skirmish warfare alliances who wish to attack the larger stronger alliances is going to be removed iii certainly be looking elsewhere for my online gameing ccp want to play the ignorance game and refuse to give a reason for this stupidity fine by me  iii simply walk  along with the rest of us who love the challenge of pvpinin hostile territory  outnumbered and outgunned  but then this patch is about the carebear like every other patch these days your about to shoot yourself in the foot this time round ccp 
i still have not voted in the csm elections so far it seems i wont be voting at all
i will say this on my partthis nerf has it good and bad point imho to look at it in a whole its immedatly obvious the it seem to be a alteration for the single pvp player to go about it alone it is making it alot harderthis i do agree with tbh in the whole sence of the wordwe need our scouts and if we want to get our ships who are able to use the covert cyno how can they if the cloaked cyno ship can make it through again this is showing favor to numbers versus skills in pvpi think we need to keep in the single player hunt as well as having benefits for large numbered gangsccps goal seems to venture on benefits for sov holders in systems rather than give the little guy a chance to make his wayi am still not 100 on what it means for my char in the game i guess i will have to wait to see how the patch effects my ships personaly
tbh the new player experience cant be that bad were still playing i thought it left me a hanging a bit keep in mind i have only experienced it in red moon rising i hear its been improved since then i like that in games i like it when they leave me to figure stuff out on my own instead of just handing it to me
pvp is just a single element of a very rich game one of the great things about eve is that you can pursue any path in how you enjoy that there is also the key concept that actions have consequences so i always think there needs to be a way to undue a bad choice but at some point it may be very painful to do soissler
yeah missions need a lot of work its not called mission grinding cause its funi could write a lot of what i think needs changing but i can think of a few immediate fixes that would help make it a little less painful like expanding the mission list an agent has available to distribute im tired of the 20 or so missions an agent recycles over and over again make the random less random i once got ae four times in a row god please do something about the dialogue im surprised i can reach my agents cause they seem to have a lot of massage appointments more intelligence would also be nice i cant see an agent that you have 10 standings with ever calling you scum and the first time i meet an agent they shouldnt be saying how im just the man for the jobyou should always have access to an agent in any corp even if its just a level 1 20q mission runners who cant access the npc agents in 00 have just one more reason to never leave empire would also allow you an inroad into reversing your negative standings painfully of course but some players like challengeswe know players have a lot to offer in the way of creative design for the eve universe and it would be nice to see ccp develop some way of allowing players to develop and contribute to mission designs to start maybe a simple webform where players could write a plot dialogue and a mission layout shouldnt be too hard to implement ultimately i would love to see ccp work with players on contributing to many aspects of the game
this id love to be able to manage a pos from a single interface or at the very least be able to move stuff between the hanger the silos and the fuel bay with just the manage and hanger windows open
the top post in this thread has a link to my interview index here it is againthe interviews are completed id like to thank those who participated for doing so if yours was sent and didnt go up let me know

signedthe old effect was better imho while the new bubble effect is cool it does not give the shock value that it shouldi would prefer a enhanced version of the old cyno effect which would clean up its appearance also the old effect did give that oh crap feeling when you suddenly see a dozen cap ships jump inthe best example ever of that was the foundations movie the clarion call  triage special when they jumped their dreads onto the battlefield you knew that they had showed up due to the effect moving far around the ship so even though the cap ships that were jumping in were not in the cameras frame you still knew that they jumped in
signedwe wont a oh crap effect and no crap effect those lens effect is now everywhere since apo stargates webbing wormholes 
makes perfect sense though i just finished training for assault ships yesterday so of course a sudden nerf was needed
you have some good ideas here
the ideea of energy neuting as a ddd weapon will simply make them even more invulnerable
please explain this logic in detail
errr and why isnt this thread way high up this is something eve should have had from the get go  needz moar supportz
definately worth doing you got support from a miner
as long as you can stop them while reloading in case you want to change to another target

with yet another 20 vs 20 fight lagged to buggery i call shenanigans this was supposed to have been fixed months ago and now since the last patch but one it seems its back every bit as bad as before reporting it in issues goes unnoticed apparently so make your marks here if youre fed up with this
supported seriously you can fix it in 00 fix in lowsec as well
i agree whole heartedly its sad when tactics etc are nul and void because you have to relog to get rid of lag issues in the middle of the battle
signed less than 50 ships shouldnt be too much
lag in the warzones is beyond ludicrous levels something definitely has to be done
needs to be fixed  supported
totally agree this amount of lag in small 20 vs 20 engagements is un workable please fix it i love fw but the lag hurts 
i agree totally bull and keep capital ships out of fw
this was not the first time it happened and lags is working against big and also small fleets
lag in the warzones is beyond ludicrous levels something definitely has to be done
fix it or alot of people will quite eve thise proves that you lack the abilitiy to help you customers bad customer services and worthy of report to the authorities

agreed signing on principle that said this thread does highlight that theyre aware of the problem

same here seemed to be fixed for a week or so then reverted back again they trying to make all leave fw for 00 combat  they pretty much said so themselves  surely at the least they can reenforce they busier fw systems ie kourmaugadalrensammakevard etc on the amarr vs min and pets sf war
i dont get it how is faction warfare any different than 00 pvp we have fights in the 200300 range and its playable
heck i run a courier mission from time to time while being utterly conciousbut i will be damned if i wanted to make it for the macro  easier so i fully endorse this product
yes i support anything that cuts down the macros
this obvious idea has my support
serious buff to corp theft  have you thought about that 
iwhat unclear if you mean original post or original poster if you mean original post congratulations youve confused the  out of meregardless supported at the very least give us an option to allow all alliance members access to pos shieldsjbsetc
i said option not mandatory

original threada couple of months later citadels vs moving cap ships is a recognized issue and on the to fix listnow i dont support getting rid of him but he could be doing a better job more time spent playing the game hes supposed to balance would be a good start that applies to the whole balance team really
ok the next person who posts fire ccp devs needs to get a reality check lets check other gamesworld of warcraft absolutely no devplayers interactionstar wars galaxies no devplayers interactioneverquest no devplayer interactionall other mmos no devplayer interactioneve online csm devs that talk to their members they acknowledge errors and fix them rather fast black screen cloak nerf loads of other errorsand you biatch about that ccp never listens to its player base lets see what weve gottenorcaclass command shipgrouped turretsactual devblog on pos cheat long i might addfixed naglfarecm drones havent been nerfedmany many other thingsshut the heck up ccp is doing the best job they can just because they dont change the game to your preferences doesnt mean they ignore the community as a whole you are not god on earth you do not get to decide company policy your a dang customer and if you hate this gameget out of here you can pull your  in protest of this game otherwise shut up and play the game isaacps lock this stupid thread
ok i agree that i was wrong on a large extent on this matter
isaac is not an alt of mebut youd think he wasoh uh yeah thisx o d
i think the process of balancing could be done better
agreednozh is behind the recent failchanges in attempt to cover up for his past failchanges the speed changes and he has a history of trolling customers on the forums not constructive he should be working the floor buffer i want a high mirror shine when i get my tour of ccp
i can understand that for lag avoidance it is better to have just a single super missile to track but the ship should look different based on what launchers you fit
its just a hole in the ships the missiles fly out putting a silo on the ship would look bad imo 
ccp explained why this wasnt possable in one of the fanfest presentations during qa or lat least not at present
got a link
i will not support this idea for the very reason you failed to either make a link or copy and paste the damn thing yourself shame on you and your family how simple was that
believe it or not i will not support this idea one of the objectives of lowsec was to bring industrialists to it and the pveers and this does the exact opposite with more players in pvp on either side the carebears have even less reason to go there creating a semifw attitude in a fair area of space but with no organizations to joinsince carebears comprise over 70 of the population according to the qen i cant see this being good for the game the only result is that a few people who enjoy both will train both skills to create the new items and highsec will remain highsec as it is now
i love this topic and everything it stands for
shut up carebears and industrialists will never leave high sec what we need to do is give those who do live in lowsec a better life
 this there is nothing you can do to lure out the risk averse carebears who are terrified at the idea of their precious ships going pop and wrecking their pretty little graphs and spreadsheets
this must happen absolutely complete and total win here folks
this wont grab all carebears but itll grab ones that are only carebears because lowsec is worthless i know lots of carebears that would move their hq to lowsec if they had awesome things like this im not looking to move all carebears out to lowsec that would be horrible for everyone none of us real players want that now do wethe main idea behind this wasnt bringing carebears in the idea of this was making life not suck for people that do live in lowsec or would want to normally if the reward were better despite the risk i apologize that your laziness causes you to respond like this if youre so lazy why did you even bother posting go eat some chips
while it might be nice to have a bc sized covert ship the focus on anti capital is foolish when capitals are on the field the only thing you use covert ships for is getting warp in points anything else will just be obliterated by the massive bs fleets and their cruiser and frig support an anti command link sounds interesting but too difficult to implement i mean who does it effect everyone on grid not in your fleet is it usable in low sec high get you concordoken muchnot supported
disable dd lul
targeted mods rpwise derived from ganglink hardware but behave more like ecm that takes some time to achieve the jam etc amended to my second postnobody ever said it was expected of any ship to be able to f over a cap or a group of caps solo nobody is seriously asking for such a ship as always having your own support fleet of appropriate size is a precondition of being truly effectivethat said locking ranges if recons are taken as a model will be greater than 200km with one sensor booster if you cant use a covops cloak to get into a position that will let your t2 resisted bc derived hull survive 30s after decloaking and locking up a dread instant you would be advised to find another ship and you apparently didnt fly many recons or encounter many falcons to begin withcapitally focused and therefore only relevant outside of empirehope that helps
there are 2 main problem with plexes in faction warfare1 they are too easy to do by speed tanking2 they give no monetary reward compared to missioning general problem with fw and lowsec spaceright now a fw plex can be speed tanked by any inty with a microwarp drive it is so lame to see a fleet of 10 cruisers look at an interceptor capturing a plexproposal1 make fw navy use webs so plexes need to be cleared instead of speed tanked2 make the plex drop look at about a somewhat similar rate to a missionso if a plex can be done by a 4 battlecruisers pvp gang make if drop loot equivalent to a level 4 missionthat way people who want to just grind isk can stick to running l4 in a raven pve fit while pvp gangs can make some isk doing a few plexes while waiting for enemies to spawnthis would also lure many small gangs into fw lowsec which is something we all want
actually its worse than that with effort they can be tanked with a single t1 frigate with t1 fittings with two t1 frigates its trivial to tank them even the highend plexes so i agree they need to modify plexes to be challenging enough that it takes at least a small gang to accomplish all but the most minor plexesas to the reward i think theres certainly room for improvement especially with the boosted difficulty however while i think there should be some worthwhile drops here and there for example lowend faction ammomodules from the faction being fought i think that lps would be better as the bulk of the reward go out and destroy our enemies and well give you access to some of our restricted equipment this would work especially well if there were some new toys put in that were unique to the militia lp stores  requiring the same tags that the complexes dropfw missions also need to be boosted they should be at least as good as their equivalent highsec missions and should also provide a benefit to the sponsoring militia should generate system capture points or something along those lines
only problem with the ui i find is clutter windows not being able to be re sized properly or fully such as the scanner and local chat when separated i always find ti difficult to find places for watch list broadcast and scanner
could we just change this so the ui could be customized ie user mods just regulate it so macro woulds be harder to program
yes the ui interface would be entirely client side so that people with nicer computers can enjoy the better graphics personally i am a fan of useless information i personally think it would be cool if when a shiproid is targeted the new holoui would pop up next to the shiproid and provide exact figures for its hp just cool little things like that would make me love this game even more we are in the future flying spacecraft and have access to holograms holoreels be cool if i saw that in the gameperhaps we could have an option between the original tactical overlay ta and the new holo ta basically if you use the holo version the camera zooms out a bit and the interface is filled with info and has the ui like the apoc trailer if a target is locked all info available would be shown this does not include modules unless there is a ship scanner or balance can be brought to it eve could use more pizzaz
i petition that the changes put forth in 12 without any interaction or feedback from the players i might add which remove the ability to mwdcloak should be rolled back furthermore i petition that the 3second nomwd delay upon decloaking should also be removed because it basically guarantees death for anything smaller than a battlecruiser if it hops into a gatecampboth of these things are terrible for smallgang pvp and encourage the blob it makes roaming about 00 in a small group a thing of the past they are stupid stupid changes that anyone who has pvped in 00 will make the game worseroll back these changes

this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
roll back or be ready to lose your business ccp
indeed
this change destroys cov ops and recons they can no longer perform their job as forward scouts a recon or cov ops even jumping into a bubble camp while scouting for the main fleet is toast because of these changes this is the most bone headed change in recent memory
covert ops is now useless and will get popped at every camp as will blockade runners

voted for lark x 2
ive done the research and larkonis seems to be the only combatoriented pilot running the rest are effeminate carebears he gets my votes
dont agreei run an industry alt corp in empire and have a high sec pos every few months i online the pos and run off a bajillion bpcs once done i offline the pos because i wont need it for another few monthsfor me personally the only advantage of having the pos in high sec over low sec is that i dont need to leave it online when im not using it and besides its already been said just war dec corps that have high sec pos it happened to me i went away for a weekend and came back to find war declared and rectracted on my alt corp and my high sec pos missing leaving only a km with 2 gank fit amarr bs on it whod obviously set themselves shooting and gone to bed
supportedi like the hackable ideacodebreakers need more uselockbreaker bombs aswell but this might be too much 
i have a better solution basically you send the people an invite and then a wormhole is generated dueling costs money all contestants can then use the wormhole to be taken to an undisclosed fighting location people get killed or whatever and then they return to their original systems
ondemand wormholes for protection from other pilot interference big no
no thanks
lol no ive spent years in 00 this is the first highsec corp ive ever joined other than fw militia for a couple monthswhat i mean by my statement before was if you ask someone into your fleet you trust that they will not shoot you being in fleet is a trust thing always has been always should be and with concord getting ed at me for shooting infleet noncorp members its fleet is becoming a forced trust mechanicyou speak of forced honour which these posted ideas are not i counter with eve has slowly added more forced trust than it ever neededeve is a game about where you decide to place your trust not where the game decidesi dont like this idea i do not support instancing of any form in any mmo this is more like wow than any proposed idea ive ever seen
seems to me the one cycle mwd was always working unintended and is being fixedhigh speed should decloak

ive lived and made my fortunes in lowsec but even i cant be bothered with it lately theres is so little there now worth the troublelots of problems with lowsec arent directly related to lowsec itself so some of the issues need to be fixed else where to make lowsec more attractiveminers dont go there anymore with trit prices so high the best ore in empire to mine is veldspar and that can be done a lot of safer in highsec ice is slightly better in lowsec but veldspar is still worth more for your time most mission runners avoid lowsec accept in large groups cause they will get owned by mission busters fittings for missions and pvp are 2 very different setups ratters are better off in 00 as there is more safe quiet space to spend a few nights making isk and recovering standings even though ccp introduced the odd bs to lowsec 00 is far betteras a stepping stone into 00 it no longer works because theres a lot less room in 00 accept for large well established alliancesthe high price of dysporium is killing a lot of the market for other moon minerals making it less profitable in lowsec for a lot of new small corps to get intoa few changes i think should be looked at to see what affect they might have on the attractiveness of lowsec1look at increasing the insurance on t2 ships on a 100mil hulk you get 11mil basic insurance 29mil for a cost of 87mil no hulk pilot is gonna risk a lose of 100mil ship to earn 7mil isk an hour mining in lowsec how many people ever take there marauders in lowsec or nullsec same reason why risk a 1bil ship for 20mil40mil an hourbetter insurance would also result in a higher demand for t2 across the board and that would make poss more profitable more poss means more industrials in lowsecalso the high costs of t2 ships and the risks with them means that only the richer players can afford them so newer players avoid pvp as they feel they have a disadvantage from the start2amake ice mining in low and 00 more profitable by increasing the amount of ice products in the lowsec00 ices the ease of mining ice in highsec and the fact that lowsec00 is only slightly better means 99 of ice is mined in highsec2badd bpos that would let you make coolant and oxygen from ice products stupid that 5 out of the 9 items you need for pos fuel have to be bought off the npc market3provide either a speed or material bonus to manufacturing in lowsec the majority of the slots that i know of are usually completely free4possibly introduce bpos to make robotics and mechanical parts might not have much impact on lowsec but certainly 00500 needs to be made more in reach of medium sized corps and alliances as these alliancescorps would be less likely to be able to supply all there needs in 00 they would have stronger ties to empire so more traffic between
let me give a few ideas i think could work to make low sec better1 easy improve the ore ice and rats2 create new content only found in low sec3 allow player corps to be the police force in low sec providing unique reqwards for antipiracy actions4 allow some form of corporate ministation between a pos and an outpost5 make it place where corporations can create missions introduce player created content there6 even something as simple as making gate and station guns get increasingly effective eliminating permacamps on gates7 move trade goods and things like pos fuel to low sec onlythose are just a few things i would love to see discussed in greater detail and considered as ways to inprove low secissler
im in
confirming me and my alts will be voting take care
i will not be voting for someone that cannot make their own voice in the csm i will not vote for someone who is really a marionette of a previous csm member a failure at that who has not one idea  proposal of his own also the csm as a whole is a pr gag and should just be terminated since the fact is you have done nothing for this game nor will you ever do something that will actually impact the game that has meaning yes you brought a skill queue wow  such a huge impacting change runs for the hills oh boy
well i am not to sure if i will be voting for erik though reading this has been fun i myself am working on becoming a 00 carebeardrug manufacturing along with my corp i am glad to see from this that some people actually want to debate topics with the candidates before voting for them i have checked out all the candidates that i could so far but so far this thread and admiral iceblocks are the only candidate web pages or threads that actually have any real discussion on them this is good sign to me in favor for erik as for as the candidates go none of the have really stated any concrete plans in my opinion some very good ideas in general of things to purpose but no real plans i would like to see that happen at this stage it would give me better idea of what the candidates are willing to put into this hence the why i would never run not that willing to put that much effort in this direction just doesnt seem fun to me but i do appreciate those who do i am glad to see a couple of other candidates in this post it gave me a better fell for them thanks to you candidates also were there any debates between that candidates that i missed if so i wouldnt mind reading through that if not i think it should be considered for next time
i would also like to here what erik or what anybody has to say about 00 systems that are non controllable by npc or pc corpsfaction for those people who really do want to be isolationist where you truly can run into random crap for varieties sake i can run lvl4 missions but dont cause i like slumming along so it would be fun to me to make my way in the verse just barely scrapping by out in a dead system if i had to depend on trade caravans that only came though the system i was in once a week or so to get supplies and what not just to get off the grid sort of kinda put a whole new spin on ratting and salvaging but hey a guy can only dream
i want to thank all the folks that have eve mailed me in game to let me know they voted for me i hope i have the chance again to support the care bears of eve in the csmissler

so basicly you are saying waah i want gallentes to start plexing so caldari wont paint the whole map blue correct sorry that sentence alone makes you clearly biased much like ankh was happy to do her bit for feds by exploiting known bugs without actually risking herself kudos to those few determined pilots who managed to kill herhey great idea i take an alt build some crap to system i want to conquer then bring my friends over to kill themim no expert on 00 but what makes you think 00 alliances would want some random guys reaping the rewards of their hard work also player given missions stop and think it for a moment if we look at extreme perspective it will just be used by alliances to farm even more isk yep id definetly give my alt a mission with 20 sansha bs spawns each appearing one at the timedamar rocarionbrigadier general
admiral iceblock made a pretty impressive post on fw here
we have a discussion going on this on our corp forums ill post my reply there here clarifying my original suggestions for fwhonestly ive heard a lot of complicated ideas in several different threads which would involve ccp doing a lot of work in terms of writing all kinds of new code knowing their history i wouldnt count on the devs to implement those kinds of changes i pretty much stand by each of my proposed changes they are not hard to implement and would collectively fix just about everything wrong with fw bringing back countless former participants and encouraging many new ones this fix would mean nothing more than making all four militia factions into alliances insofar as wardec game mechanics are concerned cant dec one corp within without deccing them all hell itd probably involve changing one line of code for each militiadoesnt have to be complicated doesnt need any new set of rules just use the nullsec docking code for fw with those stations that are militia in nature those having the respective militia in their names  tribal liberation force logisitics plant 24th imperial crusade testing facilities etc if you dont have occupancy your militia cant dock in those stations you could still dock in any nonmilitia stations in any system quafe company warehouse etc regardless of occupancy but perhaps with station services cut off to whichever militia does not have system occupancy perhaps cutting off station services in npc stations might be seen as too extreme i dont know some faction warfare systems have npc corp stations in them others do not systems which have only militia stations will be something for enemies to consider when flying through an enemyoccupied system  and give them a good reason for taking said systems themselvesthis would make fw a little bit more like 00withtrainingwheels as ccp say they intend if you are behind enemy lines roaming or fighting in enemy occupied space it will not be so easy to just dock up and get repairs or avoid fights this requires no further explanation as most everyone  ccp included  agree the plex spawning mechanics are fubared at the moment as far as cloaking and speedtanking the plexes the solution there is also a simple one one must destroy all npcs in a plex in order to finish said plex you can still run the timer down cloak up and speed tank all you like but it will just keep flashing 000 seconds until someone finishes off any and all rats continued
i dont think giving actual isk rewards would be the way to go with this at all it should be loyalty point based for such items as may be purchased only in the faction store and to avoid farming make taking a major unrestricted plex scale to about 23 what a single level iv mission would earn a high sec carebear and scale all lp rewards for lesser plexes down from there remember that this is not like mission running if these changes are implemented youll have to not only kill all the rats in a plex but do so with potentially scores of wts searching through many of these systems looking to gank you as always make offensive plexing more rewarding then defensive plexing
the blasters issue is good to hear but i have to admit the same problem is now apparent with torpedos their range has been so nerfed many are turning to cruise missiles for their weapon of choice perhaps a significant boost to the longrange t2 torps could negate this but it used to be that someone would train t2 torps and be set for all shortmedium range engagements now youd have to train t2 cruise missiles too anyway just saying that the problem that blasters have also applies to the nerfed torpssecondly the issue with mwding in webrange has now also been made increasingly problematic with the warp scrambler boost1 tackler with a warp scrambler makes the already slow triple trimarked plated megathron a stationary slab of rock that ships with longer optimal ranges can then easily take you outwould like to hear some opinions on this 3
right on when is the next meet in toronto i was unaware there was eve meets in my area
just going to point out that there is more to improving roleplay opportunitiestools in eve than just improving factional warfare while factional warfare is an important component and i agree that uk cva em 4th etc should have the opportunity to participate as those entities there are other ideas that should be brought to ccps attention both regarding factional warfare and roleplay opportunitiesi think both heartstone and erik who are actively particapting in the roleplay enviroment will recongize when ideas are presented that should be passed on to ccp for refinement
oh dang now ive got to check you out too and i just narrowed it down to erik and heartstone oh welledit nevermind page 1 of your thread made it clear that you wont get my vote
for sure theres already a candidates for fw threadthis one is different though fw is gonna pop up a lot anywayi need a candidate who will get it when lolrpideas are proposed etc
stop killing small gang pvpps is the guy who came up with this in a providence holding alliance this is like hitting uk with a bat in the ballz
they dont care anymore for the pvpers only the huge blob wtf warfare that involves no skill whatsoever i can command a fleet of 1000 people too just call a name and ur good ur better if u know the shiptypes and know which ones pose a bigger threat but all in all its easy small gang warfare now thats an art sure you will still have someone calling primaries but in the end the individual players make decisions too while the fighting is going on like say for instance a falcon decloaks within drone range if the fc didnt see it but the rest of the gang did then they will set their drones or change primary when needed sounds simple right wrong carebears are too stupid to think thats why they love large fleets where there is someone calling targets for them now that i went off topic and explained why small gang warfare is that much better if the cloaks are nerfed forget small gang warfare for those of you that say it will not eliminate small gang warfare bull you my friend have too much money and time on ur hands to have a thousand alts scouting you through your intended target regionarea i myself cannot and will not get another fing alt to feed ccp their money they get enough of it as it isno nerf is required for the cloaks plain and simple no mwdcloak tactic no small gang warfare ofcourse in traditional ccp style they will ignore the pvpers and continue on with their nerf for carebaers as ive said in another thread this continues i may quit the game and ccp will be gettin a nice post from me ps wow  is blocked this world is going to down the drain when a nonvulgar world like  is blocked i mean  wtf p
could a representative from ccp or the csm please address the reasons behind the cloaking changei do not personally support the change for several reasons already echoed in this thread that said i would like to make an informed decision based upon information from both sides with nothing in forum or publicly available to review that is not possibleregards

does it bother you that veldspar is more profitable than any low sec mineralsto some extent it is largely market driven and ccp has made it so that trit is used a lot i think ccp needs to look hard at resource balancing and go back to some of their older ideas of introducing super veld in 00 space so that logistics are not hampered the stealth removal of the mission that provided large amounts of trit into the game hurt a lot of industrial concerns and places major burdens upon logistics  time sinks for no other reason than to have time sinks the introduction of the orca and the jump freighter has helped out a lot but more balancing needs to be donemethods of being able to mine in low sec effectively need to be introduced but in such ways as to not remove the pirate from the game knowing that about 13 of all minerals in the game are in essence recycled not from mining is also something to be considered being able to mine all day in empire is also not in my opinion a good thing either  but i prefer to see that become a game mechanic as opposed to a player mechanic i have many ideas on how to do some of these rebalancing and by being elected to the csm i can effectively work with ccp to help bring some balance to the issuewhats your opinion on current war declaration mechanicsi think it is relatively fair and reasonable there are some mechanics that i dont like so much corp votes for example but overall it appears to workwhat is the single largest imbalance in game and how would you fix itthe disparity between the older wealthier playerscorpsalliances and the newer  in particular as seen by the ability to have the dispro cartel meaning virtually unworked for yet extremely massive amounts of game wealth keeping such massive amounts of wealth sources in the game that are static isnt good for the health of the game ccp realized this when they made the static plexes above 210 no longer static but have not done anything in regards to this massive imbalance in regards to moons and moon mining by making it so that dispro and to a lesser extent promo is so rare yet so needed for the production of t2 ccp has set it up so that these static resources are disproportionately utilized this is not a good situation for the economy of eve nor for the ability of newer players to feel that they can succeed in the game by having the resources static and in essence a passive income to such a large degree it has created a very static playing field that newer alliances cannot hope to enterchanging sov mechanics to no longer allow absentee owners to control large selections of space will be a significant first step you need to occupy the space to control it this however will not help with alliances that can project might into areas that sov does not play a factor areas that should be available to up and coming groups to allow them to build or fail instead of being sucked up by the super powers to support their endeavors while keeping the newer folks out it is about as much resource denial as it is resource usagesecondly changing these resources so that there is no longer the massive disparity and massive wealth will be necessary alchemy was an attempt but it failed in that the economics of it were out of proportion to the problem you need to run how many large poss to make up for a single reaction that uses dysprosium and what are your overhead for doing so additional equipment fuel manpower etc right it is out of whack the two ways i have seen that can both work is to no longer make the resource static  by either making it run out on a moon so that it respawns on another moon in the same region think faction war plexes or moving it off of moons entirely and into gathering sites similar to asteroid  gas beltscontinued below
continued from aboveof course one of the things ccp should look at is the actual usage of the materials a rebalance of the blueprint needs would also do wonders by increasing other moon requirements while decreasing the dependence upon dispro and promo t3 ships will also hopefully take some of the pressure off but it will need to be more of a longer term as opposed to a shorter term solutionas players gain experience and begin to take notice of the greater eve universe out there they often feel obliged to sign up with the existing large alliances or forever be a small fry out there there isnt a way for newer folks to effectively work their way into the big 00 game which is perceived as the end game content so a lot of people just walk away  after all how many missions can you run how many belts can you strip eve is a game about social interaction and these game mechanics so effectively place limits on these interactions that it is broken and will drive players read ccps clients away from the gameanything to addthanks for reading the wall of text please vote for me

i raised this idea about 8 months ago and lavista was on the casenever did hear anything backtime to try againlinky to original topic now closed cos its so old
supportedeven adding one additional division for savings would be useful this may help to avoid expense scams by limiting the amount of isk you have in your current account and requiring you to move cash before a large transaction the extra pause for thought while you transfer cash may just be enough time for the somethings wrong light to start blinking

agree with op
most of what was said in this thread went right over my head but the idea of one or more huge asteroid belts in a system always makes me give a thumbs up
i like the idea in general but plz incude theory fitting reqs tooi feel perhaps they would be a little overpowered as you have them right nowperhapsmedium  30k large  40k both at 500 ms
signed
yes
despite being largely antipirate i think this idea has excellent potential ideally lowsec hauling missions should make for excellent pirate fodder so long as the rewards are enough to make the increased risk worth facing but its important to make sure risk v reward is considered otherwise you will end up just making those who currently run these missions do something else instead which counters your intent

gotta love ccp consistency in inconsistency nid  armor tank nag  sheild tank helshield tank awesomeness lol
it would be consistent if they hadnt changed the nid into an armor tanker
i read through this post
i can see some positive and negative to thison the whole the dynamic has some appeal and would maybe pick up ontie in with some of mittens in vegas  ten ton hammerhowever i do see some serious downsides if the system security flips between hisec and low sechow would it be possible to flip a system back from hisec to low sec do concord move in and stop any piracysec changes would disrupt travel for both hi and low sec status players this may disrupt trade severely and upset the economypockets of agents may develop that actually focus rather than spread player activity if the agent move is randomthat said there are some interesting ideas perhaps make the sec change one which operates within the current lowsec parameters ie 0104systems with 0102 become pierate enclaves with agents offering missions for pirate faction loyatly points and loot systems with 0304 become concord outposts offering mercenary missions for concord faction lp and lootsystems can be flipped by killing ships of the opposing faction the flip could be based on a value derived from the difference in number of ships killed with a multiplier based on player sec status for example thereby encouraging the opposing factions to maintain their sec status at the maximum possible pirates would be encouraged to be very evil and concord mercs to be whiter than whiteso maybe once a monthweek the value counting to sovereignty is calculated and a change appliedpirates killed 500 ships x pilots total sec statusnumber of pilots involvedconcord mercs 300 ships killed x pilots total sec statusnumber of pilots involvedobviously enough the concord pilots would need a multiplier to counter the 5 vs 10 disparity and someone with a math degree can put together a proper equation but you get the idea it isnt just the total number of ships killed that counts it is also the number of pilots involved and the value of their sec theoretically it would be possible to kill fewer ships but since your factions sec is better you get more pointsthere would be an inherent interest in pilots continuing activity in the system to maintain the sov and perhaps the changing security could be used to improve lowsec use by offering services at a station based on the faction sovimproved refining yield for miners if sov is concord mercavailability of illegal drugs and booster materials if the sov is piratejust two ideas i am sure others can add more and the now infamous methnaught bpcs could be a reward if the system retains 01 sec for several weeks or somethinggenerally i support the idea but it would i think need implemtation that retains the current traveltrade routes by confining sec status changes to already low sec systems
yall need to stop whining about your cloakmwd nerfits really starting to get annoyingits just like back in the days of nanoships yall whining about how much it would ruin the viability of your ships yadda yadda yaddanot supporteddeal with the inability to exploit like real men and stop calling exploits tactics
nozhs repeated tactic of posting once in a thread posting a quick reply on page 2 disappearing for a month and then throwing his original changes in a patch and claiming customer interaction are why i support thisthe guy is just terrible with interaction and his ideas are usually horribleand im under no false belief that hell be fired due to a thread but honestly the very fact that a player made a thread about the incompetence of one of ccps most visible employees warrants someone looking into the reasons why you dont see such threads about the othersand to clarify two points1 the reason the 3second delay was added was presumably to prevent ships from mwding back to gates because its too easy at present for them to do that why is it too easy because after nozhs nanonerf webs were weakened severely so weve gone 360 now2 nozh gets no credit for the nag that was chronitiss thing and he does a much better job of balances  fixing than nozh does i didnt agree with the changes they ended up on but at least its reasonable its certainly not nearly as boneheaded as todays patch

satan must be iceskating because isaac and drake are fuming and i agree with both of them wholeheartedly what the crap kind of nonsense is this criticize the devs if you want to but come on
now if i could just get efrim and herschel in here and then it would be colder the space
not supported because from what the op wrote it shows that he has no clue what the process is when it comes to fixingimprovingadjusting software and for the love of all that makes people happy let the friggen dust settle before you get your panties all wound up in your man parts
it should rather be that grinding down the opposing factions would just repair your standing at a lower pace then it takes to destroy the other standing thoughso if you have 10 with the gallente go blow up serpentis and caldari navy npcs nonmission related its weird that it doesnt seem to work this way alreadyhaving a whole epic arc sounds nice but it seems like a fix that requires a lot more work and again a onetimeshot still would be a nice thing to have though
definitely supported i would love to see a whole line of t1 khanid ships
methnoughton the side what would really be cool for these systems is to have lots of unmapped resources that are able to be probed but cant be used unless the bribership changes from one side to the other hidden stargates stations gas cloud formations asteroids etc etcessentially to be in on the criminal activities and be able to reap the benefits of them you have to have the keys and be friends with the localsempire people without cartel affiliations or standings problems get to use resources in lawful systems criminals and cartels have to scan for resources in these systems in the lawless systems its the other way around empire people have to scan to find the goodsalso instead of alliances cartels cartels are the bribers the briber of a system can set allies and usage permissions just like alliances but in general the good guys and bad guys cant be on the same team because of conflicting interestsjust like in real life the antidrug enforcement is carried out by scorched earth practices modules that completely destroy gas fields in a system thereby removing the income and leaving the smugglers etcthe smuggler part seems like the most fun horrid amounts of gatecamps secret stargates that are able to be bookmarked and such get destroyed and rebuilt all to support the movement of illegal materials needed to get the best drugs togetherthats my 2 cents last thought we need a druggie smiley in the forums to compliment the pirate face
do not mistake efficiency and general know how for laziness however this further reinforces your ineptitude which is make your ing links in your own posts imagine if websites wanted you to copy and paste basic url addresses instead of having their guys make simple links also you clearly missed the sarcasm but that makes sense please wipe the cheeto crud off your fingers
bunyip you are starting with assumption that every carebear has the same mindset like yours which is totaly not true as mentioned above i know load of people who would move to lowsec if rewardrisk ratio would be higher
i agree with bunyip that it doesnt add real incentive for nonpvpers to go to low sec but that is for decent part just due to alts and you cant do much about that pirates will use alts anyway to get their ships from high sec then you can move some asteroid types to low sec only so some minerals only are mined in low sec but in best case that will result in a very small part being mined empty and everything else not changing at allhowever that it doesnt add reasons for nonpvpers to go into low sec doesnt mean it is a bad idea
i disagreeif we have this dynamic sec status this will make it safer for people to go to the newlyraisedsec systems no concord but faction police maybe
allow privateers who enforce the lawfulness of systems to sell rights to use warp points in that system extort duties etc give them a portion of the taxes from all stations in those systems just make it an isk thing where they can benefit from the general activity of carebearshisec population is huge privateers can form up and take over enough systems and those systems will fill up with carebears who will make them money dcall it deputy status or something and make it have complimentary privileges to infiltration

in case you didnt notice ccp has actually stated that it is a mistake that it was removed and that they are reimplementing itso its not an exploit
signing in even though it has already been admitted by ccp that it was a bad case of being lazy and not checking everything im signing in to help it get fixed asap in all honesty i could see a technological reason for non cloak specialized ships to not be able to cloak while mwd but the specialized ships have indeed been hit hard by this little f up i was already wondering why ccp would nerf the blockade runners while they just actually got a role to begin with but im glad it will be fixed just fix it sooner than asap or just right now please i have some high value cargo to transport
agree ccp must fix this and do not destroy cov ops ships allowing them to perform their role
dropping in to state that it seems ccp has corrected the issue i have no trouble engaging mwd and cloak and the mwd will finish its cycleplease test and see if the issue has been fixed with you aswelledit it also appears it has been a quick and dirty fix when engaging warp the mwd will display a cycle after you clicked it while it states you cant do that due to warp once you actually enter warp it displays the message again and the cycle is cut short a bit it doesnt appear to speed up the process of going to warp so it seems to be a graphical bug

so let me get this straight you got drunk and went to post a thread in a forum for internet spaceships game and managed to p off a couple of million french guys if i were you i wouldnt drink that stuff any more and for the suggestion no reason who cares
if youre really that shallow as to not be gallente because you are xenophobic you should get off the internet and try not to meet any new people we dont want you to get upset now
all the more reason not to post while drunki particularly liked the advice about changing the french nationality to something less frenchish
ah then just imagine your character is french canadian
i hate to tell you how your own forums are run but moving this to ah was incorrect you are looking for jita park speakers corner or just move it back to cp might want to know what the forums are before you become a forum moderatorposting support i guess rofls
i have demanded our whole corp vote for you  let me know who doesnt and i will have words
allowing more bombs would be counter productive the issue isnt with the number of bombs so much as the amound of utility you can carrywith bomb payloads you could put a void payload in your first bomb and then your racial damage payload in the next etcmake these payloads really small chargesmaybe damage payloads larger than utility or maybe not i dont so much see this last bit happening

i have to agree with pretty much all ove isslers suggestions and i would add a few morethe first is one that accepts a number of realities1 it was originally conceived that low sec should be a jumping off point to null sec that is not the case perhaps in the past it was but it hasnt been the entire time ive been playing a bit over a year now its time to recognize that reality2 storylinewise the powers in new eden are the empires tough as the goons might be  they arent the amarr empire or the gallente federation but they have the better space huh how does that work that makes no sense at all3 given the above it makes sense for high sec to be the least profitable after all this is the heart of empire space and in addition to capsuleers there are all those npc corps and militaries doing their things what is left could be seen as the leavings not considered important enough for the big boys to bother with it would be nice to see some content ingame to support this and help extend the illusion of eves reality4 low sec is tougher to secure the border space between empires that they are in conflict hot or cold over these spots are like that for a reason if they were junk one empire would have left and ceded it to the other for a stable tradeable policeable border but for whatever reason they are not they are either strategically important or very valuable  hence the reason they are low sec and not developed more into more high sec space5 null sec is the unexplored save that its now all explored the dregs the areas too far away or too hard to defend for the empires to bother with there should be real gems out there for the null secs  but in general these areas should be less valuable than low sec save for very far from empire otherwise theyd have been gobbled up years ago by the empires6 what this means is that storywise low sec should see a large boost nerfing high sec isnt needed and is foolish the reality is that low sec is more dangerous to operate in than null sec that may not have been how it was envisaged but thats how its turned out out in null sec i know the boundaries and who are friends and who are foes in low sec the enemy could be anyone there are no rules for the outlaws and only some of them are flashy and even that doesnt show in local with the rise of the large alliances in null low is more hazardous to operate in not to pass through no bubbles but to mine or mission in much more dangerous in practicalityso low sec needs a big boost in addition to low sec only content worth going there for in terms of reward there needs to be better minerals much much better and things there you cannot get and actually need and want that arent available in high or nullfinally there needs to be some way to protect yourself there  a better balance of conflict between good guys and bad guys a way for good guys to move in and operate the police force idea is a good one there needs to be a system for actually defending ships adequately with sec status effects that make sense around it and missions need to be more difficult not impossible to bust into and interruptas well missions and pvp need to close so you can do both with the same ship fit and have it work out as long as they are different anyplace with pvp and pve had better have very secure pvp defenses like borders and intel channels or hugh payouts in order to be profitableone way to do this is to make missions mostly non scannable there are already jammers in some missions  be nice if they worked for the players as well as the npcs and make entry difficult locked to all save those who can unlock them by having a key or beating guards finally anyone in a mission should have be able to attack intruders
i just voted for you oz vuk has enough votes already
voted avalloc cause hes like a goon kennedy
the seal clubbing banner alone gets my vote 
hmmm think id rather not vote for kugutsumen as a csm
who said i am a man running an security company in indonesia anyways
the op has been updated with voting linkim also running for a political party now guess where i got the name 
definitely in favour of skirmish combat likin the simply providing more information ingame available to anyone who is interested thing tooquestion not including fw issuesproblems is there anything youd like to see in losec to improve its viability
my vote will be going to heartstonemet him last year at the fanfest and ig as well and have to say is a very good guy and am comfortable with my vote supporting his cause in the csm runregardsgilgamesh1980
you have my vote
vuk lau best lau you have my vote
got my vote the 2nd csm seemed to be a more nobs affair with some impressive results that helped the majority of the playerbase the state of the game is better today and ccp seems more accountable to the players in no small part to the 2nd sessionalthough not all of the credit can go to you you provided strong leadership and thus get my vote along with omber on another account
would just like to thank all my friends and allies who have contributed to my campaign process and all my votersa special thanks to all the former members of synthetic frontiers for their halfhearted campaigning and amusing commentary im looking at you mark
looked at all the candidates herschel has the most cogent organized and professional demeanor of all i can say this will be reflected in his approach to his csm duties if electedyouve got my vote good luck
i voted for you
i too am annoyed by the webifier nerf especially when i consider what effect this have on close range ships a little patch on the wound would be to add a falloff of 5km or 10km eg if falloff is 10km and the target is 15km away webifying the target would have 50 percent effect 50 of 60 when target is at 125km it would have 75 effect 75 of 60or another patch on the wound would be to make webifiers have 90 effect  1km and let it decrease to 60  10kmwhy i pointed out rockets as a individual point is because rockets to me has always been subpar i think they should be frigate sized torpedoes and not autocannons with projectiles still all missiles need to be looked at personnally i would just revert the changes and turn missiles back to what they werealso i remember a certain ccp dev posting that missiles should be all damaging without the need of any bonuses due to some ships having twinweaponsystems eg typhoon still waiting on that change thouand a random idea of mine remove eccm and make eccm scripts for sensor boosters also increase sensor booster activation level to 30 sec to limit instantswitch of script
i hope you mean me woo hoo o
i voted for you even though youre a scary looking dude
i voted for you too cause kernel made me
i voted for you too since i would like to get a pos in 00
september guess i lose this time
i recall issler from her days in the last csm and one read of her platform got my vote instantly although it was a close one as vuk was in there toosign me up for the party there issler voice of reason sounds sensible to memind you i mostly live in 00 and im primarily a combat pilot so i dont know if i really count as a carebear but i do happen to think that they are important to eve and need at least as much development to keep the game interesting if not more than those tussling over turf in 00
i think rp is an important part of eve i have created an entire alliance based on a crazy back story for example i would like to see rp have a way to affect story line direction and game contentissler
ive always enjoyed the roleplaying in eve it can be alot of fun used to do it alot more than now and still find theres a big following in eve for it and we do have some really good rps in eve i would say keep it up and i will be joining in more again 
my alt is ceo is a small minmatar fw corp ill be honest its not a major concern for me yes it could be improved but so could a lot of other parts in the game and fw already received a lot of development time in recent patchesexpansionsso while im always open for good fw ideas its not something i base my campaign on
i see no downside to this other than the work required to implement it  sorry ccp signed
yes definatly
signed i thought a pos would be like this at 1st and was later disapointed like us all
dd is fine triple dd is bad solution make ships invulnerable by dd in its area for rof timeafter ecm nerf spider tank is boosted dramaticaly if hp of supercaps be inscreased ogm dont support
good idea
yes definatly
signed remember to check the support box if you sign
 yes
supported
yes artillery sucks and a 100 role bonus to damage for projectiles would compensate for the nags relative lack of damage but what if the nag pilot decided to fit oh i dunno autocannons plus by removing the two missile hardpoints and not adding a third turret hardpoint which would require a total overhaul of the naglfar ship model youre giving the naglfar 2 extra high slots something no other dread has this could give the dread the ability to equip neuts or remote ecm bursts or god knows what else which goes against what dreads are meant to doperhaps just a 50 role bonus it would effectively give the nag 3 turrets instead of 4 and remove the extra high slot
no for the love of god noo that is perhaps the naglfars best attribute by a very wide margin making it horizontal will make it look like a terd the pheonix just dropped into the toilet you can do everything else just please dont make the naglfar lay down
yes obv
supported minmatar capitals do need some reworking i can deal with a difference in tank between ships because that is a pattern repeated in minnie subcaps as well but the naglfar is extremely handicapped it honestly seems as though it was designed like an oversized tempest meant for skirmish warfare but little else skirmish warfare doesnt really work in a dread maybe if it had higher dps perhaps comparable to a pheonix then there would be less of a problem but as it is its no good
yes please
yes
im not sure if this hase been discussed so here it goessince many alliances have special corps or people that inventbuild itemsammoships and sell them for extreme low prices to benefit all membersan example is to sell ships 203040this using moon minerals available in 00 cheaper yes but you dont want to sell it on the market for even blues and the only way to sell them is using trade or contractswitch are limited and is time consumingthen commes the ideea of creeating of an alternate market specialy for alliancecorp with something like 50 slots max exactly like alliancecorp contractsps had to give it a shot
definatly supported
i dislike nozhs style of work too there is no need in ecm drones fix and similar farfetched problemssupported
lolfirst i would like to say there are too many ccp fan boys here personally i could give a  but at least have some dignity and pretend to have a real reason for non supportsecond you act like nozh has some sort of executive power over development from reading his posts it sounds like he spends more times jumping through hoops running back and forth consulting different members of separate projectsalso keep in mind that eve has a general direction that wont change  eve is becoming a softer friendlier universe to appeal to a wider audienceadapt or die if anything i view these changes as a fun meta game to find advantages over other players  be more opportunistic they boost frigs buy a frig and win they boost recon go  in a recon if you cant be flexible you shouldnt be playing this game
thats quite a budget committment  i expected most people just to pay a subscription which is way lessone persons view who happens to be a customer does not magically invoke the right to dictate policy to a businessright so pointing out the obvious logical fallacy in the ops statement  that somehow his minuscle contribution to ccps earnings gives him the right to tell them how to run their business  is being a fanboysome people really do have an overinflated sense of their own importance to the game
well i dont knowthe balancing team has been doing rather terrible  especially with the nano nerf but seems to try and communicate more with the playerbase the issues tread and fixed a very big and old issue  the freaking vertical thingy what they should do however is evaluate their changes and things they balanced in the past year  and then look if they really did what they hoped they would dofor instance the nanonerf didnt do what they intended to do  ccp intended to keep the whole nanothing still viable  but well if you ask who is actually still succesfully nanoing  very litle people will answer itand i doubt putting someone else in charge of the balancing program will change things much so not supported because the balancing team hasnt been doing too bad lately and i dont think a new face would make it better
they are fixing a lot of things that dont need fixing lately except the naglfar
deciding who works for ccp is not your job how would you like it if nozh phoned your boss and told him to fire you
all you naysayers your firedgtfo and pack your bagsseriously leavethats what you wanted isnt oh im sorry you want him to go i thought you implied we had power to throw people out rightoops
honestly i doubt nozh is directly at fault for any of thosenozh in my opinion does a good job his team on the otherhand tends to cause bugs but even then thats still alright theres another team completely meant to fix those bugqa team with help from the bug hunters they are solely at fault for letting bugs get into the game even then its within reasonhowever if you have any experience with the bug reporting system its terribly horrible bug hunters will filter and essentially not pass on a bug basically all the timei bug reported gave logserver and such still got filtered now you have stickies in like all forums for the black screen issuethe bug report system needs to be fixed
all this is is a lynchmobyou morons just want someone to hang for your pathetic little whines and complaintsmaybe if you took the time to think about how they do the work instead of going off of what you see and what they see youd figure out that its not just one guyits an entire company
not supportedand i personally think the naglfar changes werent very good in my opinion it was ccps way of trying to1 make the nag a shield tanker however i dont think its really got much on the phoenix the extra mid slot doesnt improve the ships ability to armour tank either so its still a terrible dread to tank2 improve the nags bonuses so it would be a focused projectile weapon ship the problem is theres now two semiuseless launcher slots and there are plenty of existing minmatar dread pilots who have time tied up in a less meaningful citadel torpedo skill if they were serious about fixing the naglfar theyd have done what they did but perhaps give the ship 3x turret 1x launcher so it could outperform the other dreads with a token citadel launcher vs being a good tanker like the reston top of it all ccp have broken the trend of all race ships sharing an equal amount of slotsrevelation 4 4 8  16moros 4 5 7  16phoenix 4 7 5  16naglfar 5 6 6  17having said all this im glad to see ccp are attempting to fix certain issues like the naglfar but i just think theyre going about it the wrong wayif theyd have left the slot layout and cpupowergrid alone and just given the ship a greater bonus to both cap projectile turret and citadel launcher rof perhaps 10 or even changed one or the other to a damage bonus rather than rof then it would atleast be the best damage dealing dread around despite its poor tankso yeah good job on trying to address the issues for which were all thankful but please stop fixing issues that either dont exist therefore nerfing certain aspects of gameplay which youve been accountable for since as long as i can remember
completely supported in principle however id argue as i have before that a better approach is to involve the storyline and backstory more closely into eve in a more automated fashion to avoid the drain on resources that has been mentioned
i have to side with this end of the argument if you worked hard enough to get to 10 with a faction and with all the factions friends then you have unequivocably stated that you dont care about them their culture their values their interests their likes who their friends are and what they stand for if you take it that far if you go all the way out of your way to well and truly make enemies of a faction why would they ever have to give you the ability to claw backon old earth you could get kos with a faction for minor social infractions for mere trivia that hurt absolutely no one and nothing except a perception of pride and honor you werent even thinking of systematically methodically studiously and deliberately trying to get every single one of them and their friends to hate you to the very core of their beingso if someone in eve goes that far if they take it to that literal extreme that a faction and all the factions friends place them at the very farthest end of the like mehate me curve then either there should be no way back for them or it should take ridiculous amounts of time and a sisyphean effort to make it back a few sissy missions with a bit of risk should not even qualify as an effort to recoveryand who will be in this situation will it not be the pirate the master of their own destiny the very person who could not give a wet slap about their standing and reputation and now theyre crawling back its cold and lonely in the dark pits of exile they thrust themselves into it is now just that tad too much of an inconveniencetough cookies you make your bed and now you get to lie in it the cold mercy they so generously bestow on others should be shared with themno mercy for the mercilessabulurd bonifaceme meceo
this would be a cool idea so people who have mostly missile skills can also fly in remote rep armor gangs like me 
do want 
i think that the idea for selling kill rights and making them more viable is definitely an awesome change i also like the idea of turning low sec into a vegas style hive for the corrupt not just pirates there was one thing that left a sour taste in my mouth and that was smugglers cloaks i think that particular thing would have to be a very restricted item perhaps only be of use on say blockade runners i am not a carebear to a large extent but i know that local is the only thing that keeps miners and ratters safe in lowsec and 00 because there is no way to circumvent it if such a device would be applicable to a combat ship then the concept of ratting or mining on a small or even large scale would evaporate almost entirelybut so far the good far out ways the bad in corruption i support
as far as the smugglers cloaks i disagree with the idea of their existencethough i counter because i love their idea with delayed locali dont believe a cloak should have this magick disappear from local thingi do believe that you only know who is talking around you when theyre talking most other games dont even have memberlists for regions yes we have this omnipotent knowledge of who is in the solar system where we are hangin i feel this doesnt make sense and the fact that wspace is more fun for carebears than lowsec proves my ideals towards how local is way too broken for communication it should exist i like local but it should be delayed or even expanded further than that maybe its delayed other than whos on grid and have all cloaking act like you arent on grid for this variation on local
wow just wow
we need the covert ops ships
perhaps only allow a queue for anchoring the modules and not for onlining them
faster loading would be good but more features would be bad you especially dont want them to integrate something like mozilla into eve can you imagine the security problems or the number of patches that would happen to fix them with ccps patch record the game would never be playable
better that then ies standing naked in the doorwaychrome seems to be pretty good tho sandboxed browsers tend to be safebut in reality if they want to do it proper they should allow the user to control what browser they wish to use or trash the damn thing all together as its pretty much pointless to have in the first placenow an days people alttab or have a second compy
id like to say i support the idea but i think black ops role needs to be reworked overall ccp has done some bandages for them for now so im happy with that hopefully more fixes come soon isaac
all black ops receive the racial battleship skill bonuses of their true parent hull ieredeemer  armageddon with 1 low 1 mid 1 turret hardpointwidow  raven with 1 low 1 mid 1 high 1 mid 1 missile hardpointpanther  tempest with 1 low 1 mid 1 turret hardpointsin  dominix with 1 low 1 mid 1 high 2 turret hardpoints dominix has 1 less slot than the other bs so the sin gets an additional slot to balance it but loses an extra turret hardpoint in the processall black ops received a black ops skill bonus completely out of left field that makes no sense whatsoever ieredeemer viziam ie zealot tracking bonus this should be 5 damage per level or 10 optimal per level like all other viziam shipswidow kaalakiota ie crow nighthawk ecm strength bonus this should be 5 bonus to kinetic missile damage per level like all other kaalakiota shipssin creodron ie ishtar eos  agility bonus this should be drone bay or drone control range like all other creodron shipspanther thukker mix ie vagabond speed bonus this one actually fits though thukker mix is stupid for bs design and the 3rd4th bonus for thukker is always 10 range optimal or falloff per level or 5 damage per levelso the ships have glaring mistakes in their current design however as far as balance is concerned you need to do more than just fix those mistakes the panther needs to be changed to boundless creation ie sleipnir muninn wolf the sin not only needs to be changed to duvolle labs ie deimos astarte but also reworked as a megathron instead it should have a 6l5m8h slot layout based off megathron slot layout really a 7l4m8h slot layout would be ideal 6 turrets 125m3 drone bay and have 5 large hybrid turret damage 75 large hybrid turret tracking per gallente bs skill level bonus and either 5 turret damage or 10 turret falloff per black ops skill level bonus just like all other duvolle labs ships
even for all their faults if they only received 2 items i still think they would be rather nicea covops cloakits black ops why not it would make there niche just that much betterb longer jump drive range not as long as say a jump freighter or even a carrier but long enough to make it viable
they are already rather nice a cov ops cloak is unnecessary and would come at the cost of a nerf to the ship class making them worthlessthe sin needs the most help simply because drone boats dont mesh well with the way black ops are utilized it needs to be a megathron the marauder is for pve it should be the dominixthe only things the class as a whole really needs is the long overdue fuel bay and some tweaks to the 1st bonus from the black ops skill to match the ships design that i listed above a slight increase in base ly 2ly  3ly would make them more effective deep in sov 00 space simply because space is so spread out there their jump range is perfectly fine in low secnpc 00
ahh woops epic fail didnt meant to start new topic just reply sorry
my self and my friends like playing eve but we dont do the pvp side at all just pve we dont play the game a lot at all we dont have time to so we do when we can so income is low we stay well away from 04 and lower for obvious reasons loss of our ships is huge setbacks for us insurance does not work for uswe found being in a player corp together gave some majour benefits to usthe office we rent allows us to share items with each other when we are not all online at the same timethe coporation wallet and its divisions allow us to easily share the sales of loots from missions the divisions are important for when we do missions with different people and place items on the market so the sales go into a certain wallet when it sells a few days laterbeing in a corp throws us into a channel of our own automatically so we can see who is already online and easily fleet up and communicate the whole benefit of corp owned blueprintsstandings and an identitywe have been in a corp together for over 6 months we are still learning the game just recently we learnt something newbeing in a corp left us open to warefare we was ransomed for money we did not have we avoided conflict that we could not afford by not playing the game for a week just logged in to check status and waited it out till they got bored and retracted the decleration conflic would have set each of us back just over a month of gameplaywe only earn 5  20mil per mission split between 2  3 players every other night we play we do 1  2 missions a night during the week but not every night so our income is low for the cost of replacing a megathon or hyperion is hard to replace insurance does not work for the sheer cost of replacing all the modules and rigs is the same as the cost of the ship and they aint coveredwe belive the game really needs gang buddy system that has the features and benefits of a corpthe idea i have in mind is that a member of a gang can be a part of an ncp corp so they are not vunurable to corp wars where as another member of the gang can be in an player corp that might be at war and not bring that problem with him to the other gang members and so it is his or hers and their corps own problem alonethis flexability can allow frinds to play together much more closely but still remain independant from eachother if one wants pvp and the other pve only then they canjust think along the lines of communities and clans where each member has a collection of games some members play one game and others another but they all have at least one game they all own and play togetherpve is one game and pvp is another we want to play together but some in the clan want pvp and some want only pve and sometimes all of use want a bit of one or the other but nether the less we still want to communicate and share things but have indipant actions what happens to one in a corp effects everyone else in the corp
1 safe from wardecs stay in npc corp2 distribute loot  salvage without corp wallets designate a trader who handles the stuff who uses containers to keep stuff in orderly fashion if you need more advice how to set something like that up mailconvo me ingame3 if you cant afford to lose a rigged hyperion dont fly a rigged hyperion stay in your brutix or myrmidon for a little longer until you have enough cash to affort a ship loss 23 young characters can make much more money running level 3 missions in battlecruisers than running level 4 missions in battleships at least if you loot and salvage4 find alternative ways of making money there are plenty many dont require much more than a frigate and many dont even require you do undock at all5 wardec aggression does not transfer in a fleet if you are fleeted with someone who is at war he is at war and you are not he can get shot but not you6 eve is not meant to be safe not even highsec is supposed to be completely safe7 insurance is no meant to repay your losses it is meant to make them less severe otherwise ccp could just give unlimited ships to anyone8 there are other ways past a wardec and there are also other ways to fight and not lose incredibly expensive ships
dispite the points you make dont see why a buddy system cant be implimented anywaywhy would you post these points anyway and not just be for such a system bonous to the game with no drawbacks as it would have no effect on gameplay whats so ever just simply provide a better base from wich friends can better play togetherthere is still hassle involved with what you suggest i used to do it before i created a corpwe pay a lot to play this game when i say a lot i am comparing what the same money will buy you in regaurds to other games and renting servers for them 15 lets 1 person play eve or it gets you a server that lets 10 play gta or cod4 etcits only a small feature here for our moneys worthsolutions would bepersonal wallet divisionspersonal hanger rental with character permission access tableyou can create your own chat room in eve its more than half the solution to the corp channel needs all thats missing from it is a simple check box that states auto join this channel simple noif if a joinable gang group concept was created an identity to your group within any corp it would be a nice additional feature to the game but not really nescaserryso whats wrong with such simple changes
waa waa waa your ideas suck pvp is an integral part of this game and always has been go back to your no pvp wow server
try reading the ops post moronhes stating facts not whining about wardecsyour idea has merit but its complicated and covers up the real problemwardecs are a pay to grief system and while i do not oppose wardecs themselves i oppose the way they are usedand until wardecing is reengineered to provide that pew pew without the abuse you wont get anywhere
makes sense
i can see where op is coming from there is no denying that there is a stereotype about the french in all other races of eve there is no mention of any lineage from an earth nationality so why should there be for gallente it even says immediately afterwords that there is nothing besides that statement tieing the two races together so why is it even there im a gallente character myself and i just ignored the french thing when i joined mostly cause i love drones thoughim for the most part neutral on the subject i dont really care either way whether the gallente description is changed or not im simply pointing out that joseph has a valid point just as you opposers have a valid point as well
i have no idea what you are talking aboutapproved111
just because youre racist and dont know history doesnt mean the game should be anyone who knows history knows the french have actually won more battles and wars than they have lost the whole surrender monkey thing is angloamerican propaganda since ww2
i hate that you can press enter there and it postok so people want mining revampedthis is a givencsm mentioned an optional minigame in the style of how probing is a minigame for mining to get betterdifferent yieldalsoin this post checkitit mentions the idea of generic roids that you scan to see what multiple minerals are in them to minehighsec would have fewer but still have lowsec and next to none not none though 00 oreswell with the minigame idea it could raise chances to get these other ores while still giving the ability to mine like normalwe can even keep the roids how they are just have the minigame allow possibility of this stuff and massive profit gains in lowsec and maybe massive highsec gains in nullsupport and expand on this please
btw that enter thing in the topic box is a very simple forum fix ccp  offtopic
i support this idea mostly because i like how much eve tries to stick to a realistic and scientific side even if it is set 23000 or so years into the future i especially like the idea of making asteroid belts look like actual asteroid belts perhaps make them gigantic fields of useless roids with patches of mineable materials scattered around it certainly would give miners a much needed boon being able to sit several hundred kilometers away from a warp in point is always a good way to avoid being ganked the percentagedensity system is a very good idea imo very much like actual roids that are floating in space at this moment though i dont see why scanners would need a nerf so as not to show specific percentages and concentrations of ore i mean every ship has a warp drive capable of reaching faster than light speed i think a scanner should be able to pick up details like that
yeah and im trying to find the csm link in the wiki but its down for the next meetingbut the whole active mining idea where you have the option to actively pay attention to what you are doing while you eat rocks seems really really awesomeill post a link soon after the next meeting once we see where the current issues are at
i dont believe im alone when i say that the new jump graphic for capitals really fall flat when compared to preapocrypha effects before there was a marked difference between jumping through a gate and jumping using a capital especially the aweinspiring boom of a cap jumping in but why do the two now have the exact same graphic from what i have read the two things are completely different and the new effects really dont pay any tribute to what jumping a capital used to be like
this issue was already raised by your trulythe csm passed it by any chance we will be discussing it this afternoon
haha alright i wasnt aware of that glad to see something is being done
i love you
its nice that we can search through our assets by item namebut wouldnt it be nicer if we could search by system name constellation etcmaybe even search inside of containers
sorry for the empty post at first accidentally hit enter with the character box selected and posted as my alt lol
travel and safety why would people bring big nice toys or any thing at all into low sec when they will pop out on the other side of the gate and see 3 red flashy kers waiting for them they will be just ah tankin them gate guns while their ah waitin for someone at a disavantage someone like you or my personal favorite waiting for you when you undock and then its oh no my something expensive you worked hard to get just got blown up useally follow by oh no my implants what i got to wonder is how many people have quit playing because of these scenarios because it was not fair in anyway i bet we could fill a good sized high school gymnasium with them but what it amounts to is lost subscriptions and income for ccp you are probobaly thinkinghey just get some freinds and roll in there well sometimes freinds are not on because theyre at a movie or a family dinner and try asking something in local if you like the icy grip of silence staring back at you from the chat window if someone does agree to go with you who is to say they are not pirates themselves and there are those of us who do not want to ask things of others i was thinking about moving into low sec just a few hours before i wrote this rolled into raravath in a shuttle to check it out got chased by a red flashy who was 3 years older than me character wise and had alot more determination than most after 45 min of this crap with this dche trying to kill me in my shuttle while i made some book marks  i came to the irrevocable conclusion that low sec in general blows and who puts an mwd on a drake anyway if you want people in low sec do some thing about the gate camps and the station camps you have to go to those places to live there and you may need to use your hauler instead of your megathron once in awhile however the nice thing is you wont have to do anything about the belts because there are no gate guns in the belts and there will be this temptation to roll into the belts just to gank some cruiser rats mine just a little jaspet see whats going on try a little pvp in your punisher

i have voted for heartstonefurther i am confident that i could not have used my vote more effectively
although im not very impressed with the results of the csm so far i will be voting again the take care party seems the best choiceplease take note many people fly solo when determining the focus for your campaign goals and get some fwloving that is not eyecandy for us in the militias
to be very honest throughout my mmo gaming experience ive not once anticipated such a process where csms are voted inerik is the first friend ive made in game i cannot remember how weve met but perhaps it has something to do with the sisters of eve mission arci was new to the game captivated and taking my time with the baby steps erik was extremely helpful and patient when i bombarded him with questions about the game one day erik asked if i could be his fw adviser can you believe it im new to this game i dont know my way around im still trying to figure things out and here we have erik asking me for advise how about that his reasoning for my selection was because i was a nooblet fresh off the boat all excited and eager and he wanted a sense of perspective from a newcomer well erik that didnt make much sense to a nooblet but you have my vote not because youre the first friend ive made ingame but because youve shown genuine interest in opinions of even the minority us new players thats quite a big shoe youre about to step in erik and im confident that you will fit that role perfectlyps please excuse the grammar mistakes my english is quite pitiful

been away from the forums for a while been neglecting an important debatethis i can buy for sure but i think its important to keep in mind therefore that as hacs are to battlecruisers so af must be to destroyerswith presumably the following to finish the listhawk  cerb long range missile dpsjaguar  vagabond  fast close range dpswolf  munin  tanked close range dps100 agreedsupported  caldari af are a little brokenmy concern with this is that ccp are supposed to be denerfing rockets and having good damage and epic tank rather than just ok damage and epic tank makes me nervousa 300dps retribution drools i think that this would certainly be too much a speedagility boost though could hit the spot quite nicely but then why would you fly a jaguarthis wouldnt work for me  theres no point in having a drone control range that exceeds the targetting range of the ship though of course you could well fit sensor boosters but its a tough fit to get right i thinkid actually plump for a resist boost here most of the feedback i get is that when choosing twixt the two ships you can have the enyo or the enyo with drones and whod pick the enyo in those circumstances in this way it becomes a distinct choicethe point for me about not having the tracking bonus on the wolfjag is to do with dps reduction this is also why these ships operate in falloff  having that much dps without spending a drop of cap makes for a very powerful ship indeed ive not really logged enough time in these ships though to judge what else would fit  perhaps a 5 boost to velocity on the jag and a rep bonus or something for the wolf more postcards there please
the topic that will not go away until ccp caves in 
supported in general principle on the basis that the general direction of the changes promotes the followingtitan becomes less of an iwin vs conventional shipstitan becomes a platform for focused anticapital weaponsmothership gains increased utility on the fieldsupercapitals are deployed as part of a coherent fleet with mixed ship typesi would love to see titans deployed on the field and take part in sustained capital engagements taking heavy fire from enemy ships and being suppported by motherships and carriers for reps i am not a supercap pilot but i do imagine that changes which promote sustained use over sitting in a safespot cloaked would increase the fun vs investement payoffsome things i wouldnt like to seeone shotting dreads any action should have a counterable action perhaps a level of damage that allows a two shot unless very heavy reps are applied to the targeted dread within a rate of fire window of maybe 30 seconds realistically if that dread was also taking sustained fire from other caps it would likely die quickly anyway but this would at least allow a chance of response based on player skill at handling repscap killing dd i think this would simply see titans used in a similar manner as currently hostile fleet jumps into system and into a ton of bubbles titans cap dd and hostile fleet is stuck in bubbles with no cap available to mwd out or rep each other effectively friendly fleet warps in and picks them off anything which continues to promote one sided fleet enagagements at gates over more balanced battles in system simply reduces the element of player skill and removes fun that can be had taking part in lengthy battles on a more even tactical field similar for heat damage granted it would be more fun for the side picking people off at least they dont camp a gate for 2 hours just so one pilot can boom and they all go home but eve is a two sided game and changes that promote fun for all are preferable
there are already counters to dd like dodging them jumping in parts of fleet anti bubble warfare etc the difference between removing cap and heat damage or 1 shot kills is obvious 1 allows you to continue fighting if the worst happens the other ends the fight in one flash1 cap injector counters the 0 cap issue while still giving the titan dd a significant advantage the point is you want a dd to be massively effective you also give more of a role to capless bs in fleet fights by doing this hello sucky minmatar and caldari you dont want a dd to be a 23 pilot afair against enemy fleets you should have to work harder than what is currently necessary to have such a huge effect on enemy fleets
i agree that the dd changes as proposed would make fighting less of a 23 player affair however those 23 players still have a massive impact on the opposing fleet using any area of effect weaponsnipers fitting a cap injector are going to gimp range it would still be a turkey shoot from the defenders point of view same if the fleet entering system lost all its module functionality to heat damageany kind of aoe which can impact unlimited targets has an exponentially detrimental impact on the fleet it is used upon removing this so that fleets have more of a chance to fight on equal terms creates an envirnoment where more pilots can havefun in longer sustained battlesmove the titans role to cap killer and the whole business comes down to numbers sure but numbers can be countered with skill and tactics played out over time good fcs can adapt to circumstances sieze opportunities as they develop and turn the tide of a fight that will only happen in longer fights not fights decided by aoe

eve voice causes more complications than it resolvesa not every one uses it eve voice was an attempt to resolve the issue of ts vs vent but rather it created ts vs vent vs eve voiceb incompatible with quite a few setups or sound cards ie having a usb and a sound card eve voice goes thru sound card no matter what option you choosec most corps big or small have a ts or vent server most militia factions have one available to themso i propose eve voice shuts down to save cpp some money and save us some headache

supportedthe only problem i see is that of the starting point for the arcif the starting agent is located in only 1 system even if the follow up missions are in different random systems the starting system would simply become another of the constantly camped system this would require several entry agents for each faction and that they are placed away from the low sec mission hubs
i dont really see how more monitoring could be an effective or efficient solution something alittle more intuitive is needed to make their lives harder the same way more gms isnt going to solve macrosone possible improvement would be to place limits on what trial accounts are allowed to say in public channelsdisable clickable linkssensor www you could even add specific word sensors for sites that continue to pop up i doubt there are hundreds of sites being spammed or anythingremove formatting and special charactersautomatically flag for review after the xxth post in a row containing the word iskits not something thats easy to fix and important not to put too many restrictions on so that you arent inhibitting legitimate new players it is however fairly simple to come up with some simple devices and filters that would make the isk sellers job conciderably harder

if the queue has no effect at all in the speed of towers to setup or the number manageable in a system then yeah its a nice addition theres no reason to take up that many hours of someones time for something as mundane as thisthat said pos in general are just terrible and even worse when you get into pos warfare and sov mechanics id rather see a broad overhaul of the entire system but as long as it doesnt take the place of a solution this would be a nice interim improvement

hiyeah i know this topic has been brought up before for sure bla bla blabut i realy think it is time for ccp to release the t2 bpoUFFFDs for the ormal marketthe prices should still be high but it should be an option to grab one from the npc market like t1 bpoUFFFDsmaybee they could transform invention to be able to invent faction andor officer items with it also so invention is not lost at all
before the apocrypha patch new player retention rate was around 50 and under the new player experience was horrible we all remember the learning curve picture with the cliffworse still absolutely none of the csms from previous elections addressed new player concerns not a single onethen the apocrypha patch releases and with it ccp promises to revise the new player experience unfortunately the revisions have had the opposite effect players are just plopped into the game like a naked baby out in the middle of the woods zero direction 94 less skills a confusing and fragmented tutorial and an army of griefers taking advantage of them something i personally experienced as a new playerit seems that learning cliff has become even higher and steeper i dont have the numbers as ccp has not released them but i have no doubt that retention rate hasnt improved one biti doubt anyone will disagree with the opinion that eve has the worst new player experience out of any mmo on the marketas a player running for csm what is your opinion on this what do you plan to do to address this ever present problem in eve im asking you this because you vaguely mention new player experiences most other csms dont even have the words new and player in the same sentence let alone addressing relevant concerns
thanks to all of you for the support

a bump and reminder to everyone to voteissler dainze  providing three years of carebear bliss to tada o a quote from another candidate in an earlier forum thread debate
so it has all come down to the vote finally im rather astounded that this time around i have not yet made up my mind on who to vote for maybe the candidates in my corner of the political spectrum have not had that high charisma score to pull me over whatever the reason i find myself leaning towards either erik finnegan or issler dainze but im not even sure there about themi used to be a staunch supporter of take care but i have been less than impressed by some of eriks statements avoiding concrete answers and statements of intent in some instances proposing some very prosandbox antinpc views elsewhere as well as his inability to put a stop to the fight surrounding his candidacy issler while covering many of the same topics and yet sporting a cleaner record seems to stand on a bit too broad a carebear platform where it does not quite come clear where she will side on issues likely to divide said demographic and i still haven found that website hes promised us last monthnow neither has deigned to reply to second questionnaire so i might gonna need help decidingim looking for a candidate of shrewd tenacity who is both able to sway others to herhis causes as well as seek and find a working compromise regardless of petty personal quibbles he or she should have a vision of eve where  a wide variety of playstyles is actively supported players are not forced to team up to accomplish most things and the individual will not automatically lose to the group choices will have real and lasting consequences immersion does not take the back seat to cheap balancing tricks npcs and their corps are more than static mission generators and rats but the basis for a rich and vibrant game world that gives meaning to player actions beyond grind and pvp the cluster feels as big as it really is by filling that space with danger diversity and uniqueness and preventing players to cross it in a couple minutes your ship actually feels like a gargantuan thing of steel and glass several hundred meters in length instead of just another generic matchbox rocket among thousands of clones you can have fulfilling and varied gameplay even if you are only able to play a few hours per week in short sessions great rewards are always preceded by even greater risk some say they want eve to be a sandbox for us players me id rather use my shovel in a cool theme park than on a barren sqare of quartz sand

i strongly support this idea
while at it flip the range bonuses between the two theyre completely out of whack with all of the other bonuses on each of the hulls
thanks for the reply foolish ill try and address the contentious pointsfirstly with regards to the hac comparison i deliberately excluded the minmatar ships the jag definitly has vaga like characteristics but the vaga is built around fighting with barrage outside of web and scram range even with small autocannons a falloff bonus and falloff rigs youd need to be just outside overheated web range to be getting more dps than with artillery with a very high risk of messing up and getting killed but then on the otherhand the muinin pretty much always used with arty from what ive seen which the wolf isnt switching the falloff and optimal bonus would certainly help but with the difference between small and medium projectiles the afs and hacs just cant function in the same way so as to the tracking bonus the wolf is out dpsd by every one of the gank style afs enyo retribution harpy and even the ishkur which is a tackle af the jaguar fairs a little better but only because 2 of the tackle afs are lolrockets the point of minmatar ships is to use their speed and flexible weapons to outfight the enemy where they are weakest the ability to do this is a fair trade off for less dps although it requires more thoughtful piloting you cannot always try to sit in falloff do this against a blaster harpy a retribution or an enyo who decides to load long rage ammo and youre not going to do well against these you need to get in up close and use superior tracking to win without a tracking bonus some of these fights are unwinnable problems are also caused in situtaions where the enemies tracking is borderline enough to hit you for example an autorupture you need to be as close as possible going as fast as possible having to slow down so your guns can hit is just silly rocket ships yes it does look like rockets will be getting balanced this is great if ccp are sensible we can only hope theyll also look at rocket using ships at the same time perfect solution balance rockets so that rocket using afs will be doing around maybe 150 dps with a second damage bonus plus the explosion velocities and radius sorted out so they can actually hit frigate sized targets ok given that they are both tackle syle afs and can hit out to 6km this seems reasonable to me although im not a big rocket user so am happy to be told im wrong here retribution 300 dps sounds silly but then a coercer with 3 heatsinks gets well over 300 i hear a lot of talk about lasers being overpowered and i can see why when i look at the numbers here being able to do a lot of dps but with significantly worse tracking and no tackle  is a fair trade given the lack of speed and agility of a ret but yeah im still unsure here but i dont think i would have a problem with a 300 dps retribution if it was unable to hit a jag or whatever in a tight orbit and i was able to hit it iskur and enyo there is definitly not enough to distinguish these at the moment dare i say it the ishkur overpowered it really shouldnt be doing the same dps as a wolf i would think maybe 200 dps down from 220 atmwould be appropriate as the ishkur is the tackle af i would have thought it should be getting the tanking bonus a resist bonus could suit if the dps was gimped a bit or of course the armour rep bonus that ccp loves for gallente ships that leaves us with some kind of gank bonus for the enyo just a thought but how about a reduction to both mwd and ab cap use similar to other blaster boats but also helping out with the ab scram fit i really am struggling with the enyo 
i didnt check to see where this is on the forums its just been awhile since i bumped it 
definitely agree something needs to be done the amount of offline poses you can find in even a single highsec system is rather ridiculous if anchoring a gsc and paying no further upkeep to prevent others from being able to use a moon is not permitted i dont see why anchoring a pos and paying nothing further should be eitheron the plus side this would provide another isk sink via the npc supplied fuels if the owners wanted to keep their poses in placegive folks a bit of leeway in terms of inability to get to the pos to fuel it but at the same time need to ensure the leeway itself isnt open to exploitation eg having it require a month of continuous offline status means you only need to pay for an hours fuel each month and so the placeholding would still pretty much be free whereas if it instead something like if it was offline for more than half the month  at least then theyd have to fork out for 15 days of fuel per month15 days of fuel for a pos with no active modules would still be pretty cheap but at least its cost something to keep a moon out of the hands of othersprobably should also avoid issuing corporations with a evemail warning beyond the pos being out of fuel as in no warning that the pos is about to be unanchoredself destructedhackable or whatever other mechanic gets employed to solve the issue
i saw the post about the csm submissions and the entry
bah did not notice that is used an alt that i have set up for termination
id tend to agreewhen i raised the small freighter issue i wanted exactly what you wanted ccp said that they would give us the orcabut it turned out that it wasnt quite what was requested i did tell ccp that i wasnt quite satisfied with the orca as a small freighter alas
agreed
damnation or eos or vulture has a completely wacky different training path also doesnt mean much certainly doesnt mean its not a command shiporca is a small freighter and serves that purpose quite well
bigger cargo bay then indy t2s yesable to carry rigged ships even though no other freighters technically can yesis half the size price etc of a freighter yescan tank like indys yes within reasoni see no reason to add yet another freightoriented ship isaac
something crazy is happening i agree with jason edwards
sniper fits would hardly be affectedaoe is fine so long as its more nuisance than pwn the point of a dd is to turn the tides of battle meaning a smaller force has a greater chance right now titans alone win fights requiring hardly any support to do so obviously there are exceptions to that this idea is meant to keep the devastation but remove the 3 pilot affect on fleets ie if you wanna kill my fleet and ensure your titans live you better damn well bring backupas ive stated now many times titan dds atm are the most overpowered and under performing things in game which is why titans are ghetto you either miss horribly and run the risk of complete catastrophy or nail a fleet and laugh in the future i think said changes would bring far more strategical purpose to why a titan or fcs would even want to dd you worry about cap but comparing cap to the actual existence of a ship is no comparison as someone who runs fleets titans to me are such a double edge blade i personally have no desire to use titans for anything other than massive blobs when im massively outgunned however most people in titans are out to dd anything and everything for s and giggles that removes fun factor for anyone on either side of the fight every time we dd an enemy fleet with our own fleet waiting 100s of pilots see a wasted fight is that fair to them allowing them to go in after a dd and get said fight seems far more appropriate even if the enemy fleet is gimped
wholeheartedly agree which is why i also disagreesupporting vuk laus cap killer proposal for the titan over a change to dd that leaves it as an unfocused weapon vs smaller ships promotes more fighting for all piltots this is especially the case in the early moments of battles when the attacking fleet has to jump in i cant imagine anyone disagreeing that the fleet that jumps in isnt already at a significant disadvantagemany of the attacking fleet will be out of range to shoot the opponents gathered in a snipe spot the defenders on the other hand can concentrate all their firefleet jumping in cannot make effective use of remote reps to counter that for the same reason the fleet is spread outthe defending fleet has freedom to move and warp off unless a skilled dictor pilot makes it through the attacking fleet is bubbled regardless of player skill and often for 50km or from the gatepersonally i dont see the difference between dieing to the actual dd as it currrently stands and dieing a couple minutes later to a sniper fleet while i amcapped out in a bubble not able to shoot or mwd or if i fit an injector i can shoot but dont have the range to hit a dedicated sniping opponent giving up a midslot on a sniper for cap injection on every attacking ship is going to hand the defending fleet a huge tactical advantage in terms of its ability to dictate rangeworse still sitting in a bubble with completely burned out heat damaged modules not able to shoot cant mwd turkey shooting ftlgranted at least the defending pilots get to shoot stuff but that hardly addresses the fundamental imbalance that exists as a result of titans being an aoe platform vs subcapital ships
youre assuming an alive fleet with 0 cap is helpless i think many people would disagree with that statement youre taking 1 instance jumping into a bubbled gate as it accounts for every instance most dd are not fleets jumping into massively bubbled gates theyre fleets on grid bubbled by dictors consider it the fcs fault if hes dumb enough to put you at that disadvantage wo a plan in your scenario in all other scenarios this type of dd plays out far better than most other ideasa dread killer titan is a joke just like a fleet killer titan is a joke aoe is fine it just cant be a direct damage effect like it currently isi seem to think you missed the part where a titan dd was supposed to turn the tides of fleet battles everyone wants that they just dont want direct damage affects
unfortunately the natural tendency with titan area of effect weapons is simply to stack them upwhen one doomsday wasnt enough people used two then three i imagine the same will continue to happen and any change to another area effect will simply result in the same no change to the essential use of titans warp in dd warp off same essential devastating effect on the dded fleet
there is no problem with availability of veldspar in nullsec we specifically dont mine veldspar because it is economically unfeasible to haul veldspar to a refinery when there are hauler spawns that drop tens of millions of tritanium for veldspar to be viable to mine in nullsec it would have to yield much more tritanium per cubic metre of veldspar orethe way i mine at present is keep running missions until i find a sizable pocket of veldspar eg mordus folly recon 1 of 3 bring in mining fleet mine veldspar until downtimeto reduce the market price of veldspar youd have to make it available in higher concentrations than currently available at 4 isk per unit each unit being 01m3 its barely enough to justify mining in the first place if the concentration of tritanium in veldspar was to increase by an order of magnitude the volume of supply would go up the price of tritanium would plummet and the values of the other oresminerals would riseas for the actual mining mechanic i dont want the actual process of mining to become any more involved than it already is i like mining as a nice relaxing exercise i can participate in while catching up on realworld choresthings that would make mining more interesting without interfering with the relaxed gameplay would be to change all system belts to be just plain veldspar with exploration sites yielding interesting ores eg a smattering of kernite along with huge planetoids of superdense veldspar the mining director would scan the belts and tag rocks to be mined by various specialists who would then calibrate their mining tools and start pointing lasers at rocksmacro miners could keep doing their worst in system belts while those of us prepared to invest a little effort in handson belt discovery can find these exploration belts with the good oresin the meantime we need vastly improved supplies and mobility of tritanium in order to boost the value of the other minerals more tritanium for less money means the manufacturers will have more money left from their budget to spend on the other mineralsof course a side effect is that the 40 minerals from reprocessed items figure will start being terribly skewed since these vast quantities of tritanium being hauled around the place will start appearing in the form of whatever manufactured item has the best mineral compression available at the moment
why mine arkonor bistot or crokite when you can mine uber dense rocks of veldspar instead i love these new changes it really is something to look forward to veldspar here i comeamidoinitrightif you look at old dev blogs and what ccp have reported then you will see that ccp have said that they want to redo the entire mining system in the lines of what has been mentioned but arent sure yet as to how it will affect the community or game that is why they havent changed the way mining works as they dont want everyone to stop mining in 00most of what i have read here is about veldspar its obvious either most have never set foot outside of highsec or have an obsession with veldspar and are intent on forcing everyone else to mine just because its the best in highsec funny thread fails to deal with the issues at hand and fails miserablylast but not least ccp have already said they will revamp the entire system by or after 2010 all these so called initiatives are a waste of time as ccp wont implement anything until then
you know ive supported this idea in the past but need to put my vote in here as well composite asteroids are the best way to revamp mining passes the common sense idea and would put more use in scouting for rocks it would make using a survey scanner a necessity for maximizing yields and take a little more thought than just lockactivatehaul though unlike other mining minigame ideas does not eliminate the ability to simply lockactivatehaul
how about set drones to aggressive launch drones come back 30 mins later loot finalise mission
i support the idea 100 and would love to see its implementation within the gamekeep up the good ideas

i cant support this since it would make destroyers  bcUFFFDs for salvaging purposes obsolete and i dont want this to happen smaller than bs sized ships should be useful for as many different roles as possibleand atm we have the marauders and t3 cruisers for the added boni for tractor beams your proposal would substract from their usefulness as well
at the risk of going off topic by complaining about skill training times again i will point out that marauders are unreasonably hard to train for considering what youre getting im currently flying a raven to get into a golem would take me over twoandahalf goddamn months just to get inside the hull never mind the t2 launchers and all that anyone who thinks a marauder is a reasonable choice as a salvager needs to adjust their definition of reasonablei see no real reason why not to implement larger tractor beams since theyd obviously have higher fitting requirements its not like you could just replace the smalls on your destroyer with mediums theyd actually make using ships other than destroyers or marauders as salvagers a viable option people who oppose things purely on the grounds that theyre not necessary need to stop and realize that itching feeling they get when they sit down might just be that stick they have up their ass supported

no offense but f that such a nerf would not only leave supercapitals incredibly vulnerablenot cost effective in any way shape or form very much useless but it would also make them dissapear from the game until the nerf was rolled back due to a sudden drop in subscriptions the authors proposal while a bit on the radical side still brings up some issues that really need attention first and foremost being the mothership supercapitals need to be more involved in fleet fights instead of being useless sitting ducks for anybody who cares to cyno a dread in

ill keep supporting these threads until it gets fixed
agreed i ran a newbie through 21 days of trial to see what i could accomplish with them and filed no less than 40 isk spam petitions often the target was back to spamming within 15 minutes having changed only 1 letternumber in their name one guy i petitioned 7 times under 7 different names in 15 hoursalso newbs should have the option of closing those channels
as ive said before we need a spam button on our chat rclick the name then select spamthe target is immediately blocked to you until you log outif enough such spam selections activate on a char in a given period of time they recieve a short gag an hour or two if enough short term gags add up theyre temp banned a gm takes one look at their chat logs and boom forever gone owing that theyve not already been petitioned multiple times for isk spam and thus already bannedalso ccp needs to get rather invasive the client should always report the nic address of the host if the host recieves a ban for blatant violations of the eula they recieve a nic level ban this bans the hardwired identity of their network interface card so they cant access the game without changing their cardyes i have no idea if this is even possible but it would be damned nice if so

this would make an end with the ever so manipulated kill boards out there and i think it would surely be fun to always being able to check rankings  statistics ingamebut the individual player should be able to decide if they want their own kill board statistics to be publicly viewable or being private
so basically have the option to make your combat log public might be nifty but i doubt itd see much use  there is no way ccp is going to make a killboard half as good as the private ones and we already have apis to fill them with reliably and easily could fill a niche similar to eve voice as the cheap lowhassle version for players who want basic functionality though ill support this as an issue but i only want to see ccp do it if its easy and of course you need to have the option to keep it private
if totally optional i support this by totally optional i mean pilots have the option to have both thier wins and thier losses not displayed example pilot joe uses the public killboard pilot sam has opted out of the public killboard joe kills sam the kill doesnt show up publicly for either pilot because sam has opted out
oso right now we have a pretty terrible system for finding out who needs armouretc when flying in a remote rep gangs for a small gang of ships 510 it works fine but as soon as you start going over that you run into two big problems1 watch list cant support more than 10 people2 broadcasts being flooded and being too hard to tell how long ago a broadcast was madewell i figured the 10 people max had something to do with the server struggling to keep track of the hitpoint status of a whole fleet but thats no reason to leave it in the nerfed state it is atmi propose that changes are made so that when you broadcast you are automatically added to the watch list of everyone in the wingfleet  all depending on fleet settings of course if you have 10 people in the watch list already the oldest person would get removed to make space for a new onethis would make staying on top of broadcasts much easier and help battleship gangs massively  particually when fighting without cap support ie in a hostile cynojammed system especially when trying to disable the jammer itselfum thats it do point out anything i missed
supporting my own topic
watch lists are also used for covops pilots giving wp ins logistics piltscarrier pilots spider tanking and cap transfer probably a lot of other things too that people need to keep an eye onalthough i do think the system can be messy with a lot of broadcasts that can be managed with good pilotfleet disciplinenot supported
well youd be able to change the settings on it as need be its just an idea  not quite refined yet yes you would need to be able to lock people on watch list if you didnt want them disappearing but keep all unlocked spots for broadcastsas for fleet discipline  i see what youre saying a good fc and good piloting should be rewarded but when you have for instance 25 battleships at a hostile cynojammer and half of them are taking heavy damage from both pos guns and enemy supportcarriers the current watch listbroadcasts system simply does not work
as a hac pilot when you move to your respective command ship you get a really good antisupport that uses more of the same medium weapons and survives ddd its a logical hac upgradeas a logistics pilot when you move to your respective command ship you give a really solid boost to gang performance usually with a defensive focus that enhances the role of logistics its what you graduate to as a logistics pilotas a recon pilot recon is currently the end of the lineon the other hand we have a set of unused bc hulls unlike the tier 1 bc hulls which have as a whole more defensive bonuses the tier 2 hulls are a little beefier on stats and have more blatant damage oriented bonuses harby and hurricane being the obvious examples tier 2 bcs without stating specifics should without a doubt be adapted into something more aggressive than the tier 1swhat is a t2 tier 2 bc rolewhat is a recon upgradedeimos is to astarte as arazu is to do these questions not highlight the serendipity of a bc derived recon upgrade
we need large or capital scale neuting or smartbombing or heatwarfare which in of itself will make it anticapitalslarge smartbombs  ship bonusheavy neuts  ship bonus and not a bhaalgorn lolheat warfare slowly incap all ur enemys modules something like lets say heat battlecruiser directs heat into target shipheat warfare lvl 5 means that your target needs thermodynamics 5 to be able to survive him if he has lvl 4 his modules will slowly take damage if at lvl 0 or 1 the ship will be fairly quickly disabled
i agree that we need t2 tier 2 bcsdoesnt make sense that they arent therethink that this would would make for some very nice tactics on the field of battle
no you got a bs size upgrade imho an astarte and deimos are not really related
sigh if you call lolblack ops the upgrades of recons just because black ops use a few skills that are also good skills for recon pilots to have then marauders are the bs graduation path for hac pilotsas neither marauders or black ops require any t2 cruiser prereqs they are barely relatedfurthermore recons require sig analysis v and electronics upgrades v neither of which will get you into a black ops any faster yet hacs require weapon upgrades v which will get you into a marauder fasterskillwise recon pilots get a bit left out talking about black ops is kinda unrelated
im actually going to be pulling ideas that i was posting in a previous thread about the same topic created by lana torrin new bounty systemmy ideas are actually inspired by lanas idea and continues to expand on it with a couple more additions aqnd some changes to the original ideathe new bounty system will pay out bounties based on the destruction of players ships andor pods the amount of isk paid out would be equal to only 60  75 of the destroyed ship item and implant values the only way for a player to receive the full or almost full value of the kill is to work specificly as a bounty hunter which i will define laterhow does a pirate get a bountyin the system there will be two ways for a pirate to receive a bounty1 as with the current system any player with negative security status can have a bounty of any amount placed on them by any player2 a pirate with 20 security status becomes eligible to receive concord sanctioned bountiesa concord sanctioned bounty is gained by committing a criminal act for simplification the destruction of an unagressed ship after the ship is destroyed concord will place 10 of the ships value as a bounty on the piratebasicly the more a pirate yarrs the larger his bounty will become meaning that killing a good pirate will almost always net some money for the pirates killerthis concord sanctioned bounty would be added to any preexisting player bounties that may already be in placewhat this also means is pirates now have a new epeen tool my bounty is bigger than your bounty to add to the epeen factor we could also give the pirates color coded skulls to make them feel special for having the red 300 mil bounty skull as opposed to the purple 10 mil bounty skull bounty hunterany player with a security status of 20 would be allowed to engage in bounty hunting to do this they would talk to bounty agents who would for a small fee allow bounty hunters to hunt targets for a set period of time lets say 1 weekbounty hunters are allowed to engage their targets in high sec even allowing podding they are also given the abiltiy to collect private bounties however the targets given out by agents are random a pirate may only have a set amount of bounty hunters chasing him at a time the amount of bounty hunters is based on the amount of the bounty for every 50 million isk one additional bounty hunter is allowed to have kill rights on a pirate at a time global and private bountiesglobal bounties are bounties payed out upon the destruction of a pirate to all parties involved global bounties are paid out at a maximum of 6070 of the value of the destroyed ships items and implants global bounties can be collected by anyone including other piratesprivate bounties are only available to bounty hunters assigned to the pirate private bounties pay out as much as 90  100 of the value of the destroyed items as well as enabling a bounty hunter to turn in a pirates corpse for an added 5 to 10 bonus to the previous payout to prevent players from stockpiling pirate corpses the corpse must be turned in within an hour of receiving a pirates bountywhere do the corpses goif pirate has multiple bounties and i turned in the corpse who gets the corpsein this sitaution i would say that the corpse goes to the highest player bounty contributor basicly if pirate a has a 150 million bounty which is broken down into75 million isk bounty placed by concord50 million bounty from player b25 million bounty from player cin this scenario player b would receive the first corpse and player c would receive the second corpsein the event that a pirate only has a npc bounty than concord would give a small bonus lets say 5 of the previous payout for the corpse
but we cant give the pirates nothingwith the introduction of this new system many pirates and pirates will find themselves with a little more heat on them then they might otherwise be used to so pirates will receive evemails regularly that will let them know how many active bounty hunters may be chasing them and whether they have been online in the last 12 hoursalso a pirate who is uncomfortable with a rather large bounty on his head would be able to rat down the concord portion of his bounty by killing npc rats he can lower the total concord bounty on his head however the player bounty portion is permanant until collected by another playerhow can we accuratly get the value of items to be added to a pirates bountyfor most modules this would be easy the averages could be received from the average payout of contracts  market prices for the particular item this would probably be the most difficult portion to implement and may have to be limtied only to the ships and implant values instead of also including fitted modules
reservedjust incase
which soon as the bounty amount becomes larger then the clone value it is smart for the pirates friend too shoot and pod himwhich just means moar isk for his friendsnever true infact it doesnt even have to be a friend many people have alts which can do itso the pirates friend simply has to keep 20 sec pretty easyno the bounty system literally has to become like fail warfare and militiaspeople opt into being bounty hunterspirates opt into being piratesantipirates opt into being antipiratesonce standings start being wrecked when bounty hunting and whichever piracy the system starts to balance not only that even if you dont opt in your standings can force you into itthusly a 501 sec will force you into being labeled a pirate which makes you fair game to be killed by antipirates same with antipirates kill enough of the pirate faction you become antipiratebounty hunters can find themselves in the same boat
read carefully how will the pods value ever become more than the pod value if you only receive 60 to 70 of the pods value on the kill the money received comes from only destroyed itemspirate pays 1 mil for a clone and his freind pods him he gets 600k backyou need to read the post much more carefullyedit to clarify though i think i made it pretty clear in the postpirate a has 100 mil bounty on his head and is flying a harbinger value 40 milpirate a is destroyed by player bplayer b receives 75 of the value of the harbinger 30 million30 million is deducted from the pirates total bounty which is now 70 millioneven if the pirate kills himself guess what he just lost a harbinger and gets back only 30 million which is like crap insurance or just underselling on the market
as soon as you start putting concord bounties on player owned ships you run into the problem of folks getting max insurance on a ship and then having their own alt popping that ship for the ship bounty plus the insurance which would be worth more than they lost so they start can start a infinite loop of endless isk
i know beating a dead horse herehow about when a player is podded the bounty is only paid up to the value of the clone they are usinghowever the full bounty is paid out if the player loses sp from not having an up to date cloneyaynay
supporting my own thread obviously
if youre basing bounties on actual damage inflicted then dont limit them to poddings include ship damage in the mix that said something along this line is needed
at the moment podding is the only way to get a bounty payout moving it to being on ship destruction while easier for low sec is hard because ships can be insured so no way of telling how much damage you have actually inflicted
well the game knows how much damage was inflicted even if the bounty hunter doesnt i like the idea of bounties being commensurate with the value of loss to the target  value destroyed less the amount of related insurance payout and skillpoints lost due in death if anyim not sure how to work that into the bounty system practically though so supported for the concept but obviously some details to work on

i think t3 needs time to settle in before throwing more options at it currently there are issues with manufacture and cost and the ships are not in common enough use to gain a full view of their balance in gamegive them time before more changes
awesome
bump if no replies are made to this post after this i will let it bury itself
dont let this theme bury ill help very actual and most wanted feature  customisable ui just look at feature forumwe need it
as far as i can tell race and bloodline are now purely aesthetic why not expand the character portrait change to allow sex and bloodline perhaps even race of course it would still have a fee im sure a lot of people are unhappy with how their character looks and would pay to change it simple friendly change
once walking in stations hits you will have to recreate your avatar anyways so this issue is kinda pointless at this pointhowever the ability to change your race just seems wrong
i agree with this
i assume you include bloodline with raceas a new player ive not experienced race matters again please correct me if im wrong but there are no in game implications for race and bloodline they are now purely aestheticflavori can understand how the suggestion would seem unreasonable and wrong and i dont want to push it further than that but we already die and are cloned with our minds intact whats wrong with a little genetic tweak 
its your own silly fault for choosing a baldie tbh oh wait darn
the devs havent actually stated the 3sec delay after gate decloak is a bug or intended feature only that the mwd terminating on cloak is a bugheres hopping that it will be corrected
the 3 second delay to activate modules after the postjump decloak needs to go

avalloc has a ton of experience with eve and will really make a difference
voted for avalloc because of his sense of humor and because he knows eve like almost no one else
i have changed my view of the highseclowsecnullsec income situation previously i stated that level 4 missions should be moved to lowsec which is no longer the case mission and npc bounty rewards for lowsec should be increased nullsec 00 space should have rat bounties increased as well so that it yields the highest reward over that of mission running in highsec reward the people who are actively getting their ships blown up or destroying them which in turn stimulates our eve economy

 a wide variety of playstyles is actively supportedi rat scan mission mine and occasionally help kill people players are not forced to team up to accomplish most things and the individual will not automatically lose to the groupi would love to see
i think i am a good pick for you let me respond to some of your points a wide variety of playstyles is actively supportedi believe that it is the range of experiences in eve that are separates it from other games i will always support keeping those experiences as diverse as possible players are not forced to team up to accomplish most things and the individual will not automatically lose to the groupsolo play is very important there will always be reasons why players will want to do something alone and not in a group i believe this is also an important part of eve choices will have real and lasting consequencesabsolutely immersion does not take the back seat to cheap balancing tricksi want to see things that increase immersion if i wanted an eyehand twitch experience id go play tennis or paintball npcs and their corps are more than static mission generators and rats but the basis for a rich and vibrant game world that gives meaning to player actions beyond grind and pvpwe need smarter and more variable npc experiences this goes hand in hand with both immersion and solo play the cluster feels as big as it really is by filling that space with danger diversity and uniqueness and preventing players to cross it in a couple minutesi love the sense of how big the verse in eve is i would fight anything that diminished that your ship actually feels like a gargantuan thing of steel and glass several hundred meters in length instead of just another generic matchbox rocket among thousands of clonesi believe the physics model needs some loving to make that difference in theoretical mass seem more real you can have fulfilling and varied gameplay even if you are only able to play a few hours per week in short sessionsnot everyone can put in 40 hours a week in eve the training system in eve makes it clear that you should be able to enjoy eve if you can only play casually great rewards are always preceded by even greater risk riskreward is what eve is all about i think we need to actively prod ccp to make sure these two are really inline for example low sec right now is clearly out of whack using that metrichope that helps you decideissler
id vote for issler then to be honest with you
ive been in eriks corp for about a year now and i can say the parts of your quote i made bold is what erik is like in my expierences like corporate meetings the stuff i didnt make bold is what im pretty sure about that he feels the same but it would actually be better if hed shed some light on it himself the stuff i left out im not sure about it at all he might or might not agreei dont know much about issler though so i cant compare them really im going for either erik or heartstone hope this helps you make up your mind
issler has been my ceo for over a year now and i couldnt wish for a more dedicated leader or bosslady as we sometimes call her she backs up her stated beliefs with time and effort and has been tireless in improving player experiences both in and out of game i strongly endorsefor me it really came down to a choice between her and herschel  a fairly unusual dichotomy i dont know him at all ingame but he has a welljustified reputation for thoughtfulness on the forums i went for issler this time because i can personally vouch for her outstanding work ethic and ive no doubt that herschel will be back
the real answer to your question
bah we all know oz is going to get a seat let a few of us underdogs scrabble for votes 
thanks issler garthran for your replies i liked isslers better so hes currently my favourite thanks too che for offering an insight on eriks way of thinking too bad for take care though that their candidate cannot even be tempted to answer in person by posting his name in the thread title im sure hes very busy with his campaign elsewhere but this could certainly be misconstrued by less circumspect voters as a bad sign for eriks future participation on the csm

afs being the first t2 ship i ever trained up for i am still disappointed in their effectiveness after about 2 years of experimenting with setups and tactics even now that ive had plenty of time to train up the supplemental skills to help out this is the case i agree on many suggestions brought up here specifically tracking bonus addition to jagwolf also the idea of a more clearly defined role for each af with regards to bonuses would be helpful as has been brought up by previous postingsthanks for bringing this up in a thread this isnt a section of the forums i spend much time in but im glad i did today

signedccp will whine about it not being their artistic vision blah blah there was never a vision you just threw something together and called it a systemthis is the vision
actually you are wrongthey didnt whine about that
why have i not supported this yet
i strongly support this especially with the expansion having come out in wh space if you anchor a pos and fuel it but then have to leave or are accedently locked out due to wh collapse the pos will go offline but the chances of someone bringing in enough firepower to do anything about the pos is slim granted for the moment theres plenty of moons in wh but theyll eventually be more populated and as it is if the original corp happens to come back and start refuling their pos theyll have a base thats extreamly difficult to remove making the weaker entity have no choice but to either abandon their pos or try to get it out while the other corp is busy elsewhere and not having an imediate wh exit could cause some huge issues
supportedallow the hacking and removal of towers and all mods that have been offline for 30 or more daysif there are concerns over this removing an isk sink then perhaps have the hacked tower recovered as a new item derelict tower that can be sold to npcs for a value lower than a new pos this could actually introduce a new salvaging profession to hisec
there are already small freighters theyre calledjump freighters
i quite like what ccp did with the orca  its a small freighter good for moving rigged ships and also a support vessel for mining ops to give it something to do that justifies the halfbillion price tag between indys ts orcas jfs and full freighters every imaginable combination of hauling capacity is already in place we dont need more maybe a couple tweaksrigged ships in freighters say but no new hulls
this
try to move something that is above 100k in sizeit would fit into an orca  if you could tear down the walls between cargo and corp hangarwhy would it be bad if we had a small freighter im not even considering the jump freighters theyre t2 freighters not small freighters even if theyre technically smaller
i dont really like what they did with the orca its like they tried to solve too much with one ship i would rather have had one small freighter per race and one mining command ship like the orca but without the sma and cargo though i wouldnt want to see it nerfed nowi think it makes sense to introduce a new ship for each race that are basically the same as the orca minus links and corp hangars but with some extra cargo space
this were still lacking an intermediate hauler that fits into the price progression unlike jfs
well i woudnt mind smaller brother of freighter in the price range of orca but as a his big brother without any slots for fit or rigs
yes please and i find it quite awkward that ccp gave us the orca instead of the mini freighter we asked formaybe they could even make a mini freighter with 500k m3  just a rough idea and 1million m3 of ship maintenance bay to haul rigged ships in empirerigged ships are subject to trading aswell and we need a solution to haul rigged ships
you maybe right about this we need something like small or light freighterorca is more like mining support vessel and we need some type of transport shipyou have my support
the only way ill even support this is if the orca can handle 1 freight containers worth of stuffbut it stops there o potherwise your screwing up the balancethere is no need for a smaller freighter if you cant be bothered to buy the damn thing yourself then stop whining for a new ship
its called the orca i dont see the devs putting out a new ship that does basically the exact same thing just with a new training path
i dont see what you mean about something with 4060k cargo space as being the same as the orcathe progression path is fubared why would you need to havemining barge vastrogeologyastrogeology iiisciencescience ivminingmining iv mining director ileadershipleadership imining foremanmining foreman v to fly a cargo moving vessel it does not make sensethere is nothing about mining anywhere when asking for a ship that is larger than the industrialtransport class and smaller than the freighter hence the lightsmall freighter designation requesti am sorry if ccp duped you all into training for the orca to fill this niche but it was a stupid decision i am just calling it out after getting back into the game after a long breakit may be a new training path even though all it needs is one skill a small freighter skill with the same pre reqs as the freighter if not a little lessi would suggest to keep it like the orca in that the ship is for all races i am sick of seeing all of the different tiers of ships when there is no reason for them the obelisk and the rest did not need to be 1 per race the super haulers should have been all the sameanyway adding 2 ships for all races not each would work nicely1 ship with 3050k base cargo1 ship with enough space to move 1 assembled and fitted battleship can only carry assembled ships
well i will definitely not vote for you for csm that is great if everything is capable of being hauled as you say however that is not why we are requesting this we are requesting a fix for the flaw in the progression of skills related to moving cargo and itemsi would hope the a csm would not only look at issues that need fixed because of a bug but also look at making the systems and mechanics more consistentcan you explain why the orca makes sense as being the intermediary between indystss and freighters if you look at the skills they do not make sense if the orca should come first in progression of skill now due to the mechanics of what the ships are capable of they fit in the middle but the skill requirement is fubar
sorry to hear that the reason it makes sense is that mining barge has essentially ceased to be the mining ships skill and has become the ore racial skill just like you need indy 5 for ts or freighters you need barge 5 for rorquals and orcas the skill isnt especially long for a pseudocapital ship and its the right one to use as a requisite for miningfocused ships its the problem with making it dualrole but that was necessary in order to give it a role other than bad freighter for people with no money i dont see anything obviously wrong with the skill progression
problem is that an orca doesnt give anything we dont already have with an iteron 5 with rigs etccalling orca a minifreighter isnt right its a more versatile industrial ship with ship hangar and some mining bonuses
three times the cargo capacity give or take and the ability to move small rigged ships even if you dont mine it has utility that the itty 5 just doesnt its no titan even at logistics but it does have advantages
also to answer those that complain it doesnt fit in the training skill plan sorry but in my honest opinion i think that the plan for a freighter isnt enough especially the jump freighter so should we change it just because i think sono so your argument that the skill training plan is fubared is a moot point example light interdictors  heavy interdictorsisaac
if you read the link in the op to my thread youd see that heat damage is in part a way to user in more t3 goods do you want that t2 beam that dies to 1 max dd or do you want that t3 good that dies to 3 add that to a 20  chance to be affected on each mod you have an amazingly low rate of death of modsthis also opens up the avenue to other things as for the neuting part there are now a viable  ton of ways to counter neuting rr fleets all carry cap injectors already only sniper ships do not smaller ships are anti dictor platforms so its less likely theyll even get bubbledyou are being very 1 dimentional in your thinking so youve said no to area and youve stated why theres no point in repeating yourself wo further ammunition you seem to be running under the assumption that i and vuk have not considered the rammifications of this before posting yet he and i are involved in one of the biggest wars eve has ever seen and experience and lead fleets with titans for and against us daily youre a bit out gunned on the the experience factor there
i actually quite like this idea good on ya mate1
first i want to say that i very much like the idea of splitting up the colony into a orbiting hub and an actual base i like what it would change in the pvp and industrial aspect of eve as do many other players but i have some suggestions myself 1 the hubit is said that the hub can be attacked and destroyed also destroying the resources and the whole complexcolony reverting the planet to its original state i say reverting a planet to the pre terraformed state is scientifically impossible even if the terraforming was not yet complete so either have a solid destructive force wipe the planets ecosystem clean again see 5 ships or just leave the terraforming complete or incomplete for the next alliance to hold control over the planet because for a system of changing ecosystems to work different ecosystems should mean different resources and services so that it is interesting for the alliances to change them to their needs i would also suggest the hub being an improved player owned station with the possibility of changing ownership when the control point is taken as was said in the text it would hold a planetary transport service too these stations could and schould be well defended this way the battle for a planets colony can grow out to be an allout war between alliances large pirate or merc corps could also give it a try but of course they can only lootkill and not take over the planet they could however disable the planets production to fit their agenda2 the colony itselfbecause the destruction of the hub wouldnt necessarily mean the destruction of the colony this would mean a new dimension in planetary control it would be more fun to disable for example the shield powering stations with playercontrolled vehicles or airplanes to then take control of the disabled settlements or domes by destroying certain structures with lasermissile bombardments from orbit see 5 ships after taking over all settlements the alliance would now hold the hub and the colony of the planet if there are two controllable planets in a system this process would be repeated to hold sovereighnty when one of the planets is disabled or different planets in a system are controlled by different alliances the system would be contested for outsiders or players not involved in factionalliance warfare this would mean more clarity in these matters maybe even motivate them to participate in those matters or join one of the parties please visit your user settings to reenable images3 clonesan interesting new approach on this matter is the use of clones for planetary transport you just jump into a new body when you are on the planet then for example when the hub has been taken over or disabled by enemy forces you can either whait for the base to fall into friendly hands again or you jump to one of your other clone bodies this would translate into an increase in the clone business perhaps clone manufacturing could turn out to be a viable new playercontrolled trade4 carebearsi must agree with the guys who said simplifying the work of a carebear is a stupid idea but i also thought the idea of a settlement taking less and less work to maintain was a good idea but it may be nearly impossible to implement so ill leave it be in line of the miningproducing on the planet try to make it just profitable enough for the alliances to take over the planet dont overcomplicate but also dont simplify too much and last but not least try to make use of the passengers prostitutes soldiers and slaves alike5 shipsjust exploring some possibilities here laugh with it if you want

i forgotsigned
hell i wouldnt mind being able to just inject every skill and train in them once the prerequisites are completebut i concur it would be a nice hassle saver
i would think the issue is at the moment the check for prereqs is on injection and not training queuei agree it would be good to preinjectwhat should be changed is that you can inject any skill you cant train it until prereqs are met since the queue is smart enough to escalate the training time base off of queue status the prereq check can be based off of trained  queue
hint just because it would make something easier for you doesnt mean it should be implemented in fact its often a very good reason why it should not be implemented

okay there is something really wrong with the stealth bombing system the new system obliterates the possibility of soloing first they use torpedoes honestly these things are so slow you can beat a rhino to death with a toothpick which was bent before it hits this severely restricts the targets you can hit with this you can only hit a battle cruiser or a battleship maybe a cruiser with a huge sig radius huge though would have to be not watching anything also secondly you now can not solo in this the old system worked you warp to a gate camp sit a few kilometers out decloak fire off a volly of missiles then cloak and for lack of a better word gtfo this wasnt unfair or unbalanced why because you cant take out a battleship like this solo best youll get is a bad cruiser it also had a very strategic element to it use the stealth bomber to kill that pesky electronic warfare frigate then warp in the big guys to mop them up the new system gets rid of these packs of stealth bombers that would get rid of gate camps for the fleet to warp in also you had to be quite experienced to actually solo correctly in this now i am not saying that it wasnt a fleet ship because it still was a group of them supported by a fleet could take a poss defenses on or be a softener before a fleet jumpwarp as said abovethought i would just bring this ol topic up again just because i know it is irritating a lot of stealth bombing pilots
umm walloftext  bad btw im a stealthbomber user and im not complaining before they sucked worse than anything elseisaac
the old bomber was an antifrig ship essentially but it was bad at it and there are more than enough antifrig frigs out there already the new bomber is supposed to fight battleships generally in groups you cant do what the old one could but you can do a lot of things now that the old one couldnt besides ccp is never going to roll back their changes a couple weeks after they came in so its not even worth trying
agreed ccp have made changes to other ship and weapon classes in the past to ruin their effectiveness eg missiles but this isnt one of them the increase in bomb effectiveness through costmechanics has made them viable to most pilots the torps are disappointing but its not a huge issuealthough the old bomber wasnt an antifrig ship as you say unless you mean in terms of solo pvp it could take on any ship class and be effective and with enough of them you could kill any ship class incredibly fast
i was mostly talking about solo pvp yes but it still remains a fact that killing something with torpedoes is slightly harder than cruise missiles im not saying that stealth bombers are useless now because they have had very nice additions to bombs as you have said im saying that solo pvp in a stealth bomber is more than slightly difficult nowim not going to go as far to say as this fully endorses blob warfare because it doesnt im just saying they could possibly beef up the soloing abilities of this a little more than what it is currently
while the new sbs might not be good for solo pvp they are great for solo ninja ratting in 00 and lets face it the old sbs werent much better for solo pvp unless you count volleying t1 frigs pvpthe new bombers actually work a lot better in pvp and a small sb gang with a tackler or two can seriously inconvenience big ships
its true that the torps do redefine the role of stealth bombers somewhat i think they actually bring more into line with what a stealth bomber typically do now at the risk of comparing real life stealth bombers and ones that exist in eve i will say that real life stealth bombers are used to take out strategic targets and usually large ones at that using bombs and from what ive seen since the patch people are using them for exactly that bombing saying that stealth bombers cant alpha frigates is entirely untrue in fact with the inclusion of the bomb launcher on them they are actually better at this ive seen at times 3 or 4 frigates go down to one bomb if its aimed correctly ive seen stealth bomber pilots annoy the crap out of people who are trying to set up and or rep pos armour and shield maintenance drones dont react well to being hit by bombs and if your setting up a pos dont deploy modules before the shield is upbut more and more i see stealth bombers being used as bombers just like they should be the fact that they can launch torps just makes them that more versatile for fleet engagements and gate camps you just have to change your tactics a little bit

huzzah
i see no way this can possibly hurt game playit convenient as hellso do it
signed
supportedso long as the standings settings only give access to shields and not hangars etc and the standings allowing access are set for each tower i dont see a problemmaybe a simple run down likecorpalliance105with each succeeding setting allowing access to that tier and those above itbit ironic considering the only time i was ever the victim of having pos pw stolen was at the hands of pandemic legion but generally a good idea as regards it being a total nerf on espionage well i am pretty sure there are a lot of sneaky tricks remaining that maz will keep to herself

yeh i want my drakes to outdamage 300mill ships too
supporting this partly just because it will help share the burden of corp management and so on we have people log in to play and then spend almost their entire time dealing with standingsposslord knows whatspread the work
i want to fix my 4 standing with gallente
its about time to fix thisits well known fact that 40 of mineral flow is coming from loot tablesreplace t1 with t1 named mods and remove the ammo and drone drops totally they are so small portion of the loot drops anywaythis change would be like the removal of npc shuttle production major one it would be good for the new eden
we have been discussing it intensively inside the csmhowever theres so many variables to consider that its not clear if it fixes the problem compared to the fact that it will upset a lot of peopleso while i like the idea im afraid its not that easy
pretty much what he said this is not an easy decision to makeisaac
why is this not on the front page
hell yea im all caldari and i miss that greatly
i would personally retrain my gallenteamarr trained toon to caldari if missile launchers had their own turret like graphics and launched from those bays instead of just from the center of the shipsigned
supported its ridiculous to fly a ship who can fit two tier 3 bs inside when the ship has the same size as a tier 3 bs itself
make carriers and stations bigger
yes
regular caps need to be bigger supercaps alsoseriously make them bigger carrier size is lolms size is lol
1that would be easy for ccp to just x2 3 all carriersms size
yepwhen carriers were first introduced and i saw their design it was like yayand when a first saw carriers ingame and they were almost bssized it was like  oh crap 
now wormholes allow people to invade sleeper territory personally i think the sleepers would be affronted by such a thing and would naturally want to invade backi propose that a small amount of sleepers should be capable of using a wormhole in a system where upon they warp to either a belt station or other such place and begin attacking in their normal fashion and acting accordingly after all we had this big event of wormholes appearing and planets disappearing and some people are not even aware of it perhaps its time to make them aware plus if you kill the sleepers you get a small amount of loot im not suggesting massive hordes of sleepers killing everything in sight although that would be fun too but just the occasional gang of them in normal space sleepers must use probe launchers too right
grate idea make it more interesting or they could fight concord also but actual make it decent battles and what not
sorry but this will never ever happen the sleepers are long since extinct the only remains are their automated guardian drones and some electronical gizmos that are still active
so said guardian drones went skymet on our collective asses i fail to see the problem
if anyone bothered to read the devblogback story youll find that sleepers are defensive drones onlythus this is yet again another moot pointisaac
so ive been using poses a lot lately and ive discovered firsthand just how immensely frustrating they are this is no surprise of course  ive known it for years it has however got me working overtime thinking of ways for them to suck less im not going to propose anything drastic here just a change that should make a lot of things less annoying without negatively impacting ccps ability to do the real overhaul further down the line basically instead of each lab hangar and array being separate merge them in together the pos has one single corporate hangar and the capacity stat would become a boost to the capacity of the pos hangar rather than a separate hangar of its own all lines are together as well  a pos with 12 advanced mobile laboratories wouldnt have 12x3 copying lines itd be a single installation with 36 copying linesand 24 me and 24 invent and 250000m3 of hangar space youd probably add in the ability to name individual lines so that corps who want to keep lines reserved for whatever can do so ideally youd also be able to open the hangar remotely and see whats inside like you can with corp offices though i understand that ccp may be reluctant to inflict that upon their database thered be a couple other effects but i dont think any of them are really serious either for or against basically this would streamline pos operation nicely its not going to ruin any future plans ccp may have and im pretty sure theres enough of a chance that its workable that it is at least worth asking for
good ideain the same time its possible to have the right also with the alliance on the office to share some items that will be great 
i think combining the storage into a single logical unit would be nice from the users standpoint i can see problems when it comes to those hangers being shot and such id prefer items stay in their respective places but instead allow labsfactories to pull fromto corp hangers the only change required to do this would be to allow naming of hangers should have been implemented anyways and show those names as options in the si interface
whyjust train the scientific networking skill up a bit suddenly youre at a remote station holding all the blueprints you need and can just slot one in the lab as you desire the problem has been taken care of already using ingame mechanicsnot supportededit i do agree with joining the slots just not the hangar on the pos itself read what i write before you flame me please
did you read what he wrote or did you even tried to put research job remotely or you are just randomly trolling csm candidates you dont likei hate when i need to widdle tru 20 labs in systempos to find free slotsupportededit just to clarify things it pita even from station to search for slots esp if u have more then few labs as u usualy have
true the other option is to make it a function of the corp hangar array such that having one at the station is what merges everything but thats an annoyance in its own rightdifferent game mechanics depending on whether theres a corp hangar present or not ugh as always ccp is going to work out the details before implementation anyways so i figure ill give them enough to work with and let them sort through the nagging details if all youre doing is mepecopying sure its easy leave the bpos in an office pick a free slot use it the problem comes when you have jobs that take materials i have a corpmate who is planning on buying another halfdozen data interfaces as soon as he gets a bit of spare cash so that he can just leave one in every aml he invents at instead of having to be at the pos in person every couple hours moving stuff around in order to do his invention ive gotten to the point where im so frustrated having to move my materials around between different component arrays that i have an alt permanently parked in my pos solely so that i can log him in to move things around for me scientific networking helps but not nearly enough this is the other reason yes  finding free slots becomes a lot easier when you have to look at one list of slots per pos not as many as 15 also always good to hear my pos proposal get support from someone who runs a thousand times as many of them as i do
i dont see ccp rewriting the pos hangar system its going to take too much time for too little gaina complete pos overhaul and we can speak but then again
i expect that this will only be done if its simple enough to justify it if itd take as long as a full overhaul id rather have the overhaul of course i propose this because i think that theres a good chance it could be done a lot faster than that  most of the code is already there its just pushing it into new molds theres enough of a chance that it is doable and itd be useful enough if it was done that i think its worth asking for if ccp says no they say no and ill leave it be but until then im going to take a shot at it
small modification in this bargenow its something difficult to tank the rats in 05 with this ship this ship cost about 20 m isk one way its to had one middle slot and increase a little the cpu and powergrid cpu 200  220powergrid 35  50orincrease the shieldshield capacity 785  1200
theres this really need ship its called a hulk
the difference between the hulk and covetor its about 4 days  skill dayswith a fregate you can tank the rats in 05  the fregate cost between 50k to 350 kmerlin cpu 175 powergrid 35 shield 460 about 350k skill time 1 dayretriever cpu 125 powergrid 35 shield 391 about 5 m skill time 3 weekcovetor cpu 200 powergrid 35 shield 781 about 20 m skill time 7 weekhulk cpu 300 powergrid 35 shield 1519 about 80 m skill time 7 week  4 daysyou need about 2 month to use the covetor the price is about 20 m and its difficult to tank some rats i dont ask to make the second hulk i just ask to balance a little the covetor versus hulk or retriever
quit soloing get better shield skills yes there are skills that help get a hulk use combat dronesno need to changeisaac
nice isaac your are mister noif you have some argument that will be better
your refusal to fit for the environment is not a good reason to change a ship use combat drones if you really have problems heres fit that is cap stable at 49 and will tank as well as any combat frigate and is t1 to bootcovetor tankmark i generator refitting capacitor power relaymark i generator refitting capacitor power relaysmall c5l emergency shield overload iice harvester iice harvester iice harvester iempty rig slotempty rig slotempty rig slotedit if youre not going for ice it fits just as well with strip miners
the difference for me between a covetor and a hulk was roughly 23 hours where do you get this 4 days crap fromthe difference was so short i didnt even bother with the covetor at all and went from a retreiver directly to a hulkif they want to do anything with the covetor they should lower the mb and astrogeology skill requirements by one level eachno support

thats hilariousthat would be so fun to try haha
thisno support covetor works as is although reducing its skill requirements a hair wouldnt be a bad thing
i have some argument that you dont readyou get exhumer book skill and train 23 hours then you shield be strongyes
yes yes it isfix blackops stop inventing new problems when ccp have perfectly good problems to solve already
ogmafbablack ops do not require recon skills black ops arent even that focused on ewar widow doesnt even get an ecm range bonus meaning its jam strength bonus is more akin to panther and sins runawayrunaway bonuses in function its pretty clear black ops are not upgraded recons by any stretch of the imagination stealth bombers might as well be entrylevel recons because they have a cloaking bonustldrno
one solution fixes the plex capturing abusesmake destruction of all defending spawns a requirement for capture stop timer at 75 until last navy vessel is deadinstantly solves cloak abuse range dragging navy away from timer abuse speed abuse also forces people to either gang up or make themselves vulnerable by having a carebear fittingeverything else is hopefully being worked on should be noted that fw was never meant to act as a source of revenue but rather a pvp training ground the whole system does need a looksee thoughmy opinion income should be enough to cover expenses for the average player no more the new probing allows you to do exploration while waiting for timers bookmark sites remotely for future completion combine with ratting the bs now in lowsec makes for a great side income
hi thereas the topic says raise this threat to make the following changes regarding this devblognew dev blog overview changes in apocrypha 12with this change exspecialy lowsec gets us a little in trouble why because of this5 person  outlaw  solid red backround5 to 10 person  solid red backround dont forget this goes for standings from yourself aswell as for standing from your corpalliance towards a hostile corpalliance which surely will not only have 5 membernow who has the time to check up on this in lowsec how much people will now fall for gategunfire because they dont want the possible outlaw to escapemeanwhile wartargets in empire  red flashyi say why not just make outlaws and wartargets flashy they are both shootable anywhere on sight it wont make much of a difference
a timeline of selected eventsdinosaursjesusyounowalso its not hard to make your own overview settings youre asking for trouble using the default settingsreally they did this for the benefit of new players its not a bad thingno support
maybe where the you is you should write ijust as example imagine you are a member of cva which have to maintain nrds in their 00 space and with all that 5 to 10 standings from your alliance if you dont get it you have now to fly through lowsec domain like they do toonow how do you think how much small cruiser  frigate pilots will die to gategun fire cause they now see redsolid backround as outlawit just makes it easier to see than a small colortag and people will use it but for using it you are screwed not the way it should be
perhaps i should have noted that the timeline was there to point out that this has already happened both your post and thread title make it sound as if it has yet to happento refute your extremely situational example again apocrypha 12 only changes the default overview settings it was done for the benefit of new players you can still modify it to your own liking and again most if not all members of a serious heh space holding alliance like cva will have their own custom overview settings which this patch does not mess with save the bit that blues now show up as reds sometimes due to changed priorities on the display but thats easily fixed 
oh really would have never noticed it was in the new patch oh wait several servercrashes cause of itstil if you did read the threat you see i complained before about itmodifing it yourself stil dont changes the fact that it would be the easiest to have wartargets and outlaws both flashy which is what i suggestto identify someone by a small colortag seconds after he decloaks for a gatejump for example is lesslikely than when you see the whole red bar turn red  flashyas it is now people who have solid red backround for horrible standing selected just to see their enemys easy will now have a hard time once they change from 00 to lowsec if you would clear me up what the exact problem would be in having wartargets aswell as outlaws flashy
no youre wrong the change was brought in 12 that was days ago 122 which was pushed today brought minor changes today is when the server crashedyou linked the dev blog where they make the announcement the reasoning is there and its soundand again if you refuse to change your overview settings to your own liking so that you always know what youre dealing with that is not my nor anyone elses problem
complaining for a possible change at todays patch maybe vovstil waiting for you answer on why its bad to have wartargets aswell as outlaws flashy which is the only suggestion i am making in this thread just in case you missed it
todays patchmodules will no longer be subject to an activation delay when a ship has decloaked after jumping through a stargatestoryline missions have been fixed and will now be offered correctly any storyline missions that you have already qualified for will now be offeredstation environments will no longer move with you when you use the clone jump servicefixed an issue that would cause the ships and items panels to not display correctly when the load station environment option was uncheckednumerous server side issues have been fixedso no youre not complaining about a change from todays patch hence my god youre late reactionfrom my post above you linked the dev blog where they make the announcement the reasoning is there and its sound
it seems logical that the desruction of structures would leave something of value behind in one form or another of course the chance of finding high quality loot should be low but the chance for something should be possible when structures go kaboom
i think its a balance issue some missions drop a lot of loot from wrecks without nerfing wreck drops having all structures have a chance to drop loot might flood the market in mins as most drops get reprocessed i know its frustrating to pop a structure and get nothing but i dont think giving all of them a chance to drop is the answer that said i would like more structures to have drops just not all of them as walls junctions etc are considered structures tooso partially supported
i totally agree even more so when you spend stupid amounts of ammo in expectance of loot dropping from the structure
there should always be a nice tasty loot for the stations and structures take an insane amount of ammo to blow upim tired of not seeing any loot when they blow up 
i like it although it certainly would need to be carefully balancedheres a different idea in the same vein regardless of drops have destroyed structures leave wrecks which can be salvaged
that is ingenious provided you get an a bit more salvage than you would expect
when is ccp gona do anything about them
good idea
this would only really effect t1 ships seeing as t2 ships return crap for insurance  i got 7 mil for my 100 mil zealot i blew up a couple days ago that being said i would believe that the best course of action would be to disable insurance on ships flown by someone with a bounty because really how are criminals getting insurance anyway
if you are going to stop payment on insurance then all that is going to due is make pvp more expensive and even less people will participate in it than already do
do you really think pirates are going to stop pirating because they dont receive insurance not to mention pirates might end up with even more money because succesful pirates would be able to collect bounties on rival pirates this would easily offset not being able to insure their shipsnot to mention generally the expensive ships lost by pirates are t2 ships anyway or at the most bc sized ships which hardly qualify as expensive
while yes for the few good pirates out this might be true but for the majority of pirates this would not be the casenot to mention getting rid of insurance payouts for selected groups of people is not something i think the devs are going to go foryour idea isnt bad i just think there are too many exploits at the moment with it that would require too many changes to other aspects of the game that just arnt really realisticsimplify it some and maybe it will work
well this is eve not everyone gets to be top dog and this bounty system would reflect that while this bounty system might lower pvp by making it expensive to pirate it may also boost pvp by making antipirating profitable enough to engage in so where you lose pvp on one end you may gain it on another
when youre in a system with 100s of people its hard to find the wartargets or lower standings folks among all the other capsuleerscould we add a sort feature to the local member list specifically the ability to put wartargets at the top of the list
how do you feel about limiting the price increment on market orders such as limiting all buy and sell orders to 3 or 4 significant digits this would force traders to offer a significantly better price instead of just beating the old price by 001 isk
it would be a fairly stupid restriction considering most minerals fall below that number threshold its the same reason there isnt a  based limitation any limit you place on market prices will break at least a portion of the market and the rest can be gamed

some very good ideas but overall just a pompous jerk too bad pirating really could use some overhauling   
bump
im not very good with english so ill keep this short there might be some mention by some candidates to make our life easier pls post ur view on the large projectiles here so we dont have to run through all those long speeches tq
large projectiles have the worst dps at long range still pretty bad dps at short range worst tracking and the minmatar ships are the only races battleships that cant participate in a fully long ranged sniper fleet after the hp increase projectiles couldnt be used to ohko small ships and there was never really any compensation for the loss of their specialized use since thenso i want to bring that to ccps attention while im in the csm
artillery in general needs an improvement in form of damage increase poor rof poor tracking and high alpha is what makes artillery stand out so a large damage increase is justifiedas for large autocannons they need a tiny tweak but no powerbuff
cant really add anything beyond what admiral iceblock has said arty needs work ac are pretty close to fine
ideally they should be tweaked a little to make them in line similar to hybrids since they work around the same principle but definetly dont make them identicle projectiles should still be kept in their own little niche making them usefull in their own wayit would be great to see them get a bit of a range boost for sniping
disturbingly i agree with iceblock on this one
ruri what do you know of pvp your idea of pvp is can flipping miners jumping rookie ships in high sec belts and trying to extort money from corps under threat of a war deck and you usually get your butt kicked if the the miners have a bit of fight in them your a joke
i would love to be able to vote for a pvp council member to help balance it outbut i feel that you would not be the best choice from knowing you in game it is obvious that real pvp is not your interest but only less penalties for war decing and griefing industrial or noobie corps when someone is more interested in pvpers against pvpers they will have my vote

ccp answer your customers give us what we want out of the game we pay for
uh isaac 2 to 3 assuming you have freighter already if not add 2 months months too short a time for skilling a jump freighter is not what i call a short timeobut i get your point in a sense
your iteron 5 can do 129000m  400000m ship maintenance bay
even if slightly offtopic i have to quote this its high time ccp renames the mining barge skill to something less confusingif nothing else it would at least reduce the repetition of the the skills are weird argument which currently is true because the skills are weird
not supportedffs you got the orca or you have a itty5or heaven forbid an occator
ok lets reiterate a little bit because this seems to confuse some peoplethe original post was to have a ship that is larger than an indy but smaller than a freighter for a middle ground ccp responded by stating that the orca fits that needthe point i am saying is yes the orca as is does fill that niche but it also has several other abilities what i am asking for and or suggesting is a ship that does not have the extras and only fills the middle shipping groundthe orca has several other secondary and tertiary requirements that are not related to shippinglet me repeat this is about shipping not mining not hauling fitted ships even though that is another area that is a bit lacking it is like saying that cars have to be shipped to the dealer in parts because transporting an assembled vehicle is too hardthe transport ships do not fit this spot either they have the same or less cargo space than indys but have other fun stuff related to low sec transportationjump freighters do not fill the role either because they are the t2 of normal freightersthere should be a logical steady progression of shippingcargo space which at present there is not it is either 1015k cargo or less and then the 500kthere should be a middle ground in the 50k250k rangethe middle ground should not require much else outside piloting and indys as indys should definitely be the the prerequisite skill treeactually all of the extra piloting skills for each race is a bit insane the base type of ship should be the skill progression and then racial specializations should be applied later
i supportsure i fly a freighter but a minifreighter would have a lot of usei agree that this minifreighter should not have a ship maintenence bayi also dont believe it should have a corp hangaror any fitthe orca is not a minifreighter im so sick of it being called that it has a ship maintenence bay that only holds a few ships it has a corp hangar that is fairlysized but more of a capitalship thing than a freightingthing it also has a fit and its cargo isnt very large at all if you ignore the hangar and baywe dont want a command ship that can haul as its secondary usewe want a small freighterorca  small freighterorca  subcapital industrial command shipfreighter 800m isk  haulingfreighting skillsorca 450m isk  miningleadership skillssmall freighter 100300m isk  haulingfreighting skillsas for the hauling of rigged shipsi think its about time for us to have a ship freighter with nothing but a ship maintenance bay
approx this supported except the oneshot dread popsince a couple of dreads can pop a titan quite swiftly the titan should be able to send some of them to hell before falling even if the dreads are siegeddd should be much less deadly when used as area effect  see later should be reusable much more frequently and possibly should give some nice but not at all deadly bonus like an ecm burst which grants tactical advantage to friendly fleet but doesnt completely ruin the day of the opposition dd should be scriptable and thus focused on a single target resulting it to instapop except if its a supercapital one where it would just give some conventional but huge damage since most of the titans bonuses are for gang assisting they should really participate fleet battles pretty unlike they do now but due to this there shouldnt be any new type of new anticap guns introduced as the highslots should be reserved for gang assist modules the conventional gun bonus of the titans should be removed for eg dd reuse time lvl area dd should kill off only dronesfighters and frigs possibly nanofit t1 cruisers also and give some tactically useful bonus like an ecm burst dd should be scriptable to focus its strength to instapop anything that is nonsupercap 1 target only dd should be reusable like 5 minutes half of this time the titan cannot warp both these times can be reduced titan level  boost in clone vat bay and ship maintenance hanger so they can field much a bigger fleet this also goes for mommiesthe upper changes and prolly some more smaller ones would give the titan a key role in fleet battles not just this came flash gone strategyanyway revision is highly supported from my side
doomsday should be a direct fire weapon that does enough damage to easily one volly a dread and should have a bonous against fixed objects towers and stationsmotherships need a hp and most importantly a jump range boost should be further than carriers tbh hp boost should be in ratio to the components it takes to build them ms should get a bigger boost to remote repping than carriers also the clone vat bay should be inherent not a mod ms and titans need a big bonous overheating so that they can effectivly overheat for tens of minutes without burining out any mods and both or at least ms need to be dockable
ive been wanting this since the skill queue came outmake it happen ccp
hmm im a little bit worried about it being abused to move high value skillbooks without risk just start training a short unrelated skill followed by the prereq skill which has been trained long enough to fit into to 24h timer despite the first unrelated skill and then inject amarr titan or whatever then start moving to wherever you want that skillbook to be and when you get there cancel the pre req skill and recieve 1 super expensive skillbook that could be moved anywhere without risk and then resold not sure how to fix that but im confident a soloution can be found so ill support this anywayedit maybe have the queue enable you to add a skill that you do not yet have injected to your queue and when its time to train it it looks for the skillbook in your cargohold aswell as in your hangar if youre docked would allow you to queue it while still having to drag the skillbook with you just like it is now
um if you use the modification i suggested by allow injection of any skill at any time and just make the training trigger a prereq check means that the skill book would never be respawned which already fixes the exploit you are worried about
simple treat it like a rig once injected no going back if you dont pass prereqs skill book is destroyed
yes
simple yet perfect idea fully supported
i remember doing an l4 called recon 3 of 3 where you warp into a celestial toxic cloudawesome skyboxand a couple other missions with the same one with different colourswhy arent there more missions with sweet skyboxes make space look different more often maybei loved that mission a whole lot and was let down instantly when i didnt get to fight anything in itwhy not a sweet l4 that takes you to a nebulaother examples would be sweet here have fun guys
the new changes are pretty nice imo the only qualm i have with the change is the removal of the cloaked velocity bonus it makes it really hard now to catch a targetget into position to launch your torps  bombi have no experience with em so no idea how hard it is not to mention rage torpsdamage bonus  recons 5  epic alpha
thats not entirely true you could 1 shot important t2 frigates and other un cloaked stealth bombers anyways looks like im the only one complaining bout this whole issue here oh well i guess ill just have to adjust to the new system
yes
this
would be nicerunning out of missiles and not noticing is a pain in the arse when running two accounts it happens
im actually surprised they dont do this
as long as there is a way to prevent this from happening when you dont want to i support this for example if youre on a station or gate and need to start deagressing right after firingthe last round of ammo in one of your guns it would be bad to have it start firing again after reloading adding 10 secondswhatever cycle time was remaining when you started to deagress to the time you need to do it
we have armor and shield rep drones ranging from lights to heavy dronesbut yet we do not have hull rep drones i understand ccp doesnt want hull tanking to be op but seriously we have remote hull reps all the way up to capital it would make sense to have logistical hull rep drones in the light medium and heavy variety
supporting my own topic
real men hull tank
why not its not op in anyway its not like hulltanks will benefit from this roflsupportisaac
approvedand hull tanking hasnt been op for a loooong timei wish it were at least useful nowadays lol for ships other than bait ships
any more ideas
yeah but can it also affect salvage range too or lets say all none damage dealing turrets range
in few weeks its the mid of the year already yet there are no announcements in the game development forum guess early 2009 means late 2009 or early 2010 and i have a pg issue even without fitting hams or mwd t2 hm launcher and 23 extenders make the link impossible to fit
its a caldari missile boat its supposed to suck for pvp
are you seriously expecting ccp to keep to an announced timeline
hello psiim the one that brought the concept up to the csm in the second term if im not mistaken somebody also did so in the first termwhile i still want this to happen realize that mining is going to have to be improved before something like this is even likely to happen ccp is currently looking at how to improve mining but its a careful change thats needed like scanning was or sovereignty will soon beas per your replacing t1 with meta t1 that would flood the market with named modules making them extremely plentiful and cheap this is something that we call bad for the game other ideas have been posed which hold merit but the change needs to be gradual such as reducing drop rates by 10 20 30 etc for meta 0 itemstldr its being worked on but mining needs fixed first
i  a l4 mission runner mass loot reprocessor and salvager  support this though i think a better solution would be to make named modules nonreprocessable like salvage now is and only remove standard t1 module drops drones and ammo typically give very little by way of minerals edit except cap booster charges but they take so much cargo space i dont think many bother to pick them up in the first place
issues like this have a significant impact on the game economy and therefore need very careful and progressive balancing to simply cut 40 of the mineral supply from the game would be cripplingas the csm has indicated changes to mining to make it more interestinghigher yield not more profitable per unit are what is required as mineral supply from any mining changes the loot tables could be adjusted not beforenot supported
right now you need to realize that reprocessed goods does not mean t1 modules and most certainly not mean mission lootbefore the drone regions where introduced this number was much lower besides if youre gonna remove all those minerals where are we gonna get replacements from in effect youll be boosting macro mininguntil you come up with a plan for replacing all the minerals not supported
i dont see the problem there are alot more people running missions then there are mining and despite that the miners manage to produce more minerals also with the only reward from fe drones being alloys that must be converted to minerals to be worth anything so there are many missions being run that rely completely on getting those minerals aswell as ratters doing the same in drone regions no support from me
ehh the idea is that they do not drop t1 just named t1 meta14 with variable order and chance i know that their mineral quantities vary but hey 00 and lowsec are filled with minerals not to mention wspace and there is assload of ore wich isnt being mined at all
do you know how much the mineral flow from drone loot and t1 module loot is all together is it over 50 percent of overall mineral supply
 mineral  ore  loot  drone compounds  tritanium  46  43  11  pyerite  29  60  10  mexallon  30  59  11  isogen  21  56  23  nocxium  18  32  51  zydrine  43  18  40  megacyte  44  39  16  morphite  77  1  22 
whatever you say chicken little
not just mining but all of the production and blue print availability as well course it could just be that a few people that already have all the blue prints just want to  the market and screw over new players moreno i think the equipment drops are fine just as they are
honestly sure itd destroy the economy for a little bit but itd fix itself in good timethe only real issue here i see is all the butthurt for missionmanufacturers and missionoresellersimho nerfing the hell out of meta 0 drops isnt enoughmaybe cut all reprocessing of equipment in halfthen you could keep meta 0 loot possibly but i still think it should goas for drone ore maybe that has a bonus to reprocess where it gets reprocessed normallysure there are people that farm drones like crazy but its still a much smaller percentage than the mission mineral farmers maybe they could implement all this into the next expansion and call it the universal depression so the answer to the butthurt is its just troubled times sir either stop whining or kill yourselfeve is a really strong game and as we saw with the shuttles it can take a good hit to the nuts fairly well i give eve a month to start leveling out its economy after meta 0 loot is removed andor reprocess is cut in half
while i support the suggestion that scale should be more realistic i also realize that a size increase by implication will need to be a complete reengineering of most of the star systems and pos systems etcso in stead i propose make everything else smaller my comment above refers to the fact is you resized carriers up to titians you still need to be able to fit a fleet inside a pos larger ships would mean large pos shieldsas for station size increase which considering volume of some of the stations needs be upsized considerably there are several situations where the stations are co close to their celestrial that you would be expecting them to be burning up in the upper atmosphere

patch 12 and subsequent problems have caused me to take a look at communications or lack of between ccp and the player base i was going to wait a while longer and consider a proposal but reading this from ccp in the general forum kind prompted me to raise this nowfrom issue thread in general forumthe problem with your repro is that it only confirms that there is an issue which was already apparent by the petitions and bug reports sent to us as well as some of the posts in this thread my first post in this thread was not implying that there was not an issue just that we had not found out what exact order of events caused the issuei will no longer be following this thread after this posti found this to be the only response from ccp regarding the frozen client after jumping bug nothing in game development known issues patch 122 feedback two days of a widely reported and common bug receiving what seems to be a disinterested half hearted unhelpful and actually pretty rude response from a ccp employeethe background to this i think we all know ccp rushed through a fix to a bug allowing an imbalance relating to one ship type the fix was applied despite considerable feedback from players regarding serious and widespread consequences which in ccps own words were game breaking the subsequent fix seems to have introduced this new gate freeze issueccp has numerous ways to communicate with and develop the game in cooperation with the player base forums petitions bug reports and csm so why did this happenforumsthe forums relating to development ideas bugs are split over several categories including development known issues features and ideas assembly hall information portal and general discussion there does not seem to be a structured use of these various forums by ccp sometimes ccp respond to a game issue in a thread raised in one section sometimes on a thread relating to the same issue in a thread in another section this may be due to a lack of moderation and disciplined use and monitoring of the forums by ccp it is also clear that devs do not read these forums or the issues would have been known in advanceproposalreduce and rationalise these forums and moderate them more effectively split them into the followingassembly hallplayers proposals for features and ideas as well as other issues can be raised here for the attention of the csmgame development forumproposals escalated from the assembly hall and ccps own development blogs can be posted here for player feedbacksisi test feedback forumonce an idea progresses past the game dev forum onto sisi the notes are pasted here in a new thread and feddback from the player base invited based on sisi testingtranquility bug forumincorporates known issues and workarounds and serves as a bug reporting tool for players who perhaps do not understand how to bug report issues on tq can be raised hereinformation portalnotification of patching patch notes server failure notices and links to threads in tq bug forum can be posted here and locked to keep the forum cleaneach of these forums should be actively moderated threads moved to appropriate other sections and locked with a link if duplicates ccp should monitor these forums daily to gain a good understanding and forwarning of potential issues either prior to or after patch deployment ccp should also respect the player bases good intentions and effective codevlopment of this game by responding in a timely and effective manner to issues raisedto be fair ccp does have better tools for player interaction than most mmos i have played it simply needs to use them bettertldr  ccp needs to listen up and communicate more

lol whut that whole general forum thread is the reason the ccp employee said i wont follow this thread anymoreyou all were bastards in there threatening asking for someone to get fired whining good lord get over yourselves ccp is not god theyll fix the issue as soon as they can unless any of you are employed by ccp or any similar company you have no reason to harass them me ends rantas per your ideas i will agree that the forums could use some of your edits however the question becomes can ccp honestly monitor them enough i dont know i also dont see the need to have the csm raise this issue with ccp its not an ingame issue also i have doubts it will increase the speed of fixes ingame ccp has to cut through a lot of crap that is spewed on the forum to find the problem ie the generalforum thread so until we get rid of all the trolls and complainers which will never happen well have to live with the fact that changes happen slowly you all bring this upon yourselves isaac
yup
the backstory can be overwriten anytime and they would be useful for killing up macrominers with some proper coding dand yes they would make a nice twist to hisec life 
if they were to invade i would rather see a massive army of npcs clean out low sec space and give it a softhard reset
sez youfor all they know they might be sleepingno seriously
lol  and i like the idea a lotmaybe not make them travel to the whthis would be very antineedforspeed but maybe have sleepers that spawn near some whs on our side of space chances and spawn sizes possibly determined by category of the wh
i dont see how this will benefit anythingif youre pveing the last thing you want is an unexpected something that will kill you dropping on you randomly with no warningif people want to kill sleepers they do it through wormholes they wont switch to waiting on scarce random spawns which have more competition and are less profitable
not all sleepers will drop on you and kill you and i do agree that they shouldnt move from the wh itself like maybe they could spawn in the belts of the system randomly super rare and belt spawns be scaled based on security status but i really just feel that they should spawn at the wh itself scaled to the category of the w that it leads to
as the op describes yes it would take a bit of coding however i think changing the si system to allow pulling from other hangers in the pos would not really imbalance anything and probably not be that difficult either
given my last year on the csm i has gotten an insight into how ccp perceives the mess that is the pos systemand just the thought of ccp having to touch the pos code makes me shiver in which case i cant imagine what the poor developers might be thinking
like the heavy interdictor what about two new shipsmodule roletype or a t3 subsystem or heavy dictor deviation or capitallet me suppose they would be shipsthe first would be the cloaking ship she emits a field that cloak every fleet mate max numberlevel or the like in range but without damper their sensor nor their speed or targetingweapon capabilities if not a field it could be some device that cloak a target in range maybe leaving trails indicating the number of ships cloaked cloaked mates have no need to decloak to fire enemies however the cloaking ship will move slow no turret or launcher hardpoints but like heavy interdictor she must have some mean to survive being primary like high resistance cloak device duration would be high enough to avoid spamming 510 mins but cloak device would cloak immediately and it would be strong enough to drop every lockontarget and resist proximity decloaking if she would be a capital ship she would need some fuel to activate the cloaks please note that smartbombs and interdictor bubbles and dd ignore cloakingthe second ship would be a focus fire attractor like heavy dictors she can warp enemy sensors or bend the space itself or whatever to attract enemy fire of some sort maybe one type of damage or weapon or ammo and suffer that damage herself maybe converting a little part of it fleet mates in range would be realatively safe for a while but will undergo some heavy dampening on their sensors because of the warping nature like targeting range that ship should be slow and clumbsy without weapon hardpoints and with some mean to survive being primary the effect she emit could be some single damagetypeemkinthermexpammotypemisshybridprojlaserwhatevertypeammo dimension heavy resistance bonus to targeted fleet mates in the fielda deviation on the theme would be a ship or a device that lock on target and force that enemy to not lock anything else effectively disabling that enemy shipthe two ships cannot be cloaked by any means nor they can benefit from the focus fire attractor bonus but would suffer the heavy dampening because of the device warping natureno effect will stack
my name is izo alabaster and highsec warfare is what i doone of the main things that drew me to eve was the fact that in eve often times the pvp is not consensual that means that sometimes someone might attack you without you wanting to be attacked highsec warfare is the very embodiment of this aspect of eve a group who wishes to conduct warfare attacks a group who doesnt wish to be attacked this is one of the great things about eve that makes it a unique gamein eve there are consequences for acting stupid if you make yourself an attractive target to a more powerful organization you will likely be milked of some of your isk theres nothing wrong with thatdont like it learn to defend yourself hire mercenaries negotiate a surrender fee there are plenty of ways to avoid highsec piracy and being the recipient of a highsec wardec its just that most people dont care to learn those methods and practice them and so they should be rightly removed of some of their iskmost of those who want to defang the current highsec warfare system dont appreciate just how difficult it is to conduct highsec warfare its not a matter of just sitting on a gate and wtfbbqing everything that comes through the gate which is easy instead you have to hunt for targets sometimes for hours before you get a single kill its often times very time consuming tedious work it requires a great degree of skill and patience in order to be successful at highsec warfareplease dont allow this game to be turned into spacewow where both parties have to type duel before they fight each other and neither party stands to actually lose anything from the fight keep it the harsh place it needs to be
im sure that killing mining barges and industrials is truly an amazingly difficult feat that can be accomplished only by players of such advanced training and skills that the victims should be delighted to grovel at the griefers feet and consider licking their boots a privilege
tldr are wardecs broken yes should they be eliminated nolong versionas a selfproclaimed mission running item making asteroid killing goddess of doom tm aka a carebear  really yall say that like its a bad thing i still understand that i can at any time be attackedwait for iteven without a wardec suicide ganking anyone wars can be declared and fought for a wide variety of reasons including resources rebellions honor and plain old fashioned i just hate you and i want you to die ingame in this case our corporation has been wardecced in the past and i am sure it will be again in the futurewe even discussed wardeccing another corp why because we wanted the asteroids they keep mining out from under us basically we just wanted them to go away  or at least cut back their operations in that system we ultimately decided not to pursue the wardec because the potential costs outweighed the benefitswardecs are indeed a tool of greifers but that doesnt mean they dont have legitamate uses
agreed our alliances current last 2 wardecs have been nothing short of a total pain in the sideeven they admit its to ultimately griefand when you do put up a fight they go hide and run and laugh all the wayand smack to top it offthats just utterly wrongand the majority of the corps just dont have the isk to hire a merc because they are too busy trying to make up for losses already incurredwhich adds to the alt plague how the hell else do you expect anyone to get anything done o p
if people with no skill formed a corporation in real life they would be demolished by their competition its no different in eveif you want to compete be in a diversified corp or face getting shut down no corp full of noobs only should ever feel like they have a right to exist
people who have no skill who form corporations in real life tend to succeed because they have the right to exist and give it a good shot people in real life dont declare war and shoot people in the heads or mow down there resourcescomparing real life to eve online makes one look like a jackasseve is not 100 pvp nor is it 100 carebearhello kitty get it through your thick skulls people
wow you are a moron no kidding its not exactly the same rl and eve have different mechanics we arent flying spaceships irlthe outcome is the same however an inexperienced corp full of inexperienced people wont fare well irl nor should it in eveif you hire the right people and diversify then youll fare better irl and in eve
once again your comparing eve to real life stop being a hypocritical contradiction of terms and come back down to earth eh
my point is made and its valid your choice to live in denial is your own
your point is hypocritical and refuses to accept the fact that its not as cut and dry as you think it isso get your pvp centric thumb out of your ass and join the discussion constructively or kindly take a hikea balance must be struck telling everyone to adapt or die in this context is like saying you dont give a rats ass about whatever anyone else thinks and you want to force the issuedig a little deeper than what you see on the surface and you just might find out why i refuse to take either side in this little debatei do not favor the wardec system as it is in its current state nor do i favor nerfing it eitherit is too easy to start a wardec let alone pay for oneits way to easy to abuse it and use it as a pay to grief toolthere is potentially no end to a wardec for so long as you have any amount of isk to be spentno one really makes any money in a wardec which is why a large number of industrialist and carebears dont particllary like itit has nothing to do with skillthis is the classic case of playground bully versus the little guys or whomever the bully would want to kick aroundbreaking apart upstart corps forces them to npc alts and alts upon alts upon altsstation gamesabuse of neutral remote repping abuse of undock redockabuse of stargate hoppingwardecs favor those who wish to win and will not accept losses or any particular lack of kill mailswardecs only end when you get bored or run out of moneythat said lets see you come up with a solution as opposed to telling people to adapt or die mr holier than thou
nothing is wrong with the wardec system you play a game with non consensual pvp if you would have read a little about the game before you joined you would have realized that and wouldnt be complaining here everyone was once a noob i didnt complain about wardecs then and i dont complain nowonce again if you fly in an unorganized corp full of newbs with no experience you choose to sleep in the bed you madewhen i started eve more than 3 years ago i was a member of a failing noob alliance who got destroyed by triumvirate they caused the destruction of the alliance and it was beautiful it made me fully appreciate the benefit of being organized and inspired me to be better at this gameyou say wardecs end when you get bored or run out of money that is a very narrow and false viewpoint if you have any form of diplomat usually surrender terms are quite negotiable this is left up to the player and not some hand holding set of initiatives set up by ccp its perfect one of the last perfect things remaining about evethe only problem i have is with whiners who ruin perfectly fine game mechanics if you change this game mechanic you are further emptying the sand out of this sandbox game
no support though i support the idea of a wardec revisionthe victory conditions idea is neat and would be awesome to have anyway but would solve no problemsyour proposal still puts the aggressed at the mercy of the aggressor wars could still be dragged on indefinitelycrumple toss and try again
wardec to fight fine wardec to grief bleh hire mercs and give them the mercs a reason to exist
bampbeen away for a little bit heh didnt realize this got buried
fantastic something like quasinullsecpvp a corporation or even an alliance of carebear that can hold the lowsec empire sovereighty in place of the empire itself the goodfella would be privateers and the smugglers the others to enforce security privateers need to take clean the space from smugglers maybe even from real alliance and viceversa who hold the system won the taxes and won the concord patrol npc serverside will simulate the logistics
not concord police not a broken untankable and beatable force just plain old faction police ships we can fight
if there was maybe a toggle button add armourshield calls to watch list so that logistics pilots could have the latest callers pop up in the list that wouldnt affect the watch list for other functions
after the few quickpatches and major gliches with ubercloacking ships bugging stargates and jump systems lagging database etc i think its even clearer that this is needed seems that the codebase has broke magical spagetti code limit where new bugs are created after every bug fix   mr garo
new content is a nice to have granted but fixes first i dont need to play a game with lots of flawed content 
this game really needs less halfbroken new content and some serious bug hunting
best suggestion ive ever heardwould be hard work and some time for ccp but it would be effort extremely well spent i wonder how many new players try eve see what a buggy mess it is and just leave for wow or others that arent so crippled
no support i dont consider myself qualified to dictate the correct development path for a successful mmo i lack experience in the field im suprised to see that we have so many mmo development and leadership experts on this forum can you tell us what mmos you lead the development of so we can be impressed with the knowledge and experience base from which these recommendations come
they have already tried this with a subsequent patch to empyrean age iirc they got zero positive feedback after fixing over 100 of the most commonlycomplained issues i dont see this happeningwhat i would rather see is them dedicate the next few patches to fixing the aspects of the game that are broken or unusable they already did this with scanning and they plan to do this with 00 sovereignty other aspects which could bear an overhaul maybe at the rate of one per patch along with some new content is mining manufacturing wardec mechanics player security status etcthis list could go on but i believe this would be the best way to approach it without destroying the other aspects of the game any more than this would require a complete code rewrite which while it may be very handy would most likely require far too many manhours to accomplishsorry not supported as you have outlined it
yup
those are not bugs those are unintended features so lets have no more crazy talk about fixing things that were never meant to be fixed
forgot to support 
corporation contracts  buysell orders should be controllable by any directoraccountantcontract managerits just stupid that once a sell order its set by someone from corp that sell order cannot be modified by anyone except that person if the contractsellbuy order was set in the behalf of the corporation ppl with right roles should be able to modify them
you might want a couple roles for security reasons but yes im all for this
agreed
im not sure if this has posted already but i thought it wouldnt hurt mentioning it i know that some of the bigger ships are suppose to have a crew onboard and that you as the captain controls this crew well just imagine now that you have to buy this crew yep thats right buy the people but have different types andor groups that could give different bonuses and debuffs say crew acrew a gives a bonus to weapons but being a specialized group of people they loss efficiency when it comes to operating the engine or shieldscrew bcrew b is the opposite and gives bonus to shield tanking and makes you deal less damageor another way this idea could work is say you fly a battleship it holds a crew of about 1200 people and that makes your ship opperate at 100 efficiency you get into a fight things go a bit bad but you come out alive but that doesnt mean all your crew came out of it alivecould throw in some skills like crew disipline that say increase the effectiveness of the crew by 1 per level maybe surely it isnt just the tech on your ship that makes it runjust a thought and id like to see other peoples thoughts on this idea terig
belongs in featurse and ideas section and has been suggested a billion times over before
search the forums a bit there is a very deep post that brought up this very thingi still support itthe other post got into how you have different kinds of crews that do different things and your crews could level up but would be destroyed when your ship got destroyed like rigs but can be moved from ship to shipagain i support it but i suggest that you search harder next time
could put a link please
simple proposal add a 4000000m3 ship hangar enough to shift 8 unpackedrigged battleshipsize hulls to each races freighter with the restriction that the frieghter cannot scoop or launch any shipsthis would allow for the niche for hauling rigged ships to be filled with minimum work
its called an orca
selfsupport ftwedit what youre failing to realize is that the orca only has 400000m3 of space for ships that isnt enough for even one battleship it would seem to be failing its role if it was intended for that purpose another edit proof
noit shouldnt be easy to move riggedinsured bses around thats the whole point of rigsinsurance being lost upon repackaging
lol not even carriers get that much m3 for their ship bay why should a freighter get it no supportisaac
hauling your rigged ships to the combat area is pain in the ass thats for sure but imho there are way better ways to fix this than just adding a ship bay to freighters
this would be more simply addressed by removing the 120000m3 limit on contracts rigged battleships could then be placed in courier packages which can be moved in freighters
well if this was done it would have to be a smaller bay and would need to remove roughly 50k of normal cargo space for each 500k of ship maintenance bay it recieve although its only a rumour and i have no way to confirm if its true or not but ive been told that ccp mentioned during fanfest 2008 that a new ship class was being considered the ferry which would be able to enter high sec have a jump drive large cargo bay and a ship maintenence bay large enough to move battleships it is a possibility but at the same time it feels a bit unlikely since it would make jump freighters obsolete
dont forget that a carrier has to hold a 700gw powerplant and 730tf supercomputing in almost the same vessel volume not to mention its huge dronebay the extra corp hanger and the slots for fittingsimo the freighters are whether  based on obelisk raw data too big for nothing 96 of their volume is for nothing really has too small cargo bay for the same reasonwhile thanatos has pure cargodronebay so empty space within the vessel of over 8 while they have to have those powerplants and supercomps and stuff within the vessel which the freighters dont have at all edit aye and the jumpdrive which deducts approx half a million cubic meters when talking of freighters  jump freightersi support the freighters to be rethought in some way but i dont support ops idea
you really didnt bother to think this through didnt you
nope but unless theres a dedicated ship that can fill the role of moving combatready ships about enmass suggestion standswould 1200000m3 be better two battleships smaller than a carrier
this idea is rediculous as the freighter serves its dedicated role in the game the orca is the highsecurity ship carrier so why not make a small modification to thismy idea is to increase the ship maintenance bay by 20 to 500k this would allow it to fit one of a few battleships and also other ships that might be needed to move a vast improvement but by no means gamebreaking like multiplying the bay by 10
if your going to do that make an orca mk2 tech 2 version of the orca and require industrial command ship v for itproblem solveddetails can be worked out laterthe ops idea is so bloody asinine and stupid its not worth even trolling
why not just make a new kind of shipship freightermoves ships cant scoop can probably only hold 2 battleships has no cargo etc
the problem is not to have or not the hulk  i use the hulk alreadythe covetor hasnt a good balance skill time about the same than the hulktanking about the same than the retrieverfor me this ship is completly unbalancedtwo possibility reduce the skill to use them ex astrogeology iv or mining barge iv but not the both a vincrease a little the tanking
but much lower price and insurable
unbalanced covetor not ischeap supposed to befix not it needhulk you buy
black ops are not in anyway an upgrade to recons they are two completely different ship lines bos  recons are complimentary to one another the same way that recons and stealth bombers are now complimentary to each other rapier  sbs  win each performs an essential role that the other sorely lacks thus the two work in tandem perfectlythe problem with continuously upgrading is the danger of obsoleting previous tiers of ships there is no upgrade from recons because recons already do the job exceptionally well there doesnt need to be an upgraded version of a force reconheres the upgrade path for recons1 t1 astrometrics frigate upgrades to the t2 covert ops frigate2 t1 ewar frigate upgrades to the t2 electronic attack frigate3 t1 ewar cruiser  t2 covert ops frigate upgrades to the t2 force recon cruiser4 t1 ewar cruiser  t2 eaf upgrades to the t2 combat recon cruiserthis ship line was shoe horned in after the fact technically its not a part of the upgrade path but for consistency im including itthe upgrade paths for hacs logistics command ships etc has already been listed heres the the tacklefleet tacklesupercap tackle upgrade path1 t1 fasttackle frigate upgrades to the t2 interceptor2 t2 interceptor  the t1 destroyer upgrades to the t2 interdictor3 t2 interdictor  the t1 combat cruiser upgrades to the t2 heavy interdictoragain not per the tech tree but close enoughand bos1 t1 missilesnipealpha frigate heh upgrades to the the t2 stealth bomber2 t2 stealth bomber  t1 gank battleship upgrades to the t2 black ops battleshipalso not per the tech tree but as far as roles are concerned this is the upgrade pathblack ops are not ewar they have nothing in common as far as roles are concerned with force recons the widow is a raven hull all of its stats including its slot layout is adapted from a raven hull its 2 caldari battleship skill bonuses are taken directly from the raven the same is true for the panther it is based off the tempest not the typhoonunfortunately all blackops were shoehorned into being the tier 1 bs while all marauders were labeled as the tier 2 bs which is the only reason why the widow had to take one of the useless bonuses from the scorpion which is whats lead to all this confusion over their roles all black ops are based off of the t1 gank bs all of them receive dual weapon bonuses from the t1 gank bs their role is very straight forward damagegank

currently to run 5 invention jobs you need to have the datacores in the lab and then run 5 individual jobs what i propose is that if you want to start 5 jobs you highlight 5 bpcs and providing there are enough datacores and free slots in the lab all 5 jobs are startedhave it limited to only 5 jobs at once or even 10 jobs at oncequeued per lab this would be to stop people queuing up a full day of invention jobs
i agree with the above complexes need to be fought to capture and give lp points for capturing them and i also want to say faction militia should have factionwarfare specific items in their storenot better but at least a few unique modules or ships
i dunno what the best solution is but fw in general needs a lot of fixitup for sure
this is the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen and believe me ive never seen it this bad before if you would all draw your attention to this image
cuz they buy licences every month they dont do anyhthing because they saddly keep the plex flowing money is the reasonas alwaysi hope somebody can prove me wrong
that is an interesting image and to me it definitely shows a macroer at work ccp does care about macroing as it depletes the economy and creates money from another source for relatively nothing when i was in reykjavik certain unnamed sources told me that they have something in the works and although it has taken quite some time i do hope that this is trueas a carebear this activity does pain me to see as people are destroying eves carefullybalanced economy for the sake of a few dollars of gain and at the cost of many people tied to a computer screen for unknown hours a day i like you want this to go away and have even made suggestions to how it might be done but i trust that ccp doesnt like this any more than i do and they will do something about itfor now ill wait but it does drive me crazy to see
you really dont get that i was aming for an also blinky in todays patch well whateverto your and its sound i think its far from just take this passagethe current defaults where only outlaws are set to blink is rather unintuitive  the blink seems to suggest that theres a great deal of urgency involved but people who are just outlaws cant actually legally shoot you by contrast war targets are currently nonblink by default despite the fact that they can shoot you at willi bolted the funny part as outlaws will shoot you no matter if its legal or not ironicaly thats why they are called outlaws also its urgent when you consider the flashy guys in highsec until now were mostly suicide ganker aside from the average shuttle  interceptor traveler who appears some semi few seconds on your overviewwhat looks more dangerous a simple red button or a flashy red onealso let us take into account the differenece between a wartarget and an outlawwartarget is shootable without begin attacked by gategunsoutlaw is shootable without being attacked by gategunswartarget can shoot us without being attacked by gategunsoutlaw will be attacked by gateguns this is only in our favor when we dont attack first so it dont makes a huge difference except that it would be a positive thing for us if they started so its in our favor and who would mind thatwartarget can jump to highsec after deagressingoutlaw can jump to highsec after deagressing will either be killed by concord or the faction police will web him for warp out so its a 50 50 thing non the less it works again in our favor
when will you understand that this is for newbies if billy mcnoobcorp see something flashy red on his overview hes going to think that it poses a threat or hes going to shoot at itor bothim unsure how outlaw mechanics work in highsec yes i realize they will get shot by faction police but its possible to tank those for a time do people that fire on an outlaw get marked as legal targets for said outlaw if so it seems that poor old billy is now in dire straits if not mehthe point is that ccp wanted to polish off an aspect of the game that could end up frustrating a lot of newbies it is not their problem or anyone elses if you are too lazy to change your overview settings from the default as such this issue is hardly worthy of the assembly hall where people raise issues that ccp and ccp alone can fixedit you said i say why not just make outlaws and wartargets flashy they are both shootable anywhere on sight it wont make much of a difference and i say why not just get off your ass and change it yourself if thats how you want it fine but dont go thinking that it should be that way for everyone else
wrong button grr 230am p
i never said that sleeper drones attacking fit in the heretofore established cannon i just supported it it would be hilarious nice job using ad hominem attacks to try to prove me wrongfrom a completely separate discussionand the point still stands that this is no one elses problem
u madits stil a thing only ccp can change from what its now or you ganna tell me where the field is so i can turn on blinky for other tags than warmilita targetacctualy outlaw bold red vs bold red low standing is a problem a lot people will face but sure have your oppinioni really would like to have the oppinion of a member of the cva block on this who work in both lowsec and 00 and enforce a playstyle nrds that is heavy influenced by this
im excited by walking in stations do any of you csm candidates have a vision for walking in stations is there a walking in stations idea youre thinking of supporting already
i support increased market pvp if some jerk is undercutting you on your primary sale product you should have the option to kneecap him with an electric drillbut seriously im interested to see what the final implementation looksfeels like once that happens ill start coming up with ideas on how id like to improvechangeremove the featurestill feels a little early to wildly speculate on it to me
these are the features of walking in stations that i think will be implimented and id like your support of them players get to set up run their own bars decorations can be found in space and put on display players can program npcs to give out missions to other players exotic dancersthis is the feature id like to see eventually finding hollow asteroids in space via exploration being able to get out of your ship in a space suit  firstperson perspective pve  collect lootthe critisism often levelled at eve is the lack of firstperson combat not being able to pilot your own ship tie fighter style i think the above use of walking in stations is an excellent solutionwhats the opinion of the csm candidates
i think it all looks pretty cool and will add some nice fluff to the game anything which adds a bit more depth to the marketcontract system will be welcome however i dont want it to turn into a timesink of wandering around the marketplace into the bowels of the station to find some guns to stick on my spaceshipalso i want them to let me smoke a pipe
i think walking in stations is going to be a huge improvement in the eve experience my major fear is what will happen to eve when the number of new players triples the server loads what i think it does is it can make the trade experience richer it can make the corporate and alliance experence more social and immersive and generally add dramatically to the social aspect of evei cant waitissler
social eve is not pewpew
walking in stations is for socialising but in asteroids it could be put to another use
and eve is way more than just pew pewissler
and eve is way more than just pew pewissler i have to agree with you there i cannot help but fear that a new breed of players will join post ambulation that rarely venture from stations and enjoy all the other delights eve has to offer you could argue that there is nothing wrong with this rplay opportunities etc arent to be sniffed at but as they will be low consumers of market goods it wont benefit the many other types of players of eve much hence if you dont rply maybe ambulation wont be that exciting afterall unless there are great fighting engines developed for physical combat between avatars etc a mobile avatar in a station is afterall just a supedup interface then again maybe im being a ludite
as long was wis follows the standard system security protocol i am sure this will be fine
agree with this but i also think that part of the security measures should be the next 3 things ships blown up by concord give no insurance payout at a security status lower then 0 you can not insure your ship concord pods players not with gate guns but with ships whos security standing is lower then 2if people make a choice to be a pirate they should take the consequences of being a pirate and in the old day pirates where hanged shot and quartered no mercy given by the major empiresthis would also solve loads of jita lag
210 terrible troll
i dont understand your response trit and pyerite already trade at an effective 3 significant digit restriction and i dont think anyone is complaining about that as i write this there are 9 orders to sell trit at jita 4m4 cnap for 424 isk and they are all waiting patiently to fill those orders in a firstcomefirstserved order mex isogen and nocxium all trade under 100 isk so they currently trade with an effective 4 significant digit limitation the only minerals that would even be effected by a 4 digit limitation would be zydrine magacyte and morphitefrankly minerals would be the market least effected so perhaps you misunderstood my proposal in which case i would be happy to explain further if not i cant make any sense out of your response and i would appreciate it if you could explain what you mean
thank you for the support should you wish to vote for me here is an easy link to use
im frequently annoyed by the fact that i cannot man my alliances holding corp guns without leaving my own corporation what are your views on this do you think there should be a mechanic that allows members within the same alliance use pos guns and stuff between corps such as a role
yeah you sound like the sort of guy dark harlequin needs on the csm have advised the corp of your candidacy and informed our head of security to do an exit poll of our membership fly well
how will you talk with ank on matters subject to an nda should you get into the csm i would have thought that much of what the csm discusses with ccp would be subject to such a thing
cyprus ill start out by saying that my answer is probably not what you want to hear and im sorry to disappoint you maybe ive misjudged the tone of your post and maybe this answer will be satisfying to you i hope that this is the casewhen i started playing the game in late 2006 the new player experience was nearly nonexistant i was directed to warp to a local new player training area beacon marking a 110 deadspace area where i could engage a few harmless npcs mine a little veldspar and loot a canthere was an individual of less than savory nature camping this particular area he consistently killed and looted the npcs before i could and he looted the reward can at the end of the complex to prevent new players from recovering its contents i was unable to do anything to stop him and the tutorial did not give me any further instructions on how to say go find a new beacon i sat for 15 hours and waited for him to get bored and leave i did not have my local chat channel open at the time but im sure that he was laughing at me somewhereas a gallente character i did not even start with the drones skill it was a week before i even figured out that my ship not only had a drone bay but that i needed special skills to utilize it i went through about 10 atronclass frigates before i figured out that the market contained equipment fittable to frigates other than the civilian models it wasnt until i joined my first corp that i learned that gallente traditionally base their defenses on armor repairers and not shield boostersthe tutorials were clickthrough windows that were just informative enough to confuse me i started with even fewer skillpoints then than new characters start with now and i didnt start with accelerated skill trainingyou want to know the really amazing part of this story i kept playingi am not in favor of handholding eve hardly presents a tolerant universe i think its unfair to give new players the impression that they will be helped in all their endeavors i think that the changes to the new player experience thus far have been great to improving the experience without just handing you the information that should be learned as you go allowing annual attribute redistribution has given some comfort to the older players who allocated all those points to charisma in the hopes that it would improve our interaction with other players what can i say i was new and knew nothing of eve while accelerated skill training allows new players to reach a level of combat readiness without feeling locked in to their chosen profession i cant tell you how many new recruits i had to convince that just because they chose the special ops profession doesnt mean they cant fly anything well but stealth bombers especially since until recently stealth bombers were a bit of a jokethe fact is that no matter how disappointing or confusing the new player experience is now it does not even begin to compare to how it used to be if there are portions that you find to be confusing bring them up things that need to be clarified tutorials that could be improved hell spelling errors that need correction fine i will look into it and act accordingly im not going to just say eh close enough however i am strongly against a new player experience that drops you into the middle of all the information you need that will remove the mystique of the world of eve and i guarantee people will become bored with it long before they find something interesting in it retention rates in my opinion will not be altered by telling you exactly how things work eve is a complex game it does not and can not appeal to everyone thats part of why i like it im a bit of an elitist bastardnew player experience can always use tweaking but fixing no its not broken
thank you solo player i dont think you know just how much that generous show of support meant to mefly safe o7
well looks like ill be abstaining again this election
large arty need a fairly substantial boost to alpha even at the expense of rof maybe a touch more rangelarge acs could do with more falloff
already raised in csm1 by bane glorious
that was large autocannons not large projectiles in general and even if the topic has been raised before finding out the candidates opinions on something that has been raised before i dont think is an issue
they are one of a huge list of things that need constant evaluation by ccp to make sure there is balance i am reluctant to take a single item in a very complicated set of factors as something that needs dranatic action i think they need a tweak to be sure but in the context of overall balanceso short answer they need attention i think ccp has been made aware of that i expect there will be blanace changes at some point in the future to address the issue if we dont see some change to address the issue then the csm should again remind ccp that this needs to be taken into account when they adjust the balance of the gameissler
iulixxi i like what i read in your website and your answers to the blog but i have not seen anything from you on the forumswhat do other voter think of his ideas
since i dont know any of the candidates ive read all the interviews that ive found on several blogswell i discovered that all of them gave noobish answers to any question someone didnt know anything about some game mechanics but was sadly speaking like he was a university teachersomeone simply and clearly gave the same answer of someone that was interviewed before him someone said i dont know too many times someone gave simply crazy answers something like if i was insert a powerful person i would have done insert something incredibly stupidlong story short all the interviewed guys sadly looks like a bunch of noobs dangerous for this game and im a bit worried of what they will be capable to doi hope facts will prove that im wrong
there are at least 2 very expeianced people on that list
theres always mrabstain to vote for thats who i chose best method to let them know how much they suck
just hit the abstain button like i did its utterly pointless anyway
ill vote for whichever candidate is getting me a fuel bay on mah black ops 
code for this is already in the works and is most likely added in the next expansion along with ammo bays and ore bays
i voted for cat it was the only sensible choice tbh
lol
yep when voting for a 21year old male cretin that likes to get a rise from people by pretending to be a teenage girl makes sense you prove the notion that its utterly pointless
excuses excuses there were three choices1 run for office yourself2 vote for someone3 dont careif you choose 3 then obviously you cant be worried of what they candidates will be capable to do
i havent seen any of the interviews  can anyone point me towards them
1 i cant i dont have time and i dont speak a fluent english2 id love to but nobody seems good3 how can i i do care for this game i dont want it to be ruinedwe all play the same game how can i be indifferent to what happen or could happen
and waste your time dealing with people that are so utterly full of themselves they forgot what theyre supposed to be doing in the csm and instead spend their time with political stupid talk and propagandamrabstain is a valid voting option as defined by the voting mechanics installed by ccp he only needs to take up a seat if he gets enough votes to stay a visible stain showing off the csms failureabout 9092 of the player base does not care or vote i do care enough about the csm and the purpose it could serve for ccp and the players to express my disgust at the mutated abomination we currently have in a simple vote for mr abstain
the interviews are here i also have a list of the candidates which seem to have dedication and the thought power required for the job of a csm herefor those who dont want to vote it is your right but realize that the csm hold a very influential and busy position in their role you can wear your tinfoil hats if you want but after serving on the council for this term i know just how important our role is as liaisons between ccp and the playerbasesome would try to tell you that there is more to the position than that but were basically only liaisons and filters for ideas from both sides if you think the role of csm is worthless we should also get rid of all diplomats and ambassadors as they fill essentially the same role as csm members
hehemaybe make a list of what you have against the other csm candidates
so interviews aside not voting because you think all the candidates are noobs is a pretty weak reason so a list of candidates i know are not noobs include and this is not an endorsement but just a factcat oninetails i think the premier crime  punishment candidateomber zombie csm ii and deep knowledge of the gameadmiral iceblock five year ceo with good ideaserik finnegan the successor to ankhesentapemkahhappy joymaker evil spy assasin guy  actually not a bad pvper with some real skills and experienceruri dant the can flipper griefer new corp ward decer guyextreme great csm altherschel yamamoto seems to have some great well though out ideasvuk lau supreme maximum leader of the csm ii and a leader of a large allianceas for the rest of the candidates i havent looked at them enough to say i know they arent noobs but honestly i doubt any of them should be described that wayas for me noob i feel like one all the time but somehow ive managed to continue to play eve actively for over 4 years my corp founded over three years ago is still active and healthy with 140 members oh and my alliance is now over a year old so either eve is insanely easy to play or i figured out at least some small part of the gamei hope youll look again at some of the candidates and find one that you could support if you cant decide you couldnt go wrong voting for any of the candidates i listed in my not a noob list i hope you do find a way to participate in the processissler
heres what ive noticed after viewing all of the csms stances and issuessome csms are just playing on the forum fotm issues with no real substance behind itsome csms are making insane game altering promises that they obviously cannot keepsome csms have openly admitted the only reason why theyre running is for the free trip to icelandsome csms stand for nothing have nothing to say have no issues or agendas and have barely said a word regarding their candidacy some csms are requiring all of their alliance members to vote for them regardless if they agree or notsome csms are just in it for the lulzmost csms are trying to push 00 issues that most players in eve really dont care aboutalmost none of the csms give a damn about fw those that do treat it like a minor nuisance instead of a valid issueonly one csm bothered to mention the words new and player in the same sentence let alone address new player concerns a vague issue this csm candidate later retractedi could go on and on about all this csm nonsense but i think the point has been made dont act surprised when you see the voter turnout
cyprus brought up some things key that i admit i have not brought up in my campaign postings first fwwhen it was introduced i created several splinter corps for members of my corp to leave to one for each race to try out fw in the end none of us liked it much but i see it still as important to many folks i think if fw is important to you then then erik and the take care party are a clear choice i wouldnt claim to have the experience knowledge or focus i believe ahk has established as core to the party erik representsas to new player experience i havent done much outward facing communications concerning the new player experience what i did however was buy the retail package as soon as it was available and started a new character outside any of my corp or alliance i continue to leave that character a secret and play it regularly to continue to try and see eve thorugh fresh eyes i had a lot of feedback that was provided directly to ccp in our session about the last major patch the summary is i think it has a lot stuff that needs attentionfor example the new player guide that came with the retail packaging was a not a hard copy i felt that was a cheat and largely useless and in many places misleading or wrong for example it implied i could have a career as an artist in eve still looking for that skilli do not like the new get your skills through missions approach as compared to the get them when you roll the characteri do like the reroll that came out sort of a result thoughi didnt find much in the new player missions that prepared me any better than what existed before the revampso eve remains a hard game to start out in the question that begs then how much of ccps developer resources should go to improving that segements experience verses the rest of the pilots in eve i hope for a balanced approach as i am all for a lot of new players but i also am concerned about the growing player base and he finite resources we all compete forissler
much love for you issler dainze i think youre just about the only one whos openly acknowledged the existence of new playersim in the firm belief that there should indeed be some hand holding for brand new players not throughout their entire eve experience of course but just enough in the beginning to understand the fundamentals i have also gone through the post apocrypha new player experience and imo it does not teach the fundamentals not in any clear senseweve all seen new players having to learn the hard way often emoragequitting before they reach six months though funny and entertaining to read it is also sad at the same timei was fortunate to have an eve vet roommate who took the time to show me the ropes ingame he was always there to shout answers down the hallway whenever i had a question not all new players have such a luxuryi believe this should have been ccps 1 priority in a business sense more players translates into more income disgruntled players who cant figure out what to do or how to play often leave which translates to loss of income eve is after all an income generating source for ccp new player attraction and retention should be top priorityi dont believe eve needs to change to accommodate new players rather i believe a better clearer and easy to understand tutorial is necessarysomething i might get around to tackling once i purchase fraps
i spend my time in game building mostly tech 2 items and blowing things up in missions i play this way as i am a casual only player with about an hour to play a day and in that time i can normally complete either 1 level 4 mission or set up new queues to build and research stuff that said here are my issues1 new toys the last expansion had nothing interesting for me i want tech 1 salvage able to be engineered into tech 2 salvage so i can build tech 2 rigs to upgrade my ships a tiny little bit without spending a billion isk this was supposed to be implemented in apoc but was removed i want it yesterday anyways2 cheaper toys as the player base continues to increase with the same amount of moon minerals approx always being mined the price of rare moon minerals continues to climb and thus the cost of tech 2 ships continues to climb this is annoying ccp introduced a prenerfed feature called alchemy that was supposed to ameliorate the scarcity of tech 2 raw materials alchemy needs to be fixed so that players with the appropriate levels of skills can afford to fly their new ships and the neverending price increases need to be reversed for a while so tech 2 ship prices drop3 crowded mission hubs  when i started playing 3 years ago there were often only 10 or 20 people in mission systems now there are hundreds all the time creating constant lag spam and griefing i do not want any of the current level 4 agents moved i want more added as the player base increases all of the carebears eventually move to level 4 agents then they sit there forever unless they go pvping if ccp added 39 more high sec level 4 agents to each race 20 to 19 mixing the different types this would go a long ways toward spreading out the player basei realize my priorities are not everyones priorities i personally have 2 votes i also think there are a lot of carebear lurkers that share my priorites candidates please post here if you do as wellthanks
my campaign threadto respond to your specific issues1 i have to be honest when i dont remember a mention of a t1 salvage  t2 salvage processing mechanic if you could cite a reference i would be happy to provide a more informed response as it stands tech 2 rigs are a serious investment in the current market most tech ii rigs cost more than a tech ii cruiser according to current values at evecentral a capacitor control circuit i costs 168 million isk a capacitor control circuit ii costs very nearly 300 million isk unless my math is wrong it might be im a bit tired that represents a price increase of around 1700 compared now to a thorax t1 cruiser and a deimos t2 varient of the thorax hull the thorax costs 63 million and the deimos costs 113 million this once again represents approximately a 1700 price increasei recognize that the information provided here is hardly conclusive scholarly research but i think it illustrates my point all tech 2 prices are a little ludicrous but tech 2 rigs are not necessarily costlier than tech 2 ships proportionally speaking2 tech 2 and to a much greater extent tech 3 remain largely unattainable production goals unless you have significant manhours to devote to development and maintenance be that large quantities of personal game time or large numbers of corp members all willing to chip in i would love to see tech 2 production become slowly cycled into the mainstream possibly by altering the invention mechanic to make success more likely and less expensive i recognize that ccp does not want to eliminate the benefit of holding tech 2 bpos as they earned them in a way meaningful at the time of their release however tech 2 is almost commonplace now but the prices continue to stay high many people complain about the isk faucet of level 4 missions until prices for tech 2 ships at least become reasonable the influx of isk will be necessary to continue to afford them its simple cause and effect when things cost less people need less money when people need less money they do things that arent as immediately profitable like for instance pvp yeah that got your attention didnt it oh boy willing targets and all we have to do is charge less who would have thought rant3 hating level 4s is the flavor of the week right now which makes anyone with a bit of a chip on their shoulder unlikely to take this complaint at all seriously i recognize that level 4s supply a large amount of isk with little risk involved and i recognize that reprocessing the loot from them has seriously altered the mineral market i am in favor of curtailing the loot drops within level 4s to reduce both the income due to module sales and the massive influx of minerals to the market i recently moved with my corp out of the area surrounding amarr they spent most of their time with a level 4 agent in the tashmurkon region i spent most of mine with the muchloved edami dantan of penirgman we moved into areas less densely populated and do you know what we found more level 4 agents higher quality level 4 agents still in highsec with comparatively small numbers of pilots utilizing them there are plenty of level 4 agents around but they arent going to be brought to you sometimes you have to build standings with a new corporation sometimes a new faction you may have to relocated 30 jumps away but there are places to run level 4s without overcrowding escaping the ninja salvagers and the can looters already in the universe and i seriously believe that adding significantly more level 4 agents to the universe of eve is one of the few things ccp would never do
this is a sensitive subject since tech2 salvage material tends to come from a finite supply adding it to missions would result in issues for the ingame economy given the fact there is no limit to mission availability maybe the careful addition of t2 salvage material to the end of storyline missions might be reasonable i would gladly bring the topic up to ccp if elected and the issue gets representation in the assembly hallunfortunately supply and demand is at play here concerning tech2 ships the valueable r64 moon minerals are found in nullsec 00 space and lowsec which are defended viciously by whomever is claiming them therefore they set the price on based on the risk and effort that goes into mining those resources they are also getting their ships destroyed in the process to do this slowly adding more cadmium and mercury moons into the game might not be totally reasonable but it has to be done carefully it would be unfair to the alliances out in 00 if the very thing theyve spent years fighting over was devalued i do understand your wish to jump in better ships but one thing to keep in mind is the fact mission running can be a very low risk endeavor i dont see any reason why there shouldnt be more level 4 agents added for the purpose of reducing lag if the system is getting overloaded the only other reasonable solution is ccp reinforcing that node but that might be something better for saving use for 00 combat situations however as garthran said it might just be a matter of doing some research and finding less crowded agents yes itll require grinding up standings on someone new but that is part of the game rightjus lookin what ideas do you have for giving the onehoureachnight players something they can do and still feel like theyve accomplished something each login as your csm representative i would be glad to hear your opinions each one of us plays this great game for a reason and thankfully ccp is a company that gives the players plenty of ways like the csm fanfest to be heard
looking for industrialistanticarebear candidate
hey jus ive been on the csm for the past two terms and im currently campaigning for erik finnegan my successor with your playstyle id say you should check him out but also consider giving dierdra vaal a lookill tell you what has happened in csm1 and 2 regarding the issues you posted and what my stance on it is expect erik to keep up the same lineccp agrees the disparity between t1 and t2 rigs and salvage is larger than intended not only do they want to address it through the salvage upgrading but they also have a few other plans to improve the situation in the long term which i dont think they disclosed yet so i cant speak about it for nda reasons lets just say ccp is aware of the problem and are working to make adjustments from multiple angles i support this attitude and hope the changes will make it in a bit faster expect erik to raise an issue about this delicate matter if it takes too longccps economist eyjog is monitoring the mineral market closely the current price increases are the result from several factors the upheaval in delve the closing of the exploit and increased demand however eyjo said the current prices are not a reason for concern because they are merely stabilizing towards their original levels before the exploit if the prices continue to rise ccp will step inthat said i agree alchemy is too heavily prenerfed the output quantity is way too low as well and it requires constant attention this needs to be looked at that and i dont really like the whole idea of static moon minerals but i suppose that will get looked at in the major 00 revamp later onthis has been raised in csm1 and discussed in iceland as a result new agents have recently been added to the game expect a devblog on this matter in the next few days
id argue that alchemy is perfectly fineit acts as a pressure valve for the highend moon minerals we can always argue about the fact that it sets the price slightly high but im pretty damn sure that if ccp sees any problem they would fix it rather soon
candidates please post here if you do as wellhey jus ive been on the csm for the past two terms and im currently campaigning for erik finnegan my successor obviously cant read id agree with you lv alchemy was never intended to replace the highend moon mining its an option available when stocks are limited and thus expensive and where an industralist has the capacity and capability to setup a decent synthesis operationclearly some players dont understand the simple economics of supply and demand supply is limited for the rare moon minerals rarity scarcity and demand adds up to a sortafter asset if you hold a moon this creates the environment needed for conflict which is what a lot of eve is about conflict leads to demand for other commodities shipsmodsammo and thus the market wheel is kept turningid argue that prices for the rarer moon minerals arent that high as it is getting sold easily on the markets this i know firsthand prices for modules and ships have gone up as a response to increased base costs but id argue they are still considerably cheaper than preinvention if you wish to see what happens when players push price ceilings look at morphite in jita the past year that hump was the result of one player when supply is limited and then interupted due to wars expect hikesthis game isnt wow unlimited supply and the ability to make stuff very cheaply isnt compatible with the universe that is eve some players forget this and candidatescampaigners and want everything quickly and easily ironic really considering many of them dont enter into the confilct side of eve at all theyll tell you that the playerbase has grown and the seeding of minerals hasnt this should indicate to players that ccp are happy with current seeding and there was just an abundance of minerals early on in eve and a larger playerbase was catered for ie forwardthinking by ccp id argue that with t3 ships being dependant on wh materials we should start to see a drop in demand for materials required to build t12 in the futurexavier
i think i would be a great candidate for you to support i hope youll take some time and read my previous posts as i think they would show you are exactly the type of player i focus on as to your questions1 new toys not every expansion can include new content for all groups of players that said it is important to have csm members that keep ccp remininded of the large number of players like you and that content for this segement of players continues to be included in future plans2 cheaper toys i think there are several issues the promary one is we have essentially fixed amounts of resources being fought over by a much larger player base we have double to players and the same moons and roid belts that is not going to provide a quality game experience if it is not addressed the solution is to adjust the levels of these resources to be back in line with where they had been with a smaller player bases3 crowded mission hubsagain it all comes down to twice the players but the same resources i dont know if more systems or other changes in infrastructure are the answer but clearly the experience has degraded as the game has grown and some sort of change is neededthere was also a discussion of alchemy in this thread i think alchemy is not a solution to the moon scarcity in fact i think alchemy is useless and needs a revamp id love to meet anyone that is using alchemeny in any meaningful way i actually went through the planning to try and use it in our t2 production process and found it to be impossible both in terms materials requirements and more to the point in terms of timei hope this helps you pick the candidate that can best represent you in the csmissler

regarding the extension of supercap battle durability sorry if this was mentioned beforeproblem with current suggestion extra hitpoints will be easily negated by extra dreads and cmon what can survive for 30min when 50 dreads let it ripsollution i know its radical please dont flame too much micro reinforced mode that a supercap enters when it reaches half structure or smth making it indestructible but also imobile for certain set period of timehows that for a whacky idea
i dont like the effect of the dd mentioned in this threadthis does in no case eliminate the hitrun of titansscenario if the first titan places his ddthe new one wellevery other titan in system has 20seconds to fire his dd on thesame fleet without any ship of it being able to get away with the increasing amount of titans i cant see why an allianceshouldnt fire lots of dds on the same fleet destroying every moduleon them leaving them gimped to any conventional fleet without any chanceto get away cause 20secs are enough to totally bubble them down afterthe dd if a titan is going deploy a dd it should be forced to stay on field and not being allowed to warp off that is the most important change that needs to bedone multiply their ehp if needed but dont allow a titan to hitrun
of course it can die if it doesnt have support and it should be that way in response to the direct damage guy weve got 1000 ships in game that do direct damage what is unique about another one even if its damage is massivedd is a unique and tactical weapon it should stay that way however its affect at the moment is just ridiculous so the real question is how do you revamp the dd to have catestrophic effect while not just blowing ships up i think the proposed solution is about as good as it gets i can not stress how much i like the fact that this actually ushers in the desire for t3 ships and goods and gives people a reason to choose bt t2 and t3 goods
t3 is currently beyond the reach of the majority of the player base and may be so for a very long time indeed further to that the baseline cost ccp has indicated it would prefer the t3 to sell at is 300400mil isk so it will be considerably more expensive than the current standard for fleet warfare ie a sniper or rr bsso i have some questionsare you suggesting that t3 becomes the only ship which can survive your heat dd with active modulesassuming the dds are stacked as is likely to be the caseandif so how do you propose pos warfare be carried out with t3 cruisers since these are likely the only ones to survive at the gate
changing the covetors mining barge skill requirementcurrent issuecurrently once a player has achieved the skills to pilot a retriever they skip the covetor and go directly to the hulk as its only a day of more skilling to pilot making the covetor an obsolete ship and creating a huge gap between the retriever and nextinline ship upgradewith over 35 days of skilling to pilot the covetor another day wont matter to skip it and get a hulk instead making the progression bar for the mining career unbalanced and a ship has become obsolete and useless as it was the best mining barge before the release of the hulksuggested fixlowering the covetors mining barge skill requirement from v to iv making the coveter once again an attractable ship to obtain and a perfect ship to pilot while you skill for a hulka retriever is inefficient compared to a hulk which is over 150 better than a retriever there needs to be a ship in between the retriever and hulk and its already in the game the covetor it just need to have its requirements fixed to put it between the retriever and hulkthis will bring balance to the mining career path and once again make the coveter a useful ship players would actually use instead of skipping in favor of the hulkthanks for reading and supporting this
makes sense to me although i hasten to add that i have mining lvl 2 and no other industry skills at all part of the reason for that is the length of training into a half decent ship covetor for it to give a decent isk return on the investment in timepersonally and if anyone repeats this i will pod them but i may be tempted to mine a bit in quieter less pvp times by poking some rocks for a changethis may go some way to encouraging mining and increasing the minerals brought into game through mining therefore also reducing the 40 balance of minerals brought in via lootit wont be a huge change i expect but a collection of smaller balances of which this could be one offer a better overall solutionsupported
when we discussed revamping of mining at iceland this was a major point because a mining barge v requirement for a covetor is stupid imo
its not stupid in my opinion it should be there to be the buffer for those going towards a hulkbut if ccp could consider decreasing the skill requirement of the covertor to only require mining barge lvl 4 you would obtain a much steadier and progressive curve of development as you will enable the practical use of the covertor again in eve as it would then truly become the nextinline after the retrieveras of what it stands now its a major problem as the covertor is a pointless ship in eve and it realy deserves getting some light shed on it once more making it a nextinline in the chain towards mining excellence
thats what im saying
i fully support thisit shouldnt thou be posted as a suggestion but rather an issue as the progression bar of the mining path in eve is currently to broken compared to all the other paths a new character would prefer to takeeven older characters who wishes to skill in the industrial section and go for mining would benefit immensely by this as it would bring balance to the miners
yeah i agree with you on that this is actually more of an issue rather than a suggestion and it should in my opinion be address as soon as possible
i pretty much agree with everything the op saidi as a retriever pilot fully support your proposal signed
if you try to compare other types of professions such as those who prefer combatmission running they have a far more steady and balanced progression in the game where they can obtain more firepower and better ships just within days of creating their character and after a week or 23 they already have surpassed all the miners in terms of profit and progression since they wont have to spend over a month just to get their nextinline ship upgradei believe that the current state of the miners progression needs to be attended quickly and hard to ensure that those who wishes to go down the miners path are able to enjoy their playtime and not being forced to sit in their station waiting for weeks until they can get a viable upgrade from the retriever
i agree fullythere are more of such progression obstacles like cruiser v requirements for the next series of fighting ships progressions that can be looked at but this indeed makes the covetor a useless ship never had one went directly to hulkmika
ya i agree there are also to many instances of requiring skill v as a secondary requirement for some shipsto fly the next class of ship should require level 3 or 4 of the current class to get to the t2 forms of each should require level 4 of the current if someone want to spend that 520 day space to get that last 5 of bonus then more power to them all of type type 2 frigates should require rank 4 in frigates general piloting  1 or 2 other skills at rank 3 or 4 the type 2 destroyers have the insane requirements of frigates 5 destoryers 5  several othersgallente frigate vdestroyers destroyers vspaceship commandspaceship command ivinterceptorsinterceptors ivevasive maneuveringevasive maneuvering vthe point should be to open up more options to the player base and only force specialization if they one the last 510 extra bonus
i couldnt agree with you more aeryn also this whole suggestion is about time we get some changes to this matter its an issue more than it should be a suggestion
they either need to make covetors available at mining barges iv or hulks available at exhumers iv if not vthe gap between covetor and hulk needs to be much wider than it is nowim in favor of making covetor come soonernot later
making the hulk available at exhumer lvl 4 would just worsen the matter but yes make the covertor available at mining barge iv is the best option as it would close the gap between retriever pilots and hulk pilots providing an upgrade in between those two ships
aye i agree
quite so
i cant say id support the making of hulk requiring a higher level of exhumers as i feel that it already takes long enough to be able to pilot a ship like thatbut the matter needs to be focused on fixing the gap between what ship to look at once your in the retriever cause so far the covertor is left in the dark and has ended up being a useless ship in eve as everyone just skips it going straight for the hulk wich takes just a few more days of skilling to obtainif we could rally the support and get the mining barge skill required for the covertor lowered down to iv we would have shaved of over 20 days of skill training required to pilot it thus making it a viable nextinline ship to obtain before starting to skill towards the hulkto perhaps make this a lot more balanced it would be a good choice to add a requirement of spaceship command iv requirement to the covertor and raise the hulks spaceship requirement to lvl v instead of ivby doing so there will be brought balance to the progression curve for a miners career path making it easier and survivable when trying to play this path in the gamethis should be a equal terms of boosting and nerfing that should gain the support by not only the older players but new ones as well
ok i agree that we need more gradient for mining shipsbut not this quote not this quote at allrequiring v for t2 ships makes perfect sense just like how you require v for most t2 gear t2 requires time and effort taking something to iv in 4 days isnt time and effort and most people wouldnt ever train a v skill againhonestly i think the op is a wonderful idea but this quote is completely ignorant to the fact that theres a reason the perlevel boosts are small maybe if they were bigger itd work but it wouldnt change the fact that if things were the way stated in the quote no one would ever train those skills to vsupportive to op
some posts are getting off topic here i can agree to thatid like for more people to open their eyes and respond to this matterthis is an issue that needs to be addressed cause its affecting a lot of peoples playtime playstyle and in game experience which could be the turning point of whether or not a new player would even bother continue playing as one of eves most basic profession needs an serious do over and this is how they can start by fixing the biggest gap in the mining fleetlower the mining barge level requirement on the covertor to lvl iv to make this ship a viable upgrade from the retriever on your path towards perfection in your chosen career path
i agree completely lowering the requirement for the covertor to 4 both for mining barge and for astrogeology makes a lot of sensethis is kind of off topic but what about adding a 3rd tier of mining barges something that could truly be called a capital mining ship the orca or rorq are all well and good but they arent actually for mining they are for supporting miners i would love to see a capital mining ship of some kindanyway full support for the covertor having its skill requirements lowered
i support the opcovetor beeing reduced to mining barge lvl 4 makes a lot of senselvl5 is a nice barrier of entry for tech 2 gear but most tech 1 stuff does not require lvl 5 and shouldnt it would be nice to see another barge above hulk perhaps requiring exhumers 4 or 5 something with 4 strip mining slots a third low slot and a nice shield tank capacity call it a deep space mining barge but this is another topic entirely p
lowering the astrogeology skill would just end up making the retriever a pointless ship to go for since the covetor would be a better alternativ since it would put the covetorhulk case and make it into a retrievercovetor caseby just lowering the mining barge lvl requirement you put the covertor right in between the retriver and hulk in terms of skill training time it takes to obtain thoseafter you have skilled for the retriver you would have to endure 155 days roughly estimated before you could pilot a covertor if the mining barge requirement was lowered from v to ivafter that you would have to endure a little over 21 days of skill training given that you have by that time 3 implants lvl iv t1 learning skills and iii t2 learning skillsit would bring balance into the mining barge flotillathis is a matter that needs to be fixed not in the future but nowfor the future once weve gotten this changed then we could start asking for a ship that could surpass even the hulk in terms of mining 
i agree with what valkyrie aeris is saying about bringing balance to the system and not ending up making it to easy while doing soits obvious that we are not asking for some major buff or massive nerf here just simply trying to raise the voices of the people to address a vital starting point in the whole system for bringing new life into the mining path of the gamei strictly believe that this isnt a massive change that could affect the entire eve universe but it will change the game experience for people as they will finally have a more steady bar of development in their chosen career path while at the same time bringing the covertor back out there in the asteroid fields so let me hear you all give your thumbs up and lets get this change implementedwhat do we want lowered level requirements of the skill mining barge from v to iv on the covertorwhen do we want it yesterday
if we could get this fix implemented as soon as possible it would be the perfect step in the right direction for the ccp devs making changes to the current mining system in eve which so many people desires that it gets a makeover
thanks for picking out the negative in my statement i was saying i agree that the cov should be a lvl 4 shipi was just arguing with that other person about how t2 ships shouldnt take lvlv skillsi wholly agree with the fact that the cov with the current skill requirements is stupidly useless
the are a few thing i can think of to add this carriers should have a new type of dronefighter for planetary bombardment say a bomber that fires once or twice then returns for ammo ammo could be a thing the carrier pilot has to buyalso what if players could hire npc ships to help defend theyre assets obviously there would be a limit say 5 seems a bit boring just shooting static weapon emplacements they could respawn after downtime and have a dailyweeklymonthly cost or the is a sub orbital shipyard that makes them again after resources have been put into it that or just buy them again after being destroyed like emplacements just a thought or what about this say an enemy alliance wants to take over a moon baseasteroid basecolony they could go to the sub orbital station attack this into a state where they can use it and then put marines  armed planetary vehicles in it to take over the colony this is an optional way to get the colony without blowing it to bits and paying for repairs there would be a time delay on when they would win if there was enough of an attacking force put down obviously fights arent won instantly and especally if your battleground is a city

oh dear god yes please
anyone who doesnt support this because it would make missions easier to afk is an idiot should miners be forced to reactivate their lasers after each cycle because its too easy for them to afk currently should producers be limited to creating a single item per production run the benefits of introducing this feature far outweigh the negatives associated with yet another afk isk making method
why it has not been implemented yet is shocking after so many years it is a no brainer

i find it interesting that i read thru 16 pages on this and not one question regarding that stance ccp has about  pushing more players into 00   i see what honestly looks like the same small groups of folks screaming at each other  all the while embracing this assumption that if there was even more stuff in 00 there would be a mass exodus into 00 no i think you all relise why there are very few players exculsive to 00 and it isnt about isk itself its about being able to log on and go play without hassel without uberdoom without having to constantly look over your shoulder or wait around for enough other people that wanna do what you wanna do to be around yes i already hear the keyboards going at this im such a n00b ect ect yet i think youll find that argument is the reason even most of you make money in empire and blow it in 00 wanna make lowsec and 00 attractive less hassel less stress simple to say but extremly unpopular to admit you wanted the biggest ships best rocks best ice  ect ect   you got it  and your alone noone even wants to try going out there because its just not worth   there time not isk alone but simply because it eats up time and stresses folks out to even try going out there guessing this is where youll start trolling and screaming carebear you said it yourself risk vs reward its not that there isnt reward there its that stress and risk to even make the attempt isnt worth it to most players because they just wanna play in lowsec and moreso in 00 you just cant really do that now can you  you all wanted the pressure guess what  most other players dont they wanna go shoot some bad guys mine a few rocks chatter with others and relax so while i do agree that you all could use more to do out there and a few of the sugestions i see on here seem great in that direction ccps idea that if they keep just tossing candy out there that more players will swarm out into it no not really some revamping that might instead make it less stressful that might be a better question
some awesome ideas in here i particularily like the ideas around moving sov holding to planets upgrading stations with agents upgrading planets with colonies i understand that npc trade goods are an isk sink for the economy and this may be a good thing but this could be remedies simply by paying salary to colony personel the idea of making small gang targets out of the colonies is awesome perhaps incorporate some of the sub profesion skills such as hacking and salvaging for small gangs to exploit hostile resources

fixedminer drones add to first post
supporteddrones need lovedrone rigs implants maybe t2 ewar drones and fightersmaybe make ewar drones not complete crap
i agree more drone items would be handywhat about a highslot drone item that would boost drone damage output carrier have one in that they can use an extra fighter but for everything smaller the only high slot items for boosting dps on a drone ship are guns and those generally arent all that usefulhaving a rig that gives 25 bandwidth and drone bay might be nice too
bait ships need loving also would be nice to have 1 on me for roving gangsplz give ccp also bamp
obviously a good idea
from a rp perspective one could argue that it is hard if not impossible to repair structural damage through the armor but as there are remote hull reppers i cant see why there cant be hull repping drones
im all for armor and hull reppers no longer working in combat only in deaggressed situations but hull repping drones are definitely part of that mad vision i have
hull rep drones would be very nice indeed
excellent idea and great quote

absolutely unsupportable proposal let me tell you whyif op is right and the statistics are true removing t1 loot from the game would  up the economy for quite a long time not just a short period would raise hyperinflation and even when the stress is over and markets are back to balance longlong time average prices of anything would be a way lot higher than nowadays at least of those that are in any way connected with mineralsjust to connect it to rl as eve market is too much like rl there is a global drought that takes 40 of the food production globally that would kill millions and would make food prices go skyhigh and its still not the same as in eve when you know its going to happen like god ccp comes and sais let there be drought and there is gonna be drought all the wealthy would immediately buy as much as possible not for using it but to have profit on the prices rising sucking out even more resources from the market anyone who produces food in big quantity wouldnt bring it to the market for the same reason both killing even more millions or lets say probably close to a billion thinking earthwise anyone who produces food in smaller quantities also wouldnt bring their goods to the market because their fear of death of starvation market dies for quite a long period producers andor owners start bartering as money isk is not a good way to store your riches as it devaluates too quickly meaning noone wants money for the food everyone wants food for money too many hungry eskimos and no seals nor whaleslook at any of the rws hyperinflations the problem is that whoever owns the goods dont want to sell them at any price because if he doesnt spend his money immediately he will loose quite a lot the only viable option is bartering being an economist and being hungarian the country that produced the highest hyperinflation on earth up to this day i highly against this proposalfor further information hyperinflation see
simple solution replace all loot with refineables  the thingies that drone npcs dropindustry will become more popular and profitable since manufacture will be the only way to get t1 modules missions would be still interesting since it wouldnt be actually nerfed the only thing that changes is that players will depend more on manufacture to get modules that they need
why not slowly phase the loot out then
since op has his problem with the t1 loot that is refined for minerals this one would not be a solution for him as far as i can guess following the chain since manufacturing needs minerals you can finish it alone on the other hand it would be quite nice for me and other economists to see what it would do and how people and market would react on such a thing to happen eve is already a bit short of trit or at least their price history sais so long term rise in prices on a free and fully competitive market indicates shortage in that good andor its substitute goodsbut still im playing this game to have some entertainment and would happily leave work behind when logging in  so im still unsupportive is there such a word d edit reading through the first few posts again im wondering what people are thinking about market reactions named loot instead of simple t1 ones haha make named loot unprocessable hahahahaha let me guess named items price drops as hell and noone cares to buy t1 stuff yes it solves the problem of the too much minerals as noone would care to buy them for t1 production since there would be no demand for simple t1 mods btw reality shows that simple t1 modules buysell order prices are quite balanced while named ones are meh quite hectic id say 80 of the loot i reprocess or leave behind in space are named ones crap named ones tho
i think this idea is a bit rash i am against itpossibly mission loot should be dropped damaged ccp could make damaged mods refine less effectively and they would have to be repaired before sale thus making them marginally less profitable than manufactured items
removing loot altogether would be very bad economically for a change like that something would have to be done to counter the reprocussions such as giving existing asteroid belts a buff to cope with the large number of miners that will spawn from the economic backlashas for it perminantly destroying the market that likely wont happen prices will increase dramaticly for maybe two weeks but they will stabalize reletively quickly as more miners take to the beltsthere was a ton of stuff being produced for nothing with the pos exploit the aftermath of this change would be compareable to what happened when it was fixed
there are several problems if you remove t1 loot reduced mineral intake increased mineral demand you need to build the t1 module to build the t2 module increased use of building slots see above unbalance in iskmaterial inflow in mission even if the isk reward stay the same removing part of the loot the rapport change and the isk part of the total reward will go from 40 to 60all that say inflation  building slot shortage not a good combination
then what about the proposal of cutting reprocess of all loot in half and keeping drone ore at full reprocessthis wouldnt hurt things nearly as much and it would slowly help with the issue of how way too many minerals come from mission lootitd effectively cut mission minerals down to 20 instead of 40 or 25 if you include drone loot with the full refine bonus thus making the impact much less painfulim still supportive of no meta 0 loot but i would be perfectly fine with my proposalcurrent reprocessing percentages are waaaaaaaaaay too high sure they use the same numbers as refining ore but they shouldnt you should lose a lot when breaking a gun back down to basicsand before yall argue that in the future we can refine way bettercurrent technology allows us to target objects way better than in eve among many other things in eve that wouldve improved instead of devolved like scan probes autopilot etc they devolved for gameplay reprocess should not be futuristically evolved it should be balance to where its not such a ridiculously easy way to get lowsec and nullsec oresplus eve has an economy that is based on deinflation and this is not caused by mission loot if anything you wouldnt get hyperinflation youd get true inflation making the eve economy even more realistic current eve economy works backwards
just figured i would comment on a few thingsto combat the reduced mineral intake mining needs to be boosted in my opinion it should be boosted a week or two before the t1 loot is removed so there will become a glut of minerals right before the shortage hits so it wont be felt as much i would like to boost mining by adding in capital mining ships but thats a topic for another thread just assume for now that ccp can and does boost miningthe increased mineral demand is covered by there being more minerals because ccp needs to boost miningthe increased use of building slots is a problem but its not a huge one poss can have building slots added as can player owned stations in addition in highsec stations that are away from the major market hubs and off the major trade routes there are tons of free read no wait at all construction spots research spots could use an increase in my opinion but i dont think the increased use of building slots would be a problemas for missions being worth less well personally i think thats a good thing as they are currently drastically unbalanced as far as risk versus reward goes they have a large reward and very small risk taking a bit of profit out of them in the form of removing the t1 loot would help balance out the riskreward ratio
 this is basically my opinion to what taking this loot out of missions would do there is absolutely no reason for me to be able to run l4s all day long solo with no possibility of dieing and making nigh 1b i stress solo from making rigs buying what very little salvage i need to make them building industrial ships which are overpriced for some reason that i have yet to figure out look at the sigil for reference and basically paying for my own account with isk in a battlecruiserwith eves obsession with riskreward it fails super bad at missions just yesterday we needed a ton of low and null minerals to finish building our capital ship in 00 since there were pirates roaming the area at that time i personally ran some l4s with an industrial following me for loot and me dropping one launcher for a tractor beam to salvage1 daybefore that day we were about halfway done building it1 day1 personin a battlecruiser drake l4s according to ccp are built to be done by battleshipsreprocessed at the highest standings station i could find i think it was like 995 net reprocess wtf something doesnt make sense hereand right now the ship is under construction and we need nothing else to finish itimo all of you arguing how much it would break the game the game is already broken and it needs a drastic fix
move target painterstp from medium slots to high slotsreasonsusually medium slots are needed for tank and tackle gear  mwdab  else  there is little room for a target painter most rapiershuginns never fit tp because they dont have the free slots to do so even if their rolebonuses are for target painting to some extend and caldari missile boats have to reduce their tankmost ships that need tp usually have a free highslow this is true for caldari missile ships and even the huginnrapier can free up a high slot easier than a med one if the want to fit tptp effect is more like turret effectneutralizers than other ewar effect it follows that it should be high slot item like turretsneutralizers
supported of coursefeel free to add your opinion here
no i have weapons neuts and rr to fit in my highslots tps midslot position is fine because tank is overrated  its only useful while youre being shot at while gank is useful the entire fight
rapier has i think mainly been used for its webs which were considerably better preqr and the speed changes also perhaps because target painters did not have such a good role in a gang at that time with the changes to bombers a painter is more useful than before and the new gang dynamic of reconsbombersblack ops are still being explored i think over time we may see more tp instead of webs on black ops rapiers perhaps a mix of different fits in gangeven allowing for that i feel that changing tp to a high slot will unbalance things tracking disruptors damps jammers are all mid slot items and the same could be argued for those it would be a pretty significant boost to ewar ships since they meant to be squishy and trade off ewar effectiveness vs survivability
i support this idea
maky a version of target painter for highslot with slightly higher effishiensy
not supported for what your asking but i would say is offer a version of a target painter as a lowslotjust as turret ships have the ability to fit a tracking enhancer there should be a lowslot module that would increase the speed of the explosion velocity affects all missiles where exposion radius only affects guided missilesas far as the util highslot no tp is an ewar that all the gang can benefit from and is kept in the midslot on the basis that you cant have 1 ship that does it all you have to sacrafice something if you want to fit that painter granted it gimps some setups such as a tping torp raven you either have to sacrafice a part of your tank or propulsion mod or point
this topic is intriguing if you take a deeper thought aboutlets assume not only the target painter would have to be high power slot but all modules affecting another ship no matter if positive or negative effect would become high slot modulesmedium and low slot modules would just be used for effects that affect your own ship and dronesthen you have the choice to balance how your offensive capabilities work eg either by using lots of guns only usefull for yourself or by a combination of guns and effects that weaken your opponent usefull for your whole gangeven if this is not exactly what you asked support for ill support to see where the discussion will take us
its a neat idea in theory but forcing all offensive utilities into the highslot makes a lot of ships entirely useless due to other ship being a better choice for thisitd make all ships tanks and take really weird tactics with as to who is doing damage who is painting and who is tackling or using other ewarimo highs are your damage and primary function maybe they could add a special high powered ecm modules for ecm t2 ships but this is hypocritical for me to say and i dont fully support the idea mids are your utility and shield lows are your defensive and hulleffecting
no the tp is a utility at best a bloody good one at thatmoving it to high slots would disrupt a lot of ships that have issues with tracking but yield a ton of firepower like a maelstrom for exampleyou need to remember that not everyone fits ships like you dobad idea
a ccp is not skype  no stupid spy functions please b no it wont work mac spoofing is not very complicated whatever a nic level ban is i dont think such a thing exists for users behind the usual nat firewall
isk selling is getting rediculous we all know it having the client report the hardware id of your network adapter would instantly make being caught selling isk a very expensive mistake  to the point that it would be far cheaper to sell plexthough if the adapter is sold on there would need to be a way for legit players to appeal for an unbananother way to do it would be to hand out perminant gags to those caught  that would allow a legit player to play while the unbanungag request goes throughedit its not a spy function given current network architecture the hardware id of your adapter isnt avaliable beyond direct network connections on your lan so its impossible for anyone to link any particular id to you
ive seen at least three threads requesting different types of hotkey support for various aspects of the game it needs attention why dont we just have a macro system like every other mmo for exampleorbit t1 30klock fleetassistlaunch drone group1of course their would be limits on how they could be used ie macros cannot call macros im not really sure if there are any cases where you would want to string together multiple commands but it wouldnt be abusive anyways ive only been playing about a month though i probably have like 250 hours of game time in since then but this just seems obvious to me
i agree with the ability to have more hotkey functions to the game it would present an avenue for macro automation users to use to get more reliable input to the client but it wouldnt allow doing anything you cant do in the ui already macro will just emulate a mouse as they do now with or without a command macro system like this this would however be greatly usefull for the rest of us some possible uses for a macro command bound to a buttonset various shield passwordsselect warpable object under reticule and warp to at xxkmlaunch drone group named snipersselect ship under reticule lock and engage modulesselect nearest gatebridgeportal and jump
i agree with the op but also feel it could be overpoweredbutffxi solved this problem with a limited number of lines for macros and no looping etcvery limited macroing yet very powerfulthumpsup
obviously a feature like this would warrant a lot of testing to make sure its not overpowered but i like the idea of legitimate nonafk macros to simplify common tasks especially potentially timecritical ones that require multiple steps to do by hand this isnt supposed to be a twitch game but the interface forces it to be sometimes eg selecting locking a target and engaging modules or selecting an escape point and warping away
as long as theyre careful about it and dont let players do too crazy of things yes other games have managed that balancing act just fine and im sure ccp can too this and a moddable ui are things eve needs desperately  no game this complex can be played anywhere near well enough with the standard ui even if that standard ui was good which eves clearly isnt supported
sorry have to lol hereyou just contradicted yourselfno game this complex would work with a standard ui even if that ui was goodwhataminutecustom uis arent always better than developer uisif the standard ui was good as you say it would be fine this is why it needs custom uis or a good uieither works and your statement argues against both 3devilsadvocate
oh certainly a lot of bad custom uis get made theres no doubt about that thing is you dont have to use those  you find the one you want and ignore the hundred you dont and if one is just better its the one thatll pass by word of mouth and its the one that the most people will wind up using and the reason why even a good default ui isnt good enough is that not everyone wants the same thing theres room for improvements but even the best defaults wont satisfy everybody and so i want to see both improvements and room for customization
not supportedgive them an inch they will take a milethere is just too many ways this could go wrong very quicklyim not saying this is a bad idea its a rather good one im not saying its stupid im saying there are a lot of stupid things that could happen as a result of this proposal
no
threre are some stations with big undock ports make those and only those be dockable for capsmake caps bigger and some of the stations undock is small and cannot even fit bs so ships spawn in middle of nowhere the gallente highsec noob stations
agreed carriers need to be 34 times larger
seriously how hard is it to scale something based on the numbers they already have sure they say theyre working on scale for ambulation but from what ive seen that only means stations will be made larger and higher resthis scale issue isnt even held by only capitalsall ships have this problem if you look at the ships lengths
yes lets have cap ships really freaking huge 
i agree not just caps but stations aswell
youre forgetting that eve is a service provided by ccp for monitary gain we pay ccp a monthly subscription fee in one way or another for this service ccp are failing to apply qa adiquitely to their serviceas for ccp not being god thats true but they built eve they know exactly how it works and they hold total control over it thats as close to god as you can getunless ccp have taken a rush of new substandard code monkeys and havent noticed their entire qa department has been drunk for months on end there isnt much excuse for gamebreaking bugs like thisthey even have a test server at their disposal to test for bugs you have to admit it takes the fing cake and eats it too
hello zosterato be honest this isnt the first thread ive seen about this concept however the tos makes some of your ideas unfeasable this part isthe forums are in need of a redesign but it needs a total overhaul not a minor one from what i hear this is currently being worked on by ccp
the test server is one thing and running certain patches flawlessly on them is al lwell and good but then when you try to do the same thing on the live server that might be a little different two totally different systems even thought they run the same software you got to take into account that on the live server theres the issue of bandwidth and occupancy on that server im not saying that theres too many people on one server actually its kindof cool that there are so many on one server and it works im just saying that the issue of just because it works on the test server it should work livethat concept is bsits good that they work on things in the test server and i applaud them for it i agree that ccp has in the past come thru for all of us and when they do good no one stands up and sais good job bu ttheres always a bunch of us i included that will stand ther ein there face and  at themhowever ccp needs to be a bit more forthright with the issues ie hay gang theres a problem with the patch were working on it well give you more info this evening and give us an updateiknow for one if i took my car in for repairs and the mechanic put me off on an update i would pull my car out of that shop so fasti run my own business and i give my customers an update about every hour tha tim working for them they appricate that it shows them that you are working for themccpwe pay you you are working for usjust give us an update oh and by the wayccp you guys do a great job keeping evep and runningthank youxx
supporting more ccp feedback on issues suggestions requests for information  all on the forumsseeing a thread where 200 people ask or talk about something and then seeing the shiny hope in their eyes fade away when theres only one reply on page 3 of 22 hinting at userccp interaction is sadit will make people like you ccp plz get more manhours on this ps yes its difficult but then again you didnt make eve to have it simple 
give me a batphone
learn2softwaredev
yes eve is a service made for monetary value by ccpccp is also working their asses off day and night for you to play your little video game instead of working or going to school like you shouldanyone who knows a lick of anything about game development would understand that just because a bug is reported doesnt mean a fix is as easy as just fix it and in all honesty id rather them spend their time working on said fixes instead of listening and talking to your whiny arses all day longthey give plenty of correspondence stop whining or quit playing
the whole storyline part of the sleepers is that their civilization is long dead and most of the actual sleepers are just broken malfunctioning hulls only a few are still active and able to attack because they are basically sentry drones on steroids sleepers will never become proactive in such a way its fun to think about but will never happen
these sleepers should clear out the wormhole systems first starting with shotting down the stupid poses there although the idea is good but i think storywise the sleepers are the least good candidates for such an attack  pirate factionsdrones attackscampaigns would be a much better choice
maybe the sleepers themselves wake up or come out of hiding or whatever 3you forget that with a fiction universe with the right storytelling you can make anything work
horrible ideas imo both of them there is no need for a mass cloaking ship simply because if the ship emitting the field is visible but every ship around it isnt visible then wtf is the point plus the ships already under the cloaking effects still being able to fire incredibly overpowered periodand a ship meant to act purely as primary can someone say battleship tempest for examplehorrible ideas not presented in any kind of coherent manner not supported
been playing ra3 been playing as the american faction your ideas sound awefully like the allies stelth tanks and assault destroyers
honestly the only new thing id accept cloak wise is the ability to cloak a poswhich would be humorous at bestbut not thisnot supported
i support a revision for wardecs not necessarily this particular concept the revision should be made with the intention to make highsec politics more interesting and possibly giving some leniency to newer playersi think there should be a corp ranking somewhere based on performance in wars then again isnt this handled by killboardsi think there should be some corporatealliance ranking with concord which affects the price for wardeccing i think this should be negatively affected by repeatedly beating up on newbie corps andor negative average security ratings of pilots within the corp ie its cheaper to dec a corp whos naughty according to concord and more expensive to dec goody twoshoespossibly an implementation similar to bounty only on the corp level as wellthe idea is to make arbitrary griefing more difficult and merc bounty hunter activity more interestingnaturally the people who are looking for fights are going to hang out in lowsec and accrue negative sec making them easier to wardeci dont think there should be any absolute protection though if youre a new corp your best defence is to stay off of the radar besides its a learning experience when you get decced
phoenix i love the alpha capability even if it is nearly impossible to play out this card in a large battle revelation is just my second choice im long enough in the game to seen lots of things nerfedboosted even if my favorite toy is not the best one i can enjoy to play with it they will change it 10 times eitherthis two screws look better than onethe drawback is you get reduced dmg on structures like neuts it would make a lot of ppl unhappy so it would have to be an additional ammo type which is not a good idea too defenders of a pos dont need to carry both ammo types so the uphill fight gets worse for the attackerswhat about a script for the siege module to carry 1mUFFFD more does not hurt it has the nice itchiness to only be swappable when out of siege which would force us to think first and to plan which one to use in which phase in battleeven with both screws im not sure if that is enough how does the dmg on moving carriersdreadsrorquals looks like it would not be that good if they now get anihilated too easy whith an antisupercapweapon webbingpainting should still be worth the effort there did you have tried modified numbers in your tables i think we will have to use the third screw supercap signature sizesensor strength toothe use of scripts would also allow to balance the diffrent dread weapons give each weapon type its own script with specific attributesnb if we turn just one screw at once we end up with odd side effects like the last change to citadel speed take a look at this thread in game development
yes agreed i wrote it between   just to clarify the mean
i would more prefer the ability to setup watchlist tabsjust as you can broadcast multiple things you should be able to have a tab that only displays certain broadcastsand to help limit lag you should be able to turn off loading the fleet members shieldarmorhull status and just have their name listed in the watch list so you dont have to scroll through a laggy fleet menu to find a needle in the haystacki like some of the idea but i cant fully support it because of it auto adding something i would prefer to manage manually
one thing id like to see in wis besides all the stuff ccp mentioned already is better support for machinima making movies using video game engines walking in stations has a huge potential to make eve movies like clear skies and such a lot more immersive so i hope ccp can add in some proper camera support
so you only play half the gamethats too bad
it will add a considerable new demographic to the game one that quite honestly i dont think will appreciate the intricacies of eve my wifes best friend plays sims that is the closest game i can think of to what walking in stations will be like  and there is a lot one can do in such a game but it isnt nearly the same type of game that eve is very different demographics apply to the people that play each  spreadsheets online or hello kitty with purdy picturesas such my personal opinion is that ccp would be better off using the development that has gone into this so far and working it in such a way as to more compliment the player base that currently exists making it so that ships can land on planets or do various npc and produced goods trading etc with even more markets overall i think the concept needs to be worked on and once the concept is set then go for the objective of walking around to be able to meet the objective
i can see my character getting drunk in station as i get drunk in real life and gambaling my isk away in some crappy card game against a two day old noob
the isk  reward ratio is way out of whack but ccp recognizes the issue look at what they recently did with the rats  you now have rats that are in many ways equal to quite a few 00 locations is it ideal not even close but it is an improvement i think that soon you will see even more improvements and balancing to this sector of space being a former low sec inhabitant i recognize the benefits as well as the pitfalls of low sec and improving it is something that needs to happen
i was hoping for more substance on this issue from you care to elaborate on actual ideas simply saying you have lived there and ccp can handle things is not the greatest platform in my humble opinionediti had no idea we were back in cp
well part of it is that i dont see any way to effectively make low sec viable for mining on a large scale many of the belts havent been miend out in years and the amounts of minerals considering the value of trit and veldspare mining is well worth it to actually mine however the population is dense enough not dense stupid but dense as in a lot of folks that most low sec areas you cannot effectively secure from roaming folks so the cost of a hulk vs the return on time isnt percieved as worth it even if low sec areas developed clusters of gneiss crokite bistot or arc or even mex it still will probably not be worth itone of my ideas is to move moon mins off of moons and into probable sites similar to grav sites you can then take your tier 4 mining barge and go into the site and mine out some cadmium caesium or even dispro do this for all of eve also make it so that it is relatively easy to ninja mine in low sec 2030 min worth of mining and the site is played out empire you dont get any of these sites and in 00 you get them but they are larger  along the lines of 26 hours to effectively mine out this would keep the relative value of the space coherent allow for folks to do their thing while still working to encourage them to move out of empire space it also solves what i view as the largest problem in eve right now the static massive passive income sources that only a few have a possibility to havethis is just one of my ideas i have several i also know that ccp is working on the issues as they see and recognize them
im in favor of more regions it sure would set the population on its ear if there were more 00 regions that would kick off a frantic land grab id add four more two in the north and two in the south
a frantic land grab that would set the players on their ears obviously expansion of 00 space would see a frantic land grab by 00 players the majority of players inhabit the hisec regionstbh we dont need more space there are vast tracts of space underutilised as it is perhaps no minerals in high sec indicate that its time to go a little further afield to mine besides we just got an expansion of spacecheck out the wormhole near youxavier
crowded in some ways definitely the high sec ore belts are a good example the question is though is it that the distribution of players across high sec low sec and 00 the real issue there are a lot of places in eve that never see any playersi think ccp needs to see that for a lot of players the ability to log on and find the thing you like to do easily is getting hard for a sizable part of the player baseissler
more people  better eve experience generallythe issue isnt the number of people online except as far as the servers can handle but that is hardware that ccp can add to as needed the issue is population distribution a better balance of resources including the removal of the static resources now in the game promo  dispro moons in particular by changing them to be nonstatic along with a balancing of risk  reward in space should help to alleviate a large part of the congestion however the large part of the eve population that will not even consider low sec or 00 because of the potential harm they may get well there is only so much incentive you can give people it is an issue though that needs to be worked on and constantly addressed not just looked at once and called done
static resourcesin a realistic universe well a realistic virtual universe there are some incredibly rare elements and compounds it just happens that in eve they are the very rare moon minerals thats the sort of realism that i like as do many other playersthose resources can hardly be described as static in terms of the products they produce as alchemy can produce the products also it might not be the cheapest option but its probably cheaper than taking and then defending a dysprosium moon oh and itd also be a mistake to think that high prices for the rarer minerals is solely down to their scarcity alliances can hold back the minerals and drive prices upwardsthere are no doubt some vast stores about market traders can also do the samethe end result of course is slightly higher prices for modules and ships etc given that the game goes on pretty much as usual gives me the impressionthat its not such a big deal as some make it out to be
static resources in an mmo environment are one of the most unbalancing game mechanics around it is realistic no but neither are the mechanics in the game for flying around in space it is just that unlike how the ships fly around this mechanic isnt balances fair or fun for 9999999 of the player baseit allows passive huge amounts of wealth for only a select few you need the wealth to keep the wealth as you can only keep it if you have the resources to defend it and you can only get those resources by having it so ya it is a broken mechanic if the people that had it had to actually stay at it maintain it keep it up it might be different but that is not the case nice derail btw 
sorry i though you meant whole numbers rather than actual digits in this case i obviously dont get what youre trying to ask as it doesnt seem to make any sense
hi ozwill you continue to push for resolution for this issuesi interface improvementsthx
most definitely along with any other ways of simplifying what is an unnecessarily complex and time consuming ui
i have used the ball gag that you gave me years ago to force my minions to vote for you for the sake of a good laugh here is that image once again ofc them damm ebil mods love ya mitnal will purge it soon enough please visit your user settings to reenable images
sorry i will try to explain it better this is an attempt to make the eve market system more like a reallife exchange trading system where there are predefined minimum bid increments for example if you wish to buy a crude oil futures contract you will either have to outbid the existing buyers by at least 10 per contract or wait for all their buy orders to be filled before yours will be filledsince the eve market trades everything from minerals at 4 isk per unit to ships up to a billion isk or more the problem is how to implement such a minimum bid increment my proposal is probably the simplest implementation when entering the price for a buy or sell order you will be restricted to the number of significant digits you can enter you will still be free to add as many zeros as you wish or place the decimal point where you want except that you still cant have any increment smaller than 001 iskfor example valid prices for a raven would be 8565 million 8566 million 8567 million etc under a 4 significant digit restriction what happens when you enter an invalid price would be up to the developers but they could either round it or truncate it or reject it altogether i personally feel a 3 significant digit restriction would be feasible but probably hard to sell to most players so a 4 digit implementation seems like the most painless way to get this in place
i guess my answer to that is why would you want to limit the market i understand the frustration of 01isk undercutting but this type of limitation would imho do more harm than good the eve market isnt a trade exchange its like walking into a local market and haggling with the vendors one of eves best features is its open market  unless i can get some very very good arguments as to how such a system would improve the market i cant say i would vote for it let alone raise or champion it
as a matter of fact the eve market is a trade exchange and it isnt like your local market the market system is set up to automatically execute trades with the best matching order which is what makes it an exchange the contract system is more like the local market because you choose which seller you want to deal withalthough i freely admit that for most players not trading in hubs this is a nonissue when you buy a something you look at both the price and how far you have to go to pick it up when you sell stuff you either put it on the market where it is or go take it to fill a buy order somewhere it only matters when you have multiple buy or sell orders in the same station so my proposal will not help the casual trader but it wont hurt them either
my vote
ccp havent made it easy to find information about candidates or their platformsthe main page for voting only has a half complete set of links to homepages no links to forum threads and only a few of the homepages link to forum threads i had to come looking for this thread could forum thread links be added to the main voting page
you get my vote mazz
for those interested in heartstones views on faction warfare he recently post to our thread in the gunship forums 3rd csm election candidates for faction warfare
doubtful they will acknowledge this publicly but one assumes there will be many off the record discussions between erik and ankh if he is electedi find myself torn like most folks i am not getting a strong sense that fw will be a strong focus of eriks term and the only other candidate ive considered was heartstone but how can i vote for anyone who doesnt  you know  actually participate in fw at allin the end it doesnt look like much to choose from this time around goumindong why didnt you run again i like ankhs feistiness it was one of the reasons i ended up voting for her in the past i dont know why this girl doesnt pvp shes got the scrappy nature for it ankh did such a good job and was dogged in getting things accomplished through the csm never had much opinion of anyone else on these councils doing very much hard work tbh perhaps in the end that will be reason enough to vote for erik
this is one of the reasons for me and bms hostility also he comes and spams our militia chat with his alt urging people to vote that sort of gets under my skin ankh also only participated in fw to exploit bugs in the system why would it be so hard to program npcs to shoot all those not in friendly militia hell npc pirates happily throw their frigates against any sized shipswith erik coming from this same camp i cannot seriously consider voting him i think none of the csm candidates would move fw to direction id find good so i will cast the abstain votedamar rocarionbrigadier general
im more in favor of supporting and developing features that would be interesting to new players goals to work for for example rebuilding the pos system remarketing that as a selling point for eve build your own starbase in remote corners of space mine moons for precious construction materials defend your property from interlopers profitsomething to that effect additions that will draw attention to the game but not necessarily reducing the learning curve
how do you feel about limiting the price increment on market orders such as limiting all buy and sell orders to 3 or 4 significant digits this would force traders to offer a significantly better price instead of just beating the old price by 001 isk
youve got my vote its rare that i run across someone sharing my odd viewsbut you share many of them good luck garthran
if i understand your example correctly youre saying make it so minimum increments are 100 or 1000 isk instead of 001 if this is the case id have to say i disagree what would be the purpose from a roleplay standpoint what about all those items that arent worth 100 or 1000 isk per item like single units of tritanium what about ammunitionit just occurred to me that 3 or 4 significant digits in the current system might also be 1 or 10 isk but then the difference is not significant enough 10 isk changes would simply become the new 001 isk changesi dont think that we need to punish the traders by restricting their abilities to compete
andy3021 thanks for your support
no what i mean is that when you enter the price in a market buy or sell order only the first 3 or 4 digits of the number can be nonzero thus the valid prices of battleships under a 4 significant digit restriction could be 8561 million 8562 million 8563 million etc in other words you couldnt sell your raven for 8561999999 isk any price under 100 isk would not be effected by a 4 digit restriction because they already have only 4 significant digits or lessi hope this clarifies it for you
that does aid in clarifying for me thank you i understand much better what you mean nowit does sound like a great idea in theory but i just dont think its a process that would have place in eve i may be wrong this is just my opinion but im not sure that pricing restrictions of that kind have a place in the eve market the market will still deviate at the minimum level and to most of eve 10000 isk is no more significant than 001 isk when buying a battleship
if you went to an auction and bid 10 on an item and then somebody else bid 10 and then the auctioneer said sold to the last guy that bid 10 you would think something was wrong wouldnt you the two principles of any auction system are sold to the highest bidder and first come first served the point is that minimum bid increments are established to prevent someone from defeating the firstcome principle by making a bid that is not significantly higher than an existing bid whether or not we agree that 10000 or 100000 isk is significant when buying a battleship clearly 001 isk is not significantand make no mistake about it the market system is just a variant of an auction system where the buyers make their bids known publicly and the seller comes along later to sell to the highest bidderi realize this doesnt matter to most players it only matters when there are multiple buyers and sellers in the same station so it is pretty much limited to traders in market hubs and maybe a large number of those players like the 001 isk price wars because judging by their actions you could make that casebut i spend about 90 of my time in this stupid game dealing with the market and it just seems to me that it is so obviously broken i have no expectation that ccp is ever going to fix this and judging by icelanders knowledge of financial markets i truly have no hope but ive got two votes for csm and i would like to give them to someone with half a brain who can listen to and understand the issues that other players have to deal with so good luck to you
there is a minimum bid increment system already in place for auction contractswhat im basically reading is that you want people who are undercutting you on salesoutpricing you on buys to take more of a hit to their profits than they currently are while understandable i dont think that requires a game mechanic change i think if playing the market is what you really have a passion for there are workarounds i know traders who update their orders 15 20 times a day if you want to play the competitive game in market hubs thats the way you have to play it changing the amount of money you have to alter your orders by into a big round number isnt going to change that its just going to make people take more of a loss when they continue to play the 001 game as the 10000 game
15 to 20 times a day seems low to me and i dont want to play the market game i just want to sell my stuff so i can go back to playing the game of eve look i dont want to beat a dead horse but if ccp designed the market so that players would sit in station and play 001 isk wars all day that would be fine but if they intended the market to be a place where pilots could efficiently sell their stuff they screwed upif something is broken with the pewpew part of the game it will get fixed improved and tinkered with endlessly the devs dont really care that much about the boring parts of the game so i turned to you as a selflabeled carebear candidate to make my case
i spend much of my time running missions and wormholes and make most of my money reselling the loot that i gain from those activites i dont really have difficulty with doing that i find the market ui itself to be occasionally frustrating and if you can point out specific issues youre having id be happy to listen to your ideas for improving them however i think minimum price incrementing is going to anger many more people than its going to please

or better yet  who will champion my type of game playi like most average joes in the game would like to vote for someone to represent their needswants  but are too lazy to sift through all the fluff to find the right candidatei dont represent a large amount of ingame people but i can reach a large amount due to ingame networking i have done over the yearsif you fit the mold  i will spread the word my eve demographi am a 5 year veteran of the gamei have only 1 accounti am a pvper first 2 pvp toonsmy pvp centers around empire war decs my alt lives and pvps in 00 during roams i have one trade alt to support my pvp habiti am a casual playermy concerns i want addressedas posted in assembly hallissue looting from my kill should  looter flagged to meissue neutralalt remote repping  aggressionso  who wants my vote 
nt
issue two i support fully as neutral remote repping is a pain in the rear end and a blight on high seclow sec pvp in 00 ofc it doesnt matter as much away from stations issue one i am not so sure about i cant really see a problem with your proposal beyond why would you get the rights to the loot but on the other hand i cant see many drawbacks from changing it without actually spending any time looking at the subject in question in detail i would be loathe to support something that i havent had time to look at the implications of vote for me dont vote for me whichever you think but please vote for someone lets have a good turnout this time
i agree with your concern and would support a change to the current system along the ways you suggested players shouldnt continue to be able to hide behind being in an npc corp when theyre looting another players kill agreed in empire and lowsec an aggression tag needs to be tagged to those remote repping in 00 space i dont see it as being a huge issue since it is either an npc station or they are friendly to the entity that controls the outpost when it comes to stargates in 00 im pretty neutral on whether it should give aggression or not since you can just catch the guy on the other side i believe i have your interests at heart being that i am in a pvp alliance and i am familiar with piracy in empire as well i want to encourage more players to venture into lowsec territories via more incentives which will in turn give the pirates more targets to play with
id like to think id do a pretty good job of representing you i spent several months doing the empire wardec thing back in the day and am certainly interested in ideas on how to make the wardec system suck less  i dont have anything that can really be put onto paper unfortunately but if i see a workable idea ill certainly jump on it regarding your two ideas im sort of torn on the first  i think its a good idea but im not entirely sure maybe tying this into a wardec improvement would work letting you have rights to kills you made legally but not giving any rights to suicide gankers that said im totally in favour of the second if you want to be in the fight you should have to wait 30 seconds to dockjump just like everyone else if you think im your guy i would certainly appreciate your vote if you have any other questions check out my site or drop me a line ingame
i too want your precious votei wholeheartedly agreedont agree so much with this one if i read your suggestion correctly

thanks you very much for your oppinioni choose not to participate on the forums campain becouse as we all know and saw here there are a lot of flamers manny ppl dont even read a platform and they start to point the finger others dont care about any ones iddeas and they start to laughmake funinsultetcmy platform is pressented on my campain website wwweveronetcsmthanksiulian
i understand your approach and support it i agree with most of the items on your website and i like how you have presented it and i am supporting you for this csmand i urge other voters to visit the website and the blog i mentioned above to see what they are voting for good luck for you iluixxi and all the other candidates
to be honest i dont think retracted is the right word you asked for my stance on the subject and i gave it to you honestly i didnt pander to what i knew you wanted to hear i told you my opinionthis is indicative of who i am and how i will behave in the csm i will stand by issues i feel are important i will listen to arguments and consider all sides of a discussion and i will give my honest opinion i am not a tool to represent any specific power bloc or demographic and i am not out to disrupt the purpose of the csm by saying that one particular issue should be considered to be more important than all others
by the way thanks for this personal judgment i would invite you to ask me questions that are important to you or if you cannot think of pertinent questions i have not already answered to perhaps hold your tongueif you are so completely dissatisfied with the state of the csm let me join others in suggesting that you run for yourself
personally i would love to run for csm finally giving new players a voiceunfortunately well i consider it fortunate im enlisted in the us military and i doubt theyd look kindly on going awol to attend a video game conferenceanyways im a little confused by your wordsi have nothing to add to thisyour words speak volumes about your character and intent what that is exactly i am unsure
if youll read carefully i think youll find that none of those statements even taken out of context as you have presented them here are directly contradictory though you seem happy to imagine that they are however this is the last ill say on the matter since you seem immediately ready to criticize but less forthcoming with constructive suggestions this indicates to me that you will find fault regardless of my response and trying to convince you of anything else will be a waste of my timefly safe
i cant vote eitherthat is i click the button but nothing happensi want to vote1 million isk for the first person who gives me the right way to voteabulurd bonifaceme meceo
being a rather new player i found this a rather simple process1eliminate those that didnt have a link from the eve csm page and you can easily take out half the candidates2eliminate candidates didnt have a page dedicated to what their positions were that would be those with social networking sites as their page etc i dont want to wade through all that crap just to figure out what you have to say3eliminate the candidates with annoying webpages sorry erik going to your website only to have my ears assaulted by an obnoxious video didnt win me over4eliminate those who claim they dont have any specific things they want to see fixed seriously if you dont have a position on something hell anything what is supposed to make me think you would be able to get anything done5eliminate any idiot who mentions the words transparency and accountabilitythat pretty much narrows down the list quite sufficiently knock off the rest that personal preference gets rid of and it makes the process pretty simplei personally was interested in a candidate that had more of the industry side as their focus which very few even mentionedso how did you all do it
following this criteria none of the csm candidates qualify and as you will see for a third time voter turnout will be at an all time low what was the voter turnout percentage last election eight percent how much of that eight percent was voter abstainingwell im hoping ccp will get the hint that the csm elections are fundamentally a popularity contest the prize being a free trip to iceland and a gold csm logo attached to their forum namei have high hopes for the csm process but i also have high expectations expectations that the csm candidates have for the third time fallen short
you want to know how i picked well i wanted to vote for a goon so i looked at the various goons and picked the one with the best website and policies that were similar to my interests small gang warfare in particular for my alt i think i might pick the mm candidatepopularity contest seems about right however i would vote for the people who are more knowledgeable about the game not forum hos and douche bags
while i have not been as active ont he forums as i should be i dont know what else i can add that my other fellow candidates have already said but i will add my 2 cents1 new toyswhile t2 salvage is currently only obtained from destroying t2 ships it is sound to say that would probably never change salvage can only be created from destroying a ship and i dont forsee howwhy ccp would want to change that the t2 rig market is already highly priced due to low supply and high demand2 cheaper toys as was introduced to combat the moon mining monopoly alchemy which was already been mentioned was put in place to be an alternative to the hard to find moon minerals aside from ccp reseeding newer moons with more high end minerals there isnt much more that can be done with reseeding there would be morewars ad fightingover them which would in turn drive up ship prices3 crowded mission hubswhile this is a pain one possible solution is to move some more agents to lower sec space and maybe increase the reqard to balance the risk of being in low sec i for one would like to see something more along this line even though i am mostly a carebear with my current activiites in evei hope some of my answers help in your descision

the last version of this idea was terrible but at least this one has good points id support the vengeance getting the resists bonus from amarr frigate and it getting a second rocket damagerof bonus from af skill
actually the veng already gets the resists bonus giving it that and the rocket damage bonus would bring it to 5
supported in principle the precise details as ever will get argued and debated hotly and then ccp will do something weird anyway some great points raised by wang jing and foolish bob it at least highlights that some afs are in need of work others need to be delayed until rockets get fixed others still are well just great already and thus need kid gloves

i dont pay for play or post with my accounts to make sure that youre having fun frankly im pretty sure you must have fallen and broken your head since youre actually whining about people wanting to make it so they get the most fun out of the game they play and pay for
funny you should say this considering that when a carebear plays to play his style of game hes accused of being selfishgreedyidioticinsert privateer rant here but when its you well thats just acceptable now isnt it youre just hypocrites and im calling you out for what you are while having some fun at it dont get mad at me for telling you the truth quite frankly this thread needs moar teers they fuel my ship dont hate the player hate the game bro
when did i complain about other people wanting to maximize their own fun broken head there you go again lumping everyone into a single ready made mould thats poor arguement technique broken head
playing the mature card now are we ok lets see how long it lasts before your alliance degenerates it into a smack u n00b u quit1 and explain to me why the current mechanic is broken if you agressed or attack someone why would that automatically make you the owner of their possesion just because you attack someone and managed to kill them doesnt mean you somehow legally own their stuff eve isnt a prizefighting game like counterstrike eve is more real in the sense that you can agress and you can steal from someone else loot isnt handed down to you because you dueled an opponent and won the tournamentthe possessions still belong to the victim until you steal them but you have to steal it first its more realistic and its what makes eve so special and different from other mmos its a cruel world even for the cruelest of the cruelest
i also would like to add that eve is a vicious cycle where the predators also become prey and its more fun that way you could be the baddest killhog out there but then a lowdown dirty scoundrel comes along and dogs you just like you dogged your prey its what eve is all about sure youll get mad when you get dogged its natural and the scoundrel will laugh at you just as you laughed at your prey and in the end no one likes to be dogged but its what eve is all about when you blob some poor guy at a gate or station what do you tell him you should have friends to help you right well should it not work for you as well you should have friends there with you ready to steal the victims loot not everyone in your gank squad need to put out dps you could have someone be the dedicated looter in eve you need to think of all sides of the angle and be prepared to be attacked in your weakest sideand its not like the loot stealer is getting away scott free he is being flagged to the victim who now can kill him exactly how it should be i know it pses you off but hey what can i tell ya you like to laugh and poke fun of the carebear you just ganked i like to laugh and poke fun of you by stealing what you thought was your loot  this my friend is what eve is all about
no the prize is up for grabs to anyone who can grab it nobody is saying that this shouldnt be the case and if anyone does than theyre ed what people are saying here is that theyd like some way to legally per concord attempt to discourage the vulture from the picking scraps is it reasonable that being a pvp loot thief has absolutely 0 risk and great rewardsthats a very valid point until you see that now i have to bring an extra guy along with my gang putting another ship at risk for the vague possibility of him being able to serve his purpose in the gang or sacrifice an existing part of my gangs dpsewarlogistic etc in order to have him play space vaccuum again putting someone in harms way for the vague possibility of having him serve his purpose do you really expect that to become a valid profession in eve do you really believe that this is a fair balance of risk and reward for the hunters or the huntedediti would agree with you on this except that you can not truthfully say that it is balanced game play you need to be put at risk if youre going to pull from the wrecks of others in the scenario were discussing and no being flagged to the victim doesnt always matter besides the guy just lost his shiploot stealing is really funny i agree with you its just broken
what you say here doesnt make much sense you admit that the loot should be up for grabs but then you add that youd like to discourage other players from picking it you cant have it both ways because youre not the owner of the loot until you steal it but you must steal it first now if what youd like is for any loot stealer including the aggressor to be blinky to everyone else including bistanders this makes a little more sense and then the aggressor is opening up himself to becoming a target himself for stealing loot which is a whole separate offense and rightfully so this i could agree withyou invalidate your point as soon as you lock yourself with the mentality that everyone in your gang needs to physically engage in dpsewaretc youre opening yourself up to loot thieves when you pick up the loot that makes you a loot thief and you dont blink to anyone else but the owner of the wreck so why would a bistander blink red to you if you havent picked up the loot yourself like i said i think its better if any loot thief picks up the loot he can be aggressed by anyonebut there is risk to the loot stealer he is being flagged to the rightful owner and his corp members if the victim chooses to do so he and his corp members can hunt down the loot thief and engage him now id be willing to bet the victim would probably welcome loot stealers to steal his loot just to not give you the pleasure of taking it but thats a whole different story now p and it is a valid mechanic just because you dont like it doesnt mean it isnt fairyou have to look at combat and stealing as two separate actions you can pvp someone either through a war or whatever and then you can also choose to steal their wreck a totally separate action which will cause you to agress the true owner of the wreck
 matrix skyesimple risk vs reward  as it stands the looter has no risk in looting the ship and reaps all rewards  what exactly is so hard for you to understand or are you bumping my topic with your flawed arguments out of the kindness of your
there is risk to the looterwhats so hard for you to understand about thisthe looter is being flagged to the owner of the wreck as it should be it pes you off that someone else is beating you to stealing the loot and therefore being flagged to the owner but that is not a reason to ask ccp to change the mechanics in your favor the system is fair as it is now
lets see  if you consider a pod a risk  you should be playing hello kitty online  pleanty of time to loot and be on your merry way because the original owner still has to get to a station  dock up  wait to jump in a ship  undock and get back to the wreckhmmmmm  sounds like a huge risk to the looter 
dont be idiotic mr jackhammer if the victim happens to have a replacement ship in the system or friends nearby as you yourself admit he should have then he is a threatnow if the victim chooses not to persue that is a call for him to make not younow if your argument is that the victim doesnt have friendscorp or doesnt have pvp ships and that the thief is just taking advantage of the situation the fact that the victim is carelessweaknonpvper please explain to me how you yourself arent taking advantage of that very same situation by attacking the victim
u madanswer the questionnow if your argument is that the victim doesnt have friendscorp or doesnt have pvp ships and that the thief is just taking advantage of the situation the fact that the victim is carelessweaknonpvper please explain to me how you yourself arent taking advantage of that very same situation by attacking the victim
we all agree with the point youre making already weve been agreeing with it the problem is that youre not arguing the point you think you are by posting this what the supporters of this proposal are saying is that we want to have a stronger ability to balance the scales between risk and reward for people who act as vultures i want you to still be able to loot my wreck from my kill i think that its a fine profession in fact if people want to do that i just want to be able to point some revenge at you if you do this isnt game breaking there is precedence for this in the games history that wasnt game breaking this is a fair requestthanks for the chat on this thanks for the trolling and its privaqueers not privatears
you are going round and round in circles ill point out your flaw once againprivatears attack a target you gank it and then some fair enoughtarget could have had friends corpies bigger ship etc in the end its the victims fault for not defending back with me so far its no excuse that he was alone or that hes just a miner in your opinion the risk although practically nonexistent is there agree that is the privatears defense so you should agree with this so farnow a vulture comes along and also takes advantage of the victims inability to come back and protect its loot and your take on it is that there is no risk there is the same exact risk that your gank squad took no more no lessits just you want to be able to attack the vulture because you feel the defenseless target that you yourself attacked isnt able to defend itself if thats the case then might as well make it so that even if youre at war if you attack anyone in high sec at war or not you become flashy to everyone meaning global timer for you but of course you wouldnt agree with this because what you really want is just what benefits you and you alone
and that my friend shows the huge flaw in your argumentyoure centering this issue about who proposed the change and not the mechanic that is being talked about  your no support is duly still noted  please leave the thread

supported in principle but eve is a long term game and a pos can be a major investment for some groupsdefining a pos as abandoned should be something like 36 months of continued offline status eves been running for five years and shows no signs of stopping after allthe only problem with introducing this sort of hacking is that the moment everyone knows its on the drawing board every offline pos will be explored out and there will be a feeding frenzy how would you limit this to a more sensible offlinescavenging period that doesnt plunge the pos market into freefall or at least knock it about  skill requirements perhaps and thus delay the offlining to a period of months instead of the first week the patch goes live

i agree with the op in principle the covetors only real purpose right now is as a seed ship to build hulksor for mining in areas that may be dangerous because you can adequately insure itaside from that its a useless bit of kit  forget three days it only took me 19 or 20 hours to go from can fly covetor to can fly hulkwhy would i buy a covetor to use it for 19 hours 12  16 of which i will be sleeping or at work
i was also surprised buy the gap it should be adjusted
this is certainly true of my toon and likely that of anyone with a real interest in mining some combat pilots might stop at covetor since they dont want to spend the isk on the next skill book but the benefits of a hulk over a covetor are well worth the money and require only about an extra daymax

one big flaw thereyou forgot to mention that drones can shoot up to 50km easily and do their full damage at whatever range drones have great tracking heavies do not miss cruisers whereas neutron blaster cannons attempting to shoot an orbiting cruiser are a jokedont compare stats mindlessly

the reason i see that it has not been implemented yet is due to a balancing issue only droneboats would carry these things and not all factions have thosebut i dont see too much harm coming out of this really
they need there storage capacity to be more then doubled battery consumes more powergreed and cpu then a capacitor recharger and yet is 2 times less effective medium and small capacitor batteries are at least moderately useful in small number of setup large capacitor battery when installed on myrmidon battlecruiser gives the same effect as a t2 capacitor rehcarger on dominix battleship as its capacitor is twice the sise on myrmidon the battery is twice less effective then cap recharger on tier 2 and 3 battleships it gets worse there isnt a single worthfull battleship setup that uses batteries that needs to be fixed they consume allot of ships resources and are nearly useless the batteries should be useful together with capacitor rechargers to increase capacitors recharge rate as both increasing capacitor capacity and increasing its recharge rate increate overall power output as you stack batteries they will become less useful but would be used coupled with capacitor recharges to give capacitor recharge rate slightly above that achievable with capacitor recharges only but at expense of grate cpu and powergreed consumption at the moment that works only with cruisers 750 of capacitor capacity t2 battery is only a 125 capacitor increase for dominix thats a tier one battleship making a t2 battery less useful then a t1 capacitor recharger with recharger consuming no powergreed and tiny amount of cputhe situation gets worse as we move on to hyperion tier 3 battleships have 50 larger capacitor capacity roughly then tier 1 battleships making capacitor batteries 33 less useful which puts them below 10 mark personally to me this system does not make sense and i believe it should be fixed
so batteries sucktry not using them
yes they dont make sense for battleships or battle cruisers i agree on some extra cap in those large batteries
batteries should give much more capacitor capacity but at the same time reduce recharge the reason for that is that the batteries should serve as stability buffer during capacitor warfare if your setup is not stable without the battery it should not become stable with it but it should hold out longer and withstand capwarfare better a recharge reduction would suffice which more or less cancels out the recharge bonus due to the increase total capacity
this would actually make some sense ive seen a few hac setups that us large batteries just for pure duration but they should be way more usable than that
oversized batteries in logistics ships are relatively common ever tried to run a couple medium remote hull repairers on a cruiser sized hull omgwtfbbqpwn capacitor batmanbut you are right putting a large battery on a battleship or battlecruiser is almost useless how about an xl battery instead but dont change the current mechanic of how a battery works please a whole bunch of support cruiser stuff will stop working if this happens and we likes us our remote hull repairers yes we do
xlarge sounds good to me we got xlarge shield boosters why not batteriesthat is not correct they do not reduce recharge rate the increase capacity yes it is much on crosuers on bttleships it is below 12 which is nothingthey add durability and increase cap recharge rate and current mecanic is fine and makes perfect sence how let me explainyou have 4000 capacitor recharging in 100 seconds numbers are just to illustrate that gives you recharge rate of 40 gj per second now you add in battery with capachity of 2000 you capacitor becomes 6000 but still rehcarges in 100 seconds so not you get 60gj per second so it works both ways
jin is merely suggesting that cap batteries should not actually give you more capsec as per the current mechanicbut should instead nerf your recharge rate so you are charging just as fast as you used to in relative gjsec but you just have more cap to work with which i suppose would work in certain pvp situations mind you a cap booster is much more likely to be much more useful in such situations in the first placeso supported but please dont nerf the recharge rate with it
1st we are not talking only from pvp perspective2nd why should the cap be nerfed
now thats an idea that can be supported
which gives better income for macrominers which in my opinion is not in any way the purpose of ccpin case the belts get buffed then yes youre rite but then again its good for the macrominers again hisec belts are usually wiped clean even nowadays so if no boost to them then it results in serious shortage in minerals 00 mining is not for the market since lowend minerals are sold in such a quantity that it is not really worth hauling them to empirei would love to see statistics about this because without numbers its hard to tell whether youre right or wrong imo the later i know its just a weird guess but i think all ferrogel reaching the market due to the pos exploit covers only a few days of hisec trit market real life analogy a few stolen thus relatively cheap rollsroyces wouldnt ruin the market of volkswagen for example yes for the few pos exploit users it gave relatively insane riches but in the whole market it was not that insane was just 1 or less relative to whole market potential just another weird guessif you all look at the statistics in post 11 ofcourse i dont know whether they are right pyer mexa and iso market would definately collapse while trit and mega would suffer a longterm inflation imo hyper oneif anyone has gm or dev maybe exact numbers against or along my weird guesses i think theyd be highly welcome
you wanna mine it i dont mining UFFFD besides youre forgetting about all those poor inventors that need those t1s to get better chances of success the problem right now isnt that t1 is priced too low but that minerals are priced too high to make t1 production possibleincreasing the price of t1 will also raise the price of t2 as you need those to make the t2 which is the last thing we need right now
the biggest problem with t1 production is the price of trit imo but todays situation is quite close to a perfectly free and competitive market balancing itself except the small shortage in trit

the numbers lavista gave are a 1 day snapshot of refining activityit come from here so it is official it is debatable as in the loot voice is included the modules used for mineral compression and the ships brought from market under mineral price notice that in the loot part there is morphite something that is in not present in t1 modules but it has a value even if a lot of information are missing mineral compression modules ship reprocessing number of players involved ecc i suppose that the people saying 00 is full of ore will be the first in the line for mining veldspar in 00 right
no this is the part where you have to make decisions about the equipment you bring to the fight
of course it would be very important to heavily restrict what can and cant be done but you must understand that we are talking about a few commands add a few restrictions and there isnt really any room for abuse simply convenience macros cannot call macrosmacros cannot waitdelaymacros are very limited in scope  lengthmacros cannot target based on name alone ie no lock veldspar activate hi13can anyone even think of something that would be abusive given those rules and a reasonable set of commandswhat i really want for eve is for gameplay to feel smoother and i think this would be a good step in that direction

as someone with some insight into the development and maintainance of software i agree that the nature and complexity of bugs such as the ones specifically being discussed in the op are not easily gauged from the outside and thus an immediate fix being forthcoming expediently in every case is too much to hope for however another thing entirely is how these bugs made it through testing i believe part of the reason such severe bugs have made it to tranquility lately is due to the accelerated schedule ccp announced at last fanfest  going from two exansions to three per year less time developing  less time testing most of us will probably agree that more content is not worth the game breaking every few months but to be fair to ccp these are realities in software development and not introducing more content is comparable to suicide for mmos personally i agree that the current state of eve is not good enough but i hope that this is indeed just growing pains from ccp adapting to a new work schedule i also agree the communication about these issues should be a little better however i believe ccp is already pretty good at communicating with the playerbase and that we should be thankful for that a lot of developers would much rather release a statement than send an actual employee into the raging waters of the forums
i cannot support what all the people said in that topic its a bit to over the top at times but i do agree that a bit more communication about this is needed its a game breaking bug and the reply of we cant reproduce it whas just stupidthis still gets a thumbs up becuase communication towards the player on a bug of this size is lacking
quality control
communication is important to the game
it is often said that eve is a game still in beta that can be seen as a bad thing or an exciting opportunitywithout good ccp player communication it is bad because the joint development isnt effectiveif however the communication is good and this proposal is an attempt to suggest ways to do that then the beta aspect becomes an exciting opportunity for all concerned how many other mmos offer players a chance to take part in the growth of their hobby offer a chance to get their idea into game how many games development teams have thousands of contributorsa little bit of work on this and eve can only become better
 you hurt my feelingscan we haz fix nao or is the backend of eve so spaghettified that the devs cant make heads or tails of it if the spaghettification is indeed strong with eve it would explain a lot
that does not mean you can pull ccp around by their collective reproductive organs they know there is a problem they just figured out whatheheck happened they are fixing itwhining is not gonna make it happen fastercomplaining that we pay their salery so wahhhhh is gonna make them knock off for the day to go raise a few at thepub
nice idea i wsupprto it
ok i dont want to rewrite the whole thing but this idea started heretell me again whynow obviously this will take away from the lowsec crowd so expect plenty of whinesbut i feel it balances out the game a bit more tell me what you think
why bother with requiring a bounty at all why not declare all players with a negative security status as fair game anywhere in empire space there is little point on requiring people to place a 1 isk bounty just so that they can create more high sec targets
i think it would be better if ccp made 2 new ships in every t1 ship class that way there is more veriation of slot layouts and setupsnot so much the layout but new ships that the average pilot can afford and fly
i thought the first one sounded more like an arbiter out of starcraft but then ive never played ra3 that said no theres a good reason cloaking doesnt work that way and making people shoot at a ship that they dont even have targeted is a good way to  them off not make fleet battles more interesting add that into the fact that you imply fleetmates would be able to rr while cloakedin triage no less because they dont have to defend themselves from a fleets firepower and you have yourself something that looks a lot like an invincible death blob which im not so much a fan of the second sounds rather similar in effect rr is too powerful and too omnipresent to remove an attacking fleets options on where to point its dps
the arbiter from starcraft jumped to my mind for the first one tooboth of these ideas rely on the idea that a ship can survive being primaried in a fleet battle no matter how high your resistances no matter how good your tank if you are flying a noncapital ship in a fleet battle and are primaried you are going to lose your ship very very quickly the proposed ships value stems from their persistent presence on the battlefield  which is unrealistic because in both cases they will be the enemys very first primary target
actually its very difficult i welcome you to try it and to get anything other than random kills the amount of effort it takes to get even a single nonrandom kill in highsec warfare is substantially more than the amount of effort it takes to avoid being killed 90 of the difficulty of the kill occurs before the warp disruptor ever gets activated
you said it well and i couldnt agree more sandbox open game sandbox open rules dont like them negotiate with the opposing side most are reasonable if theyre not reasonable get mercenaries etc the system works as it is the way some of these guys go on its as if actually interacting with other people in an mmo is such a tragic experience
what youre calling for here would unnecessarily damage mercenary alliances such as atomic battle penguins repo etc it would be abused by those who can abuse it and would only complicate what is currently a simple and fair system that encourages ineve diplomacy and politics which is in my opinion a good thingwho are you to decide that arbitrary griefing is wrong decreasing the ability of people to arbitrarily grief also decreases their freedom to act as they feel is suitable in a given situation it inhibits the use of diplomacy and politics and would take this game another step closer to being spacewow for instance if a person is salvaging your mission and you dont like that you can wardec his corp and teach them a lesson or even hire mercenaries to do it for you they can wardec back etc etc the freedom to wardec who you choose encourages a genuine use of politics in eve which is dynamic and unlike any other mmo out there
make it so the mothership itself has to target the enemy to use the bombers and it would be balancedi love the idea though
good basic idea but bad proposalno support in this way
i appreciate the thought and time that went into your responsethat said theres a problem with missions which are not static being run in lowsec as you already pointed out this is due to the population density and roving gangs i do not see how making moon mats exploration sites and thus vulnerable to the same roving gangs is an improvement in fact i think you could argue that without moons and pos there would be virtually no point to lowsec at alli believe a better approach would be to put more power in the hands of players to defend their own space in this case theres too much freedom for roving gangs to cause trouble just for the sake of pvp and not enough opportunity for antipies to retalliate my vote will go towards whoever supports a player based antipirate feature possibly being able to form gangs which do not receive any sec hit versus lowsec offenders this might require a history to be kept of players sec status the more often youve dropped below a certain level say 50 the more of a target youre made to these concord sanctioned fleets to get in these gangs would require positive security above a certain level say 30 and can be renounced if that level drops a certain amount within some time frame

the vast majority of things that are covered by the nda is just the initial responses ccp gives to issues raised by ccp  and for the most part these are summarized in public minutes a week latermy role and that of the other take care advisors is to provide as much data and different views as we can for erik to base his issue on which erik can then use to write up his issue documents and use as material and arguments for discussion with the rest of the csm and with ccplike factional warfare if there is some concern from the fw players that hasnt been raised before then people such as olsummer bedlinnen and other fw people will likely pick it up quite fast poke erik and brief him what the problem is exactly the entire thing behind take care is that while the csm youre going to vote for doesnt know everything you do have a voice after you vote and can get the csm to work for you the thing i can guarantee about erik is that he will put effort into getting your fw issues through unlike the csm in the current council that vote down fw issues such as fw lag as unimportantsame thing with me and 00 while ive been in syndicate delve pure blind and providence ive not been in any alliance that holds sov needless to say the sov mechanics and 00 warfare do have a number of issues thus i went out to ask as many 00 players of their views and used my knowledge as game designer to analyze the problems and come up with potential solutions thats why ive had several people mailing and convoing me saying hey eva this is what you need to know about the supercap issue the take care system works as these people came to me with their issues and concerns rather than having the 00 people on the csm deal with the 00 issues exclusively the csm should be there for all players and most importantly provide an opportunity for all players to get directly involved in the csm and thats precisely the aim of take carelast and these will be my only words about this topic the claims by bad messenger and damar that im using exploits in factional warfare are blatant lies and stem from envy for my successes while in the gallente militia as well as a desire to oppose any improvements to fw because they are the top dogs in the current ruleset and see any change as a threat to their position ive never abused the cloaking exploit in fact ive sent numerous emails about it to ccp and basically told them in the csmccp meeting that its nothing less than a disgrace to ccps reputation that such an exploit is still not fixed the standings are working as intended i find it odd that damar accuses me of exploiting while he is bragging in the militia chat how he continously ganks mission runners in dodixie while circumventing the navy spawns through some loophole he and his corp are infamous for abusing im not going to reply to further accusations and will report any followup on this to moderators as offtopic as such a discussion doesnt belong in eriks campaign thread warfare  tactics that way ankhesentapemkahdivine commodore of the 24th imperial crusadeluminaire general of the federal defence unionmajor of the state protectorate
vote for vukgood ideas
hey you definatly have my vote i agree with having more npcs around if anything just for a bit of easy pew pew however i have just gotten into industry i have been producing rigs and have just organised and run my first mining op in my corp with the intention of production so i have a limited view however from that limited view i think i would agree with claire that is if what i am reading is correctin reality an object of significant worth in an auction does go up with large bids we are supposed to be in space selling battleships to people who want to go out and destroy other battleships if in realitly a person went into a auction to buy a battleship just hear me out lol and placed a bit of 001isk they would just laugh at them and ask them not to interupt in a serious business transactionthis is our chosen profession and it is an important one i expect this profession to be takes as seriously as 00 fights because it is the foundation to everything elsi would apreciate if you do get in to take a serious look at this and concider if what i understood to be the argument having a buying and selling system that would mimic realityso as one of your voters even if you dont address the above good luck cuz u seem like a good representative for me in there 
okay heres a deal for you guys create an ideas thread advertise it drum up some support for it this really is an interesting idea and i see what youre hoping to accomplish with it im just not sure about actual implementationwhen i get elected show me the thread with your full idea and other people voicing support for it and ill try to push it at the first possible csm meeting deal i cant promise implementation but if you can show me that its important ill do what i can to put it on the board 
this a very good application and campaign because the text is clearly formatted and not too long and i understand all the points you listed while i am having problems to identify a clear goal in some other campaignsi dont like the antropomorphic asteroid screaming thing though id rather propose some sound of earthquakes coming from the asteroids every now and then or a crashing sound when large pieces of a rock are mined awayi also dont like all other points personally because they seem to be potential evil means against my general habit to fly with expensive stuff on autopilot through empire while i am afksmoking on the window i probably cannot elect you because this habit is one of my main sources of fun in evewhat do you think about some kind of cloaked doomsday or mega smartbomb weapon on small pos towers in empire to add an unknown risk to wardeccers who dont want a fight but instead only steal the pos modules while the owner corp is offline for a few days or weeks due to a withdrawal treatment against nicotine and alcohol for instance lets say the cloaked doomsdaymega smarty is activated as a big surprise as soon as the tower goes into reinforced and blows away everything in a range of 2000 km or so except the pos itself of course the doomsdaymega smart has also a builtin pos shield recharge capability to make sure that the next attack will go the same way imagine for better understanding the pos belongs to a pirate corp and the wardeccers are greedy mission runners with high concord rating if you could support this and bring it to ccp for a quick implementation i might rethink my election decision
hi pitboss larkonis trassler international man of mystery and ex privateer pre nerf herei share your paini for one look back with a hint of bitterness at my time spent in privateers for the two reasons you have pointed outi believe yes the spoils of your kill should be yours currently there is no way for the victor to correctly defend his spoils in an empire battle from scavengers and thievesneutral remote repping is a pain in the arse i would wholeheartedly welcome a change of the mechanics if people wish to engage in battle then it should be flying their own colours hiding behind the white flags and yellow and brown breeches of a neutral or npc corporation should no longer guarentee safety

let me just make this very clear in advance im not a candidate but i have been a member of the first 2 csmsthe issue you think is important was indeed raised the csm widely agreed that it was a good issue and made a lot of sensewe brought it to ccp in iceland however we were met with some devs fundamentally disagreeing on the idea and some who liked it however ccp promised to take up the discussion internally and figure out if its possible from a technical point of viewit turns out that changing it to having a such effect is not easy at all and will take some serious work in the aggro systemso while its a nice idea im sad to tell you that its not really likely to happen at all

i wont ask for your vote as i have a pvp alt but i am not running primarly on pvp issues myself but i do have an opinion on your issuesi think the game mechanic is a little kilter and fell out of the options you posted i like the second one best flagging you to last blow and original piloti think you have valid idea to address the game mechanicissue 2 neutralalt remote repairing  aggressioni believe once a fight starts as soon as somebody helps another in that fight they become part of the following actions weather its shield repairing or drones repairing armor that it should be considered to be part of the action as it does effec the overall fight so they need to be flaged as well as their role is part of the final outcome i have also seen this with the repair ship running in and scooping the loot form the fight too

as lavista vista has said ccp see it as suboptimal after talking with him and finding out what exactly it means they also think its lacking and can do better so its in motion and we should see a new graphic eventually thanks for the support and keep supporting this so ccp know they need to release something official about it p
thats gotta be one of the most ridiculous arguments ive ever heardeither you didnt read the op correctly or youre stupidwoo dealing with a logistics ship fine no one has a problem with logistics shipsop has a problem with people repping other people with no consequencesay i wardec you you attack our fleet and an alt corps fleet with nothing but logistics ships come inthey can actively repair my fleet with no consequences and you can do nothing about it unless you want to wardec the alt corp which isnt a solution to a mistake in the games current mechanics
ok  let me break it downi war dec a corporation  one of its pilots decides to flaunt a ship i can easily kill infront of mei start shooting the ship  all of a sudden his alt who is hugging a station or a warp gate starts remote repping himhis alt is now aggressed to me  leaving me the option to shoot the original target or shoot the remote repperso if i shoot the remote repper  he is allowed to dock up or jump through the gate anytime he feels comfortable  he doesnt have to wait the normal 1 minute deaggro to do so in which i could probably kill him during that deaggro time and punish him for sticking his nose in our warif i ignore the repper  im fighting a losing battle against a ship i can normally takeso what im asking for  is the normal deaggro 1 minute timer on the remote repper just like everyone else gets
theres something hilarious about privateer alliance of all people complaining about the use of npc corp altshowever its a valid issue so thumbs up
supported  it definitely needs fixing
supported
no im pointing out the flaw as to why your reasoning is wrong you claim the risk practically is nonexistant because the victim now has to dock and get another ship or call corpmates to defend his loot but that is how eve works theoretically when you gank a miner in an asteroid field he could bring corpmates to defend him against your gank squad theoretically he can fit his barge with guns to fight you theoretically he can come back in a pvp ship to fight you again but practically that rarely happens but the risk is still there isnt it so now you come along and ask ccp to change a mechanic based on practical risk when your entire defense against you ganking noobs is that there is a theoretical riskwhen it suits you you use theoretical risk to defend your position and when it suits you youll use practical risk or the real risk when it suits you this my friend is double standardmr pitboss you may be the boss of pits i guess but youre not the boss of me you posted a thread in a public forum where its open for debate even for those that disagree with your views mr pitboss youll have to learn to accept that if you want to post your ideas here you have a wonderful nitesincerelymatrix skye 3 3 3

salvaging the offline tower as a new item would mean that new towers still need to be purchased while providing a source of income from the old tower as an incentive to go find and remove them
the requirements for the covertor indeed needs to be looked at by ccp to fix the gap between retriever and the nextinline shipgood that someone spots exactly what needs to be done without suggesting some major unbalanced change to be madethis is just logical and nothing elseset the mining barge lvl requirement down to iv and a lot of people will rejoice
as a young character miner plodding through the training to finally get 3 strip miners and a worthwhile cargo hold i agreethe only reason to get a covertor now is if you cant afford a hulkand the ore bonus for mining barge iv has made the retrievers inadequate cargohold issues even worseif i could have that 3rd strip miner on the covetor for a month while training for the hulk id be able to afford it as soon as the training is complete
covetor barge 4 prereq supported
as i understand it the level 5s in the covetor requirements are because it was once the ultimate mining ship before exhumers arrived and then became much cheaperas someone who can fly a covetor supporting lowering mining barge or indeed astrogeology requirements to 4
there need to be maintained a certain balance lowering the astrogeology skill as well would be to much you would then skip the retriever for the favoring of covertor by just lowering the mining barge skill requirement to iv you maintain a balance and you even the curve in the different ship upgrades in a miners career
thats why i said or astrogeology not botha miner would still use the retriever for a month or so while waiting for the level 4 skill to reach 5
judging on what implants and the learning skills astrogeology takes about 2 weeks or more the change would be to low in my opinionmining barge from 45 takes abit over 3 weeks thus changing that requirement down to 4 would create a sufficient gap between the covetor and the hulk wich should provide a proper buffer between them and not bring any further unbalance issues in the mining barge fleetits what atleast i think is the most logical solution 
bumpsdoes no one agreei find this surprising oo
i wonder why there havent been any missions with whs of a limited nature 
im of the opinion that space is entirely to crapped up with gas already the normal system skyboxes are entirely too bright for my taste space should be much more empty than it is here in new eden
agree on this however having something interesting to look at in missions would not be bad
my supposition from a purely laywomans astronomical point of view is that new eden isnt a galaxy in the way we think of the milky way honestly it looks more like a globular cluster with most of the stars fairly close together in which case space would actually be considerably brighter than were used to seeing it simply because theres more light per unit volumeof course given that its so bright i do wonder why a lot of the ships have headlights
the sbs role was never to be a solo ship in any way shape or formccp made this very clear when explaining how they were going to fix it before the fixbad at it i disagree ive killed plenty a frigate destroyer and cruiser with the old sb rolebut in argument i think it needed a role change sb shouldnt be a solo ship everbut its new role it fails at worse than its old role
the new changes are pretty good imo ok so they make it hard to be a omfgwtfsolopwnmobile but get a friend in an arazu to point  sensor damp it possibly another in a rapier to web it and unleash your torpedoes being a sb pilot whose done this a few times since the patch will validate the vast levels of fun this is 
we were promised an overhaul to many things market with storefronts mining the list goes onthe industry expansion was dropped in favour of fw medals certificates etc the only remnant to make it in was the orca and then later a prettier look for roidscould the industrialists of eve get some information on whenif our promised expansion is going to roll around or are we the makers of all things that pew and dont pew going to be ignored in favour of more pewat the time i believe it was stated that storefronts were withdrawn for a better system in development and then they dropped off the radar entirely i also believe it has been stated that the expansion schedule was full till 2012sooooowhatever happened to the industrial expansion
might as well support my own proposal before it disappears from sight
i also support this as i feel this side of eve is slightly underdeveloped compared to combat

dude what were you on when you wrote thisif the answer is nothing then please revise the question to what should you have been on when you wrote this
basically he want it to work like an armour plate you get to run your mods for a bit longer since the battery provide you with a cap buffer but once that buffer is used up its useless until it has been rechargedrepped so using your previous example if you have a ship with 4000 cap and 100 second recharge time giving you 40 caps and add a cap battery that gives 2000 more cap then your cap recharge time should go up to 150 seconds so that you still get 40 capsecond but you now have 2000 extra cap buffer to run guns reppers and whatever before capping outi think it makes sense but very hard to implement and not worth the effort in the example above you could easily calculate that the stats for the battery would have to be 2000 cap and 50 recharge timebut then you fit the same battery on your other bs where you have 6000 cap to start with and 120 second recharge time standard aka 50 caps which the battery change to 8000 cap in 180 seconds or 44444 capsecond then you fit it on your bc with 2000 cap and 100 second recharge aka 20 capsecond which get changed to 4000 cap in 150 seconds aka 2667 caps even if that could be worked around it would make it harder to get them better balanced since you get more factors to calculate with
i agree with what your saying here but think you would need to increase the fitting requirements on them as wella large t2 battery that currently gives 700 base cap i think should be increased up to 20003000 cap though its fitting requirements should be harsh enough to make it almost impossible to fit to a cruiser but still possible just seriously limits what else you could fit ie not worth fitting on a cruiser it would also be able to fit on bc and be a little less harsh but still not the best option in most casesthe medium battery would also get a buff from say the base 420 to 13001600 cap but agene having hard enough fittings that putting one on a frigs just would not be possible as is the case now then doing the same for the small and micro batterysthis would make them more useful then rechargers but at the cost of using a lot of your fitting gridcpu the use of rechargers would be used on setups that are tight for fitting
yeah you are right so so far we have 2 options1st as described above2nd is to simply introduce xlarge batteries that have fitting requrments and capacity so that it makes sence for battlehips steave435 i see what you mean and that would be interesting but would requre change of the entire system not everyone might whant that and its increadebly complicated imagine what will hapen if you add in capacitor flux coil one more batteries cap power relays and mwd and then try to keep cap recharge the same that would be extremly complicated
xlarge batteries are a lot more desireable than the ops ideasupport for that
exactly thats my point it would be too complicated so trying to give the batteries that buffer only functionality isnt viable unless ccp can come up with a smart idea for once
sounds like you want a reversed cap flux coil boost capacity and nerf recharge
please allow us to repackage items in any corp hanger office space pos arrays even ship based arrays for consistency it makes no sense that you can build packaged items at a pos you can assemble them you just cant disassemble them wspace has made this a much more pressing matter than before
i know nothing about the issue but i see no obvious reasons for which this could be a bad idea so supported
you already can in offices but yeah this is kind of silly in pos arrays this would also solve the problem being complained about a while back that it was a real pain to build a jf in a pos because it was nearimpossible to get the packaged freighter in the array i dont see anything this would break so sure
didnt know about thissupported
sounds fine to mesupportisaac
i see no reason this shouldnt be in the game as it doesnt offer any real advantage other than general logistical benefits repackaging ships for jfs stacking items in a corp hangar array etc supported
i have noticed in wars if a player accidentally fires on an alliance mate for example had him locked for repairs then didnt check target before firing guns then they get a global criminal counter and either concorded in high sec or hit by gate guns in low sec players should be authorized to engage alliance members freely as if they were corp members this becomes an issue in other situations as well such as alliance mates wanting to test their ships against each other would get criminal counter for shooting but cant exchange cans as cans are flagged at alliance level or if an alliance wants to hold a tournament in high sec on the main server

people can already do all those functions if they download an unauthorized macro program ccp should legitimize all macroing and make limitations to macro behavior inherent in game mechanics rather then in eula rules especially as there is no system to detect and ban macros efficiently implemented in the game softwarefor example implement some way for people to sell items on the market at a range of prices rather then giving market macroers the upper hand or allow macro mining so cheaters dont get an unfair advantage but if a player steals your stuff due to your inattentiveness well thats eve for youtheres a lot of far reaching consequences and the idea will need a lot more thought and rebalancing but i think its got a lot of potential for being really cool and useful and making eve more fun and reduce the headaches
i think your proposal goes a bit too far  things like adjusting orders and mining without the player having to think are the sort of things macros specifically should not be able to do a macro should look something like ctrlclick macro button and now im targeting him and orbit 500ing him with all my modules set on instantaneous the result of a players action and a simplification of a complex repetitious set of actions the player would otherwise have to take introducing legal macro mining is exactly the sort of thing i dont want to see
having been watching the reverse progress of darkfail i have to conclude that letting people add to or alter the client in any way is just not a good ideawhy not learn to work with what you have like everyone else in eve does or you could apply to ccp as a ui designernot supportededit spelling and grammar
not supportedin certain other mmos especially a certain popular one macros and ui addons have almost become a requirement to remain competitive in the game though eve onlines ui is pretty horrible all players are on the same relative playing field
if you bugger up your own client youre the only one who has to live with it isnt that the whole eve philosophy  accepting the consequences of your own actions i know dealing with whatever fail the devs throw at us is also the eve players philosophy but in that case its more a matter of it being inevitable than of it being good as for the or apply for a job bit reminds me of a forum exchange one of my corpies had with a devdev if you think you can do better we have a job openingcorpie

yes make it public to all and backdate it to include all the old kms tooyay for accurate historical records 
this would be great
ok guys ccp just announced they fix it happy now only took a few days and theyve now locked down the problem its over we can get on with eve with less complaining good griefisaac
ccp isnt going to allow game breaking bugs to last for very long even if they dont project an outward appearance of getting it done all right now as for the forums i think making devs read them is really too much to ask but the csm and community managers are supposed to be the ones who do that work so i think the biggest wants from the players are going to get heard either way
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
part of the problem is that the forums currently offer no way of knowing that a dev has read a thread until they post in it perhaps the reads column could be split into two with a new column for dev readsas has been said already however if you want ccp to post more then we as players first need to post betterben

like other players who can do that anywaylets turn wormholes into yet another npcing activity like missions the spawns will not be there for the benefit of gaining goods that is a bonus it is more for creating a more lively universe where people see real consequence of living in a harsh place sleeper drones then best form of defence is attack 
get around the bounty payout exploit and you got yourself an idea
for once i will agree with drake in that the current system is too broken atm to implement such an ideaalso i can see this idea as being abused by high sec war decing corps as a means to kill anyone with a slightly bad sec status
this is an iteresting thread
i envision walking in stations to turn into something like habbo hotel at bestisnt this stuff really just testing for their next mmo anywaysanyways i support any game mechanic that allows greifing in stations beating people up in stations blocking people in stations etc etc we should be allowed to carry weapons in stations and perhaps turn it into a first person shooter in stations that would be awesomein stations
i see what you did there you made some letters all red
hello i think the crowded systems like jita should be expanded there could be a specially designed station which is about 3 times the size of a normal one with more than one entranceexit ramp just to spread it out a bit and then maybe a special permanent cyno jump out of juts to take some of the pressure off the stargatejust some thoughts
you need large amounts of wealth to keep the wealth true since dysprosium moons are well sought after and need to be constantly defended against attack given that this conflict requires ships modules and the like due to large losses incurred in such conflict many players benefit as a result due to sales this conflict also benefits market traders limiting resources entering markets due to disrupted supply etcfor the more lazy player i could see your point regarding static minerals not wanting to work towards goals such as earning isk to buy the better t2 ships theyd like cheap materials and modules so that they could quickly reach a higher level some players myself included like working towards goals we also like the fact of a realistic economy that drives markets etc look what happened when price caps on trit were removeda doubling in pricewe dont hear complaints about this from manyis this due to trit being a common mineral and hence the complaints about rarer minerals really boils down to a degree of envy because they are inaccessiblexavier
why do we have so much space that is underutilized could it be because the moon resources in eve are gasp static that there is littletono reason to bother with that spacehow much more active would 00 be if the resources were not static if they had to be constantly sought after the higher end moons could shift around over the course of months this would encourage infiltrating your neighbors and exploration
actually venture into low sec and youll see vast tracts of this space underutilisedstatic resources refers to amount available ingame to be mined etc you arent proposing anything else but changing the location of these resources or are you proposing to change the volume and location as i pointed out the product made from these resources are available via alchemyhow does changing the location of the resources make them more fought after im intrigued to know your thinking here how do you propose to overcome the numerous issues that constantly changing locations will throw upwith the advent of t3 and the accessibility of the materials to any player so long as you can find a wh will go some way to overcoming any percieved shortage of rare mineralsxavier
why do i get the feeling youre responding just to get your name out and not to let people know your ideas whetever ill biterare moon material location mostly but volume to a smaller extenti have not participated in alchemy from what ive heard its not worth the time and next to useless do you actually defend alchemy just being able to do something doesnt make it worthwhilesupposedly there are changes to sov and pos in the works so this might all not matter but how does removing static resources not increase conflict especially if the time scale for them moving isnt in days but maybe weeks or several months the end issue is that your defensesnetwork guarding that rare moon will only last so long before that space isnt as valuable anymore and you will be encouraged to move as it is now you set up shop hunker down and collect profits for years or until someone steals your alliancei dont propose to know every detail simply that the options for new players are extremely limited when it comes to 00 you either join a large established alliance or you fight over the scraps those large alliances dont care about nonstatic resources will encourage more movement and unknown promote exploration and open up a lot of opportunities for all of eves player base not just someone who locked down a moon years agothis is also an extention of more riskreward scenarios there is always a greater risk in moving around and that should be rewarded rewarding people for growing stagnant without change is well not the eve i want to play
why do i get the feeling youre responding just to get your name out and not to let people know your ideas whetever ill biteim happy to let players know my ideas im a little fixated on the rare moon minerals since i trade them in volumei have not participated in alchemy from what ive heard its not worth the time and next to useless do you actually defend alchemy just being able to do something doesnt make it worthwhilealchemy offers another route to producing products required for the construction of modulesships it is labor intensive requires a high degree of organisation pos refuellingsilos etc it is worthwhile if you depend on large volumes of products which are continually either inflating in price or just hard to get more on this lower its far cheaper than defending a dysprosium moon however and the quantity you produce depends solely on the scale of the operation clearly players carrying out such operations will have checked their figures carefullybut knowing many highend ship manufacturers supply is the single biggest limiting factor theyll pay a little more for a constant and dependable supply hence alchemy allows access to products which otherwise are limited by the supply of the rarer moon mineralsvolumes of both the rare minerals themselves and the products are controlled by two main interests the alliancescorps with access to the moons themselves and the market traders supply lines are often disrupted due to wars etc indeed supply to empire is also dependant on the alliancecorp demand for the minerals as they also build shipsmodules etc we can safely say that the excess makes it to empire volumes cant be all that bad given that ships and modules are still being built and meeting demand prices on the otherhand have increased pretty dramatically in the past 6 monthsthis is due to market trading you and i know that the supplydemand balance determines prices traders with vast capital can buy up stocks on markets then relist it at a higher price the ceiling price for any specific itemmineral is easily determined what i found was that much of the rare minerals and products from these were vastly undervalued now prices reflect the rarity and susceptibility of supply for many of these rarer minerals what this boils down for consumers of endproducts requiring rare mins and their products is slightly higher prices however prices are significantly cheaper than preinvention remember when cruise missle launcher iis were 12 mil a pop what we see today is not actually as bad as its made out to besupposedly there are changes to sov and pos in the works so this might all not matter but how does removing static resources not increase conflict especially if the time scale for them moving isnt in days but maybe weeks or several months the end issue is that your defensesnetwork guarding that rare moon will only last so long before that space isnt as valuable anymore and you will be encouraged to move as it is now you set up shop hunker down and collect profits for years or until someone steals your allianceadding this layer of complexity to the current situation isnt imo going to solve the problems of conflict and unoccupied space jump bridges effectively allow 00 dwellers to bypass large tracts of space having to search through this space constantly for minerals moving setups and the like would just be a timesinksov limitations for competitors and jump bridges would mean that most space still not utilised conflict already occurs between the large alliances for the moons and space maybe the problem isnt where the minerals are but how other mechanics allow those areas to be effectively inaccessible
promote exploration and open up a lot of opportunities for all of eves player base not just someone who locked down a moon years agowh space is an attempt to do just this i believe given that t3 is dependant on wh stuff maybe we can read into the implementation that ccp are moving away from a dependance on static resource feeds a similar thing occurred with t2 bpo with the implementation of invention alchemy is also an attempt to do this im sure ccp is monitoring the effects within game of these changes and will make adjustments if required im also sure that the csm will be feeding back at the request of the playerbase should things start to be limiting
not having used alchemy does not mean i am ignorant to how it works simply put the amount of time it takes to manage alchemy processes is another advantage holders of the static resources receive far cheaper than holding a dysprosium moon i seriously doubt this while costs potentially can be huge when under siege i think it is much more likely that profit is made in 00 more often than lostim just going to quote this here so using jump bridges to skip over large amounts of space is a way of utilizing that space making them stop through there and look around is a time sink and is not utilizing that spaceive intentionally avoided t3 discussions as that is a new market and has yet to establish itself wh space does not provide sovereignty see space empires or markets see requires travel out of wh space and as such i do not think plays into the crowded or not discussion the number of players who live there permanently is very very few
sorry if i wasnt clear i think jump bridges allowing players to bypass large tracts of space is not ideal and holding off seiges is expensive in terms of ship losses etc they might generate good income most of the time but i bet some of the time it costs dearlyas you say rewards should increase with risks however given that there are serious problems with other mechanics such as sov im not sure that moving resources about is going to solve the problemswh space is exactly an answer to limited resources etcit allows any player to jump in and participate im not suggesting you have to live there permanently although there is nothing stopping corps doing so since exits into the rest of the universe are there also

edith bunker nice pic i think that it would be awesome if gunner characters didnt have to hop corps just to protect different poses id like to see it go though but i see a couple of problems getting in the way of it making its way into the game first ccp stated they want to completely overhaul poses and if they plan on overhauling pos gunning too they will be reluctant to make a relatively minor fix in the meantime second there may be technical limitations preventing that from being implemented in the first place would the pos guns consider the different corporations character roles is there some sort of other technical limitation anyways if i get sent to iceland that will be one of the questions i ask ccp ive gathered a sort of informal list of pos interface complaints already

given that most of the candidates have just one thread for their election campaign why do you feel the need for morethis area would get pretty congested should all candidates start multiple threadsxavier
just taking a quick look not to name any names or anything i see two more candidates who have multiple threads open one on this page and one on the next did you miss these or were you trying to target issler here oh and i think i can explain the other thread is a party thread which is inviting other players to help shape a political party with some core ideas summary here  issler for csmthere  carebear party candidate not necessarilly issler for csmgo issler

so the previous csms have brought up balance issues regularly i dont think you can expect to change the way ccp goes about it as a csm ccp is very interested in keeping elements of the game balanced youd be surprised to see the depth of analysis and calculation that perform on even the simplest changesis it perfect and are they always right no is the way to make it better get elected to the csm with that single purpose of nagging them about very focused places that might be out of balance not so sure that is the best thing for a csm to be laser focused onanyways good luck in the election and thanks for participating in the csm process with a goal in mind that is more that a perceived free trip to icelandissler

tell me what would you do to make ccp increase quality of the eve code basewould you ask that they hire real testerswould you ask that they start a name and shame policy for devs who code the large eve breaking bugswould you ask that they give the qa people more authoritywhat is your platform what are you passionate about besides your personal alliancecorp an helping themin short why the heck should i vote for you to be csm
2 insanity points there for you how many does that bring you to
apparently one of them is going to propose changing the color of the multifrequency crystal to fuschia
looks up fuschia eww i wouldnt vote for them
now theres a change i support xd
you jest but this is exactly what i see wrong with csm and ccp as it is nobody who is csm has the balls to ask ccp to do the right thing and i do not see ccp as taking csm seriously so we waste time on colors for lasers verses fixing game breaking bugs or trying to fix the development process so how they happened in the first place does not happen againas for the insanity comment even if your not a dev alt looking to make people with the guts to speak out look bad you still sound like a guy who doesnt understand software development at all either way your comment does not make any sense as its already clear that i may be the only sane one here
your suspicion that i am a dev alt trying to make you look bad for having the internets ecourage to suggest totally counterproductive things does not speak well for your aforementioned sanity
the things you ask for are not game design decisions but company policy decisions on which the csm has zero say influence or right to query
you say this like the op might take the time to research what the csm actually does and does not do before sharing his paranoid misinformed thoughts with us 
you may think so but really they are very related if you worked as a developertesteretc in game development you would know thatthe problem is people in gsm make the same ignorant assumption you just did so in the end they waste time that could be used making eve a better quality game that could make ccp more profits because its player base is happier and more willing to get their friends involved
and yet you still have not added anything useful to the conversation and have wasted our time trying to tear the discussion down without the use of logic or hard data
fair enoughnot what the csm does not even closei find your obvious implication that the current testers are not real testers to be counterproductive and misinformed and probably related to a personal bad experience of yours with a bug in game ive worked in the industry and the reality is that no amount of game testing is going to catch every bug every timethats not what the csm does and even if it did and a policy like this was enacted what do you think would be the positive effect we would get out of this so you could personally vent your frustration at someone in specific versus ccp as a wholenot what the csm does not even closei didnt bother spelling it all out in my first posts as its pretty obvious to those of us readers that have any idea whats going on 
why would you vote for me  is it even possible
first of all my initial list was just the standard wild stuff to get peoples minds going i know the csm cant walk on into ccps main office and start giving orders it would be sweet but yeah i know its not possible and i sort of expected people to have the intelligence to understand thatsince that does not seem to be the case let me explain furtheri also have extensive experience in the industry working for companies you can buy shares in if you are into the stock market not dinky little private companieswith that in mind i do not see a really big qa presence in the game i see a little black box testing for happy path but no white box daily continual build integration bvt regression etc testing thus in my mind with my years of experience they do not do real testing as defined by the software development life cycle standards traditionally in fan fests past only devs where spoken of and qa never really existed i suspect it was because they simply did not exist until i started complaining about it publicly on the forum and have yet to have this disprovedcsm works with ccp to make the game better and allow the customers to give ccp input to do so this is exactly what csm does and should be doing but as stated earlier many of them do not understand the devqapm roles and how they work together in software development so they do not even tryas i said above i expected people to have some intelligence in regards to my most brash statements clearly your need to further explain your point of view and take them seriously either proved i made a mistake in this regard simply did not communicate my intentions clearly enough or simply over estimated the intelligence of the people who would reply either way a mistake i will do my best to learn from
heres 1 reason people might vote for a csm candidate in the hope that the plane taking them to icyland crashed in the north atlantic
i think that the crystals should be made to actually reflect their positions on the spectrum instead of their names cause yellow to red to orange to deep red makes no sense sif i had my way wed get rid of standard and make multi the new standard having the name multi and being white still but with stats of current standardhave infrared be yellow microwave orange and radio deep redultra violet is green x ray is blue and gamma is purple with a new ultra gamma to replace the current multi and this one will be some ultradarkpurplevioletalso maybe shifting the colors down and adding a super radio tooso make infrared start at yellow still radio be red and super radio deep reda true spectrumtho cause ultra violet wil be green and other stuff this will also cause confusion to no enddamn it all
the csm is a complete and utter pile of whitewash foisted off on the players by ccp to lead them to believe we the players actually have some input into the game ccp has a long history of totally ignoring anything the players state such as the players doing bug testing etc on sisi who report bugs to ccp which promptly get ignore or report that planned game mechanic changes actually break or destroy entire ship classes etc those who believe the csm actually do anything other than waste the air that they breath i have a bridge to sell you on mars its in perfect condition can be used to support several hundred vehicles and can be repackaged into a pocket sized square for easy transport only 1 billion iskies just send your isk to this character and i will see to it that your bridges location exact spatial and chronological coordinates gets sent to you via evemailsb
moderatedapplebabe i just love it when ccp gets in my way i was trying to discuss this among a larger audiencei tend to agree but that is only because people accept that and dont try to change it using the system in placeccp actually seems to give the csm a lot of power problem is it does not seem to get used

dear mr skye it seems that your whole argument revolves around your hatred towards privateers thats sad btw this issues doesnt only effect us fw for example could greatly benefit from these changes
youre spinning the issue again and you keep avoiding the question you claim there is no risk to a loot stealer so then allow me to ask you againwhat is the risk to a gang that catches a miner or missioner whether it be a wartarget or out in lo sec in an asteroid field or deadspaceand compare your answer to this quesitonwhat is the risk to a loot stealer that steals loot from a wreck that doesnt belong to himif you answer these questions sincerely and honestly youll notice that either for both you point out practical risk or for both you point out theoretical risk
break it down more  because youre assuming were in a gang  1v1you attack a target youre at war with  youve spent your time tracking them down  you attack them  youre running the risk of losing your ship  many a times ive attacked a target 1v1 and got in over my head and lost my shipin empire  all 3 of us in a field  victim is in a pod victor is in a shiploot thief is a shipwhat exactly is the loot thiefs risk  ah yeah now i see it  he risks having his feelings hurt because i dont thank him for taking my reward for my hard work
probing a target down does not put you in practical risk and you know it  thats virtually nonexistent risk the only risk is you losing your time now im not saying youre wrong but what im saying is if youre going to claim practical nonexistent risk is risk then stop saying that loot thieves have no risk because they do even assuming that you jump on a miner or missionrunner 1v1 you will have the upper hand if you dont then youre doing it wrong  mission ship or mining ship rarely has scramblerdisruptor so if youre losing ships to them many times then wow youre either full of lose or sh choose one and here you just make it very clear that you have a problem with nonpractical risk with loot thieves but you dont have a problem with the nonpractical virtually nonexistent risk in you attacking a miner or mission runner this is very hypocritical of you mind you eve is a game where even if the risk is nonpractical it still is valid no matter how improbable it is for example gate camps youre familiar with these as you run them occasionally  sure there is the risk that a war target will call for reinforcements and they will make it on time to save him from the impending doom of your gate camp but practically that rarely happens yet the risk is still therejust because the victim chooses not to come back to defend his wreck not yours doesnt mean the risk isnt there and you definitely cant get mad because the loot stealer got to the loot before you did you can fix this problem easily as said before get a dedicated looter problem solved if youre too lazy or too unmotivated to loot or assign a looter then you dont deserve that loot anyway very simple
a thread about salvaging is never complete without matrix skye white knighting for the missionrunners of new eden and misrepresenting the facts
there isnt enough risk for loot thieves for all other actions in game that a player takes that involves another player there is a fairly balanced risk that itll blow up in their face loot thief empties the wreck and then can instantly dock or warp away without anyone doing anything unless the original owner returns in time to reclaim the materials we both know how likely this is there are options for dealing with peoples actions in everything else in eve why not this i want my spoils of war and i want the bastard that stole from me to be flagged so i at least have the legal option to hand him his ass for mucking about with my fun this is not too much to askthe only people that act as dedicated looters in pvp are the vultures that stumble upon an opportunity to take the spoils from someone else no pvp gang worth a  is ever going to assign a dedicated looter putting all the loot in one place to be destroyed ed expecting anyone to accept that job when there are actually fun things they could be doing really edand what about jita or similar high traffic systems you think a dedicated looter is going to win more times than not against all the neutrals that swarm anything that moves waiting for a wreck you idea is a good one and good strategy but you cant honestly believe that this is an emergent profession in eves pvp gangs if you tell me it is youre blowing smoke up my ass one person in a gang may be chosen to pick loot but thats for after the pew pew is finished nobody but the criminally insane will choose such a narrow game play role that basically excludes them from anything fun join me again to chase our own tails
this
confirming that i agre with the op
i give my support to the ops suggestion this is one of the most logical and realistic fixes ive seen on the forums
this is all moot ya know it isnt going to change anything well just overcompensate by bringing more and more to achieve the same results and sentiment of zero risk exposure we all seekbefore going into changing features on the ship or the weapon start thinking of ways to stop us from overcompensating purposefullyone titan is a glass cannon two is a tactic two with a backup is sound tactics but the minimum of a dozen here and there we bring on now is strategy deliberate strategy by players that is just silly we can change to a focus on racial ew heat damage whatever when push comes to shove we will do what we always do bring more to overcompensate to negate any room for flexibility until we make titans something of a knife that cuts both ways on the infrastructure they serve nothing will make us players behave any differently

yeah qr was a definitely disappointing expansion for the industrialmining community and im still looking for the hailed expansion to arrive i can say that ccp is looking at mining and may have a new system similar to how they have the new system for scanning and will soon have the new system for 00 sovereignty in the works to arrive soontmmining needs a serious overhaul but other aspects of the game need it too im hoping for a true industrialist patch eventually
patience apparently is not among people here you realize that this will be an expansion fairly soon just wait ccp has it in the queue isaac
information would be nice but the winter expansion is going to be the industry work or so ccp has said
id really like to know where you got your information as i spoke with the devs and was informed that the winter expansion will be regarding 00 sovereignty and might include related information the closest i heard to industry is that there were some mining upgrades that didnt make it into apocrypha and those would probably be in a later patch
quantum rise was supposed to be an industrial expansionas far as i understand ccp needed to allocate more resources to fighting the lag so quantum rise became the big lagkiller expansioni still want a grandindustry expansion but hey

yes that is more or less what i meantcap rechargers are mostly used to make a setup more or less capstablecap boosters are mostly used to slotefficiently run stuff that is not needed all the time for short durationscap batteries are mostly not used unless they accidentally happen to do exactly what cap rechargers are used for in single freak setupsinstead cap batteries should neither make things much more capstable nor should they run things in short regular bursts instead they should keep stuff running in one long burst a cap booster can be used over and over again until it runs out of charges a cap battery cannot be run over and over once it is empty it is empty until the capacitor recharges through other meanswith the discussed modification capacitor capacity up recharge down they would allow two things that are currently not quite possible1 make a ship very resistant to capacity warfare through combination of battery and recharger2 allow a ship to run a very strong burst capacitor through combination of battery and booster with a lot of surplus safetythis would be useful both for pvp and for pve less for pve but still useful if you know what you are doing
i dont like the idea of having useless modules but making things like cap fluxes and large cap batteries usable might need a lot more research and number crumching with more useful cap mods available people will be able to fit more powerful longer lasting tanks then they could before etc etc it would have wide reaching consequences
large cap batteries allready got horrible fitting requirements never mind what you would get with xlarge batteries
we could just increase powergreed but i agree that is a problem i have a feeling the entire battery system needs some reviewi peronally think the curent system should be kept but there fitting reqirments and capasity adjusted
support the idea

supported it seems like an obvious enhancement plus i would greatly appreciate anything that makes it less of a twitchfest
so long as its handled with a fine attention to detail im in favor of this just dont make it too easy and have limited steps able to be macroed such as how coh does macros and it should be fine they could even make them buttons to put in the unavailableunused parts of the module overview
i dont know anything about darkfall so please enlighten me what is wrong with ui modification how did they do it differently then world of warcraft all the wow people i know of like their iu mods so some for eve would be pretty cool to havethe pvp macro i agree with but macro mining is probably the only thing that will make mining popular and level the playing field between the people who use the only easy way to cheat at eve and the noncheating players they talk about revamping mining and aside from turning it into some minigame to keep people busy macroing is the easiest solution there are still consequences to macro mining macro miners get their ore stolen and get their ships killed in highsec and lowsec respectivelya quick google search can get you set up with all the tools you need to macro already pretty easily with low risk and high reward but all those options are out of the reach of someone who wants to play the game within the rules maybe if you want to prevent some really annoying consequences of macros do not include pixel detection as a function but other then that i think ccp should open the interface up more to the playerbase ccp mentioned that the client is simply a dumb terminal so hacking it really does nothing except allow you to macroalso it would save ccp and the players a lot of headaches if ccp just released tools for players to use to make their own interface mods all the complaints about the corporate interface market interface etc etc would be pretty much solved overnight without additional effort by ccp of course there will be consequences to this but i think its worth working through them because id like to be able to customize my ui more then just being able to turn it hot pink
so how would this have any influence at all instead of calling another macro they just copy the contents of the other macro
let me clarify by mentioning something i forgot tomacros cannot use conditional logic it cannot do anything but execute commands sequentiallyabout addons in wow addons made the game better they let players fill in gaps the programmers neglected to and in that way accelerated game development they were mandatory but towards the end addons really improved only how information was presented to you  and i dont think anyone can deny that players should be able to control that to whatever degree they wishfurthermore i wasnt talking about addons if ccp wanted to make an api and add some addon support thats a separate issue all i want is the ability to not have to right click select orbit scroll to 30k click again thats ed this is a game thats considered hardcore and i find myself clicking all over the screen in the midst of combat that is fail you should never have to click except when you are selecting targets
a macro by definition is an addon unless its not originally apart of the games uino on said eve was gong to be easy stop being lazy

dude thats already ingame ccp has better communication with players than any other companythey monitor forumsmake threads on game balance issueslook into your petition with good responce time there is a csm etcetc  thats a solid fact people that say they are playing beta are just ingnorant idiotsgo try to communicate with devs in any other mmo i would like to see that any increase in that communication would be just stupidly insane and a waste of their precious time imho
i agree and have a feeling that 90 of the people who are complaining have no knowlage of what they are complaining about have you guys eve thought that the reason they fix is coming out on thirsday is because the bug might be hard to fix or that level of logical thinking above the trolling majority no support as the threat is of no use to eve community if it would be so easy it would already been done
i just made a new alt and get into the rookie channel and the first thing i see is a bot that sells iskthat is just not good these guyz a new dont know the rules and they keeps getting spammede with isk sellers item sellers and other crapyou should really monitor that channel it is way worse then the recruitment channel 10 times atleastmy idea get some one to actually watch the channel it is quite important to give them a good start
i suggest to add a time to the pos mail the ones when your pos runs low on resources which displays at which time your pos will run out of fuel and shut downeither have a timer behind every fuel as seen on the management screen of the pos orand have an timer which displays the time when it runs out at the bottom of the mailseeing as this is a really easy calculation which just makes your pos logistics easier it surprises me why it is not there already
yeah this would be nice not the only thing needed but a good fix nonetheless
as a part of the pos overhaul giving the main tower functions like a hangar and centralized inputoutput and perhaps even systemwide fueling would be a huge convenience the corp hangar array could be relegated to an extra capacity role
please organize the drugs in market by their effect it is a huge pain to scroll through 50 drugs trying to figure out which one you wantit should have a break down menuarmordronesengineeringmissilesshieldsturretsthis would make shopping for drugs a lot easier also maybe some more drug related skills
there has got to be a simple way to see how much time is left in game would it besoo hard to give a timer or update on time left paid for gee whiz ccp you like our money anough shouldnt you make it easier to pay or at least know wehn to pay by the way having to post this on an alt account because my main is suspended for non payment when i had enough for a plex in game shucks why noeven be able to use a plex for reactivating a suspended account anyway
its been asked for before basically ccp keeps financial servers and game servers largely separate mostly for security reasons  someone duping items is bad someone duping paid accounts is much worsefor example because of this putting interlinks in apparently makes the devs cry  the plex was apparently a  to implement that said they are working on it no need to ask again
on behalf of rolosjust wanted to provide a little feedback on the patching system though its nice to have a torrent based autopatcher i think there are quite a few small things to improve on to make it a better experience for many of the eve userbase1 patch notes are great to read but why not download the update while the user is reading them there could be a small bar at the bottom providing small details with a show details button to add more functionality and information2 as its a standalone patcher and a torrent using one there should be options common to torrent clients such as utorrent and azureus such as the ability to pause downloads restart them or stop them in order to redownload the patch without having to close the autopatcher 3 related to the last point bandwidth control would also be a coveted option myself and many other eve players do not have internet connections that allow multitasking on the internet inability to read email at any real speed or do anything else requiring the internet without ridiculous slowdowns whilst downloading this would allow us to keep our lives going whilst preparing to play our game options for control could include setting download and upload limits for seeders see next point4 seeders are people that have finished downloading or are in the process of downloading a file and are uploading the bits to others trying to acquire said file they would unload strain from ccp servers and mirrors saving bandwidth and letting these resources be used for more important things like the game itself4 allow us to download a torrent file instead of the autopatcher its smaller more versatile and easier plus you wouldnt have to do coding for the torrent application itself and could just skin another application or build the autopatcher as a module for the client running as a separate program instead of having to be downloaded each time a patch comes out this could also help people seed5 look to utorrent for inspiration on the matter of torrent applications its lightweight extremely fast easy to use and popular6 a patch folder should be created in the eve directory to store patch files if this system or similiar is implemented it will make it easier to find the files for users and allows for easier backing up of said filesread and reply 
what are you doing redownloading the game repeatedlyyou on dial up or somethingi have a 15mb connection here and while its large most get done in 30 mins or lessi dont see the big issue here unless your continuously reinstalling the game
reply on behalf of roloswelcome to the world of canadian internet and acer laptops i download at 60kbs when thats all my internet is working at and living with this laptop leads to a reformatting every few weeks life is slowbut these adjustments wouldnt only benefit those with god awful connections but those who hate lag while gaming and want to split their bandwidth to multitask better or for those who need to share a connection between multiple computers in a network and still have them work at high speeds on the internet
the thing i really hate about the patcher is when you have multiple clients open at the same time and it closes eve to begin patching it closes all the evesdistributing patches via bottorrent is an excellent idea too
id prefer that versus how it is now
i will say that new eden itself is not crowded however certain systems areeach region has like a couple of good systems and these systems are the ones that are crowded rest of new eden is empty and dessertthis is something i want to change in my csm campaign uniqueness and value of each system each system should have some kind of applicable value for at least one proffessions in eve
it would free the market not limit itthe entire trade system especially in hubs revolves around who updates enough orders often enough not supply and demand using 34 significant digits for bid increments would effectively over time make all markets converge to supply and demand and traders would have to make decisions and market moves instead of repeating their intention this would be a good thing for you and the community becausea it would make trading more about brains than time which would be more funb it would get rid of every single trade bot in the game or put them at an serious disadvantage a good example of this would be to check out the markets and bot activity in hubs where theres already an automatic 34 significant digits limit like veldspar or trit in jitac it would net you alot of the traders votesd it would be one of the biggest changes you could hope to get throughe more research and thinking and less brainless updating every 5 minutes means less server lag for all this benifit would make the issue alot easier to champion and get response in

you have my vote garthranim like you i play eve for the enjoyment of the gamei started playing in sept 05i dont enjoy the pvp aspect of the game but have taken part i have played and still play many mmos but i always keep returning to eve i would enjoy seeing what you could bring to the csm with the mindset ive seen in your posts best of luck and i hope to see what new outlook you bring to the csm
hi i was looking through this thread i am looking for 1 simple thing to happen to the mining the ore crystal color should change with whatever crystal you use in your strip miner right now its all 1 yellow color although the fire effect against the rock is very pretty1st it would be pretty2nd it would easily distinguish which rock your gang members are mining on an op 3rd you could easily tell which beam is working on which rock just 3 benefits of the color changes think light sabers in star wars   the 2nd thing in eve that i am looking to see changed is the ability to change font size in eve mail that is getting on my last nerve im practically blind and that pica 4 point is just killing my eyeswell thats enough i hope i have given you something to think about thankyou for your timerachel orefinder
he would have also had my vote perhaps it would have made the csm a little less of the darius show it seems to be currently
i agree scams are rampant and it is totally unrealistic in real life you can tell the police and they will go after the scam artist in eve there is no such justice worse in eve the criminal is protected i consulted a real lawyer and this is my understanding of he saidin addition if the scam grows large enough to where you can easily determine that it would be worth real life money they could be found liable the person who scammed my corp is in this forum buying and selling billions and yet i have to wonder how much of that is ill gotten gainsfirst the conversation from isk to any currency can be established through the in game selling of game time cards since ccp manages that market and recieves money from the selling of the gtcs they benefit directly so they benefit from the crime which makes them a partyif a scam were to ever raise to the level of a gtc which is about 700 million isk or about 35 us they could be in trouble example above assume that the person mentioned above whom i say purchase something for 40billion isk that would be 1866 dollars that could potentially be linked to a criminal actif players loose that much isk you have lost real money without consideration which is a legal term where you must benefit from the contract if you do not benefit in some way the contract is not legalanother way is if the contract is out of balance to where one side greatly benefits at the expense of another then the contract is not legalno contract can be written that sanctions an illegal act so in the above conditions the eula may not protect ccp further they could be liable because they are protecting the offending person while profiting from the scam directlythe fact that its a game also does not protect ccp again because they accept real money or manage the exchange of real money for in game money they have opened the door to liabilityall the legal stuff aside its just damn bad to run a business that sanctions such actions
regarding isk evemail spammersi agree with the restricting trial accounts ideas in this thread trial accounts should automatically be prevented from sending evemails or speaking in local etc after x number of spam complaints are lodged against themof course a later gm investigation can sort out the abusers of this and there should be a max number of trial accounts one single computer can log into in a certain period of timecomputer defined as same install information and ip address something along those lines should reduce the volume without punishing legitimate usersregarding legal scpammers i think the calling the 19999999isk 199 mil change was a step in the right direction some sort of limit on the amount of links someone can put in local chat might help but no matter what you do jita local is going to be utter and complete trash anyways any trial account restriction probably wont stop these guys implementing something similar to what the market has to filter out orders that are ridiculously high might be the best solution if i see one tritanium up for a bil the contract will warn me that its x above average going rate on contracts for this item and i guess the going rates will be calculated from the past few days of contracts that were completed
i judged that most of the candidates responses would be similar to mine and im simply not famous enough to draw attention unless my answer was exactly what you wanted to hear and as issler said i wouldnt want to give an answer that is not indicative of my personal feelings so i opted to allow you to exclude me from your considerationsgarthran
i fully support the needed ability to change font size both larger and smaller i change back and forth from a 24 screen to a 14 and i need a larger font for the 24 and smaller font for the 14

this thread should have died months ago maybe someone needs to come up with a bettermore balanced idea since obviously the ops has not succeeded in raising enough supportas it is the current suggestion will likely imbalance the situation more than it is currently skewed imaginea young capsuleer encounters a deserted battlefield some wrecks have not been looted possibly due to them not yielding anything worth taking for the veteran combatants short on isk the young capsuleer cannot resist the temptationa corporate pilot has barely survived an ambush by a rival corporations roamer the battle has cost him and he feels entitled to the loot the aggressor has left behind woe him as a specialized human vulture in a fast ship has been waiting for this moment and will now quickly swoop in and ransack all the best loot on the fieldsuicide gankers have just ganked a mining op by a alliance friendly to you one of their ilk has waited at a safe distance and is now coming in to collect the spoils of their efforts you will not let this injustice stand and hurry over to deny themneither the current system nor the one proposed here likely works out in all these situation to everyones satisfaction things to consider why should shooting a ship make you the legal new owner of the spoils why should stealing property automatically give anyone the right to kill you and your crewconsider this from the perspective of those that decide what is right and what isnt in empire space the empires maybe an empire  would consider a ships property forfeit under certain circumstances would give a capsuleer the exclusive right to salvage under certain other circumstances would not intervene at all in such trivial mattersdiscuss but better make a new thread
dont try to necro my thread  still plenty of discussion and support going on here alot more interest and activity than the majority out there
im sure that missionrunning ship or mining ship had a real good chance at popping your pvp ganksquad
although i should be considered a weapon of mass destruction one person does not constitute a gank squadread the quote  3 different people in a field with 3 different agendas get over yourself btw its funny youre assuming that the person in the field is running a mission or mining  welcome to eve  there are a few more reasons to be in a field  but those you constantly state are the only ones that help your argument and make him look all soooo defenseless
wow  you guys have been discussing this for more than a year now  how long do this things usually take to be accepted or rejectedit seems to be that at the moment the game mechanic is skewed in favour of the looter  but equally i think the suggested solutions on the front page put the favour far too much in the favour of the winner of a fight if those were implmented wouldnt it make it far more viable to suicide gank someone then come back in another ship and sweep up all the loot because you know no one else would pinch it while you were getting in a new shipalso it doesnt seem realistic if this were a real scenario the loot and salvage would be available to anyone who turned up it should be possible to play as a rouge type character sneaking in and stealing the lootequally in a real scenario if youd just won the fight then youd be able to start shooting any looter that turned up without fear of concord intervention i liked the idea someone suggested about any player that loots from a player wreck loses their concord protection for a short time adds risk to the looter but also doesnt just hand the loot to the winner of a fight on a silver plate

thats a problem of 2 things in eve its economy and its sov if you were to fix the economy so that losing a ship actually hurt you financially even a frigate to more of an extent than it does now youd see progress if you then fixed the sov so that defending entities actually had reason to fear losing their space easily then youd see even more progresstake a look at the alliance size rankings youll find about 70 alliances over 500 members how many of those do you see holding a pocket of space maybe 20 everyone wanted the game to be a cookie cutter cake walk were combat was more about how many ships can i throw at you rather than how will you fight against me dd were added to compensate for this massive failure but what happened was nobody cared about the ships they were losing only the ability to have the fun fights that fleets could now have with 30 backup ships per pilot waiting dd ended good fights for most attacking alliances so rather than attack most would rather defend now moms and titans were added but the devs didnt think about the rule of 10 which means anything major and new added should always be 10x more than what is currently a high price titans were meant to be alliance goals yet now you have random people self funding them on a whim imagine if they cost 400 bil rather than 40 you wouldnt see them in the same light now every alliance has several but their original intent was for a select few those willing to work together truth be told i dont blame the devs for trying to make money i do blame them for not trying to find a balance between what they once had and what theyve created whats really a shame is that now that we have these 1000v1000 player epic and potential fights and servers that can actually hold them nobody is willing to take them because of the ed up mechanics its almost funny that the devs cant hide behind the lag issue anymore now they have to address their own errors and thats going to be a much bigger challenge
im really a bit amazed nothing in this thread makes any differenceit all comes down to im suggesting this and that because when push comes to shove my guys are fine because it already is our strategy to pump over a dozen titans into a system to achieve objectives without a fight once the mechanisms change we can just bring a dozen more to achieve the same resultwhat is the real problem here the ship the doomsday or players
i might support this if the vuk could rephrase his op to make clear exactly what he is proposing as it is all i get are a general idea make supercaps stronger some links to other ideas and suggestions to maybe do this or that or why not this toops is it really still possible to edit an op in this section
youre assuming this is the only change expected its not its one on a long road to 00 recovery and revamp however it makes no sence to pool in sov mechanics insurance ratting pos and all the other crap into this thread you start small and work one problem at a time
no its not an assumption 00 in more respects then one needs a complete revamp it would  as digi pointed out elsewhere  a complete expansion to do that this however is not commercially feasible 00 is just not that big of a niche to warrant such a marketing investmentso yes itll have to be step by step the first danger of this is that we have often seen ccp come up with something only to implement it at a much later time when circumstances and player behaviour have changed so much that the changes come across as kneejerk behaviour instead of a sound gradual approachthe second danger is that both on a technical level as well as on a customer level behaviour everything is so complex and interconnected that doing things step by step gets very close to coming off as somewhat incompatible with ccps recently adopted development method while it enables them to pump out a lot in relatively short time it does not provide much depth or a lot of room for preventing issues that arise from complexityhaving said that we all know ccp wants to do a good job i just worry a bit that it is vulnerable to dropping pieces during design or implementation look at apocrypha expansion for example or the recent jumpbug dramaya know as long as all those little steps on that big road deal just with features and not with how we abuse them and go nuts with them its just pushing the problem ahead of us at least thats how it feels to mebesides that by the time a small step hits us were well beyond the situation during which that step was designed
this whole thread is about balancing the fleet make a proper suggestion that doesnt unbalance the fleet even more than what it already is i like your setup there but there is one problem that just makes it all to easy for new beginners or old players moving into mining career and thats the fact that youve set the covetor one level to low making it unbalanced there need to be a certain buffer between the retriver and the covetor at the same time we provide a proper buffer between the covetor and the hulki suggest it like thismining barge1  first tier mining barge2  retriever3  na4  coveter5  naexhumers1  first tier t2 barge2  second tier t2 barge3  hulk4  na5  nathen we dont ask of to much and it remains a proper buffer that will bring a proper balance to the mining barge flotilla and doesnt make it to easy nor to hard its just perfect 
i support system suggested above
full support to reducing the skill requirement for a covetor in order to make them once again a viable stop along the career pathingame since beta testing  i remember mining in a vexor because i couldnt afford a battleship yetrelated issue  named t1 mining lasers meta level 3 etc are approximately useless even on an osprey there are way too many t2s at far too low a price in the game
signedas a newbie player like you describe ive not long had my retriever and im much enjoying it  but ive started the learning parth towards the covertor because i assumed the progression curve was balanced and that itd be a good stepping stone to the hulk now ive read this im switching my plan to go straight for hulki should have run the numbers i guess but even so id have been disapointed to have handed over the cash for a covetor and then discover how little was required to get the hulk

if i remember correctly lag wasnt this bad when fw started and the fleets were bigger what happen the hardware running the zones degrade badly or something i cant believe ccp is letting something really good for the average player fade away
signed
 because they may not be inconsequential for everyonethis problem should have absolute priority as its very very easy to fixat the csm level i think ccp should be pushed toward investing some energy into little and simple details like the above so that similar mistakes do not repeat and instead even more simple assistive device friendly ui features are added
im not technically adept to know if something is easy or not to fix but i will vote for the want of ease of accessibility for the individual and those having to face a similar difficulty due to the current changesigned

agreed
as a visually impaired player i support the assistive device friendly and would also like to see it extended into the range of those with visual impairments high contrast large font etc and other disabilities as wellccp should take a proactive approach to disabled player client adaption they would benefit from this stance to several degrees the positive press being the first and only major mmorpg to offer disabled player access functionality in a client it would give great coverage and is a excellent marketing pointthe increase in active subscribers a whole new potential influx of new accounts players who never thought they would be able to play and players who wanted to play but were unable to due to their disabilitythe good karma and free beer i and other disabled players will buy the ccp staff at fanfest a simple advisory panel comprised of differently disabled players to offer suggestions and helpful adaption insight for ccp would benefit the processwith a little bit of effort ccp is quite capable of making this universe a better place for all of us signed

your reading comprehension is sad reallyedit and i found you an example of a ccp fanboy here for your reading pleasuresad isnt it
once your using primarily t2 gear its easy to forget how useful t1 drops can be to players just starting out or just moving to a new area where production doesnt necessarily match demand a fair few players rely on those t1 drops to equip their ships test new loadouts and so onremoving 40 of the legitimate mineral flow also increases the proportion of the mineral flow that comes from macro miners
the reason for your request is basically sound but even i will concede that it should be done as part of a proper industrymining expansion
but it decreases the amount that come from sweatshop ratters and missioners
balance is the key to success overall loot could be reduced by 12 with little effect on game play but it has to be done with some forethoughtmaybe 10 thru 08 systems and equal level sites and missions loot tables retain t1 ordinary mods meta level 1 new players actually use these mods when theyre starting outin 05 thru 07 plus sitesmissions of equal difficulty meta level 1 mods arent in loot tables but level 3 mods are addedin low sec only meta level 3 and 4 mods spawn with faction or officer mods from the odd elite rat onlyand in deep space only meta level 4 faction and officer mods spawn at allreducing the loot tables by 12 or more would reduce the isk added every day to the game and thus would put downward pressure on prices players would generate fewer resources per day of play and thus could afford to pay lessthis would partly compensate for the isk added via the addition of salvage to the game and the net impact of wspace systemsfor those who are interested ive been ingame since beta testing so i do have some experience to guide my suggestions
id mine veldspar in 00 more if the roids didnt insta pop once they got some attentionhaving roids pop every 23 minutes is a pain to manage especially if running multiple hulks did it once never again ill buy trit or not build stuff before i mine veld again p
so you think too much minerals are being generated from reprocessing t1 loot in that case it seems you should argue that certain items yield too much minerals removing those things from loot tables although obviously npc ships can be expected to have equipped just that before blown to bits seems unreasonable especially since you do not offer a good ingame reason for this changenot supportededit good to see that your proposal is more important than all the others though you having so kindly labled it thus
if mods drones and ammo are removed from loot tables ccp might as well remove trad skills from the game traders wont have anything to buy or sell
whilst i have issues with the mac reporting ideas suggested along the list of privacy besides its frigteningly easy to get an os to spoof this i can just see the mass of clients reporting 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef now that being said the block and report mechanism should be implimented the current method consumes a lot of time and once complete the spammer has usually logged off to spawn yet another character

i have clearly not paid this section of the forums enough attention in the past i feel i would like to amend this yet i am slightly confused as to how this is supposed to work if there is a faq or similar please point the way i have not seen itas far as i could gather this section is reserved for a player to present a concrete wellconsidered proposal to the general community having it dicussed by their peers and hoping it to be supported by enough of them with a thumbs up then if a certain amount of votes in support are garnered or if the proposal finds the personal support of a current csm member the csm will have to discuss and vote for the proposal to be presented to cpp correctnow i wonder about some things i see threads starting with proposal issue suggestion idea request and other similar ones is that all the same or are these threads to be regarded differently for some reason i see threads just stating a general opinion about an issue or offering a variety of possible solutions to a problem does it make sense to support such things if you generally agree seeing as this could only be presented to cpp by the csm with great difficulty i see players voicing their opposition to some proposals without offering any reasons or discussion does that negatively impact on the likelihood that a proposal will be taken up by the csm i see ops being edited by their authors after people already stated their support shouldnt the author make a new thread if he or she wants to change or amend his or her proposal i see players discussing proposals and then voicing their support not for the original proposal but actually for certain points that came up in that discussion are they aware that they are really supporting the original proposal as suggested in the op i see proposals that were originally proposed more than a year ago still generating discussion and still garnering some sporadic support a lot has happened in that past year  can such an issue still be taken up by the csm i see some issues being raised again and again some of them have even been rejected by either the csm or cpp in the past does it make sense to raise such issues once more i see the csm has made a really nice wiki that is much more structured and userfriendly to get an idea what has been discussed before thanks will it ever be brought up to date again andor include a faq that answers questions such as these
just because a mail exists doesnt mean it needs to be posted and it really doesnt need to be force posted to some central killboardjust because some pvp happened in some way doesnt mean it needs to be posted in that way

sure why not it could be alot more accurate than most killboards
i support the idea of more communication from ccp and transgaming speaking as someone who used the previous official linux client the amount of feedback on it from the people developing the thing was simply attrocious i also see the same thing in the mac subforum two weeks until premium content and then the plug being pulled on the whole client springs to mind we need to know what you are doing if you introduce a major bug wed like to see details of when a fix is due how the progress on this fix is working when the fix is sent out for testing even 140 odd characters used in a twitter feed would be suffcient
might as well give them a breaknow if you could combine this with a right click on character in local to report them for isk spam instead of making a petition that lags you to death that included what they said in its autop generated non laggy report
i can feel your pain but i think it will be mostly worthless to have somebody monitor the channels for bots the people who do spam recycle their characters at a rate that would put to shame even the most devout ecologistimho they should give details about the legal and illegal methods of acquiring isk as an emphasized part of the account creation process the mere knowledge that there are completely legal methods of acquiring isk would both virtually eliminate the illegal spammers and aid those of us who pay for our accounts using etcs
or get more isd members
or make trial accounts unable to speak in public channelsthis issue solvedcontract scams and spam solved
i see advetisement ow looks like cool game lets get the trial ok rookie channel ok guys how do you do missions what i am a rookie and i cannot ask questions in rookie channel then who is gonna talk in rookie channel whta is it for this is a very big problem edit reported 2 spammers
that would be true but i still think some one would end up buying it from isk sellers as they really dont know what is leagal or notnot quite shure this would work i dont think that a isd member can mute or ban
i started a 21 day trial just to see how the new player experience was much better than the past in my 21 days i filed 47 isk spam petitions from the rookie channel and 6 or so from the corp channel and thats only putting in a few minutes to set up training ques each dayyes ccp definately needs to take a look at the rookie channel even if all they do is hire a few new low wage interns who do nothing but watch the channel and rclick  ban spammers on sightno need to conduct an investigation no need for anyone to file a petition the spammer is just gone end of storythey also need to implement the rclick spam option that instablocks the spammer from whatever channel for the individual who used the selection when enough spam reports add up the person is gagged for a rather lengthy period of time think a few hours if this continues theyre banned pending an investigationenough said
two fairly easy labourunintensive possible solutions surprised no one has implemented similar options before maintain a database of isk selling sites any message in a public channel that includes one of those addresses is autocensored could autocensor on other common iskseller terms tooanyone who is blocked by 5 or more people in rookie chat within 30 seconds is prevented from posting to that chat again pending review by isd or staff
just add a tool for volunteers to easily silence trial accounts only from talking in public channels
this tbh we already have rookie channel mentors i seem to remember some from my early days in eveif the mentors could right click ban it would solve the problem allowing other people to right click report with an auto banreview would open up a method of griefing so not in favour of that
the problem with this is the same problem with the textonly spam filtering in email it works for about 5 minutes consider thiswwweveonlinecomwwweveonlinecomthey pretty much look exactly to you dont they but i can assure you the software sees something completely differentall that aside i do support the absolute banning without possibility of revocation those found to be buying andor selling isk from an unacceptable source
remove rookie channel or allow players willing to stay in there to stay in there and be pmd by rookies who actually need help most answers to things can be answered in the evelopedia or should be perhaps if people read they will find their answer have you gone through the new player system recently its pretty informative its not hard to create work arounds that suffice this more so detriments or stops isk sellers and spam scams versus forcing new players to convo people and ask not a big problem at allagain nerf trial accounts speaking ability
this is not a problem with links because links have to be resolveable by a dns server if a dns server doesnt resolve them to the right ip address they dont work and dns server code is public domain in fact you could be really clever and use a dns server to store your database of isk sellers every link in a public message gets resolved on your special dns server  if it returns the ip address of a known isk seller or a flag value showing the link is known to be an isk seller the message gets blocked
personaly i beleave that ecm how it is now  even after the change are still most powerfull module in the game and must be complitely revisited but i will leave hereby without any more propose to change it in any way since there have been plenty of topics relating this heavy discussionwhat i strogly beleave is that what make this module close to  i win  hardware is that it can be very successfully used on the biger ship clases then it own hull classwhat i want to purpose here is that the ecm effects must be seperated by ship classes where it can be successfully used without changing module it selfso generely speaking it will looks like thisall frigat hull ecm ships include t2 versions will be only succesfull by jamming they own class hulls  destroyer classbut not on higher hull classes as cruiserbattlecruiserbattleship hullsall cruiser hull ecm based ships will be succesfull on it is own hull class  including t2 and t3 versions  battlecruiser hull and smaler hulls then its own classstill wont be successfull on the bigger class then its own in this case battleship hull and abovethe battleship hull ecm based ship will be the only counterpart to it is own hull class  and below bccruiserfrigat in short if you want to use ecm successfully on the bigger class hull then its own you have to bring size capable ship to do so otherwise you will have stick to your own class hull to be usefull on jammingi beleave this will solve lost of frustrations and actualy balancing this module in the way how it fits in gameapologies for bad english i did my best
ofc i support this idea since it was brouth by me
wownono other mechanic forces this even weapon systems to a degreethis is just a terrible idea no supportisaac
no we already have sensor strength to enforce a similar mechanic and this is an absurd and unnecessary mechanic not supported
and that is exactly the problem since sensor strength of battleship hull class is way to weak vs target jamming strength of the falcon or even blackbird cruiser hull classat the moment how it is now the battleship class hull have chance from low to zero to counter lower class ships jamming strength and that is what make the ecm so powerfull in curent state
if you are not content with the performance of your battleship i suggest you pay less for it next time or buy another ship entirely if there are none that suit your needs suggest the gods of invention gift someone somewhere with a blueprint according to your own ideasnot supported
blackbird 1 of each racial 2 sda vs dominix0 eccm  8161 eccm  5452 eccm  339so yeah a single cruiser can disable a single battleshipbarring those pesky hammerhead ii that have a tendency to rip said cruiser a new one most of the time unless the battleship uses countermeasures in which case the cruiser isnt in such a nice position at all remember jamming ships only get jamming nothing else about them is any good yes in ideal circumstances they do nicely but if anything goes wrong theyre screwed
well how about it please the few upbeat songs in the game cant be listened to regularly in the jukebox67 songs of low tempo melodrama can induce narcolepsy couple examples i could find

i was just thinking of how much effort the human race undertakes in real life in the attempt to research all aspects of the space its history its nature and composition eve on the contrary despite its well educated playerbase and despite the fact that there are so many research and science related npc corps around is only about ships or modules all aspects of the game including the industry and also the research that can be done is all about modules and ships narrowing it down to combat in the end as the one and only motto of the game while this isnt wrong the immersion of the game could be much deeper if we could also get into researching eveUFFFDs universe itself ingame lore anyonenow on to the questions of what would be the point of it all and what should the rewards be then should it be implemented as a standalone thing or should it heavily interfere with the other professions that we can already go after and then how could it be implemented without to much effort on the devs side and with generating a good costbenefit ratio regarding the development process and finally how would it be gameplaywise1 first off the point of it would be to generate income or it would be a meaningless profession as much as this principle counts for all the other professions too but it would be another way to generate income thus making the game even more fun its simple as that the more different things we can do ingame the more fun it is2what should the rewards be see paragraph 1 with the added reward of having accomplished something towards understanding the universe and new eden a little bit more3at first it should be a standalone thing to not overcomplicate things trading with npc goods is also a standalone thing and can be fun every now and then so i cant see any issue of having another standalone game featuremy definition for standalone doesnt interfere with other game features other than letting the player generate isk if they chose to spend their time doing science jobs instead of lets say running lvl 4 missionsalthough they could combine science related activities with some npc killing as well would spice up things but ill elaborate on that in paragraph 44 how could it be implemented i would say by implementing science related tasks or jobs that are given out by npcUFFFDs there was once this idea about scientific ships yea those could be brought on the table here again accomplishing these tasks would require an appropriate scientific ship the scientific ships as much as the scientific tasks could come in two up to five tiers depends on how much effort the devs would be willing to put into it as much as we have five tiers of missionsfor example if you wanted to accomplish a tier 4 scientific task you couldnt finish it unless you had a tier 4 scientific ship lower ships just couldnt handle the difficulty andor complexity of the given taska scientific ship would have some combat abilities to fight off unforeseen threats but also have the capability to fit specialized laboratories and scanners
5 how would a scientific task look likehere comes the real essence of my idea these tasks could be anything from very simple to very advanced some examples for simple tasks go to sun x in solarsystem x and research the exact chemical makeup of it or we have received information about increased sunspot activity at sun x in solarsystem x go there and research if it could be a threat to nearby stationsor we have received information about an unknown species of asteroids in location x in solarsystem y go there and research the chemical makeup of them uh oh as soon you warp there a bunch of guristas with their own reasearch convoy shows up looks like they are interested in the makeup of those roids as well now youll have to do some pew pew before you can get on with the researchthe possibilities are endlessmore advanced tasks would deal more and more with the universal aspects of the universe  new eden while simple tasks would deal with local aspects of the solar system or planetary systemsmore advanced tasks could be similar to escalations the agent first sends you to a specific location but then the task escalates on to new locations in different solar systems you get the idea
intriguingneeds to have the bones fleshed out but i would train for something like this it would be different and fun
maybe its the sort of wacky miniprofession eve can add easily but i have concerns about dev time and your proposal is rather lacking in meat it might be a good idea but its a lot of work and thus a very low priority id say take it to fi play around with it a little and see if you can get some support there the devs do sometimes read it you might get them thinking along those lines that said this is a little bit too far off in the distance to really justify a csm endorsement id say no thumb even if i am intrigued
tonygs popularity in players community is second only to t20s reputation and the latter is no longer with ccp as was pointed out elsewhere by other players it is amusing to say the least that one of the top marketing people at ccp is generating so much negative feelings amongst the arguably most loyal customer base putting tonyg in charge of retconning the eves canon is wrong on every level
most definitelyneed for credibility and consistency  tonygs ego  eve lore  tonygs literary abilities
i think it would be really cool to see some dread guristas blood raider khanid navy angel gistii ect carriers motherships and dreads just give them a new paintjob if you dont have the time to make new models give them some sick bonuses and make them cost a bunch of lp for a blue printid buy one caldari navy chimerawyvern weeeeee
youre going to need a far better reason than because itd be cool before i support this yeah itd be cool in a narrow sense but how are the existing faction ships cool if every ship has a halfdozen faction variants im not totally opposed to making new faction ships but game design isnt about pleasing people in the short term its about pleasing them in the long term just throwing around bigger and shinier every time you get bored is a terrible way to do that
it would be easy to implement and would give people more goals to work for i have run out of things to train almost may as well throw in some faction capspeople have money to spend ya know
faction ships have nothing to do with training faction ships have about the same skill requirements as their t1counterpart and capital ships needs a revision as such adding faction ships is pointless ccp also have a lot of other things to do which will benefit the game more than just fuzz which this is
are you going to cry
anyway there are navy issue cruisers and battleships so why cant ccp just change the color of the carriersdreads give them a 10 boost or something across the board on shieldsarmorstructure call it a navy version and give us all something else to slave towards with our iski would like the option of spending 510x the normal isk on a navy issue version
signed for humorous terminator reference
funny i was just thinking about this the other day fully support this would spice things up for sure imagine the tears from someone being afk losing a costly ship to sleepers
i dont like the idea it seem to undermine the efforts made in wormhole space and smells like greed as if battling sleepers in highsec would lead to sleeper rig components
that is all the rampant inflation will only continue  ie mission runners income i recognize things like lp store items and skills are already huge isk sinks however i believe we need more isk sinks weather direct or indirecti could type something more credible and lengthy but post your thoughts below
if ccp thinks that the current level of monetary inflation is unsustainable for the economy they will do something about it
fair enough they do have an economist on board regardless ive been a marketeer for over a year now and soon things like titans may not be so expensive and out of reach as they used to be or intended to be  from my experience at least watching market trends
i see your point entirely but the fact that theres virtually unlimited supply of isk and minerals creates a deflationary effect which is inherent to this system that goes for any mmo basically
unlike most mmos eve has great costs and risks on ships think about it in wow you die it costs a penny effort to fix your crap here if you lose a decent ship it takes quite a bit of money to replace it i believe ccp is already focused on this with their economist
the ironic thing is that insurance is a giant source of inflation
yeah i know eve is the only game i can think of where pvp is inflationary and pve is deflationary that said aside from the fallout to the reactor exploit theres no inflation in eve as of the last info we have the trend has historically been slow deflation if that changes im sure they have ways to deal with it
flog the dead horse and have done with ita pos should work the same as a station
the problem with this is the same problem that caused the pos exploit if the items are stored in a different location the module has to make a status check aka a database call on whether the raw materials are present in the other location and the other location the pos tower in this case has to respond with another pipe of datathis might not seem like much but considering how many poses are in service and the amount of modules the poses contain the number of database calls would be disabling to the servers the devs made a shortcut to just save two calls per hour and that cost them a huge mistake in the games economic historywhile it might seem like a good idea this concept is completely unfeasible sorry but i cannot support it due to the overhead required
i know ive talked to you ingame but this should probably be addressed in thread too i dont think youve quite got what im asking for here there would be no need to check multiple places when starting a jobi agree that would break the database because there wouldnt be multiple places to check the pos would have exactly one hangar and thus there would only be one check im not a dev and i dont know for a fact that this can be done but my intuition which isnt usually too terrible says it can probably be done a fair number of people including one of your fellow csmers seem to agree i think its worth asking the question since thats really what the csm is best at the csm have brought up topics before where the initial idea was rejected but another path to the same solution was found one of my topics started as change ammo in all guns at once and ended as weapon grouping  not the same thing but the same ultimate result and instead of causing lag it actually reduced it in that case we didnt get what we asked for but we certainly got what we wanted if this thread ends up in the same place ill be more than happy but we cant do that if we use lines like well im not sure its possible if you know its impossible fine reject me i dont see any way for anyone outside ccp to know whether it is or not  if you have info on this topic let me know and point me to it if its not under nda but from what i can tell this is all guesswork we both want it to be done i think theres a good chance it can be done in a reasonable amount of time without breaking anything you dont but neither of us really knows lets ask the people who do
be that as it may sooner or later the devs will have no choice but rework the entire pos codingsince they insist on making us depend on poses more and more there will be more people using them  and getting annoyed eventually perhaps to a point of leaving the gameinstead of chosing to ignore the issue until its too late and kneejerk hotfixes are applied they should man up and fix itjust saying its too much work its too much work over and over again wont helpignorance may be bliss but it doesnt fix problems i tried more than once
hi omberwhat is your stance on aggression flags for salvaging wrecks
i should go find my exact quote from the minutes this was discussed in but in general my idea was to have time limited flags for both the corp of the people who owned the original ship destroyed and the corp of the people that destroyed it something like 5 minutes whoever salvagedlooted it first got the stuff after that time limit expired the wreck became available to everyone to lootsalvage
i vote omber zombie becuase of falcon
i voted for this guy
well youve got my vote for that reason and others thank you

vik luk for csm d
part 2 i think is a valid complaint that should be addressed yet another tiny flaw in the eve ui that needs correction and im all for thatpart 1 while interesting is a minor cosmetic change that really would only do so much for the game however that doesnt mean im against it like ive told some others if its important to you flesh is out make an ideas thread pull together some support for it give me a link to that thread if you can show me popular support ill support it in the csm
i must say despite disagreeing with some of the concepts herschel puts forward he does seem to be the one that cares most about the game and its future i submitted my lone vote for him and look forward to his term on the council if others agree with me
just like last time i voted for herschel the ui should be getting constant attention as it is horrible i can agree to his policies on the eve gameplay as wellgood luck to you herschel o
due to rl commitments ive hardly been playing the last 6 months and certainly not had time to keep up with the forums  but i was very pro herschel in the last elections and looks like im back just in time to vote for him again

ok ive been waiting for a long time to see anything helpful brought out for corp ceos and directors in the way of more controll over there corp and security for there currant assets corps and alliances are the core of eve game play and are a vital for the future of eve and the last we saw in the way of changes where some extra corp wallets new corp logos and some fancy new medals nice chineys but this does not really help one manage a corpso are there any csm candidates who even care about this at all or other more pressing matters other than pirate mining crystals orshall i be abstaining againmore details in this post
my view theyre garbage and need a complete ui overhaul
this
erik certainly does and he also has some interesting plans for 00 infrastructure development that would benefit providence immensely id saythat and hes a roleplayer what else do you want
maybe erik to actually speak for himself
erik assigned me to do his forum talking the complaining about it is getting old nowit the message thats important not the messenger if you want to hear him speak watch the movie
i agree the roles and permissions interface is confusing and needs an overhaul in fact a great deal of the ui needs an overhaulhowever pirate mining crystals would be pretty cool 
i think corp tools are pretty decent atm and a lot of people dont make full use of them however the interface is absolutely terrible and really needs a look atofftopic  mitnal
i say screw it all lets have a drink i think corps need a better interface when it comes to giving roles and their explanations my first time being a director i wish i had a guide book i know eve has a step learning curve and that is what brought me to the game but this is a part of the game that can have a huge affect on many people in the game and needs to be clearer more control over certain such as pos control and general actions that have a wide spread affect on many character is needed and a clearer explanation of the roles
cleanedofftopic posts removed
since i speak for myself and always will corp ui stuff is pretty good could do with a few tweaks and changes but the interface is confusing and needs workxavier
this should be brought up i do not think this is working as intended you cannot inject a skill before the prerequisites are obtainedmeaning for example towards the end of his skill queue my character will be done learning instant recall iv in approximately 21 hours afterwards i want to train eidetic memory i ii and iii there is room on the queue for at least rank i and ii but i cant put them in the queue because the skill isnt injectednormally the last skill that fits can run over the 24 hour limit but in this instance my queue is smaller than 24 hours and is going to inconvenience me to get around it i have to train less efficiently or train a skill i dont really want to be training right nowproposed fix let any skill be injected only check if the requirements are met when its put in the skill training queue so that when i queue all the prerequisites i can immediately queue into the appropriate skillif ccp does not want free skill injection perhaps instead let yellow circles suffice for injection but green checkmarks are required to actually train the skill to level 1 to prevent injection of every prerequisite turn 0 sp injected skill to orange circles and once it has at least 1 sp meaning the prerequisites have all been met it will be a yellow circle in other skills requirements and those skills will be injectable
i have found this occasionally frustrating but i see too much potential for workarounds no its not optimal to have to wait until instant recall iv is done in order to queue up eidetic memory i but you have 2 options queue up another skill until it will be convenient for you to change it or log on to change it when instant recall iv is done just like you would have had to prior to the skill queueyour idea has some merit im not going to say its a bad idea but im not seeing implementation as likelythe skill queue is a serious improvement it means you dont have to sit online for 4 hours while you train a bunch of skills to level 1 it means that you can set most skills to start up to 24 hours before the previous skill finishes making 400 am alarms for skillchanges much less necessaryother candidates may disagree with me but my opinion is that you should mostly just be thankful for the skill queue as it currently isgarthran
kids these days dont know theyre born tbh in my day we didnt have a skill queue or double training speed for new characters or a fancy pants tutoriali do feel your pain sometimes but thats just the way it goes the skill queue is an amazing system and i think ccp didnt want the process to be completely automated and afk youre still going to have to wait to learn the good stuff im afraid
this was already raised on the assembly hall i fully agree with you  something this fundamental to the game really ought to be given the easiest ui possible not the log in at 4 am nonsense of yore  but this is the wrong forum and redundant
good luck
im the best

friendly bump no really havent you all heard goons and kenny are napped

i get the feeling im being trolled but just in casedont you ever read patch notes or look in the game development forum ships get tweaked in almost every patch recent examples being the naglfar falcon and rook and stealth bombers stealth bombers in particular were quite drastically changed the problem with the current afs is that they are very expensive for a frigate hull yet dont receive the 4 bonuses that all other t2 ships get making an even more expensive version is a terrible solution and there is no precedent for that kind of approach to balancing
supported concept is good but the devil is in the details
i would like to lend support for this topic the assault frigates need their rightful forth bonus granted i dont know what it would be ive only flown the enyo and ishkur during my carrer and the ishkur recentlyi would try like a combat utility and ecm drone bonus for the ishkur but even that might be too much
yeah they are really underpowered
not trolling you just stating my opinion out of principle things in a persistent world should not be changed unless absolutely necessary a poorly designed ship could easily be succeeded by a new improved version whose advantages are actually worth the slightly highere price or it could be succeeded by a new much cheaper version profiting from a significant production shortcut getting things in balance as wellmind your solution is clearly simpler and more conventional but i just dont think it is the best way to introduce change into a virtual world
full aggression penalties should be applied
absolutely valid dual flagging to can owner and destroyer of ship looks like valid solution
i can see what these guys are trying to say to a point however i do not believe the solution is completely valid if operating in high sec it is a fact that concord does not allow one to destroy another pilots ship without them getting involved even if that person is a loot thief you do not have the right to attack them without concord intervention except in the case if it is your loot because you just got wacked bye someone blowing someone up does not mean you now own their stuffone crime does not allow another crime to be valid it does seem though that the crime of stealing is somewhat being allowed without much risk so what is there to be done how about all crimes in high sec be considered felonies so to speak thus allowing all pilots to utilize citizen arrest for crimes blowing up offenders ship attacking someone you flash red to all stealing from someone you flash red to all a war dec nullifies all involvement from concord and standard citizens meaning if someone comes along and steals loot from the wreck of someones war target they in essence are making themselves war targets by getting involved in the disputei guess what it boils down to is the policy does seem to need some reexaming to determine what is fair and balanced for everyone
absolutely but if youre gonna plan a robbery you have to also plan your escape and how dangerous it becomes getting away from the scene also
signedposs need a change and they need it badif this has been on the table for nigh 3 years now csm has absolutely no excuse not to bring it to ccps attention

yeah as the system is now there is no point in spending money on the covetor as you can spend those instead of the exhumer skill and go for a hulk instead which is superior to the covetor in all ways due to its way more stronger defensive abilities cargohold and mining yieldthats why we now whine to have the covetor fixed to make it once again usefull and a valid upgrade from the retriever
user interfaceissue confirmation on cancel market order
supportedhowever make all belts exploration sites meaning all belts have to be probedadd minable comets that actually orbit the system
as someone who is rather underwhelmed by the fact that all the training ive done to utilize increasingly specialized forms of mining technology only gets me a few more percentage points in yield per hour i offer complete support to all the changes proposed by the opthe idea of using a survey scanner to see which asteroids have the best density of the type of ores you are looking for and picking those asteroids to mine while ignoring those of lesser quality makes far more sense than the current method whereby you simply vacuum up every pebble in sight because theres no significant variation between them moving from belt to belt as you clear them of recentlyspawned gravel until you are out of time or fall asleep from boredomanalyzing a massive boulder consisting of a multitude of strata including different ores in varying richness picking the crystals appropriate for harvesting the ore or ores that are most useful or profitable to you and deciding when to stop mining those ores from a certain body  not when your mining laser finds it a pale shadow but when you decide that the yield youre getting has fallen below the point of profitability  would make a far more interactive system of mining than the current system which encourages macromining due to the sheer repetitiveness and lack of decisionmaking involved and add to that the idea of having to locate these large asteroids in the first place some of which may have been passed over by other fellow miners due to a poor composition or other reasons and you might even achieve a bit of excitement once in a while when you scan some unprepossessing rock and suddenly realize that youve struck gold and will be raking in valuable ore at a rate approaching the theoretical maximum yield of your mining systems for an extended period of timesupport
why arent you running for csm for the last month or so i have mined more or less everyday in the same stationless 05 khanid system so naturally i mine the same belts keeping my own mining spreadsheet i have noticed a trend now these are the numbers ive pulled for fiery kernite5794 7097 7097 7097 4545 7097 4545 2787 7097 2787 5794 7083 2787these are the numbers for dense veldspar55558 39415 60536 10272 60536 10272 29324 60535 10273 21993 46052 60535 10273 46052 55558 20200notice how i have the exact same numbers pop up again and again fker 7097 5 times 4545 twice 5794 twice 2787 three timesas i jetcan mine the numbers for dense veldspar are less similar as it tends to overflow into the next jetcan and i input the two different values as opposed to putting in the day amount but even so 6053560536 4 times 46052 twice 55558 twiceif its at the point where i am mining not only the same belts but precisely the same roids then yes mining needs an overhaulif i was completely and utterly anal i could keep a spreadsheet that showed each individual roid and setup a plan to mine each roid from most profitable to least profitable warping from precise bookmark to precise bookmark to mine one or two roids then move to the next till all veld in the system is gone then scor then ker with my orcahauler keeping up behind me no need to worry about a tank no need to worry about drones id only be spending 2 or three minutes in each bookmark anywaywith that kind of precise and complete predictability where is the incentive not to macroend rant 1begin rant 2also i would like to add that there is a need for greater diversity in mining ships only six ships in total and two support ships not to mention that the retriever and hulk are the only ones used except mackinaws with ice miningif i fly missions or 00 blob then i have a choice of 6 frigates 4 crusiers and 3 battleships per race plus at least 1 tech 2 per ship and then add in faction variaties and i have at least 30 ships per race to fly around in then add in support logistics and command ships and that blows out to 40 ships per race each with its own specific purpose and bonuses so i can have a highly specialised 00 blob flying aroundrather than just having ore as the beallandendall of mining maybe we could have 1 or 2 other npc mining factions with bpobpcs that have bonuses to specific types of roid like a skiff has 60 to merc per level maybe we could have one that was 10 to veld per level and they should have a different skill tree so that miningbarge and exhumer belong to ore ships but for example high sec specialists frigate and high sec specialists crusier belong to the high sec specialists ships separate and distinct from ore skill tree we could also have mining modules and euipment made by another 1 or 2 different npc corps ore cant possible be the only corp in the eveverse that has a stake in miningsorry if i got a bit off topic from the op got a bit caught up in it wow only 668 characters left
never having tried the missiles post patch because everyone said they were broken i caved and created a torp phoon for pvp the thing has the potential for awesome dps with torp spec 4 against slow to stationary targets while shooting a stationary geddon a single torp was hitting for about 300 damage per missile sweet then the geddon started to move webbed down to about 45ms and moving parallel to my ship my torps began for hitting for 76 a friggin torp the whole time my autocannons were hitting for a constant damage stationary or moving about 45ms well minus those barely hit shotsmoral of the story is missiles need a revision

raised this issue a month ago and it was voted down by the current csm as they didnt consider it important enoughonce erik gets elected im sure hell make a second issue of this and take it with him to iceland though if it doesnt get voted down by ignorant csm again
lol csm against fw support what a hell  why  because fw fix need hardwares from 00 i guess csm work for players not for againstand yes 1 signed against fw lag
because none of the other csm have much of a clue about fw besides what i told them and because they believe it when ccp said were working on fixing the lag despite fw players seeing no results for the past 5 monthsthe thing that bothers me is that some fw still dont want to vote for the csm erik and heartstone are the fw candidates with erik having my preference and thus yet another batch of 00 hobos are likely to get voted in dont expect any fw issues to be raised if that happens

given
why dont we remove moderation completely from coad
the approach i raised during the 1st csm was to have a selfmoderation system whereby players awarded a value to individual ops and replies eg 15 stars players who accurately rated good posts got more weighting to their stars up to a max of range 15 players who consistently rated poor content as good got less weighting to their stars down to a rating of 001 to 005n00b characters got a 0 weighting on their scores until they rated eg 200 postsany user can filter based on certain star ratingstaking this rating and weighting of your rating principle you could further refine the calculation model to handle more complex attempts to abuse the system eg alliancecorps have 0 weighting and 0 gain on rating posts by their own alliancecorp membersplayers rating threads that are later locked get their rating reduced to noob level againweighting for each player is perforum so someone uber on market forum doesnt mean uber on caodim sure you can thing of some more simple rulesthe whole weighting could be calculated offline and applied enmass it might not even need to be as complex as requiring weighting if just the alliancecorp 0 value thing was used once the model was right that would pretty much enable players to clean it up
as often as this seems to come up and the major issue most people have against it is the visual identification of tech two ships it would seem that the simple answer is if you dont want to see custom ships you dont have too i started playing this game with premium graphics and when i loaded eve to my laptop and noticed my comet had writing on it i was bummed out that it didnt have it in the updated skins the only explanation i could think of for making the navy comet less cool was that it was eventually going to be allowed to be customized most games have some ability to customize and with the release of t3 ships we see a really cool ability to customize a ship based on how you build it in other mmos you change your armour and it changes it on your character i always thought that it would be cool if the iteron started as a long ship with a cockpit section and a drive section and that cargo modules could be added to the middle to make it longer something very much like what is done with the t3 cruisers for the most part but not having any way to make something reflect you seems to limit the fun factor everyone likes to customize even a little i want my vexors to be black with green and yellow accents all dark in colour that would be wicked stamping it with a cooperate logo would be cool as well for some reason i highly doubt that it would be tough to do and for those that complain that the visual identification of a t2 ship is more important just add the button to turn it off were not all pirates or 00 combatantsanother thing i noticed was a request to have a mark to show who made the ship maybe if something like this was in say the notes section with the logo of the constructing corp with a link to the corps info would be kinda cool and wouldnt be visually detracting on the shipoh and no i dont agree with hello kitty geddons though they look wicked outside the game i dont know that they are needed in the game
we are pod pilots after all it would seem that perhaps we want to stand out differently than all the others i agree that some form of customizing should be implemented
while not exactly new this has alwas been a good idea however thats what the op is an idea not a proposal if you want this to be taken seriously as a proposal to the csm develop and expand your thoughts based on the discussion and feedack in this thread make sure you find out what compromise a majority of posters would agree on then propose a clean set of features you would like to see implementedconsidered by the csm and ccpwhat i would support corp and alliance logos on two fixed spots per ship a small selection of colour schemespatterns per ship a choice of two colours from an 8 or 16 bit palette display of custom colours and logos both optional and independent paint job loads on grid at lowest possible priority making sure that t2 ships still looked clearly more advanced than their t1 counterparts by having neater patterns and cooler normal mapsreflectionswhateveras to the sceptics you are not forced to see what you dont wish to see simply uncheck the box  distinguishing ship classes by their colour is just lazy no sensible captain would colour hisher ship to suit your ease of targetting this proposal will not cause increased lag unless your local pc cannot handle it in which case i suggest you reduce your settings if humankind ever freely and individually travels the stars as thry do in eve you can bet they will colour their ships most obnoxiously no matter how harsh and gritty their lives  i expect the work to develop such a feature would take no more than one hour per ship and some more to come up with an interface and qa the whole thing not exactly huge amounts for a feature many players have been clamoring for ever since the beta
almost a year has passed since the introduction of factional warfare numerous issues about fw problems have been raised through the csm and the player community have provided hundreds of helpful suggestions and discussions on improvements to the state of fw despite all this nothing has been done about fw since its introduction despite all of ccps promises before and after fws introduction features that were not complete at release still lie broken and unfinished and numerous promises made before fw launch are still unmet consequences to system occupancy unique missions where player standing affects outcome unique rewards obtained only through fw etcnow with the caldari almost occupying all of gallente space and theyll have it all by the time this issue gets through it would be nice if ccp revisits fwanother point that frustrates many fw players is the fact that ccp doesnt seem to have any interest in fixing bugs and problems related to fw the lag is a constant problem and weve had promises that it would be fixed soontm for the past 5 months now since apocrypha players exploit a bug in the cloaking mechanics to easily capture the npc plexes and ccp does nothing to fix it and so far has not even declared it an exploit complexes still dont spawn as intended despite this issue being brought up in january alliances still cannot participate in fw while the csm has raised this issue since the beginningcsm3 should take this issue to iceland and convince ccp to allocate a higher priority to fixing fw problems and properly finish fw instead of leaving it to rot in its current prenerfed and incomplete statesome related issuesunfinished expansionsshort list of problems with the game mechanicsthird time alliances in fw had to be brought up
supported something needs to be done about fw
i support this
well they do whine a lot
i dont care if it is erik or heartstone or whoever else makes it on the csm after the elections fw must be discussed in iceland
supportedweve been fobbed off too many times
fw is in dire need of a complete rethink and overhaul it needs better objectives better rewards and better consequences
i wish ccp would for one time go back in time to a feature they released and fix it pls ccp do something about fw its in dire need
im to scared to use real ships in fw anymore because off the lag
its time ccp got fw moving in the right direction again
supported even though i would prefer you were a bit more specific in what youd like to see changed and in what ways instead of clogging your worthy proposal with general complaints and indignation
i totally love the idea of small and little armed structures that generate some sort of wealth trade goods over time if you could go and hackdestroy them and steal that wealth from the sov holding alliance that would be awesome some real targets for roaming ops and it would be cool to take a transport and someone with codebreakers out into enemy territoryi couldnt support this ideas any more
i think need more support because i saw an another csm vote and not changed anything
your mom
i whole heartedly support the idea of hull repair drones infact if is on my short list of like 7 things i would like to see eve get and implementing them would be insanely easy  just copy the data base entries for armor drones and change the skill from remote armor systems to remote hull repair systems and the amount of armor repair to an amount of hullwhich csm candidate supports this
wanted this to be implemented for ages as well as other changes for poss
dont see why not
this topic is not that important for me but i like idea so you have my support
please visit your user settings to reenable imageslook at me im sexy why dont you like mei am at a whim and almost desperate for help i have submitted petitions sent email to a dev i had personal contact with in the past in regards to my mining guide etc i have exhausted all options and i do not see what else i can do so i am hoping a csm can help me move things along somehow it involves alliance logoon january 9th 2009 the logo submission for our alliance wildly inappropriate was accepted by ccps art department one full month before the apocrypha expansion release we had hoped the logo would be included with it it was noton march 1st 2009 a petition was opened to ask what the problem was the first reply came from ccp dev1 wont say his name on march 23rd saying he did not know why it had not been included after a few messages exchanged ccp dev1 wrote the following on april 8th 2009unfortunately i cannot find any reason why it was not added with apocrypha but i have been told that it will be added with apocrypha 11 which is due for release shortlyccp dev2 closed the petition on april 14th 2009 but the logo was never included in the 11 patcha new petition was opened on april 16th 2009 to ask why ccp dev1s statement had not happened as promised on april 23rd 2009 ccp dev1 repliedi am very sorry to hear that this logo has not been included as the logo page stated that wildly innappropriate would have their logo added in this releasei will need to speak to some people and get an update for you and i will do this asapthis was the last we heard of him three weeks later on may 12th 2009 ccp dev3 never heard of him before judging by his skills at getting things done he must be new wrote please accept my sincere apology for this late replywe currently have an issue with our alliance logo submission tool preventing us to review submissionsyet our logo had already been accepted 4 months prior to this it is now may 26th 2009 45 months after the logo was accepted almost 5 months since submission and nothing has been done or changed its clear ccp dev3 has no idea what is going onthere have been 3 patches since apocrypha ccp cant tell us why the logo isnt in the game they say its been accepted and cant find anything wrong with it and five months later they gave us bs about how the review system is broken how and even if it were true the logo was approved in january why does it need to be reviewed againwhat other options do i have isnt it enough players have to supply the game with adequate documentation because ccp failed at it miserably and on top of that we have to fight to get one little png file included in the game for five monthssuffice to say i am disgusted by the sheer incompetence and inability to give me a straight answer i cannot fathom why it would take five months to resolve thisanyone knows
how about you submit it again
posting to confirm wi are logoless and should not be
logo i want it and i want it nowno not truei wanted it 6 months ago
we have hottest logo that youve never seen help spread the love ccp
its also a damn good logo too so it adds another small point of value to the ccp eve product to get it into the game for every subscriber to enjoy it makes commercial sense oh yes
as much as i dont like wi i must agree with this overdue logo justice
the petition latest one is still open and i keep getting the same replies from applefail
thisi demand our logo ingame now
ccp give us our logo
why wont someone think of the children
honorablewe as players of this game do understand how sometimes things can go wrong with running a game such as eve i personally am always a supporter of ccp when it comes to bugs and things that can arise running something of this scale however with that being said i too am at a loss as to why our logo just cant seem to make it in the game the amount of times the ball has been dropped with this situation has finally reached silly levels please give us our logo
bump bump
we have waited our due time ccp needs to learn how to look over the cubical and talk to the guy next to him
logo now
logo please come on we want the lady to show up
yeah wat they said
sexy red head wanted and not lady mctiglogo please ccp or well ransack iceland
such a nice logo cmon ccp make us happy
logo justice for all
ccp must hate us logo plz
sort it out
leggo my logo
logo logo logo we want our logo freedommmmmmm for logoooooos
been in this alliance since the beginning the amount of work and thought that went into making this logo has been an endeavor accpeted by ccp only to be forgotten and lost in a whirlwind of incompetance make good on your word and make your customers happy if you say you will do something then do it if not dont make promises you cant keep implement the logo asap
give us logo or give us death
logo designers of the world unite i had the great pleasure of creating the honda accords logo and theres a certain great swell of pride that comes with seeing it finally make it in game although similarly they took something on the order of half a year to get that in game toothis good mans mining guide got me start in eve over a year ago give him his most excellent logo
i want our sexy logo yesterday
gief logo please
i have an idea seen as we have exhausted every other option and ccp clearly fail at fixing issues abrakadabra  nope that didnt workguess its down to ccp come on guys fix it  you know you want to in fact i reckon you should create a patch solely for this as compensation and to restore our faith in your cough abilityand yay i cant jump through gates again without crashing woot
1 fail for cpp i think theyre going for the record
thats one hell of runaround for a simple thing like a logo yet in the meantime our symbol of identity as an alliance is denied for months what kind of support is that id say less than none at all
ccp wtf is wrong with you si want my logo or i gonna find you all inside the game and pod you all with bpos t2 inside or not
gif logo to me
whilst i can understand alliance logos are not up there on the devs priorities they nonetheless have included them for other alliances in a reasonable time frame i really cant see why it would take this long to sort and it doesnt seem like usual channels are working do we have to get the entire dev team drunk at fanfest to ensure this happens or something please can we at least have this put in front of someone with actual ability to resolve the issue so we can all get on with oggling at our gorgeous logo
a classroom full of first year veterinary students were participating in their first day of anatomy class for the lecture the professor begins by unveiling a dead cow under a white sheet laying on an operating tablethe professor tells the class in veterinary medicine there are two qualities you must possess as a doctor  the first of which is a strong stomach you cannot under any circumstance be disgusted by anything involving an animals bodyfor example the professor pulls back the sheet and sticks his finger right up the dead cows butt pulls out his finger and sticks it in his mouth the students just standthere paralyzed at what they see now go ahead and do the same thing each of you the professor saysfreaked out the students take several minutes but eventually take turns sticking their fingers up into the anal cavity of the dead cow and then sucking on them once everyone is finished the professor continues on with his lesson now the second important quality you must possess is a keen observation you see i stuck in my middle finger up the cows butt and i sucked on my index finger now learn to pay attention ccp
this new intro isnt horrible it teaches you a bit about eve and explains different career paths you can takebut it lacks what the old one had it made you excited to play eve the old one really showed you how huge eve was while the new one says if you are manipulative then you can become a good diplomatso i propose we bring the old introduction back and have the new one play whenever someone creates a character and when it is done you can go into the actual character creation
hooray for the old intro
zillionbackstory should be there 
not supported
not supporting this proposalid actually would like another solution to the bigger issue you portray make high end mining more profitable by adding some of the rare moon minerals as an by product of the mined ores this will have to be balance to not ruin the moons as the profitability of them gives reasons for fight but it has to be balanced so that t2 ships will be more affordable again
currently ships are nerfed and occasionally boosted as a result of whining on the forum i am proposing a better method based upon the assumption that all ships within a class eg hac or battlecruiser should be equally popular if one ship is much more popular than others like the falcon was until recently then it should be nerfedccp should monitor how popular each ship is  how many are built  then every week adjust each ship to boost the unpopular ships and nerf the popular agility and hit points would be automatically adjusted until all ships are equally popular if after 6 weeks with a 10 boost to both agility and hp a ship is still less popular then another ship of the same class which has had a 10 nerf to its agility and hp then ccp should take some other action like changing a ship bonusauto balancing should only apply to popular ships  t1 frigates to bs t2 frigates and cruisers it is important that people can switch between ships of the same class if people can only fly ships of one race then ship popularity does not have much significance
while a good idea i think it would make it a total pain for the market in general with demand comes supply and constantly shifting the demand would cause people to hoarde ships and when balance swapped to less popular ships for builders prices to skyrocket on top of that a lot of ships are geared for specific tasks that arent always relevant to combat
equality through mediocrity almost always a bad appproach no support
this is a bad idea no not just a bad idea its a really bad idea in fact its one of the worse ideas i have ever read on this forum and thats saying somethingpeople get upset now when the devs tweak things every 6 months or so just think of the excrement storm that would happen if the devs tweaked once a weekheck why not just come out and say for every race there is only one type of frigate bc bs command ship recon cov ops etc and be done with it this will save the devs from tweaking every week and get all the whining out of the way in one sitting this might actually get rid of a lot of lag when a lot of people leave cause the choice for ships has been drastically reduced two birds one stone so to speak
i see why you want it but i dont think its the right approach hp and agility arent always the right things to balance and forcing balance to be done by autoadjusting those stats could lead to some really perverse situations what we want is for the devs to do it a bit quickerthough not too much there is such a thing as overcorrection not for it to be taken out of their hands
i hate ur face
except the popularity of a ship is absolutely no indicator of whether its wellbalanced or not
popularity is the worst type of indicator of balancing how blindly ignorant can you getthats like saying one week frigates are the new bling bling and then shuttleslets try using our heads before we post ideas ok
heres a thought  lets toss out all the ships but oneno more problems
you mean this isnt how they do it nowminmatar popular  speed nerffalcons popular  ew nerfwatch out we amarr are next 
that would be a valid argument for removing the probes form the directional scanner entirely but that is not an excuse for a bad interface affecting gameplay currently you can see probes on the directional scanner but cannot do so and use filtering at the same time this is silly and would be a relatively easy fixbumped and supported
serenity steele from evemapscom just sent an email to their database that is not canspam act compliantid hate to see this candidate get benefit from this illegal actioni like their maps they might be good people but breaking the law to get votes in a computer game is wrongamong other faults no unsubscribe link was included
the email also contains links which say such apparently neutral things as do not let your voice go to waste  vote that when clicked appear to directly cast a vote for steele rather than leading merely to the voting page so it seems hes being grossly dishonest in addition to annoying the hell out of us with his unsolicited spamsays a lot about the candidate imho
this canidate needs to be stoppedpunished they might be a good people but this was not a good movei dont look forward to the spamfest next election if this gets allowed
well he abused my faith in providing his website with his email i signed up for the outpost alerts which i have stopped receiving it seems long ago
so thats what it is so its not even an active doubleoptin listthis guy seriously need to get acquainted with his antispam laws
did he ask for approval to direct link the vote submissionplease do not discuss this on the forums  mitnal
i can understand if you take issue to me using the evemaps mailing list because it doesnt relate to directly to the map book i had diverse reactions from i already voted for you to good luck to your reaction please consider the following in your judgement it is my own emailing list and domain name i used for my own csm campaign to promoting my avatarauthor of the book its the only message not related directly to the maps ive sent in 3 years the email is from my private email address on the domainin my first campaign i appended my campaign message to the bottom of an outpost alert email rather than making a dedicated email about it like the first time ill use more discretion in the futureit is legalfor the points about it being illegal this is incorrectthe can spam act refers to commercial messages which my email was not and it explicitly states the fccs ban also does not cover noncommercial messages such as messages about candidates for public office  regardless of the nonrequirement  you signedup to my mailing list the subject clearly stated eves future vote for serenity steele it was clear who the email was from the email has a valid reply address you can unsubscribe on the site or simply reply youre right i didnt add a specific unsubscribe link as it was from me personally  my badit is not trick codethe email contains 3 external references my avatar
i wasnt going to vote at all and then i got his email so i start thinking about the great work he did with the maps and thought why not but instead of following the link i opened the csm candidate list on the eve website to check out the other candidates after that i voted for serenity with my both accounts its said that everybody complains when someone allegedly does something wrong but nobody notices when someone surelly does something right good job serenity steele
as far as i can see from his post he did nothing wrong however i do worry that other candidates might use trickery such as that described earlier to get people to vote without their consent
ive had a friend in goonswarm claim that when he tried to vote for erik it was told that he had already voted when hes sure he has notworth investigating
drugs are bad mkay
wasnt she dutch
i think we should ban goonswarm for thisthanks for all the tips for my next csm run guys
what if your tax returns contained a leaflet for the major ruling partyccp should remove serenity steele from the candidates list for pulling a stunt like thisvoting should be based on the ideals of candidates and not mis usage of an in game service
government is supposed to be impartial eve maps is not those two situations are not comparable and this stunt is no worse than vote for me because im a girl vote for me because ill bribe you or any of a dozen other stunts csm candidates pull all the time i think its a bit sleazy but not enough to really influence my voteeven if i hadnt already voted for myself bring it to the attention of people who will care sure but its not even close to on par with including political literature in tax documents
you bring up a good point and another candidate brought up one as well im not going to say who to maintain impartiality to my commentsfirst of all the majority of eve players that ive met dont give a flying stick about who is elected for various reasons dont care dont believe in the system believe its a ccp conspiracy etc etc etc im one of the rare people who actually took the time to review every single candidate with a web link on the voting page this should be a hint to future candidates spending a good few hours with each one to see who is the best because it took over 24 hours i decided to make an entire mailing list that was 20 mails deep which covered the redeaming features of my ten most favorite candidates and forwarded its access to all my friends corporation alliance and allied corpsalliances for them to make an informed decisionmost people wont take the time to do it and thus ive come to the realization that the system is broken if it takes me 24 hours to speak with just above half of the candidates then i can guarantee that the majority of people on eve wont take the time to make an informed decision instead voting along corporate lines goonswarm pandemic legion band of brothers for example will get someone in guaranteed as long as they have fullalliance support by the candidates home country the coolness of their avatar or simply clicking the candidate at the top of the list another complaint of minesure there are those that spam emails to vote for them ive seen another offer isk however i have come to the conclusion that it is necessary because unless ccp and the csm find a way to make voting more appealing or mandatory these underhanded methods are here to stay and i dare say i encourage it especially for those who are from a small corporation are in npc corporations and those who have no backing except for their charmsthe only way i can see voting to become more popular is to move the entire process ingame make an ingame applet for voting have ingame ccplead debates have ingame candidate question periods have eve radio maintain its interviews of candidates upgrade the voting page to include a summary of the persons platform rather than just the name avatar and corp of the person and their webpage and most importantly have the candidate list randomize in order for every time someone accesses the voting pagemaybe then well see even better participation so before picking on ss or any other candidate about using underhanded tactics for votes ask yourself this question if they did not use these underhanded tactics would you have voted for the majority that answer would be no unfortunately
damn i know im a bore but id really like some answers ye who care to advance the cause of mmo democracy
in the context menu for market orders cancel and modify are positioned right next to each other on the top of the menu this will occasionally lead to unintended cancellations in the slight lag that happens when a transaction is registered causing the entire orders view to updatethe suggestion is then to add a confirmation popup to the cancel option of course with the usual nevershowthiswindowagain checkbox for those who want the old behaviour
as long as its optional yes
yes
note this was intended te posted under my main character jalxanrecently i came across a very akward frustrating and scary situation while fighting in a war with my alliance it was two wartargets against myself in a scorpion and an alliance member in a command ship the battle was going well we had almost taken down one of the two wartargets however the second wartarget launched drones against my shipintentionally also because i was an ecm ship i was far away from the fight because i had smartbombs for the intention of taking out enemy drones i intentionally kept at least 15km away from neutral shipping this was a calculated riskhowever when the enemy sent his drones after me one of my allys drones followed them i did not see it enter my firing solution until it was too late in the end it blew me up and i took a massive standings hit for killing my allys drone ship and pod though ccp fixed the lattermy issue isnt to do with the standings but rather the entire friendly fire mechanic first of all ive noticed that corporations are not affected by friendly fire in terms of concord response however alliance members are in an odd difference i believe this is to prevent griefing alliances from shooting down new corporations in a large scale form of wreck and asset lootinghowever i have an idea that would not only fix that but also fix other situations where this is debilitating say those who want to test their tanks or have a duel it goes something like thistwo players two corporations two alliances or any combination of the three wish to shoot amonst each other to do so they do the following1 both parties set each other to 10 5 standings in other words eve considers both parties to be best friends2 one party sends a concordsanctioned criminal imunity or some sort of lingo request to the other which the other party has to acceptonce this is done both parties may shoot at each other this way if two alliances are at war with one target they can accidentally shoot one another with area of effect weapons or even have a planned skirmish for example when i was arranging my alliance to have a rookieship war competition or have a duel against one person the list goes on the point is is that both parties can shoot one another this request would cost nothing and have no maintenance cost unlike the war decloration and will also last as long as both sides have consentto prevent this mechanic from causing griefing every person within the agreement two players a member from either corporation or a member from either alliance can click a cease concordsanctioned criminal immunity button which will end the immunity for anyone involved any person within this immunity will get a warning message stating that the immunity has been revolked and that any further actions will cause a swift concord response in addition all weapons in each participants ship will get a serverside deactivation of all offensive module cycles to prevent weapons from maintaining their fire if doing so and finally the concord response will be delayed for a short period to allow noninstant weapons to hit their mark smartbombs missiles etcas i said this will solve many problems and will also make corporationlevel griefing obsolete as well the mutual standings requirement is a safeguard to protect one person from accidentally accepting a mutual pvp request if one accepts a request with their mutual standings at 5 or 10 whichever is accepted then theres no real excuse if that person loses their ship especially without knowing
voting no based on the title i already know this is a bad idea sorryedit ok you posted nowthe idea is fine but its kind of like telling someone how to build a wrist watch when they ask what time it is why shouldnt you just be able to have friendly pew pew with your alliance mates is the above mentioned griefing really so prevalent no youre a doo doo head fail failfailfailfepicepicfailepicfailepicfailpicepifaile
finished sorry about the posting frakupi ask you to read the finished proposal please i know its a touchy subject but i think its worth reading
just read the title and kinda figured what you want to propose we dont want to turn this game into wow
crappy title yesstupid idiot assuming proposal is hinged on the title alone hilarious level of epic failnessop should change title or youll have even more morons making the same conclusionsupported only if alliance friendly fire is permitted during wardec and only in that case
okay what do you suggest i can still change italso thanks for the vote of confidence
best i could come up with would be issuealliance friendly fire during wardec causes concord
hmm perhaps that could work thanks 
logos rule and we want the logo please sir can we have more
no opting out eve is a pvp game from market to industry to combat all pvp
aye
of course it is and controlling intell is a valuable pvp tactic no one can limit or control what people post to private killboards this is as it should be theres even a good deal of false information out there the creation of a 100 accurate and official killboard would provide way too much easy intell
definitely not
i agree with verone
what happened to this
bigger is better
coad is a place all alliances come together and talk it should be a section of the forums dedicated to free speechif one alliance want to make assshats of themselves let them people will quickly see who are the mature of the bunch in evemy proposal is to lighten severly moderation of coadmoderators will only remove personal attacks ographic pictures etc
remove alt posting and you get my voteanyone who posts with a stupidly obvious alt name like that should be shot for there arrogancepost with your mainidiotin before flame fest
yes lets make caod even worse than it already isno thats a terrible idea
while i agree that coad should be a place where alliances should be able to get together and discuss with one another what goes on in their now is not discussion  its crapclean up coad and then we can discuss changing its moderation policies
it would be tremendously bad business for ccp to allow something like the gatebug persist for very long yes but as i interpreted it the central matter of this thread is the proposal of a clearer forum structure for providing ccp with feedback
if ccp has bad communication then all the rest of the companies have no communication whatsoeverin fact i think that ccp devs go forward with more stuff and in more ways than any other company out there
exactlythe argument is not that ccp is worse than other people it is that the communication could be improved
it is a big problem i started a trial account recently to check out some of the new training time bonuses and and try some fits the rookie channel was so busy that it was almost impossible to read or respond to anything
would suggest that those voting in this thread go vote in this thread which was created earlier
make high end mining more profitable by adding some of the rare moon minerals as an by product of refining the mined ores this will have to be balance to not ruin the moons as the profitability of them gives reasons for fight so although profitability will go dow they still have to be rare and worth fighting for the goal is to balance t2 modules and especially ships to an affordable level 10 mill for a interceptor and 80 mill for a hac prices of course are open for discussion
bump
not gonna happen if ccp tried to apply any logic to electronicsecm then the bigger ships that have more space for larger more powerful computer control systems would actually lock faster than anything smaller not vice versa
i do not agree with the op not only does sensor strength all ready work this out but a blackbird jamming a bs still needs other ships to attack said bs to actually take him down even a scorpion jamming another bs is going to have to be fitted awesomely and have good luck to take out another bs by himself the ecm ships are good at what they do jamming but their offense is poor at best i think it works out in the end and then add drones to the mess and its a whole new ball game
supported also put more upbeat songs in versus ambient pedit in some music i cant find on the jukeboxgallente thememission02mission 3mission 4mission 5dronei know there is more p
i would like to see these added to the jukebox too
i completely agree that lowsec is a total wasteland most of the time but the majority player population living in highsec has no incentive to venture into no mans land just to become easy bait for roving squads of overpowered playersive composed an idea as a starting point on how to balance low sec territories in empire space that adds some rp value to the game as well as making a small compromise to benefit players wishing to explore

actually this was the time that the skill queue was taken to a csm meeting with jade as principal supporter it was voted through to a ccpcsm meeting and at that meeting given high priority ccp agreed to examine the skill queue and explore ways for implementation csmccp meeting minutes eight months later a skill queue was introduced with the march 2009 expansion in programming terms given the other hurdles to overcome ghost training etc this is quick implementationare you saying that you repreated raised this issue despite the csm assigning it high priority and ccp agreeing to examine it in depth and obviously find a solutiongiven that you have stated elsewhere in the forums that players that forum post arent the sort erik should be responding to can you enlighten me as to how he will discusssupportpropose issues on the forums or can you confirm that this will be your responsibility as take care party will be elected with erik being the representative this csm term

sorry take care no troll intended edited to correctcould you point out the factual errors of my post regarding skill queue all the information is easily obtained via the evewiki and forum postsadditionally can you address the last part of my post i am considering voting but would need to be assured that erik will be active in the forums as csm rep and not have a spokesperson doing this task
first of all the skill queue was given a mediumhigh priority by the csm not higha lot more went on behind the scenes than can be found on these forums for example it reads from the minutes that noah ccp indicated ccps awareness of the player frustrations with the 6 hour duration skill trainings however ccp strongly believes that switching skill training is an activity that encourages players to log into the game and playthis is the part where my contribution comes into play changing ccps perception of this matter and proving that players are not logging in and playing more due to having to change skillsi did some research and wrote a document about this its a bit long but the conclusion is already reflected in the mk2 issue it basically is that people are just inconvenienced by the skill completion time and if they log in at an inconvenient time they only do so to change the skill not to play in addition players used to be very selective in what skill to train if they wanted to train skill a and b they would not because these skills happened to end at an inconvenient time so instead they would train skill c which is a skill they did not want as much just because it happened to complete at a certain timeof course csm1 raised the issue it was the first issue of the csm and it was supported by everyone however ccp repeatedly said to the csm that theyll look into the issue but then either doesnt implement it at all or give it such a low priority that it still hasnt seen any resources allocated to it this happens with highpriority issues as well thus it was extra important to remove any reservations ccp might have had towards the skill queue which i considered one of the most important issues at that timeid appreciate it if that was truly your intention but i have serious doubts regarding your consideration due to you calling us the take credit party which is what larkonis and supporters call us and directly referring to my response to a post by larkonis which was removed by a moderator due to trolling
thanks for the response can you point me in the direction of the relevant paperwork from the evewiki it reads as if the csm1 raised issue gave it priority and ccp then worked on a solution and implemented it within the yearjust because my question may have been percieved to be from someone you may not likeagree with does that make the question any less valid i read the posts from all parties including yours and am seriously wondering about this question
sure its part of the documentation that i havent wikified yet ill dig it up when i get homewell its one of the reasons why take care conducts most of its discussions with the players ingame or through email forum debates tend to be circular and require much more time while leaving too much room for intentional misinterpretation of the things saidbetween this post and my last one ive had conversations with three people in game already discussing factional warfare the corpalliance ui supercaps 00 improvements walking in stations and many other topics during my time on the csm ive had hundreds of emails to my private address regarding eve features and issues and evemail from at least 500 different players not to mention all the people that started conversationsi think answering those players and discussing with them is more productive than nitpicking at some forum where a lot of people are just looking for a cheapshot at their perceived opponents a lot of players unfortunately avoid these forums due to the hostile attitude and trolling here but that doesnt make their issues any less valid take care doesnt ignore the forums we just use alternative means of communication to complement it means which are easily accessible to everyone as id say that for a lot of people sending an evemail has a lower barrier to participation than posting at these forums
the forum however is a public discussion of ideas and views since the csm are a publicly elected body and their dealings are supposed to be open doesnt it make sense that the forums are the logical place to conduct discussions evemails tend to be between two parties forums between manymy question was whether erik or a tc spokesperson you or another will be doing the forum postingdiscussion if elected onto csm considering the opinion of the forum you have expressed
issues have to be on the forum for a minium of 7 days of discussion before the csm is even allowed to raise it so anything we do will have to be public and open for discussion which we will actively participate in were currently working out the stucture with the advisors if we will have regularly scheduled meetings they will either be public where people can join in the channel or well release minutes afterwards we want to be an open organisation not some club of elitists that meets behind closed doors
wtf are you two freaks going absolutely nuts now you start off with very basic knowledge of eve requiring you to hire advisers to raise you to a level a regular experienced csm candidate has now instead of getting good advisors non constructive  mitnaloh and for gloating over the skill queue its nothing people really needed and you didnt have to push anything any other csm candidate would vote for it
issues have to be on the forum for a minium of 7 days of discussion before the csm is even allowed to raise it so anything we do will have to be public and open for discussion which we will actively participate incan i infer from the above comment that it may not be erik as csm rep commenting on issues and such raised in assembly hall and jita park forums advisors or nominated spokepersons from take care may be performing this role
erik is anks catspaw there was never any real pretense otherwise hopefully erik will actually try and be a good candidate when he is on the csm
at the meetings in iceland are you going to have some sort of batphone to communicate with ankheriojwporewr or will you try to memorize enough material that you can try to present and defend an idea as though it was your own
i am assuming that this has to be some sort of rule the take care party has created for itself for issues they choose to raise i can tell you this was definitely not enforced in csm iiissler
a final thanks to everyone that participated in the csm proccess thanks to the other candidates for your promise to participated a council member and thanks to the players that took the time to find a candidate and support them with your voteissler
its not over yet i think i just voted for you mainly because of your name and location however after seeing this thread im glad i voted for you as your platform is agreeable
doesnt matter how but somehow it should still be possible to gain a tii bpoit is that it just make think it is silly that we can travel to star systems do all nasty stuff like travel far faster then light and cloning and and and but when it comes to produce a tii bpo we cant because why i dont know

being a solo mission runner my main concern is mission thieves they irritate me to no end the last thing i need is someone stealing my salvage i dont want someone to ask for it its mine not theirs any ideas on possibly at least discouraging this behavior any idiot can do it with a few days training
i have already addressed this topic actually in a post in this same thread
sorry palanna i missed your post before thanks for your support
voted for you as you dont sound like an arrogant meglomaniac
sup meridus i made a thread about this in the other section weeks ago because all the candidates failed to mention fw as being a primary concern to them so as it stands that all appear to fail to capture my vote i dont want a half assed attempt but someone that has an fw record of both plexing and pvpings candy asses sitting on capture points and fleeing at the first sign of trouble is not in fw on the same level as itherefore they know nothing about what i want in a candidate 3rd person campaigning is also bs you want my vote you need to speak to me not have someone else talking for you now as for fwpeople say its supposed to be a stepping stone to 00 but thats bs to me 00 is not and should not be the end game of a sandbox game it should be up to the players to determine what they want if you want 00 then go to 00 or join a 00 training alliance they do exist ccp made sure fw was prenerfed and nerfed bad they left it that way and i think thats pathetic in a way i feel this is soe all over again why give us wormholes when the other project is still in serious need of beign fleshed out fw does need rewards but also changes fw should make players want to move out to lowsec not just as part of a fleet or to plex but live out there yet its far easier to live in hisec and go to lowsec for the fight i know cuase thats what i do its not necessarily a bad thing but theres little choice either stay in lowsec and have a much smaller isk flow or spent part of your time in empire and have a greater isk flow i want more to lure me out to lowsec full time why do people go to 00 some say the pvp while most i have met in my time in game say the isk so it makes little sense that 00 has loads of isk to be had as well as pvp empire has isk but virtually no pvp other then ganking and wardecs so why does the inbetween area have less isk then the zero pvp zone but the ability to have the same level of pvp as 00 but without bubbles and titans clearly fw is flawed on the reward aspect its something i have actually argued against but why would an empire expect someone to fight on its behalf for free we arent all mimtards so why treat us as slaves yeah i dont want anyone abusing fw but lets face it 00empire gets abused so its nothing new lets not forget that unlike empire fw is an agreement to be someones target so if people wanted to run fw missions for phat profits then they can bring their shiny cnrs out people will kill them  that right there levels the abusers in ways that are impossible in empire flying 10jumps behind enemy lines is a risk yet theres no reward i liked the idea of fw missions but found how stupid it was not the way it was done but the level of reward was pathetic staying safe in empire and only going 1 or 2 jumps brought far more in rewards then fw missions that is a joke fw missions should be 2 to 3 times greater in the level of reward due to the actual risk involved if players are able to do 100s of fw missions unscathed then thats the fault of the defending milita not game mechanics the player still assumed the risk and had no control of his destination when pulling the mission 00 is a self sustaining enviroment they have a lot more isk and greater ore then fw would it make sense for ccp and players to suggest that 00 players head back to empire to rebuild their wallets absolutely not why is it true for fw players pvp is its own reward sure it is however the same can be said for 00 so lets strip them of their high value moons and rats and great faction drops lets strip them of their morph as well as the best ice in the game if you think thats stupid then ask why fw that is at the very least between 00 and empire has less reward for its risk allow players to have a self sustaining enviroment and they will stay they will find more of a reason to fight other then another km
giving them a reason to stay and the means to stay in fw creates a new home for them a home for those that find empire to be a snooze fest but 00 to be anything but they hoped forto me fw is a lot like what eve should have been to start with 4 large empires fighting it out while giving players room to find their own path if they so choose it empires would not expect people to fight for them for free in rl nations pay their troops they equip them they do not ask them to supply their own weapons mercenaries command huge sums of money for the same job yet in eve people are supposed to fight for free why i dont want some  that joined fw to hide in the furthest corner of empire space and receive isk for zero risk what i do want to see is players bagging some isk in other ways such as kills if you kill a wt of a certain class ship you get a bounty as you would with rats the empire wants us to destroy hostile assets and we dont get free ships so how do you motivate the masses most people are not out for gaining the biggest epeen yeah i said it having the bigger epeen isnt a bad thing nor is it wrong to want to have those bragging rights however most people arent like that as annoying as it is so we need to give them another reason to kill ccp has a doctor in number crunching right get him to find the average value of each ship and come up with a formula for busting that value into a reward to be paid to those that kill it a value that is under average production costs but reasonable enough for players to want it again the reason there should be a bounty is we dont get paid to sit around like npcs we gotta go out there and earn our isk we are supposed to be supplemental forces right if people have to kill for isk t hat is under production costs of their targets they cannot abuse it you could pop 20 frigs that took 200k to make and recieve 100isk for each one if you try to abuse that you end up losing 100k per ship simple enoughright i want to say that i do not need the isk however i cannot speak for other militia members or my targets i can say that people are interested in rewards for their efforts volunteers are few in most fields in rl so it shows how willing people are to do stuff for free its a game sure but the losses are permanent helping people fund their pvp is to help lift pvp up in all aspects of the game it comes down to a question of if you want more carebears in eve or more pvpers make fw increasingly pvp friendly by allowing players to earn their isk outside of empire and you will see the number of pvpers grow keep fw as it is and see the number of pvpers shrink not all disenfranchised fw members will go to 00 for various reasons so even if you want to see fw as a stepping stone to 00 but want to hate on fw or leave it to die on its own just because you are in 00 is to smash your own stepping stone fw could be so much more but ccp doesnt care 00 players also fail to see how it could help their groups out pirates dont see how it can bring them a supply of targets that didnt exist a year ago maybe they do but they dont speak up instead they look down upon fw so it ends up being one big circle jerk that will restore the old status quo and leave eve the lifeless game it was beforehand fw should bring the eve storyline to life without a storyline that is alive we are left with nothing more then 4 flavors of ships with a half assed reason why they are different to begin withblah i could go on about fw but its late
i agree with having to kill the rats in a plex speed tanking it is moronic and makes no sense if you want to remove an enemy you have to find a way to remove them and running around is not a way i disagree that people would be able to farm plexes like missions people will see tasty targets float into the plexes and that will get the pvpers out therequick pvpers having the ability to shoot at farmers is the best way to solve the problem of farmers so give us a reward for capturing plexes in enemy territory its not our fault if the enemy didnt show we still assumed the risk and we still did the job if you get killed or flee before the job is done you get nothing rather balanced to me since the players are the ones to balance it if player were given a bounty for killing wts then there is a motivation to go out and kill no reward no need for the risk id still go but not everyone will we need to look not at the willing but those on the fence i remember reading that in wwi or wwii that only 10 of the troops did 90 of the damage they looked at those 10ers to find ways to make the 90 more like those who wuld fight basically the 10 had less fear and more motivation so motivation fearfight so increasing the motivation increased the numbers of those willing to fight in fw and only fw we attempt to twist that around instead of realizing that the 90 lack the motivation we look for ways to decrease it or stifle the building up of what will motivate why do we wish to flog ourselves do we really have some kind of self administered stigma that we must whip out of ourselves since we are not in 00 but want to pvp 00 does not flog itself for having drone regions officer spawns rare ore and moons worth maintaining a capfleet to defend why the hell should we if people want zero risk and all reward stay in empire and out of milita if you want all of the 00 experience head out there if you want to take losses and have to retreat to empire to rebuild join fw nah that doesnt sound right to me fw should have its own rewards rewards just like empire just like 00 we have our risks so wheres our rewards give us our rewards and we will have many more people out there pvping instead of hiding in empire space from there they can choose if pvpinghiding if so they can stay in fw and get their rewards for their risk and only if they take up the risks or they can go 00 or pirate either way you pull one carebear out and show him what eve has to offer eve is about pvping not just grinding l4s right so to build up fw into something far more attractive then l4 grinding is to reinforce the idea that pvp eve  pvp so lets give those 90 players something to act more like the 10ers
well failure to vote wont make anything better and certainly wont get you the representation you wantremember that anyone including you can be an advisor in take care and we currently have two fw advisors already based on my history you can clearly see the amount of fwrelated issues i raised and the content of them which goes way beyond my personal playstyle if there is anything you want to see raised all you have to do is send erik or me or any other advisor an email or convo any of uswere not here to run off with your votes were here to give you a voice once the elections are over
thanks to all of you your support is much appreciated
dear csm candidatesthanks for all the interest ive received a winning offer
since the candidates have no way to verify that you have indeed voted for them dont expect any offers or interestplus you are supposed to pay the csm for their time spent to improve your game not the other way around
ah well so long as your not against the idea of buying votes thats great if you get in you can maybe get ccp to put vote buying on contracts
i also feel buying votes is wrong though i know some have done that this election personally i think it shouldnt be allowed to pay for votes as in real life if it is proven against any member and they are in power they should loose their position they got through bought votesno i am not bitter because i cant do it i think its immoral and wrong and wouldnt do it even if i had the isk to sink into it
the problem with vote buying is there is no way to verify the person paid actually voted my personal advice is to offer your votes for sale and take all the iskies you can get
did people actually buy into the idea that it was a chick either way the number of threads where i saw mindlesspointless garbage in an attempt to be funny and cute assures us all that i will not vote for cat saying one thing and doing another is as voter friendly as edwards banging some chick on the side back that up with im for the poor peoplezlolz while sitting in a massive mansion while your neighbors live in a shack as for your job you could be working at tacobell indias numerous help desk phonelines or anywhere else it smacks of a resumewhite washedfuzzy story as opposed to presenting is real  that makes us think you might be worth voting for alsoguys trying to rp chicks seriously wtf
your vote has been registered we thank you for your participationplease do wear cat ears when you go to iceland and leave them on as youre discussing csm business around the table that is all thanks
yarrrrr
2 votes from me i do not agree with all of the proposals but larkonis is definitely the champion of piracy and small gang pvp
im having trouble finding any news about the results of this meeting did it occur did ccp elaborate on this issue or anything else for that matter
i see you point however there is not really any point arguing it as ccp have been changing things this way ever since the game started the fact of the matter is in mmos it becomes quickly apparent where there is an imbalance and whilst persistance would be nice you cant let it get in the way of fixing problems so many fads have come and gone every ship having a multispectral ecm in the mids  ecm nerfed except on dedicated ecm boatsbeing able to fit cruise missiles into kestrels  nerfedbeing able to run multiple mwds  nerfedinterceptors being able to fly at 30kms  nerfedyou see my point there has never been persistance in eve trying to do so now is completely pointless there will always be things that are overpowered and underpowered ignoring them would eventually kill the game
let um get cocorded for now on nuff said
area of effect weapons will just be stacked on top of each other whatever they are to the point we have exactly the same problem as we have now with titansfocused anticapital weapons are the way to go 
this is what needs to be changed here the covetor needs to be there before people go for the hulk
like the ideas
yeah yeah
updatethis is the writeup im about to submit for some meeting i think i worded it to avoid any misunderstandings such as there have been in this thread
hmmmmmmmmmmm i think i will support myself
common request its also a stupid questionchrist no if i want to play clientmodification online
ok you can stick with the ccp default i hope you like it
i support this only if mazzilliu will allow me to use his mod
my current modification to the eve interface is a bright pink backgrounds and hot pink buttons and pastel pink text background soooo there you go
will ill be to lazy to learn how to do this but i think its a great idea usually the people share their workso everbody could use that alteration he likes the most or none at allsupported
the problem with modsaddons is that since they do make things easier they by default create either unbalance or an arms race of who has the most effective tools while i agree that creating balance by bad ui is not the right way to design things fixing the ui with mods for elite players is an even worse issue especially in a pvp oriented gamemyself i love the fact that eve is free of the modaddon update hell after each patch even knowing there are number of things id like to get access to please keep eve clean but also please develop the ui on the official clientbesides eve has enough bugs to not need mods to bring more grin
cliet modifications are and should remain against the eula and a bannable offence i wont mention any names but i recall someone being able to fit more lowslot modules than the ship allowed by alteration of the python codethe client obviously has outgoing data streams if you allow modification of the client that control these streams then reprecussions are unforseeni really think controlling any drawback of this idea is more hassle than its worth for ccp programmers sorry
thats something that means you need to move that calculation to the server and any other vital calculations like that even despite those minor exploitsthere wasis a comingoutofwarp at max speed hack too and no punkbuster or gameguard or whatever running the memory editing type ofhacking problem in eve doesnt seem very widespread so allowing legit client modification should not cause any world ending consequencesanyways ccp can choose between allowing player run modification or taking endless suggestion and debate about whether the zoom button should be bright pink or green and why cant you fix it you are a horrible company etc etcas for the poster concerned itll result in an arms race i dont see that ever happening in a place where players can share things openly and the same tools are available to everbody the best ones will be the most popular and specialized ui issues like the colorblind population and nearsighted and the deaf will get their concerns addressed as well without requiring everyone else use the same uianyways the default ui will just be this one we can only get better from here
hell no
i made this a major part of my csm campaign in the last two races so obviously im for it assuming its done sensiblyie dont let people add low slots through client mods  seriously you call that a counterargument it would be the single best change ccp could make to the game bar none
i agree with this sentiment
im with the no side of the argument on this issue as much as i would love to be on the other sidemoving the exploitable items back server side instead of client side is going to add an amzing amount of calculations to the servers for the 3050k people that are normally logged on you think jita or large fleet battles lag nowthe fact that there are and continue to be exploitable benefits of hacking the client the aforementioned max speed after warp thing for instance means that opening it up for player development only opens it up for abuse i dont mind being beaten by a smarter player being beaten by a better programmer is another matter
i still reckon legit modification could very much result in worldending consequences in fact something that doesnt even require a calculation sent to the server is the password that you type in a client loaded with addons of which just 1 could be hostile could result in the sensitive information getting in the wrong hands not only do i see potential alterations to ingame items but also a whole new form of metagaming hi friend in kenzoku would you like to download this modification to your client it definitely wasnt made by a goon alt
thats a pretty freaking huge if hersch with a lot of baggage to go with itit would need to be defined down to the t and sorry to say not likely to take place here considering the individuals proposing thisi dont mind a clean up but with how its worded too risky
this is a game that has the potential to have well over 50k people on the same server and you want the server to do more calculations would you like it to discern pi to the last digit for you as wellsorry i am strongly against this a modifiable ui maybe an opensource code you have to be kidding me
a customizable ui is sorely neededbut anything more than that not really
the idea is logical since the current ui is a nightmare and an example to student ui designers how not to design an ui but its opening a can of worms when it comes to abuse and exploits if its not designed properly i dont think ccp will be able to plug those holes right from the bat
its easy to poke fun at ccp and they really do deserve it sometimes but they can do good work if they have a reason to youre right that this could be bad  if you dont keep an eye on it it can rapidly go from being a very good thing to a very bad thing my understanding is that the macromodder side of the game is something that gets tweaked frequently on games that allow it in order to keep it to utility and not necessity or absurdity but that said if they do it right it would solve so many problems  probably half to 23 of the outstanding complaints about eve could be solved without ccp lifting a finger if this was done browser sucks someone rams firefox in that hole complete with an addon that gives trusted sites all the info you could ever ask for  think of what sort of fleet coordination tools you can put into place with that amount of power at your sisposal mail client sucks not once you download a mail addon that integrates it into your computers mail client complete with sentbox multiple addressing contact list and all the other usual and unusual feature requests think the corp interface is a pile of steaming dung rewrite it change it all you like and make it into whatever you think is the slickest thing imaginable the game would be far more playable and immensely less frustrating and ccp would never have to do a thing again in order to keep it that way freeing them up to make a newbiefriendly default without worrying much about us vets and put people onto the game mechanics that need changing as far as im concerned this is a nobrainer and the only serious way to code an interface for a mmo
fw is where its atwake up ccp
i think its more accurate to say that fw is where it could be  if ccp paid more attention to the unfortunate problems that currently plague it
20
omg thats terrible poor chapsigned
supporting as well i actually just made a post regarding this on shc especially related to doomsdaysthe one change i would make to the proposal would be to add a few extra subgroups within the effects tree so for instance you could allow the display of doomsdays while not rendering things like sensor boosters to reduce lag or disabling the hardener effects while preserving the boosterrepper effectsi think simply moving dds to turret effects wouldnt help quite as much since many players have these disabled in fleet fights as well to reduce lagthat said a good start as it is 
ya there really should fix and final add the allaince features to the pos if there granted the roles they should be able to use the pos like they was the corp the put it thereand yes a better why to protect pos from spys would be great
i support this idea greatly the new intro states we are demi gods but if i am a god that doesnt deserve a lick of paint then i just feel small and insignificanti agree to the idea of preset colours and patterns so that players cant end up causing too much lag with this having the corp logo would be an amazing idea as it would be like a sign of loyalty and proudness either way i say fight for this
yeseven if it is only a way to cover those ugly white stripes on caldari ships they look like the painter was drunken while doing it no straight borders
emote facepalmyou dont get it do you lag want me to repeat that again laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggg l  a  g and for whatemote doublefacepalmso you can change the clothes on you ship go play second life if you wanna change clothes in a gameand before you try to tell me that it wont cause lag yes it will ccp has said so god has spoken it has been brought up by the csm and ccp tried it it caused lag does not work you can not have it go away second life is that way kthxbainot supported
links or stfu
ya some paint would be nice
i like the idea of adding corp logos to a ship i also like the4 idea of a predefined 2 tone color scheme layout that all you would be allowed to do is select 2 colors from a pallate and they would be applies to your ship in the predetermined pattern based on your ship each ship would have a pre determined pattern and the t2 ships would get a spiffier pattern i support these ideas i do not however support the idea of completely customised ship patterns and such cause really the last thing we need to see is a horde of hello kitty kestrels flying around
fw is the most fun in the game atm yet ccp have said they dont want to spend any time on it and dont want it to impact other gameplay at all the rewards are nonexistent apart from standings which is fine but the feature needs some serious work all the samefw is great ccp its not a sidegame finish it
signed i support this
signed
word
i concurthe fw missions are terrible and rewards really slim compared to those available elsewhere in eve fw needs love
fix it
supported
i disagree with the op 00 is very rewarding for those who are willing to take the risk and it is a lot more profitable then empire space the mining is much better and more profitable the ratting is a lot more lucrative and now the denizens of 00 got wormholes and everything that comes with it i do support the idea of improving 00 but not the way the op proposes i want to see 00 made more accessible to newbs there should be pvp bots that new people can practice with and wormholes should be made available in empire space moreover there are by far more pressing issues for ccp to work on ships need to be balanced performance needs to be improved missions should be made more interesting and diverse the list goes on and onso basically i support ops idea but not right now
wormholes are available in all space including empire
lol epic  ummm still waiting for that logo btw ccp
check out my faceand logo please
me wantsa logo
logo pic is wildly inappropriate thats the reason we dont have it
this ccp why do you hate wi logo now please
they want to review it several times because this logo is so awesome they cant let it go and have to look at it every day and each time they look at it they forget what they were doing because the logo is so awesome and so this logo never gets addedthat must be it
you may want to discretely link in the source file here in case they just misplaced it and none of them knows where the original upload went p
how about that logo
 indeed
there are 1792 toons in the wildly inappropriate alliancedo ccp plan to wait until each and every one of them posts in this thread to ask for our logo before they do what they promised back in january
logo logo logo logo logo logo logo logo logo redhead redhead logo logo logo logo logo
gives us our logo or i will uselessly shake my fist at you in frustrationyou have been warned
yes the old one also gave the game back story and what is the point of all these new graphics but to increase immersionand having a back story will help immersion a lot
i agree the new one is not immersive at all the old intro made people feel sorry for the matar or jealous of the gallente or entranced by the power of the amarr but all the new intro does is say wellcome to eve lots of other people play this game so its going to be hard for you hope youve got some ballsthe old intry would be better i feel
yeah bring back the old one
didnt think the old intro was extremely good but the generic chestbeating new one with demigods and other overblown nonsense is so bad id settle for a mediocre one any time
i like the new intro it has spunk and the new new player experience is somewhat more storyimmersive than before taking you on a walking  er warping  tour of the galaxy to compensatethe old intro while very cool set up false expectations i think  the new intro better primes new players for the real deal theyre about to getthat said im a sucker for good plot and would love to see the backstory better integrated especially for beginners
i quite like the new one but i didnt have the same excitement while watching it as the old one 31
i like the new one but i miss the back story it really gave a sense of the immense ammount of time that has passed between now and eve
supporting this ancient idea
signed for the launchers and the plates being visable
firstly vuks thread about supercaps is excellent and i fully support nearly all his ideas there is however a simple fix in the meantime which could be applied pending a total supercap revamp or indeed as part of it i think many of us can appreciate that areaof effect dds have had their day but titan pilots rightly want something fun to do with their shiny toys without breaking the game for everyone else soreplace areaofeffect dd with focused dd1 remove area of effect dd completely2 replace with focused dd think death star with a 60 second rof and 1m raw damage per shot and 200km range 3 retain all the logistical qualities which make titans coolthe focused dd fire can use a certain percentage of the cap to prevent instajump outs after execution the idea is that titans become a potent anticapital platforms without the game breaking area of effect dd intactand it keeps the ship cool and worthwhile and funthis would have to be accompanied by a boost to mstitan hp which is needed as per vuks post to prevent ms being twovolleyed or something equally ridiculous
titans are meant to be antiblob weaponlet them stay antiblob
titans come in blobs these days and especially when used under cynojammers most reasonable people can see they are imbalanced to the point of being gamebreakingit wont be long before 2030 titans are able to dd and kill a capital fleet were already seeing 15 titans together at once in this situation there is no place for the areaofeffect dd anymore
you are a horrible troll and worse battlefeild commentator but this is a very good idea and one i proposed about about a year ago your concept here is much better than my original and thus i fully support thishowever before this can be effective ccp needs to resolve the issue of big  lag otherwise the massive fleet fights that result from this change will be utterly miserable lagfests and will ruin the game
what a stupid idealwould mean what the titain gets to shoot on ship and kill it then get blobed by the group his dd would have normal taken outcause if this new death ray you want was put it and useing enough cap to stop it from jumping out would mean would only get what 2 ship kills what every 30 to 40 mins for a titain like said stupid idealthen again uks blob are getting small now a days
to be fair weve actually grown in size since forcing your alliance out of catch but were digressing here back on topicthe cap usage would prevent the titan jumping out but not warping out  so of course people could use them in driveby attacks on capital ships for example against seiged dreads it would be particularly effectivethis negates your point about getting killed by the blob his dd would have taken out  this isnt a ship to be used solo it would have a support fleet covering himwhat it provides is a phenomenal and scary anticapital platform which can oneshot most dreadscarriers it is not without risk and nor should it bebut it removes the gamebreaking areaofeffect dd and keeps titans fun whilst adding an interesting new dynamic to capital ship combatedit oh and i support my idea of course 
dd is not game breaking hell you can tank dds now if you know how to set up for itcourse you wont be able to do much of anything eles but you can live through a dd blastas far as a 1 hit 1 kill in stead if screwing up the titain more than it already is lets add that 1 hit feature to the dreadsince that is suppose to be a huge flying cannon anyway up the dps the dread does and youd get this maybe even make it were a couple of dread using the power can pop a titainor they could introduce a t2 version that is built for that purpose
if its so easy to move around now whats the big deal in lowering the clone jump timer
because people who actually prefer this game to hello kitty think jump clones are a joke
i support this
jumpclones are awesome
ofcourse they pirates dont like this ideal the would be harder to camp ppl in stationsi like it alot myself we dont pay money to sit in stations all day
i just thought this up so i apologize if it isnt just an awesome idea with a huge list of supporting factors but just give it a thoughtit seems to me that if moon mining was changed slightly so that towers outside of an alliances home space constellationregion were either more expensive to keep running the ty option or unable to get sov 3 or some other nerf basically making them harder to hold then 00 would spice up a bit a problem we see all over 00 is that a few big landlords hold most of the highend dysprosium and promethium some areas current goonspace is estimated at over 400b a month moon income groups like pl have highends well outside their home in fountain some in cloud ring syndicate and lowsec near fountain while these big alliances will still retain the ability to defend these towers with their huge current wealth making it harder to hold onto moons where they dont control the space around ie satellite moongold or npc regionslowsec will make smaller entities get to take potshots at holding some highends more often discusspreedit changed all jewgold to moongold and to clarify that this isnt targetted against gs and pl its just i just read what gs makes off their space and i know pl has alot of moons out of their region 
wouldnt this affect the small alliances and corps as well as the big ones if yes  how exactly does it make things tougher on the big guys if its an equal challenge and the big alliances still have more resources doesnt this end up being the same as now
or just make moon minerals finite and randomize the respawns 
not sure how this should be reworked if at all but yasomthing does need to be done to give smaller allainces some kind of chance aginst larger and the mulitpeenitys they bring against themsmaller groups need some way to get the assests they need to be able to stand agaainst the big guysand if it can be done with out reverting to underhanded way the big guys do things they better
well notice how pl doesnt own the constellations in cloud ring around their moons or control the systems surrounding their moons in other non fountain areas if they arent of strategic or financial gain well this would require them to make holding far away moons that even though still make money much harder to justify due to the higher cost to maintain them a possible solution could be moons in npc regions would have no way of getting the regular fuel rate or hp amount or whatsohaveyou they would always require an amount that would make them not very justifiable for a large 00 entity whereas a smaller entity that may live out of that region could see a point in holding them as even the reduced income would be a bit for them and being small they wouldnt have the need for a large pos network to waste isk and fuel onthen 00 regions would need adjoining systems to the said r64 to get a reasonable fuel requirement or hp buffer or whateverbasically the aim of this idea is to make taking far away moons and holding them a discouraging idea any other ideas
guess could also add a limit to how many moon a allaince could hold tofactor it in on how many corps you have in allaince like 10 moons per corp or somthingthen again that kinda rewards the bigger ones moreand upping the cost dont really help out either cuase the big one can afford to pay pretty much anything
correct which is why i would also like the towers to be easier to kill when you dont control the space directly around them there are alot of really competent small alliances out there that have small cap fleets and could knock on r64 moons every now and again and if they werent worth nearly as much due to their npc location or just remote location bigger guys wouldnt put up much of a fightlimiting moons by alliance would just make people make more alt alliances making moons in lowsec and npc sov easier to take helps out budding groups and really doesnt harm the big alliances that have plenty of good gold in their own space so yes this is a stealth little guy buff idea
this is by far one of the most horrible ideas in a long timei can more or less grasp the basic concept that seems to be buried deep inside the suggestion but it is not like a hidden jewel more like a 1 cent coin in a pile of manure no matter how i turn it it doesnt look pretty nor does it make much sense at all and i can think of a seemingly endless list of complications with it starting with the general distribution of race preference which directly influences global ship model popularity however i dont even think there is much to actually debate about this it would just plain suck like hard vacuum and mess everything up completely
bad bad bad ideal they nerf enough already infact they need to stop with that crapif you dont have the skills and the know how to fit ya ship to fight against more exp ppl then stay the hell out the wayus vets getting sick and tried getting nerfed everytime we turn around cause some damn noob who only gonna play the game for bout 2 months and quit cause it to hard for them bithced moan and grips to ccp to nerf us
if its something that shows up on the scanner at all you should be able to filter it supported
i approve of this proposal
i support this
you did i know some say a serious candidate should be convinced to be the best choice and thus vote accordingly but i still believe it lacks style on several levels slightly disappointed
youre missing the point i tried to make candidates that are prominent on eve forums tend to get elected more because their names are familiar so if you start exploiting the fact that you provide for an in game service youre relying on that instead of what you stand for makes me wonder why serenity didnt run and get elected for the 2nd termbesides there are enough governments that control radiotv and try to brainwash the citizens so they will vote for them again people are so used to this they start to think its normal in an internet spaceship game as wellbut even when csm is some sort of popularity contest doesnt mean they can try and influence ccp into changing things because players care about it just that ccp should pay more attention to them since these 2 terms they should have taken the csm more seriously several csm members wrote that they would liked that ccp got involved more
sounds very much like someones implemented the hack1 this round of voting should be dropped2 the expoits in the voting system should be fixed3 rules should be set for antispammingso currently we can safely bet that at least one of the candidates to be elected will be due to fraud
your list i though i owned my email address i only gave you limited permission to use it to send me outpost alertsonly message makes it ok this isnt a volume issueyou messed up it was a mistakeso you didnt even send it from the list i subscribed to nicejust play fairnext election i look forward to flood of spam and hacksthanks for setting the trend
funnily enough in your pointbypoint rebuttal i noticed that you somehow missed this one so i though you might want another go
bastards eh
well lets be selective with what we all readyes canspam was created for commercial and specifically sexual emails however its the regulation the industry as a whole likes to abide by as a best practices even for noncommercial mailsi think you can agree that using one list to promote another thing with no outout mechanism is in the spirit of spam and not something all users will acceptgenerally if you dont want to have your isp blocked on all the antispam lists which are automatically configured on many routers then its a good idea to play nice you might not be charged under canspam but youll still be screwed
i delibrately didnt run for 2 reasons the meeting in reykjavik would be in the deadmiddle of winter and im not so keen on going anywhere that cold the 2nd csm was predicted as needing and did continue to deal with small fixes im interested in dealing with future  universe shaping ideasbut it was mostly the winter thing 
this would probably be a good thing but i dont think ccp wants to spend the time coding the tools necessary as with so many other things they could do it a lot better if they had the time and inclination the shuffling of candidate names is important and im amazed that they still havent done it  ballot position massively skews electoral results i ran because i think i have good ideas and would do a good job as a csm member and because i think id like having the jobyeah im a geek i vote for myself because i think i have good ideas and would do a good job as a csm member and because i think id like having the job there is no other candidate i want more to be on the council and i think it has a chance of mattering and as such i cast all my votes for myself i dont claim to be the only one who would do a good job or the only one worthy of a seat i wont name names but i have several people in mind who im sure will be great csm members if elected that said im running because id like to win and as such im going to do what i can to see to it that i do including casting both votes for myself it might be different if i thought i was guaranteed to win or guaranteed to lose but id like to think im somewhere in the middle and as such that im not throwing my votes away true but candidates use all sorts of things to get elected politicians strive mightily to be seen by the general public as someone they could share a beer with  a completely irrelevant piece of information but a major part of why a lot of people get elected works the same way in eve  i dont intend to disparage the candidates abilities but dj and vuk won on the backs of their alliance leadership hardin won because he created half the alliances in the game and i could attribute half a dozen other winners to simple and obvious constituencies thats not all they had going for them but id wager the recognition and trust level from their ingame actions was the difference between their resounding victories and likely defeat the fact that serenity is trying to use his ingame contacts  which presumably worked for him in csm 1  to win a seat on csm 3 is hardly surprising
iirc an analysis of the 1st csm revealed that there was no correlation between position in the list and actual votes received id suggest run it again with 123 csm results the ultimate question is even if there is some bias is there sufficient bias based on ballot position to get anyone elected or stop someone being elected
hey what do i have to do with this waves arms around wildly
uhm not sure if its been mentioned yet but the canspam act is a us law and is therefore completely unrelated to any of the rest of the worldnot that i agree or disagree with the voting tactics in question but i just thought id point it outespecially since ccp is based in iceland with servers in the uk me holds his tounge before he starts ranting about how americans think they control the world
you knowi actually forgot that we didnt for a minute that aside you make a good point unless serenity himself is actually in the us the law really doesnt apply in the first place since he exists outside the jurisdiction of us courts
which industry would that be exactly the maps for space games industry i presume since thats the one serenity belongs tothat aside lets look at the actual actheres a snippet from the fccs website youll notice every single reference there is dealing strictly with commercial email so the first test is is this email commercial in nature if the answer is no then regardless of the fact that the email may be junk it doesnt meet the established legal definition of spam
so what does the act specifically dosolets see what applies1 false or misleading header information since i havent seen the email i cant comment on this but since you immediaely knew who it was from im guessing the header points back to the same person2 false or misleading subject lines in commercial email not a commercial email doesnt apply3 opt out of future commercial email not a commercial email doesnt applyin fact pretty much the rest of the act specifically addresses only commercial email which we have already established this was notyou may not agree with what serenity did and thats fine but dont try and cover your dislike with the shroud of a law that doesnt apply
look while you whiners and morons are screaming ask yourself one question if you have the courage to sawllow your frakking pridedid you subscribe to his list or notif you said yes your sol and should stfuthis is not the place to complain about it take it up with the server providerowner and kindly dont let the door hit you on the way outend of discussioneven if you said no this is yet again beyond eves jurisdictional rightthats like telling everyone that you hate my guts because i refused to give you a free fixit at the shop and that should deny me the right to run for csm are you really that moronic
threadyou can argue about semantics and the canact spam definition but it all boils down to adding unsolicited information to a newsletter for a personal gain and since other candidates have this opportunity it just gives an unfair advantage just use the means everybody else has and explain the people why you think youre good enough to represent the players in the csm
do you actually read before spouting off your opinions or are you just heer for grinsif your subscribed to the newsletter then its your own damn fault end the subscriptionstop whining
thats not the point serenitys mailing list was for outpost updates  people joined it to get emailed about new outposts not to get emailed csm advertisements theres a certain obligation there to keep your mails topical i dont think anyone would have objected to a by the way at the bottom of one of the mails but a specific advertisement mail being sent out thats a bit shadier
regardless they should take it up with the guy himself and his own websitethis has nothing to do with eve itself or assembly hallno one is obligated to vote after getting spammed as they put itthats like dragging anyone one persons real life into the equation and to use that as a basis for disqualificationit would be different if it was actual spamif i had gotten it i still would have issues bringing it up herea it wouldnt do squatb its a waste of timec i can do far more damage by having the idiot shut down than whining about it here
actually it was the op who started that line of debate by suggesting that the email violated that actim not debating if the email should or shouldnt have been sent frankly as far as i am concerned if ccp decides it violates the rules of the csm election process they can remove serenity from the running at will  they are after all the ones who decided he could be a candidate in the first placehowever by bringing up the argument that the email violated the us canspam act the op made it seem as if the sender may have knowingly engaged in an in the us illegal activity which is a far more serious charge than breaking the rules of an internet spaceship game
bingo i can get why someone would be put off but thats not the pointthe point is your arguing over something that has nothing to do with eve itself other than the guy running for csmccp couldnt control or enforce such things because they have no control over it and it would be stupidly insane to enforce such a thinganyone and there mother would be pushing for accusations and what noteither you report him to the fcc or you report him to abuse for spamming ccp has no jurisdiction nor does csm or this boardthis is nothing more than a whine thread sorry to sayps and imho if you subscribed to the newsletterits your own damn fault if the newsletter is abusing its sub then you take it up with themdebating the issue here would warrant the topic being moved off this board the csm thing is coincidental
it should probably have gone into jita park i agree since its an election issue and not an actual csm topic i havent reported it because i dont like moving threads after they get big barring that its a fine topic  salacious rumours about a candidate breaking the laws of a country he doesnt even live in are always good fun and standard grist for the mill during an election
salacious i love that word id vote for you herschel just for that if i hadnt already voted for you for something elsenow that should start a few rumors 
go
sounds like a damn fine idea to me and would make life in a noobie corp slightly less painful which might mean i can recruit one or two of them
its quite hard to fight these scumbags but ccp seriously should look into harsher means to stop thisa single rightclick option to report spammers should be considered now you have to do like 5 mouse clicks and type a msg which makes most people not bother abuse should get the option removed for a month or sotrialbuddy toons should be limited to a few channels only and not allowed to post links etc it might limit the new players a bit more but in regard of the scale of the abuse of these types of accounts it important to let them enjoy the game and not get ticked off by these low livesanother thing i came up with might be that ccp designs some kind of ai in the client that keeps track of communication and check its against a set of rules and signals a heads up when it finds patterns common for isk spammers what rules should remain a secret and constantly adapted so that its almost impossible to circumvent them
wrong i explained how it wasnt an addon thats a separate issue all i was talking about were a limited amount of commands and the only reason i say that is because there are alot of different aspects of the game that need hotkey support and this could take care of it all in one fell swoop stop being lazy how is petitioning for game improvements lazy hotkeys arent lazy arent some kind of luxury theyre standard fare for mmos these days again being forced to click is stupidi know all those 5 year players are probably fine with laggyuiclickfest and are afraid of the game being homogenized into wow but i think improving the ui that thing which is one of the most cited flaws with this game is a worthwhile goal
hotkey  a shortcut of keys mapped to do a functionnow how is that not being lazy againi get what your saying ui needs improvement but stop being a damned hypocrite about it and start clearing up your contradictions
i think generally it is a support sink to take presure off ccpuser  to the csmcsm takes all the slackcsm does the ground workthe csm es to ccpccp ignores the csm
the tags mean nothing  someone started issue on the first day it stuck for a while and then people started doing wacky things id like to think general issues make sense for some topics sometimes you have a specific proposal sometimes youve identified something you consider a problem dont have a single good solution and want ccp to think about it for yousince ultimately theyll have to anyways the csm has generally taken them and presented a spread of options to ccp and this seems to have worked decently proposals are taken up if and only if a csm member raises them support and opposition posts exist to try to convince the nine of them depends on the edit  minor clarifications are fine imo major changes are not that said because of the last thread getting a bunch of thumbs by lying to people is a bad tactic supporting a discussion is sketchy  sometimes the csm will pick up on the idea you support sometimes they wont this needs some clarification imo there is no statute of limitations on issues being raised that said most of those yearold threads already have been raised id love to see ccp make a csm member an assembly hall mod just so that threads can be tagged with a status it doesnt make sense but it happens because not everyone knows all the threads raised in the past usually i or someone else who knows the history will sort it out quickly though i believe that ankhs wiki is being ported onto evelopedia and that future updates will be there i dont know for sure what her plans are with regard to her personallyhosted wiki are though hope this helps
thanks for your answers herschel this clears up some but not allhow about the next csm sat down and agreed to some guidelines for this section then put an faq in there for everyone to purview
its one of the things im planning on doing if im elected for that matter might even submit a draft version to the csm if im not some actual codification of what goes here and what the csm wants to see in a proposal might be quite valuable of course the people who make the worst threads will probably never read those rules but still itll at least make it easier to yell at them
while setting up a faqguideline might be handy and it is imho the csm is fairly open so each csm can decide how it wants to handle this area so while one csm might want to do things one way the next might want to do something completely differentthe only hard rules are that a topic needs to be here for at least 7 days before being raised in a csm meeting and that the topic either has to have a  support of the total voter count from the current election cycle or a csm champion for it to be raised at csm levelgenerally the amount of support for the issue being raised is looked at along with any commentsarguments or edits to the op the actual issue getting raised can be identical to the op much more indepth or even less indepth it rally depends on who decides to champion it and what they think they can get to pass through the csmas for porting ankhes wiki  its about 90 done and i now have rsi and the evelopedia mods have recently agreed to a new bunch of categorizations for csm to use to make it all a bit better when i get some time im going to go back through and edit all the past topics so that its a little easier to read in regards to csms moderating this area  i would love it and it has been asked for just not officially through the csm raising the topic etc i spent a little time at the beginning of csm 2 going through old issues that had been dealt with and reporting them to get locked to stop them being continually bumped but quite honestly the amount of time it started to take was getting ridiculous so i concentrated on the evelopedia instead
quick tips1 dont treat it like a ing board2 dont do 1 hit post wonders youll look like a total moronidiot if your going to post bother to participate3 dont make demands i demand you do this is not how you make a proposal or idea4 csm is not an all powerful group of players who can do anything you want this doesnt make them useless either until you get that straight youll never get it figured out5 think about your idea and how it effects things 3 months down then 6 months then 1 year then 3 years youll be surprised that 9 times out of 10 most ideas are shot down just due to age6 take both sides respectively before proposing how does it effect this group that group most ideas are selfishand self centered as most people only come here to complain about an issue7 keep an open mind dont assume the title really means what the proposal says8 dont just react read sit back think about it then respond9 and for the love of all things good dont repost or repeat ideas10 posting with an alt is disrespectful and ridiculous in this context11 alt supporting is an insult and should be a banable offense but it isnt just dont do it
yes definately would like a verification for these just lost another bigger broker fee and of course it has to be user configurable if there is the popup or not advanced version would be include a userconfigurable treshold for broker fee so that only big order cancels get verified not sure if this would be truly useful or not just a thought
i found this thread in a search and am reviving it especially this bitthat is why i was searching i cant believe more people arent complaining of this problem at certain angles especially in the orange nebula systems the background completely washes out the tactical display when you mouse over a module its annoying in the extreme before you ask my gamma is actually set a little low  i dont like washed out screens but prefer deep rich colors playing with it didnt seem to help the situation either wayi dont mind having complex nebula backgrounds there as a toggle option for the people who want them but i prefer dark black space and lots of stars it is rather empty you know and ive got to believe that a civilization which can build ships capable of crossing a star system in a few seconds wouldnt have any real problems designing a functional tactical interface perhaps an option to toggle the interface draw colors
sorry for the double forgot to put my thumbs up thingie in
adding the background nebulas and such as actual distant 3d objects would not add any more load to the client than the current gas cloud and such effects do close up this would provide a real sense of place instead of just being in another seemingly randomly colored system
i love backgrounds
signedall we have atm are clouds more clouds and even more clouds in all colors and their motherthey need to look at hubble photos and then implement backgrounds that look like those
concord sanctioned mail certificate blablablah no thanksmutual 10 standing concord immunity yes please i dont think theres a need for the concord sanctionsnip setting someone to 10 actually takes some effort and you shouldnt set people to 10 unless you mean itsigned
as it usually happen pilot notice that the license is over by the fact of impossibility to login to the game when there are several accounts owned the license tracking going to be the real headache the offer is to add the pilot license expiration date to the general pilot profile sheet
this has been suggested before the problem is that the financial server is separate from the login server the only query done is when you log in a single request is sent is this account active ccp said theyre looking to a solution towards this but they have to be very careful with the coding it may happen soon or it may not happen if they cant get the code to work without bogging down the system
and this is why the new topic button shouldnt be available right next to the reply to topic button
give wi her logo anyway its about damn time
i dont but then who am i
its desirable that erik participates in these discussions himself as he also has to discuss the issues within the csm prior to voting and in the discussions with ccp and ill definately urge him to do soits one of the main rules in the founding documents of the csm and enforced by ccp it was occasionally broken in csm2 though
got my vote this time around good luck
that wasnt my wife it was plague black and his prank callsthanx for all support ladies if i win lets go and nuke jita to celebrate i will ask for reinforced node tho not that matters anyway
good luck to all of the candidates in anticipation of the resultsthanks for everyone that participated in these elections either as candidate or by voting
what she saidhad great fun discussing stuff and will be sad to see some not making the cut
and here i was telling everyone it was over at downtime well then in any case best of luck to all candidates and im looking forward to seeing how it all shakes out
it took a week last time to announce the results righti wish bad luck on everybody except me and that pirate guy and that other couple of guys i liked
ccp mentioned somethign about an official announcement being made tomorrow on the original dev blog
thursday the 29th which is an incorrect date   may 29th thursday a permanent announcement made about the results of the third csm elections may 31st saturday the third csm meets online for the first timei hope they clear up the meeting date issue so that multiple people dont miss it
so will ccp send us candidates a mail or do we find out with the rest of eve
you should get a mail a day or two in advance
may 29th thursday 2014 is a perfectly valid date for me please check your calendar
i never got such an email last time maybe its only the winners that get it
wats a csm
so its soon then
id like to thank everyone who asked me questions criticized me voted for me or voted against me the only way the csm can improve eve for more people is if more people participate so all participation is welcome 
a vote for the industrialists and rational thought

totally supported i agree it does need a sticky and it does need all the support this can getthe lens effect is cool and all but we see it everywhere and i truly miss the huge flashes of white light and lightning that represented the cavalry or incoming death it really gave an epic sense to a capital or capital fleet arriving on the sceneps when you all sign this make sure you click the support button too to show them were serious
yup spectacular effects for cool ships plzalso the cyno field itself looks like a small red ball now  was a lot cooler before give us something to look at if were to stay there 10 minutes

let us assume a small to medium sized alliance wants to carve a system or two off from a bigger powerblock for itselfalso assume the systems are jammed and the defenders have a titan or tworight now it works pretty much along the lines of this attackers have to use subcaps under a jammer defenders dd them at every opportunity ideally on jump in and the subcapital fleet gets massacred or cannot effectively stay on grid at the jammer due to the two titans poking their noses out of the shieldinvasion overchange titans to an anticapital platformattackers deploy their subcapital fleet to hit the jammer defenders must deploy a subcapital fleet to defend it end result  a big fight for everyone numbers and blobs might happen but at least its a chance and good attacker with well thought out tactics can overcome the numbersjammer goes down attackers caps jump in defenders cap jump in defenders decide to deploy titans to do horrible stuff to attackers caps motherships are deployed to rep the titans attackers support tries to tackle it and get warp in for its dreads or they snipe dreads stay out of siege and get reps with good tactics they might win and kill a titan if the defenders blob then the attackers maybe should have brought more people through good use of diplomacy either way a big fight happenstitans cant just boom the hostile subcaps off the field and the change introduces effective counters to any tactic employed by either sidemore fightingmore funrole for mothershipsno more 200 people sitting around for 2 hours then jumping into a bubbled gate and getting dded enmasseyes this is a pretty simplistic outline but i think it is fundamentally sound and yes fiddle about with titan hitpoints and mothership repping and so on to create a nice synergy between the classes end result subcaps fight subcaps and caps and supercaps fight caps and supercaps depoly either and there is a counter dont want your caps focused on by a titan or two then bring subcaps and force your opponent to do the same slow the pace of war for sure want a quick war and fast tower kills then deploy your caps but do it knowing that titans will be a threat and obvious risk
maybe this wasnt clarified or maybe it needs to be addressed differently dunnotitans are immune to ewar this is not ewar hence titans can hurt other titans by hitting each other with these effects 20 chance to lose a dd on a titan bc another one dd you is a good reason not to stack these up that said its an absolute must that moms be allowed to repair heat damaged ships per my thread otherwise if a titan lost a dd it would have to unfit and transport to a station to get refit or have multiple backups in its hanger to refit and that honestly wouldnt be so bad imokeep in mind a titan would be stuck on grid for a limited time so its not like you can warp one in fire warp another in fire there would be a series of delays involved to launch constant ddso to say people are stacking dd is to also say stacking dd gimp titans more this also means to use a titan to save other caps is litterally a last ditch effort not a common occurance
the main principal we disagree on is the ship class titans are used to counter i dont believe a large areaofeffect weapon which effectively disables hundreds of pilots at the click of a button can ever be considered balanced or needed or fun in short i dont agree it should be an antisupport ship with an area of effect weaponi believe the titan would be more balanced in an anticapital role with its logistics capabilities fully intact and it would still be tactically extremely useful not to mention fun
yes thats pretty much what i was thinking too
all that does is shift the problem to the next problem first of all we would immediately switch back to the good old strategy of all hands on deck and through that gate and keep in mind that these days we have a lot more people then before to pump into a system we still need something to keep us on our toes and away from the easy road of mass conventional ship blobs so we do not have to fight or even so we cannot fight because  lags out with 1500 peoplesecondly it will make us push even harder on the capital front making us require more and more and more capitals to do more grinding at the same time we will spam more pos to force more grinding and we will build more and more titans because we face an even stronger capital ship trendall the ideas sound nice but you have to put it in a perspective of how mad people really are lets look at an example p do you think mm or anyone up north would scale down their focus on titans and capitals in general with such changes no the strategem changes so they adapt the nett result is that  while the paradigm has shifted  the strategic need arises for more pilots in conventional capital and supercapital shipsi think this guy has a big point titans are like nuclear weapons except they cause zero fallout so there is zero reason to think about using them twicethey are fine in small to medium environments but we got to make it hurt to use them so that we will not deliberately go nuts as it would be shooting ourselves in the footalthough in this idea i do like the hindthought of going nuts and burning both hostiles and your own space scorched earth or something like that
picture the scene you and your plucky fleet of brave outlaws are cutting around low security space in a light role fleet composing of hacsinterceptors and one or two logistics for good measure hell maybe you even have one outlaw in your gang danger strikes you run afoul of some wartargets or pirates on a gate one man screams for reps but hes an outlaw the plucky logistics pilots rep him up and are flagged fail cascade ensueswhat i proposegcc is only incured if rending assistance to another player who has gccwhat this enables for outlaws either as corps or individuals within corps is more versatility when fighting on gates vs war targets or other outlaws keep in mind the number of outlaws within faction warfare etc and this has far wider benefits than the odd outlaw who turns to a bit of anti piracy at the weekendalthough a lot of you can hurf blurf and say you did the crime take the punishment the current system still leaves outlaws at a disadvantage when facing legitimate war targets
supporting dis
aiding and abettingsp an criminalas to my position on this remains to be seen
im broadly in support of the proposal but have some additional comments regarding lowsec mining mining in lowsec is too risky for the proposal to help lure miners into it as well as the rock revamp there need to be a couple at least of new ships designed for the purpose of mining in hostile space something along the lines of what transport ships are to industrials if a miner knew that if they bought one of these ships they had a good chance of escaping an individual pirate it might encourage them to venture into lowsec
yeah pretty much also all those concerns about exploits can be solved or not even be an issue depending on the way ccp implements the tools i think possible doomsday scenarios caused by implementing something horribly isnt a proper counterargument to implementing something ccp doesnt have to release the whole client ccp can release some ui modification tool that just lets people do limited things to the client or release a limited programming environment so people could alter the ui within the confines of the existing game client how its done isnt what this proposal is about and well just have to assume it wont be done by releasing the source code
only if i can write an addon so i can play the gaming using a hacked control pad from steel battlelion and put a cardboard box over my head to pretend i am in a real space ship yes i am dungar hth
supporting this since this would be the best addition the game can currently getalso to the naysayers i bet most of the lag in eve is caused by database latencies moving a couple basic math calculations to the server shouldnt make any difference at all
no yet another reason i left wow was all the mods that were becoming necessary to play yes the igb sucks yes mail system is annoying yes there are many ui things that could be better but i dont want a mod arms race i have to run eve without anything else as it is or i start having problems i can run 2 clients right now but i have to have nothing else running and turn off all effects in game  if i soo much as open firefox or any other program before eve i need to reboot or i will eventually crash either the client or my whole system there are others in the same boat playing right now ive talked to some of them before you claim that an arms race wont happen really think hard and honestly about it mods happen and soon corps will be requiring mods for all members which will lead to enemies requiring something to match or counter that mod which will lead too well you get the picture
im down
again what this says to me is that ccp makes such a bad ui that its not even close to competitive against what players can make an arms race is just fine by me  oh no people striving to make eve even easier for me to play the horroryour point about system resource use is one that id be at least a little concerned about  my machine chokes on two clients too and id probably refrain form using mods that required a lot out of my system that said again itd be my choice and its not like players cant create lightwight mods i can choose to play with the crap ccp gives me or i can choose to modify to my hearts content the worst case here  mods are crap and you dont want to use them  is exactly the status quo the best case is us actually having a game that might be worthy of an adjective better than marginally playable
well i think this is not possible the game si written in python or at least great part and i quess ui is in python as well why not if the game is in python so the only way to allow people to modify ui would be exposing some part of python and this is point where it ends because python is quite powerfull and its hard to set some borders and limit set of availiable functions to safe ones with python exposed you could easily write your own tools that give you advantages over another players  i can imagine autopilot that can even dockundock  i think if they rewrite the game to c and use lua for example as scripting language  puting all gui stuff to xml then we might have customizable gui otherwise its impossible well and its not going to happen since they already paid programmers to write it in python
i am sure that the issue has been brought a number of times before but being a new player i wonder why the feature is still missingof course i am talking about the amount of armor shield energy logistics have contributed to the battle if the amount is recorded into the kill mails somehow then many players would enjoy flying logistics and this would result in much longer lasting and satisfying battlesthis could basically be done by adding the player to the kill mail if he has repped a player who had aggro on the targetdamage dealers in the km same thing seems to work when repping someone in empire  then the repper gets aggro toohealing or armorshield rep as it is known in eve and buffing or warfare bonuses are very old and well known concept in most of the mmorpg worlda wise developer would make people comfortable playing healers since this makes the game much more deeper and interesting for everybodyplaying healing character is not that rewarding in most of the games compared to the damage dealers but in eve it is even worst virtually you get no record for your contribution to the battlepeople just like the recognition for the job they have done and when it is missing they would prefer other ships to fly
got a point i dont see why not give recognition where its due
supportedi have this problem on my laptop as well no mousewheel

eve for everyone
yep need contract menu revampt1 modules revamp some modules are too easy to manufacturethe science  industry menu needs a revampsupport
there arent specialised gas harvesting ships when ccp will finally release them
this is an issue and why cant youidkgive out some ideas right now my ship i use is a caldari moa works wonder on cloudsdont see the reason to add a new ship for the sake of itisaac
the only reason i support this ideais because i strongly thinkthat ccp should give more attention to specific professions out therelike salvaginglooting  some ppl make a living out of this in 00 or empire gas mining  the moa is a nice alternative but a specific ship wouldnt hurt i also think that ccp is neglecting the fact that people are willing to train fora certain race ship  cross training etc maybe they should look into some kind of parralelle training like caldarigallente with the moarokh ectminmatarcaldari  this way they wouldnt forcibly need to make a ship for every race eventually expand the pirate ships  create some new pirate ships with a dedicated purpose
it does make sense that sometime after the advent of gas mining a specialized ship would be built by someone to get the edge on the new industry
after youve woken up in the morning to check your market orders see if that important mail has arrived or to take your industrial goods out the oven and start to move them around you load up the client and log in ready to start a new dayexcept because you run multiple accounts and youre very tired you typed in the wrong username and the wrong set of characters load upyou close the client and start again this time putting in the correct detailsthe only two options available at this time are enter game which i dont want to do because its the wrong account and terminate character which whilst freeing up a slot after 10 hours so i can make a new alt to do whatever it was i wanted to do seems a little extreme given the circumstances wouldnt a back to login screen button be neatyes i know you can press escape and then log off but lazyit wouldnt be very hard to implement surely
or better yet make log off actually log you off and only log you off instead of yknow restarting the clientbut im guessing theres a reason ccp terminates the client to log off i hope
yes this needs to be implemented
the client used to have this but it turned out to be broken after a patch some day so they removed itwould be nice if they fixed it once more but that has been requested quite a few times
please
this and a button in the esc menu to log out the character without logging out the account for easier character switching
no this is dumb as then i cannot reset the password when people are in it on one of my many spies and laugh as they are thrown into the clutches of the waiting mob
good idea
supported in its full beautyi am not yet sure how a ui can look like that will smoothly allow the management of so many different privileges then again that is something which ccps designers will have to think aboutnext to a usable ui the learning curve for new ceos must not rise possibly the title slots which we have today could be preset with sensible privilege profiles as a starting pointi would like to add that standing and address book management are not satisfactory either
ccp has said so where also youre an idiotdone properly it wont lag christedit this is the millionth thread about thisfake edit actually drawing on the ship is bad hur hur hur look at me guies i drew a giant space peniz on mah erebus hur hur hur changing color schemes sure why not
painting on ship  nahcorplogo on ship allylogo on ship  hmm maybewhat id love to see would be the ships producers corporation logo even in tiny sizethis would be a unique way of rewarding industrial corps in their work we already feel proud when our mates take our own built ships into battle imagine your corplogo on the nose ships from well reputed corporations with welldesigned logos would become a status symbol imagine people selling ships at above price on contract just because it has a rare corplogo on italso add a link to the producing corp on the ships infoscreen would make me happy
what the hell are you doing in my townwe are paint this here spaceship see you gotta problem with thatas a matter of fact i do you missed a spot
so this is thread 256 about ship customization coming to an end having had some support negligible opposition but no effect at all what givesproblem could be this op not actually being a formal proposal but just the ol idea thrown in once more it seems more likely that if a poster of some reknown possibly former csm member or such would post a good formal proposal based on what seems the least common ground found in this thread support will be much greater and so will visibility and lifetime of the thread i know some of the current csm candidates have agreed on supporting this issue in their campaigns and they could certainly be pestered to bring the issue up again given a decent proposal and more than 15 thumbs in support
fw has so much potential its sad to see the lack of attention its getting if ccp isnt sure how to go about addressing the issue im sure there are any number of players interested in brainstorming for ideas to use as starting points and a number of ideas are already out there
please finish fw ccp as a newer player i have had a blast in fw but after a few weeks it has become apparent that fw is incomplete and i have stopped participating as much also the lag is disappointing and i do not have the isk to throw ships away to lagfests
for the past few years the main feature of the large expansions are worthless they sounds good on paper before implementation and getting us all excited but very disappointing after release these expansions are nothing but marketing tricks to keep the old players waiting a few months more and get new ones ofc with that in mind it is quite understandable that the devs are not caring of the past expansions but concentrating to future ones insteadthis strategy may bring success short term but miserably fails on the long run
feature bloat is a problem that effects traditional software schemes where users purchase a license then need features to convince them to buy a new version a year latereve is an asp subscription setup this is designed to eliminate feature bloat through having your users pay for constant development ensuring old bugs are fixed before new features are introduced keeping the existing customers happy before reaching out for new ones with silly featuresit provides cash for further development from the existing userbase without needing to add stupid features just to get the cashflow to pay programmers and support for another year eve shouldnt suffer from this problemevemail needs an updatebugs and ui problems from 2004 need fixingwe dont need another t3we dont want another shipwe wouldnt mind the stuff youve already put in working firstyoure in this subscription model you dont have the problem of upgrades and feature bloat why buy into that problem just so you can recruit a few users with a press release on mmorpgwhateverits 5 times easier to keep an existing customer then it is to recruit a new one
fw ftw
as i have sketched during my campaign i want fw to grow into something really bigthe empires are at war this part of the game should attract and bind a lot more infrastructure and influence a lot more pilots than it currently does this is not supposed to mean that everyone shall fight no  supply resources and trade should be required for and affected by the war also as a natural correction measure to avoid one empire to win game over would not be good for the evolution of the backstoryas well i want standing to play a major role it may be the lever or binding element to a greater fw picture that will eventually reach alliance space as well
opseed agents at your own station ofull support on thatimprove your spacemhh difficult more arkonor  less megacyte price and so on and so on good in theory more space then you can defend issue o full support here too take local off and this should be goners tho i dont think 00 needs to be buffed too much but very valid points in op
bumping my idea back up to the topanyone can pack 1 hull rep drone on roaming ops to take care of that pesky dmg or to get those stupid posstation mods back from being incappedeither way you look at it plz support
sounds good also nice for wspace actions
that could be addressed and should be just because drones arent mainstream in a faction does not mean factions wont make drone boats makes sense that they would at least try to create a ship to matchcounter an opposing factions

oh dear god yes it would help so much after fights especially capital fights  posses
since factional warfare began individual corps within the militias have been able to be targeted for aggression from people outside of the factional warfare arena this is how it should be the issue however is that the militia mates of the targeted corps can do nothing to help their militia mates except a counter dec of their own which if spread around the various corps in a militia would soon send the price of decs skyrocketingmilitias arent as ccp has stated before meant to be alliances and as such i do not believe that the answer is to cause the war deccing of one corp to be considered a deccing of all corps instead i think that the best solution to this would be that if a corp decs a militia corp the other player corps within the militia are given the option to dec the aggressor back for free as the cost of the war dec is paid for by the militia itself this would also not take a slot up on either the counter deccing corps war dec limit or the corp that initiated the aggression this would allow the militia corps to defend a entity at their own choice and wouldnt result in the abuses that could be seen if the militia was treated like an alliance as an entity therefore still allowing the safety experienced by corps in fw now if they so chose or allow those corps who wish to help thier friends to do so without cost or penalty beyond exposing themselves to harm
and i support my own thingy
i think this makes sense
imho fw should not be in any complicate form or fashion or choice as stated aboveput simply if you join any one of the 4 militia empires as an indivdual or corp you will automatically put in an metaphorical alliance the alliance that being the militiaif your in the militia that militia is automatically made a war target to the opposing militias along with its alliesminmatar would be against amarr and caldari and so forth and so forththis removes the need for wardecing and messing with alliancesi mean what else would one expect when you join the military the governments political stance becomes your own by due processno need to make it any more complicated than that

tractor beams need to be looked at  either the skills or some ship with a range bonus like the rorqual eventuallybut if you notice ccp labeled it small tractor beam meaning they probably have the intention to introduce some other sizes
i was reading the new ideas from csm on how to improve 00 hereincentivizing 00and i got something special through my mindif we are moving sovereignty holding from moon pos to planetary pos and we are trying to avoid dread blobbing we should focus on the blobbing problem instead of giving pos more and more healing pointsthe main idea the proposal is to create a focused deflection field array its deflection field redirects part of the damage inflicted to the pos to a ramdom aggressing target automatic mode if you assume control over it you should be able to focus the deflected damage to a specific target simple as more dps the pos takes the more it will deflectbalancing by limiting the number of dreads shooting at a pos by a certain number carefully choosen by ccp blobbing would not be so efficient anymore by using this new array as more dreads fire at the pos the larger is the risk of loosing one of them which just entered siege mode 10 min the attacking fleet would be composed by more repair ships which should be there to heal the damaged dreads after they leave siege on the other hand deflected damage can be easily decreased by the attackers by simply stopping to fire at the pos or by reducing the number of dreads shooting at itsovereignty holding people are complaining a lot that it would be better to replace that lots of moon pos holding the sovereignty by a few planetary pos these new planetary pos have high strategic value and deserve higher defensiveaggressive capabilities you now that increasing the pos hp would just require a bigger blobbing to destroy it thats not the idea the planetary pos should be more aggressive if the enemy wants to use blobbing there should be economical consequencesfitting the new array should use lots of cpu eg 5000 currently defensive structures does not use much cpu and industrial pos would really not benefit of such an array due to the high cpu usage maybe just some valuable moon pos with good materials like dysprosium promethium etc since these are strategic resources for strong alliances and thus deserve better defensive capabilities too furthermore the proposal is just a pos array so it is optional you fit it only if you want to economy should the array have a strontium fuel bay to burn some fuel or maybe burn lots of something else using such module on a well fitted pos should be somehow more expensive specially if its main usage is pos warfare this would also help ccp to improve the market giving miners some more jobs remember planetary pos might cause a huge impact on ice market people will unanchor lots of moon pos which used to hold sovereignty this must be counterbalancedccp work this does not seem to be hard to implement it is a new single pos structure it would be easy to ask for lots of new stuff for the planetary pos but a single array might be the the first step to change the sovereignty holding systemthats it thanks a lot for reading and please comment
so you want to make 00 more popular by making it even harder to attack and by making pos sieges even more like pulling teeth for those involved i cant imagine that working well
posting in favor of csm giving ccp a little hell for failing so epicly
i want my logo
i want competent ccp
logo  want it  want it now 
i like big butts and i cannot lie
i liked the old one betteri approve of the notion of having the old one play at startup and the new one play when you make a new char
o for the new introwhen you can lead theres nowhere you cant go is just the notion i feel when i play eve made me shiver when i heard it first timebuto for the old intro in support of playing both intros at different stages in game 
right now in wh space you will find about 1 in 4 systems have at least one pos within them best guess based off first hand experience there is no effective way to attack or remove these pos due to the stront timers due to the nature of wh space a wormhole very rarely lasts more than the time it takes for a tower to exit reinforced additionally the mass of ships that enter a wh and are able to effectively assault a pos are likely to destabilize the wh itself and find a large portion of the fleet trapped in wh spaceconsidering that the owner of the pos is always guaranteed to have access to nonwh space they will almost guaranteed be able to find and bring in additional stront once their tower shields regenerate i would say that this is an undesirable condition the solution is to change the way poss work i understand that ccp will be looking at revising sov with the next patch and as such there is a strong chance that they will also be looking into poss removing stront completely is also unrealistic as obviously there needs to be the ability for people to defend themselves i would recommend looking at a combination as to the defensive ability of pos weekend the amounts of shields hp so that you dont need as many ships along with increasing the consumption amount of stront during reinforced periods if stront consumption changes are not an option keeping the lenth of time a wh remains open would remain open is also a possibility but this can impact the current wh spawning balance significantly as well
not supportedyour logic is contradictingthe owner has to scan for an exit the owner has to find an exit that gets him to where he needs to go and the owner has to scan for an entrance back to the posi dont care who you are everyone has as much the same chance as anyone else to get in or out of the wh safely let alone within the same regioni was apart of an alliance that had a hell of a time just getting out never mind getting in they would find exits alright smack dab in the middle of 00 or worsenever anywhere near high sec and if they did it would be a long ways off from where they need to get tooyou should spend more time researching whs before making a massive suggestion to changing a mechanic such as strontthe owner is just as likely to not get back in time or have supplies let alone the tools to keep it up
there is no way to effectively attack it to begin with thoughyou bring in 25 bss for a large tower  that isnt a lot you close the wormhole behind you due to mass you reinforce the pos you now sit for 1d 16h waiting for the timer to run out now even if the wh doesnt close due to mass it closed due to time expiring on the wh i havent seen any last more than 36 hours you kill the pos but are now trapped congrats it isnt possible to effectively assult the pos the attackers need to have a reasonable chance of surviving and getting home they dont that is the issue
that is a whole different kettle of fishpos take downs have always been plagued with issuesthe only way you would be able to do such a thing is to squeez a cap fleet into whs from 00 good luck doing thatthe pos mechanics for defenses are too strong imo but we dont want to nerf them eitherdont use whs as an excuse to getting the job done just use it as a amplification of the problem already present in real space
i think youre being pessimistic here first off you cant get trapped in a wormhole  theres always a way out bring a covops to scan you a way back out second you dont even need to leave the bs in place  leave the covops inside a few hours before it comes out scan down a hole move your fleet to it jump through if thats not big enough repeat the process if youre assaulting a large pos you really ought to have the ability to keep a spare man on hand to do your scanning and hell be cloaked and safed so theres no real risk of losing him this is a concern but youre overstating it horribly
how economical is it exactly to run a large deathstarstar in wormhole space anyways theres no minerals to create passive income and the only income at all comes from ratting
dont troll things you obviously have no bloody idea what your talking aboutwhs may not be 00 but it is just as every bit as profitablethe trick is transportation it may not be popular as its quite frustrating to nail down a consistent pattern for ingressegress
you neeed to realize that in 00 this is a complementary source of income for some playersi dont think removing the modules from the loot table would helpor maybe in empire it would but for 00 it would be a major issue
signed1i dont know why every race can see gallenteamarrminmatar fit and we have to think about what caldari perhaps got on their ships2its a very important detail seeing missiles be dropped by random spot is very bad
ok you can even tank 2 or 3 if you fly the right thing and fit it well but have you found anything that can tank 810 no i didnt think sotitans are no longer doing as they were supposed to do they were supposed to be the jewel in an alliances fleet the flagship and a statement of power now theyre being used in large blobs which is game breaking for everybody else something must be done and this idea is as good as any ive seen
its a neat idea but problemyou can fire once per minute at worst it takes 4 mins to kill a dread 4mil ehpi deploy 4 titans on grid so they can onevolley any dread how are you going to kill my titans nowits a nice idea but lets face it it makes them neigh on invincible in groups
yes yes a thousand times yes
bring 50 battleships and couple of dictors of course its a shocking idea for capitals online
support for deathstar like gunsstill not one minute rof but 5 minute rof  no onehit dreads plzyue
whines incoming from people that dont want their i win button nerfed
youd deploy more dreads  deploying 10 to kill 5 titans wouldnt work the dreads would diedeploying 50 to kill 5 titans youd lose some but the titans would die this is a sensible balance  titans cost a lot more than dreads you shouldnt be able to take an equal number of dreads to an equal number of titans and expect to win the fight 
titan gangs alphastriking dreadnoughts with death rays once every minute is if anything even more unbalanced than titan gangs with 250km aoe weapons popping subcaps once per hour especially as unlike dreads subcaps can warp out before the dd hits
still supporting as i already wrote it in vuks topic alsoi think area dd should be kept but with much less dmg output fighting off dronesfightersfrigs and with some tactical bonus like an ecm burst and focused dd should instapop a dread or any non supercapital to maintain balance a couple of dreads kill of a titan pretty swiftly if the titans solo but the titan should be able to send to hell a few of them before going down even if hes soloand yes titans were meant to be fleet command ships look at their bonuses with antiblob capabilities but these days none of its bonuses nor the clone vat bay and ship hanger is used at all people use only dd and it shows that dd is way too much overpowered
not when titans can be killed by a large bs fleet without fear of dd riskrewardbalance is effectively rewritten but still very much there
i give support for this but with one minor modificationdo not move target painters to high slot make a new weapon modification or sensor equipment that sits in the high slot and gives similar bonuseswe already have sensor equipment that goes in high slot auto target array just make one that puts a secondary lock on a target so you can get better triangulation or some such reason
not remotely supported this idea is almost beyond ridiculouswhere do you get these most of x fit x ideas froma rapierhuginn pilot chooses to either be disruptcapable or not even with usual mwdlselse tank this leaves three slots for either triple webs2 webspainterwhatever and given the relatively poor damage output of either the split system huginn or 23 gun rapier what sane recon pilot is going to dump that slot for a friggin tpohand the tp is an indirect form of ewar it does no damage drains no capactually it does nothing offensive at all unless certain weapon types are fired at the selected targetand tough noogies on boohoo caldari which is what i rather suspect you are trying to buffgo away
24 hours is just too long20 hours would be about right 20 hours would allow you to jump somewhere late at night and permit you to jump back at a reasonable hour the next day
who ever said this needed any fixing
people that arent biased
i guess thats for the current csm to decide
so if one of these competent small alliances doesnt control the space around thier tower doesnt that make it easier for a big alliance to come in and stomp on them
minerals being finite is reasonable however moons are pretty big celestial ojects so depleting them should logically be a very long processrandomising respawns i find harder to justifying since moons logically i know its a game so physics can be bent but dont just turn up or suddenly change their mineral compositionalso a bit unfortunate if you are small alliance living quietly and suddenly have 3 dyspro moons and a horde of larger alliances on your doorsteppersonally i would go for a combo of reducing current yield form a moon and introducing random comet spawns from deep space that have maybe a one month duration we already have a mechanic for it with wormholes
so that nobody bothers to fight for a valuable region they just sit in their own corner and wait for the respawn dice to fall in their favourto the op how do you intend to define home space exactly if pandemic legion want to control dyspro moons scattered throughout the west they could just declare our home space is fountain and cloud ring and jump through whatever sovereignty hoops were set up to make it happen the fact that pl have been able to occupy the moons in cloud ring and syndicate and aridia and prevent anyone else from taking them away suggests that they do control those regions doesnt it
i believe the current system of nerfing ships is really bad but the ops idea of autobalance is plain worse no supportinstead what should happen when a faction invents a new overpowered weapon the other factions should invent a counter to it instead of reducing whats in the game by nerfing boost whats in the gamehow do you explain from an rpg point of view that the caldari could build ecm that reaches 250km and now they cant anymore did space change did physicsnow plz dont hit me i know the proposals im making are not well thought through they would lead to further imbalances still maybe you can see my point and make something of itfor example the speed of the vagabond was and still is overpowered by far now while speed nerf was a good thing in my proposal the other races should have invented webbonus ships web bubbles or maybe a ship with a nice tracking bonusplaying the falcon was a unique fun experience that required training and preparation i made around 250 bookmarks to fly my falcon efficiently in my region and now im primaried while being 70km from the fight falcon diesinstead the other races should have increased their eccm abilities improved the basic electronics or constructed an interceptor that could come at me and be immune to ecm for a while
everyone should only fly noob ships
ok heres my 5 cents on the filter systemfirst of all i like the corpmate filter idea in the op but as it wont happen how about you guys just scrap the 2 week limit on corpinternal contracts and make it possible to set them to infinite corpiespecialoffers problem solvedthe xjump filter is very nice and fun on filtering sell orders but completely worthless on filtering buy orders i dunno if ccp just didnt think of this but filtering buy orders will remove ranged buyorders in stations more than x jumps away even when your own station is in rangeso for example im buying in a 10 jumps range per buy order and i want to see whether im still highest bidder turning filter on to 10 jumps and then wondering why im still not buying crap cause theres a regional buy order 15 jumps away
salvage has a corporate tag on it it belongs to the corp if wrecks arent owned by anyone why do they have a ownership tag on them and why cant you use tractor beams on other peoples wreckslikewise calling ninja salvaging a profession is like calling can flipping a profession its greifing which i have absolutely no problem with but its greifing without any risk whatsoever a person that salvages a tagged wreck should be flashy to that corp for 15 minutes this wouldnt end ninja salvaging it would just make it have some negatives if you dont like ever being flashy go use your scanning skills to find plexes and anomaliesinsofar as the argument about how much time it takes to train scanning skills goes its pretty obvious that it takes much longer to train combat skills and scanning skills were meant for scanning sss and for finding anomaliesplexes sorry but if you want to compare all lvl 5 scanning skills you need to compare them to a all level 5 combat skills yea bout that i really cant even understand the logic behind the current ccp stance the fact is that you are destroying or looting however you look at it the wreck when you salvage it and the wreck is a corporatetagged entity a corporation should be allowed to protect its assets bring ninja salvaging in line with the rest of the game you salvage it you get aggro the other solution is to take tags off wrecks i thought they didnt belong to anyone anyways does the loot in the wreck belong to someone then or is that up for grabs also it just doesnt make sensein my personal opinion deadspace should operate like low sec in that you can attack and concord wont come but you get global aggro if you initiate combat i mean deadspace isnt the point that its a pocket of space that no one is supposed to know about except the people that scan it or the agent thats gives out the bookmark but thats probably way to unpopular
to all those who won in the recent csm election congrats
i will consider my term a success if by the time its over all you kids who never lived in 00 space want to live in 00 or at least hang out and do things there
this saturday and today in order of questions asked
i would like to thank all those who voted in this election especially those who voted for me  i am encouraged by the number of people who had a positive response to the csm so farthanks to everyone involved at ccp as well now to wait for the results
well looks like my one and only shot at csm didnt happen thanks to everyone who did vote for me
with the election period being over i would like to thank everyone who voted for me sincere regards to all those of you who found the time to post their encouraging words here or sent me personal mail while i am listening to the critical voices  the few who achieve to remain respectful in that  in my goal to improve myself it is of course always nice to see some nodding heads within the silent majority
although you did not get my vote mr finnegan i am pleased that someone will carry on all of the work of your predecessor congratulations and best wishes o7my candidate took last place but at least theyre in i hope that you are able to work well with meissa anunthiel to accomplish mucheditps your first order of business must be to force ankhe to take a break before she wears herself our from exhaustion dont buy into the excuse of her having to get a job jobs are highly overrated and theres plenty of time to work later she will do fine
thanks to the 900 folks that voted for me this term while i did not win a seat i am the first alternate i will promise to take that role seriously and do what i can to represent you all as best i can in that capacityi will continue to try and develop the voice of reason party in preparation for the next election since everyone knows iceland is best in the middle of winter issler
just buy one from a current owner prices may be high but the prints are available
vik luk for csmalso lets make him the chair again to keep some idiot monkies that could be elected under control
big thanks to everyone who voted for me as much as i wanted chairman position i am glad i didnt get biggest votecount cause i promised that i will post my nude pics on caod incase i get iti am looking forward to csm 30cheersvuk lau
congratulations to the winning candidate with the most quiet election thread loli dont know how you managed to pull it off someone besides myself must have voted for you best of luck to you i hope that you are able to work very productively with the other csm members o7
hehe thanksim not much of a forum warrior i read a lot and talk littleas for how i pulled it off ive tried to get more personal with people with no big alliance backer and not being famous in addition to being relatively young i believe that was the right approach took more effort but ultimately apparently was worth it and ill definately work productively with all other csm members who are willing to have discussions about the topics they bring up or others bring up im not the holder of universal truth but im far from an idiot too i believe the best policies are forged through combinations of efforts and constructive criticism i think theres a good mix of people in the csm 3 some of whom are verifiably of a collaborative nature so im looking forward to seeing how it all pans out and thanks again for the votes
thank you to everyone who supported my candidacy eagerly awaits the results

however many people are attacking or defending it always boils down to initially jumping through a gate even with the current dd mechanic we see some factions stuffing 1400 people plus titans into local to defend a system from time to timehowever let us not forget that the vast majority of battles in eve involve 300 pilots or less and the work done on improving server performance means those fights are generally pretty lag free removing the current dd mechanic would mean those fights are likely to happen more often under a jammereven in the larger fights better to have a laggy fight than no fight at allpeople are already doing this capitals are the new battleships is often said but maybe overstates the case however dreads and carriers have an effective counter in themselveswith regard to tower spam well it already happens with towers on every moon in 50 moon systemswhatever you do with titans those two facts remain numbers count and you need the 51 server performance will continue to improve to manage the former and sov mechanic changes will take care of the last let us hope that those things are considered alongside a supercap redesignmore fights less dissapointing boom
well vuk theres alot of decent thoughts and well presented but it doesnt seem complete yet and tbh it seems to be quite far from complete youre on the right track and a nice compilation i like how you pulled in yaays idea and gave him credit for it for exampleill elaboratehp buff on all supercaps  i think most players agree that this is needed we start to see people that even set up traps for titans one of the latest ones comes to mind where support that are onetwo jumps out wont even reach the kill in time to get to fire on itget on the killmail its pretty ridicilous considering the timeisk investment for those ships in this example youre just stating something necessary  support on thismothership vs titan roles  this is where your ideas arnt really complete or halfdone right now the mothership idea is basicly do let it play more of a logistic role which is interestingintriguing but you dont provide a full solution to itin the titan case you provide yaays idea which is interesting as well but still not complete by removingnerfing the dd it affect alot of players skill training not just the current role if its removed it needs to have an important new role for the titans the suggested idea is interesting but more like the remote ecm burst  an obutton instead of an offensive weapon would you train it to lv5 id get it to lv4 and no furtheritd need some more thoughts on what titans would get instead since well yah most of us agrees that the dd is over the top today but titans are damn squishy and having just the portal and the new idea would reduce them to a logistic ships theyd be a passive ship that sat at pos just like the mothershipsas for the olympians that does sounds like a role the titans could fill we dont need new supercaps fix the ones we have first and if titans loses their dd why not give them this role so what am i sayingthe ideas you present are good but unless it has a full package i cant give you any supportapproval its quite massive changes to the pilotsill give you that i like how you are thinking of ways to make the motherships more aggressive and instead of giving them damage to give them more healtha unique repairsupport role it might just put them on the field againfinish your ideas give a full package and if it seems reasonable youre on the right track ill definately support it
you wouldnt train dd 5 if the difference was 40 heat damage vs 32 heat dmg at lvl 4 thats like titan pilots now choosing lvl 4 dd which is incredibly easy to tank vs lvl 5 dd which is much harder in a lot of ways this type of dd would be nothing like an eccm burst it has 2 lingering affect and 2 obnoxious effects its still dealing damage but massively reduced depending on the dd type it might not even make it through a bs shields heat damage is not a quick fix which means people are going to struggle to overload their weapons and mwds in hairy situations neuting is going to provide more of a role for minmatar and caldari boats in fleets since atm they have the worst sniping abilities and warp scrambling is going to avoid hit and run capabilities if you do get hit by the dd allowing mop up fleets to get on grid and react immediately and to some good effect while exposing the titan for more time after a dd is fired that to me is the greatest effect since you will likely never see a pack of rouge titans launching dd after dd with little or no support fleet anymore
absolutley and completely yes super caps need reajusting now i say olimpians should have that emeryan age vid wepon
yes yes and yesxz
at first i thought this was a terrible idea and then thought about itgoing to support this as it has very little effect for when pirates are shooting neutralspirate 1 is shot at by neutralspirate 2 reps pirate 1 and then opens up on neutrals giving gccpirate 2 gets primariedpirate 1 reps pirate 2 and for reppin someone with gcc gets his own gccsupporting this i mean its not like its easy being 10 anyway so surely this cant hurt
clarification questionwould someone giving rep to a target incur aggro to their aggressor in this scenarioexampleoutlaw with nonoutlaw friends outlaw is attacked by another fleet outlaw receives reps from nonoutlaw friendsdoes the other fleet now have the option to attack the nonoutlaw reppers without a gcc

great proposal
would want this clarification as well

mods helped kill wows fun factorif you cant play with what ccp gives you request something else or play something else
i like how all the criticism is either1 eve shouldnt do it because wow does it2 i dont understand the concept of a dumb terminal and think that it well let people hax hurr hurrsuck it up and let us mod already
sorry anyone who mods the game for themselves instead of putting their ideas up for public discussion is taking the game too seriously for my likingnot supportedben
hello no the only way for that to even remotely work would be a model along the lines of apples ipod software market not touching that with a 10au pole
if i see more than just pl and goons supporting this  and pl guys even with standardized messages than ill support it too but so far it looks like plgoon pushing their own agenda of getting yet another advantage in a full pvp game where every advantage counts
most of the criticism on the other hand is either no it wont work because ccp will allow us to make hacks or no everyone will hog all the good mods for themselves and standard assembly hall troll posts so do we like the bad interface of eve or something nowso someone should come up with some valid reason why ccp shouldnt allow players to modify the interface and saying something from the above paragraph isnt a valid reason a bad idea is a bad idea but throwing illogical andor unsupported criticisms around doesnt make a lot of sense
could we get away from this goonpl forum bashing lets bash them ingame yeah even they have good idea sometimes and i think a lot of people would like this idea implemented not to do it themselves but so that some goonspy could leak their newest interface xdkidding aside i am sure that some great work would be done and then shared and a lot of people would get something they like more then the current
think of it as ccp giving us the tools and framework to add features to the ui that the player base would find useful some examples would be filters for chat channels removing portraits from channel lists and leaving just the name changing the ing font to something more readablewhy is this a bad thing
raises hand
and seriously id hope people whom dislike pl or goons due to in or out of game imagined or otherwise infractions have the maturity to put that aside regarding game development and proposed changes
no i dont like the ui interface but if i have to choose between a group of players getting way too much advantage through 3rd party programs released only for their own membership and the ui interface to which i adaptated over the past 3 yrs i have played this game then yes i will stay with the interfaceif you want me to rephrase my opinion in a negative way to this proposition how is this  it may leave room for too much abusewish we could but just as with politics if the person i voted for is elected i expect to do stuff in my own interest  on a sidenote i voted for lark because it is hard to get a pirate into csm
counterpoint evemon was a goon project evemap is a goon projectyeah we dont release stuff to the general public
standings in local also was a goon project that helped you a lot you didnt release it but ccp still leveled the playing field by releasing something similarand before you give another example in the gridfu pdf file that was released because your enemies knew of it and it didnt matter at that point 
the local portraits had to be updated based on the corp membership constantly with some dude doing tons of work its physically not possible for them to provide it for everybodygrid fu was an exploitalso i dont have any idea why you think that all the programming talent is within the ranks of big alliances and nobody outside a big alliance will do any work and nobody is interested in making a name for themself by making the best ui everalso nobody shares eve api apps the only good api apps are in the hands of pl
the logserver change that broke bacon also severely crippled the portrait packnot that the pack is needed anymore since ccp said hey good idea and implemented their better due to lack of upkeep versionto build off of what mazz says in the bit i quoted i know we dont trust api programs built out of house were always concerned about spies and the web based api using programs we develop in house are linked to our auth system it isnt something easily exported for general usenone of this has to do with ui scripting though it was merely a point to demonstrate that we do release stuff to the general public
i guess this is a good idea recently got into a guardian myself and it would be nice to be on the killboard
yeah thats a bit missing
has been suggested a few gazillion times in fi and as a long time logistics pilot i really do support this
if it helps get more logistics into the fleets im in then im all for it
yep
i want industry patch before walking stations besides they need more time for station walking than they do for industryfix the things that already exist and dont work right before creating more new stuffwhy hasnt ccp grasped this simple concept yet
when someone scoops your drones the thief should be flaggedi lost connection yesterday when i had my ogre iis out and came back to find someone taking my ogre iisnot a whine thread since its only a couple of mil but still can get very annoying when you have to travel to get some more drones cause someone got away with taking themwould like discussion not troll or flame pleasethanks
i dont like it there are perfectly good drones floating around all over space these days people should be able to scoop em up and put them to good use
they are free game like salvage
if you dissconnect drones should automaticly return to the drone bay but if the ship warps out before they retur then when you log back in you should be able to reconnect to them like a probe
i agree with this the op is a bandaid fix for a problem that shouldnt be there
i agree with the idea that you should be able to reconnect to your drones in the event of a disconnect or warp out and warp back since they end up looking the same to the dronesi could especially see this as being useful for carrier pilots since they may not even be on the grid with the drones when they dc i thinkbut scooping unattended ie uncontrolled drones shouldnt be a flaggable offense fix the real problem dont compound the error
as long as they are connected to you they cant be stolenif you warped off then you left them in space as junk to be picked up really just bad performance and choices on your partstop trying to play eve on easy hellokittymode and not supported
taking loving care of poor abandoned drones is not a crime abandoning isau contraire stealing control of drones would seem to be a useful addition to current warfareas for the hellokittyonline comment people crying for concord help whenever a bad bad thief steals anything else cans loot etc from them are not really entitled to ridicule other greedy bastards stealing should not be considered any different from scamming people out of their money
littering should be punished by having your litter stolen edit oh my gawd new icon look at how space important i am now

always wondering why this is not possible
i remember this yeah i would love to have this reimplimented
basic feature ought to be implementedalso dont make log off close and restart the eve client i know its the easiest way to implement the feature but that is lazy
yes
good idea but this has to go with a a password on corporate and capital ship hangars
as we all know ccp put some new agents in the game in apocrypha 11 and the list has just come outthe totals2x gallente navy1x fed intel4x caldari navy6x corporate police force2x spacelane patrol1x ishukone watch1x sukuuvestaa1x hyasyoda1x lai dai protection service4x brutor tribethus the totals stand at3x gallente16x caldari4x minmatar0x amarrnow ccps reasoning is most people run missions for caldari so lets add more caldari agents to spread out the populationi say this is the wrong approach most people run missions for caldari because they have the best and the most agents allowing selective missioning turning down lessprofitable missions and moving on to the next agent only caldari can afford this very profitable selective missioning because of the sheer amount of agents they currently have almost as much l4 combat agents as the rest of the empires combinedinstead of making mission running more viable by adding more agents of the other races they went the opposite way and just made the situation even more extreme this is extremely bad game design instead of encouraging players to truly spread out more and consider running missions for noncaldari agents they make running l4 missions for caldari agents even more profitablelets look at the best agents that have been addedgallente l4 q18 in 07 space the catch being that this agent has the potential to send players to old man star which is lowsec factional warfare space it also has 4 adjacent systems which makes the odds rather high to be sent out of systemgallente l4 q16 in 07 space one system next door and its in solitude good luck running your mission ship through 00 to get there okay this is a nice and welcome boost to the people that live in solitude though like meminmatar l4 q15 in 08 space no lowsec and only two adjacent systems thoughnow the caldarikia isatoh l4 q18 06 three adjacent systems of which one lowsec sucks right wrong no stations in adjacent systems so this one wont send you out of solar system at all if he does send you 2 jumps out to lowsec then just go to uuhulanen where youll find your next l4 agentkonuoma ichodan l4 q17 05 one adjacent systemurpiluola samiwa l4 q16 06 one adjacent systemsotrentaira isara l4 q15 05 two adjacent systems with stations can send into lowsec 2 jumps awayoduma onnajus l4 q18 07 three adjacent systemshunen arekila l4 q16 07 four adjacent systemsso instead of adding l4 agents to the factions that need them amarr gallente minmatar and how about sisters of eve which have a grand total of 2 l4 agents in highsec ccp decides to boost caldari even more yeah that makes it really hard to choose who to run missions for and really makes me wonder why so many players run missions for caldari and hardly anyone for amarr another thing that indicates this wrong approach is ccp adding agents for the corps that already have plenty of them instead of making other corporations more viable by adding some more combatagents to themthis issue demands 23 new highsec l4 agents added for each noncaldari factionedit this is the wishlist of agents if they let me ill punch them into the database myself i tried to keep things balanced as much as possible and introduced a few small mission hubs nothing as unbalanced as the caldari already have for the various factions i also added some agents for some of the problematic corps mainly minmatar the rest of the agents are just solitary l4 agents in outoftheway systemswhile i was creating this list i noticed that amarr and especially minmatar really lack 05 systems with stations in them usually if there was a goodlooking 05 system it had only caldari stations in it even in amarrgallenteminmatar space
ill agree it is a bit on the edge especially given then debate on level 4s and low sec but this new agent seed strikes me as a stopgap solution they are trying to see if they can further a trend with itthe idea is to tempt people away from their normal current high sec overpopulated mission hubs quite possibly with a hindthought of hoping the people running the industry in such overpopulated hubs will follow the mission runs to alternate locationsprobably that is why theres an overweight of caldari involvedif it works it may indeed lessen the stress on some places and smarty indy folks may very well discover new geographical niche markets
never thought id agree with someone who campaigned to be elected on a i got boobs and a mini campaign and who is what some ppl call a glorified pure carebear 
i do agree with most things but another reason for alot of people mission running for caldari is that there are alot more caldari pilots out there who fly mainly caldari ships and in doing so would prefer caldari items from the lp store and thus run but on the main part i do agree that agents for other races are indeed lacking for the amount of lvl 4s in high sec but mainly for higher quality agents missions for the caldari corporations and the fact that caldari are getting alot more new agents where as amarr get nothing zilch all  nadawitch over all does not encourage people to do missions for the other races at all
this move will entice players using amarr agents to switch to caldari as they already have high standings with the faction and would have a easy time getting to the best agentsadding several high quality amarr agents would have got the opposite effect
agreed ccp really need to stop making caldari best at all the pve activities see wspace missions ratting caldari pos etc
i think all factions should be on equal terms if a majority decides to roam caldari space and faces problems doing so these problems are the result of their own decisions they should not get a bonus for that adding more agents is fine with me but it should affect all factions equallyif there are more attractive mission hubs for other factions more players will eventually grind their standing up to run missions elsewhere
yarly
signedthe existing mission system does not scale there is no real intensive to move to the lower quality or more dangerous missions agents
agreed
redistributing current agents would have likely been a better choice to solve the issue they were attempting to solveas for adding agents these agents offer nothing different from the agents they are counterparts to they did not add combat or additional high level agents to rd corporations as an examplein general ccp needs to sit down and figure out what they want their mission system to be and what endgame they want the pve dedicated player to have it isnt a gateway to factional warfare or 00 missioning players are simply not taken along that path
updating op with a list of agents i think should be added to make the other factions somewhat more competitive without being unbalanced
agreed said the same thing on vent last night 
agreed while having more highsecurity level 4 agents in space is nice the distribution really needs work in focusing on the other 3 races for pve just because crapdari are the masters of pve apparently does not mean that nobody does missions in any other race of ship nor with any other factionsupported
a half support from meneglecting one faction over another should not happenhowever you dismissal that agents should be added to lowsec instead of highsec is a mistakeedit so is this the tone for eriks csm term his master answering for him just as it was for the elective campaign
i agree also
ccp was looking for a stopgap solution to lag which this proposal isnt that said if theyre looking for a longterm solution this is the way to go make the other factions half as good at highsec missioning as the caldari and you wont have nearly the same problems with everyone living in caldspace that you do at present also in a similar vein can we get a batch of caldari lowsec agents like the other factions get put l4q20 agents in systems like ienakkamon and saranen and see if you cant move some of those caldari missioners to lowsec wont be many who go of course but there should at least be the option like the other factions get
ccp asks the communitys opinion on other things in advance why not with this idiocy
more agents for the depopulated races will not suddenly cause a massive change in mission runner distributionmore agents for caldari will reduce the load on the busiest mission systems this is a good change although they could have added the same numbers all around

sounds sensible to me means limiting exploitation by those fighting against your militia without exposing themselves to counterattacks by your militia
ironic perhaps  but weve always felt that lowering the entry barrier for wars in this theatre is a good thing the proposal makes sense to me happy to support it
well done on getting elected larkonis  how do you feel about making this one of your first issues to formally promote at the csm level 
it would be very helpful if the skill that affects the fitting requirements of a module not only the skill needed to install and operate it in the first place was listed in the module description most of the time you simply have to find out somehow because it is often a riddle wrapped in an enigmaguns would list weapons upgrades and advanced weapons upgrades but it would be most helpful for the less obvious modules and skills like electronics upgrades and their likes they often just list some egs which usually leave out half of the affected systemseft already does it why cant eve itself do it ingame
as long as they figure out a clean way to display the data yes probably stick it as a list below the requisites listedit i read this proposal as being what cardinality said please list all affecting skills
support my good friends
you and the guy above you forgot to press the support buttons
i would think that pos assaults would look a very different in wspace compared to known space because of the large fleet logistic difficulties described in this thread instead of a direct assault on the pos what about a seige of the system to starve out the pos and its defenders dont attack the tower  scan down and camp the wormholes and scan down and attack the defenders any time they leave the pos dont allow them to bring in more fuel when the pos runs dry and the shields drop or when you pod the last defender out of the system  you win

what are you saying the players have to think about things and suffer the consequences if they do not what an outrage
hi there i must say that with the changes presented in apoc 12 ccp dropped the ballwhile i agree that making war targets blinky on overview was pretty cool the fact that you made outlaws non blinky was notanother issue is the fact that player has positive standing is now below player is outlaw on the default overview leading to some hilarious mistakes immeadiately post patch fortunately none involving my corporationsoreset the blinkyness of outlawsplace player has positive standing above player is outlaw on the default overview settings

weve all been victims of bad directions when double clicking not quite heading off just where we wanted or even worse trying to coordinate cloaked ship operationswhat id like to propose is a right click in space or even a series of text boxes under the center panel where you could input a couple angles and a speed angles are based on local ship space and speed in meterssecond they update as you wander around but you can type in there and hit the little navigate button that should be right there00100 is 100 meters per second directly at the sun1800100 is 100 meters per second directly away from the sun900100 is 100 meters per second at a tangent to the sun if one were to circumscribe a circle around the sun passing through the ship aligned as closely to the system ecliptic as possible or as aligned to the same plane as the tactical overlay ends up being at where the sun would be off to the left of your ship1800100 is 100 meters per second at a tangent as above except the sun would be off to the right of your shipor if not based off the suns position at least off the cardinal points provided by the tactical overlay just so that we can get more precise movement in space imagine the pretty lines you could make with ships turning in formationfcs could call out directions and have the squad all hare off in the same direction or even betterpunch in a direction and get the squadwingfleet to align with him freeing them up from having to navigate and instead concentrate on managing their targets remote rep cap and everything else involved in a small gang fight and for the devs imagine the fewer calls out from the 2030 clients asking to get their directions changed when you can get one poke from one client to align and move a bunch at once120 mark 30 at 14 impulse mr sulu

if you want people to take you seriously id advise revising your proposal with some actual reasons or even some words why you think such drastic action as opposed to say ideas for fixing the drones is warranted
reported for spammingnext time put a little more effort into your post and less time emoraging like a moron
on a side note i expect the time they finally get around to fixing drones there will be patch notes right guiselike the time before and before that and then that other timelul
now that we have a new csm im hoping we can get some love for this
make it simple you dont disappear if you disconnect whilst you have aggro your ship stays until the bitter end if you log when jumping through the gate but cloak drops and you get aggro before the 30 second timer expires so be it it may lead to some losses due to real disconnection issues but would remove the exploitsupport the idea of removing the logging exploit

this is where you say pwned isnt it
dont forget about lowsec
it looks like a good group and i wish them all the best of luck in their term
i congrat the csm councilhowever i think it should not be allowed to have more than one member from thesame alliance
i take it youre personally removing pos warfare from the game then
by making empire space even more unbearable than 00 i assume
i am wondering how everyone could ever live in 00 when clearly the large alliance will always control that space just as they do today since a lot of the new csm are members of large alliances maybe making everyone be in a large alliance is the plan by the way i can get anyone that wants to join goonswarm in for just 500 million isks contact me for details sadly i am worried this election will mean not getting low sec fixed or addressing some basic issues like volume of ore in high seci hope i am wrong but not a lot of carebear candidates made the slateissler
whatthe csm is four 00 players four empire highsec players and an empire lowsec player thats a good group right there
congratulations new councillorsi wish csm 30 all the best in good wisdom and so onim happy to see meissa sophie vuk and omber made it to csm 3 to continue what we builded and ofcourse congratz to the new chairman who also was csm in csm 10i hope to see you all on fanfesto7 extreme 1st alternate csm 20

thanks extremebeen a pleasure during csm 2 maybe at csm 4next time think about putting up sexy pics you may become chairwomanhowever if youre going down that route ill put nekid pics of my exgf the more votes i get the more ill put now that sounds like a plan p
congrats new csmrs now get to work telling ccp about all thr problems if you dont get them fixed i will not vote for you next time
chair sounds like a ton of work are there any perks for getting third place or for that matter is there any difference between 2nd through 8th
yup 2nd place is receiving much more isk and items from eve shop as reward then 8th place
congradulations and to ccp i suggest you have fresh ripe pineapples waiting in tribute you do not want to anger our one and true lord

game news  dev blog  see
thanks
sigh
nice to see an actual reply by you and not by your master
congratulations erik i was quite sure from the start that you guys are not to be underestimated
did you or your puppet master write that
awww too bad that so whats the ratio of pvp alliance kids vs carebears on the council nowstill i suspect some of the elected members will be similarly present on the council as they were in this forum so i guess well see you up there instead a lot would love to lend a hand with your party if youll have me btw
so looking at the results it seems the winners were biased towards being members of large alliances and largely pvp focused i dont see the carebear representative i hoped to be elected to be in the case of the take care party i expect that erik will largely be similar to ahk who he replaces id suggest reviewing the meeting minutes to figure out what to expect thereat any rate it gives me the time i really need to get the party idea truly launched expect more annoucements about that this summer with plenty of time before the elections begin to get some activties and ideas sortedagain thanks to everyone that supported meissler

bump for the new csm
just posting to show my support for this thread so far ive had limited piloting time in my vengeance not yet able to give my full educated support for or against the issue at hand because theres a lot of good argumentsdiscussion going back and forth in this thread definitely worth a bookmark and looking forward to more views from experienced af pilots out thereregards
10
support because right now theres no point in getting into an enyo if you can fly a ranis which outclasses it in everything except for a nonspeed tank
supportedyou enter in a fight you are not neutral anymore we need to start doing something about the neutrals who take sidesdoing it repeatedlywould that not usually involve that party into the war if there is a war going on  just one thought to making war decs more dynamic and uncontrollable both for the aggressor as for the aggressedand is there not also an improvement potential with neutral trafficker alliance war support out of highsec  that one is more tricky so solve though i will suggest something in another thread later
while the boss has rendered me many a wreck over the years in this i have to agree having seen a singe abaddon sitting on a station under the fire of no less than 7 bs and assorted support being repped by not one but six neutral repperslogis and watching each of those dock  immediately undock as soon as they were jammed or engaged it gets insanely frustratingnot only are they 100 immune to retribution for supporting our war target they can break ecm escape drones are invulnerable to damage and all the while continue to foul the entire field pointlesslyoptionif a neutral provides support for a hostile that individual gets flagged as a war target for the duration of the targets warim all for war declarations flagging individuals so that jumping corp does not shed said flag this would just be an extension of that

this one party goes hand in hand with this topic but i digress drone users are at a serious disadvantage when fighting under sentries although i have on occassion launched wave after wave of light t1 drones as chaff to buy me precious seconds to escape before my armour melts it is quite an irritation when fighting in a larger gang after about 60 seconds half your drones are gone removing significant capability from your gang more often than not one volleyd by the guns so any attempt at management are fruitlessagain you may hurf blurf and say well you shouldnt be outlaw but this would make more incentive for those dastardly pirates to stand and fight on a gate so you can crush their bones and plunder their booty and get saucy with their wenchesi understand this may have further complications with reference to hisec suicide gankingconcord etc would it be all that hard to just remove the kill switch for drones from all gate guns but not concordsentry guns no longer agro the drones of players who have a gccare aggrod to that factions navy
as always supporting my own topic
a big disadvantage to all pilots yet gallente ships ones especialy
meh im not too sure about this one i like the idea that a pirate gatecamp is at a disadvantage when it comes to stuff like that all i know is that when im solo engaging outlaws there drons being killed has saved me a few times pirates generally camp or roam near systems they live in from my experience and the fact youre fighting them on their turf should make the advantage swing back too them although im sure there would be a good alternative to clumsy gate gun agro mechanics you havnt given me one i can support yet so fire away
not supportedexploits mechanics in favor of outlawsif drones no longer got aggro then they could continue to do things for as long as the owners tanks holds outyou expect to be an outlaw then you should expect your job to come at a pricegate camp somewhere else where there are no gate guns or fewer gate guns at that rate
there are exactly two things sentry guns do to any camp involving several pirate ships1 it prevents them from using frigate sized ships2 it prevents them from using dronesi dont think it is that good of an idea to remove one of the few uses sentry guns still have
this wont be very popular and would make sentry aggro mostly pointless for anyone with a clue stealth domiishtar boostand rather than encouraging blobbingcamping gates how about looking at other means to encourage combat away from stationsgates etcnot overly supported without further justification
ive never really liked how eves aggro rules work  more things should shoot drones and drone statsor spare drone bay capacity should be built on the premise that theyre going to get shot now and then sleepers are a step in the right direction in this regard as far as im concerned the upshot of this is that i think youre going the wrong way to find a solution dont make sentries not shoot drones make them stop being stupid cheating npcs get rid of their infinite tracking to give drones some actual survivability and give them some sensible aggro rules as opposed to just random and the drones might well be a reasonable option
supported because carebears get to keep their drones in missions so why cant outlaws keep theirs when their gate camping change the agro or nerf drones in missions
not supportedget away from the sentries if you want to use drones
domis are cheap boost their lowsec usabilityone difficulty is that drones still need to be aggroed in highsec
missions dont involve gate camping comparing an orange to an apple  epic fail
funny statement targets are to be found at sentries 90 of the time
sorry this would make rr domis way too op
qftno this would make things very unbalanced and i happen to be a geddon pilot who uses drones allot even i see why this is a big no noxz
as a nonalliance pilot i would like to say hell ing no the eveserver seems to be becoming supercapitals onlinethere are too many of these ships already there are completely unbalanced in their favorunless of course you have fleets of hundreds of ships or dozens and dozens of capitalsno ing thanks
an anti cap role would just make titans the new dreds the area of effect poroposal is sound it would be a big decision to deploy titans after a change like this as it should be the problem really is multiple dds and this also covers that issue

i support the lack of gun aggro  thumbs up to that but im not sure if the rring ship shouldnt become outlaw flagged for repping an outlaw for a certain time periodnow while i agree its unfair to the blinky pie that the logistics gets gun aggro im not sure if its fair to everyone else that the logistics does not become outlaw flagged for repping an outlaw if that makes sense

good lord yes supporting the heck out of thistheres nothing so frustrating as having my own corpmate come under fire at a gate hes 10 and be completely unable to lend assistance with my logi im 10 too but hes in my corpnow if im in corp b hes in another corpalliance entirely and 10 and i choose to rep him well i deserve the sec hit but not the gcc if he is not the initiating combatantgranted i should not be allowed to jumpdock for the requisite time period after repping him if hes in my corp or not
i like that
yep
makes sense since helping someone kill someone with a gcc shouldnt be illegal
supportedno sense in receiving a gcc for repping an outlaw who is currently not doing anything you can rep neutrals in highsec with no complications practically why this one

excellent suggestion i love it
yes yes yes thank you for summarizing the mining suggestions and bringing up a fantastic new system especially the easy to tweak after implementation is important for any revolutionary approachtwo additional thoughts i want to tie the security rating of a system to the marshal idea and make the value implied by the effectiveness of marshal work in the jurisdiction constellation where the system is in i would toss in another sensation to mining sound  a mining scanner would be needed to detect the desired ore and you need to screen the rock moving the scanner probe around listening to the loudest beep or quickest beepbeepbeep where to start to drill now try and program a macro for that
the idea of using sound is really coolbut the needs of the hearing impaired or even people whose computers are in living rooms and family rooms amongst other family activities would have to be considered
thank you for your support of this idea  i assume this means the issue will be raised at the first meeting of the 3rd csm i am eagerly awaiting the conclusion of your encounters with ccp
thank you ankhe and the take care party response tonew dev blog new level 4 agents
people make mistakes and those mistakes shouldnt cost them valuable training time over the course of a yearlike plexs this item will be purchasable from the eve store and grant its buyer a card granting some kind of experimental neural remap treatmenthey neural remapping was just recently invented it would make sense for some technological advancement to be in experimentation i personally didnt have any regrets upon my neural remap but i have heard many a stories of people screwing up their remaps if that were to happen to me id be very frustrated situations like these will never be avoidable but they should be treatableyou can throw in the argument of people starting out characters before we had remaps and that this wasnt an issue however bear in mind that by the time newbies realized they had made a mistake it was alright for them to recreate a character with very low sp losses however when your high sp char gets its remapping messed up due to a lack of concentration in the right moment you cant just go ahead and recreate and frustration ensuesthese neural remaps shouldnt be easily obtained as they could be abused for faster skill training but hey if it pays for ccp thats fine maybe makes those remaps usable only once every few months

let me quote about gridfu being an exploit it was only prohibited around pos towers which means that in every other situation it is still being usedas for trust this is exactly why it should be in the hands of regular players you may not trust 3rd party programs built out of house but what is to say that we should trust 3rd party programs made by some 00 paranoid alliance about spies alliances like these have time and time again proven they will stop at nothing from a metagaming pov to reach their objectives  or must i remind you of why this forum now has a feature for disabling the viewing of pics and signatures 
if you have real programming tallent within your alliance and you develop an app that really helps you would you release it publicly so that even your enemies have access to it this may be internet spaceships but you guys take it way too seriously  
clientside mods should be limited to the visual expression of the client to the user with plugins focusing only on display datano data that gives information that the game does not require such as that new face in local or automated scan modes alerting of probes within x range ectso the color blind can have a plugin that suits them and the deaf ect datamining applets and macro behaviors would as ever be a eula violationlikewise ccp should implement client side thread monitoring specifically to watch for macro behavior
supported with the reservation that it should not be a top priority as i see it the ui as it is currently works but upgrades would be handy if community made mods can be integrated without too much work on the part of ccp then i am in favor if a project such as this one was to push future gameplay additions such as ambulation of planetary landing back too much i would not be in favor

if ccp werent so terrible at ui programming this wouldnt be necessary as it is
id settle for a native linux client
fw needs boost i am baffled to what lengths we are willing to go in the struggle to fix fw now we are suggesting ccp the right server layout  oh my god you know if ccp were attributing the right level of attention to fw then they would well be able to fix hardware issues related to fwwhat i want the other csm and eventually ccp to understand is the endgame potential which fw has once the vision is big enough and shared resources will flow to itthumbs up to every fw issue on the board
thumbs upi dunno if this has been worked on i think ive seen less desyncs or if its just a general lowsec issue but we it still gets unacceptably laggy when anything resembling a fight happens
i remember tryin fw once was with a small fleet looking for trouble when trouble found us fight started to go badly so i warped to a station long story short i died about a minute later with my ship not having registered any of the commands i had given it during that time good times never played fw after thati thought the general lag fix and ccps promise to investigate the later issues would have produced something more concrete at this point cant blame people who find fw lacking at the moment even though im out of it hope it gets fixed and developed before it goes belly up thumbs up
for many new players fw is their first taste of pvp does ccp think people are going to want to move on from it to the 00 endgame as ccp intends when their experience of pvp is a horrendous lag fest even with 30 man a side fleets
you are so full of yourself its not funny anymorethe issue was knocked back as it had already been raised and ccp acknowledged they were tying to fix the situation already raising it again would have been a complete waste of time

if its sitting in space its salvageannoyingly sometimes i can scoop the drones of a recently vanquished ship my kill or anyone elses but sometimes i try to scoop a drone and the game adamantly refuses since it does not belong to me tho the owners a wreck  corpse 1500 meters awayeverything drone related in eve is borked granted its far better than it once was but is far from efficient after all why cant i launch a ecm a web  a sentry at the same time
yeah logicalctrlq quits the game closes the client no are you surectrll or whatever quits the current character session and returns you to the character selection screenthey may not have implemented this due to caching the character data and having to dump it to bring up the selection again but then i dont have a clue
putting aside the tickling association of the one shield password mechanics with the pseudophysical foundation in star treks shield harmonics i like the standing attribute as an optional second choice for accesslet us discuss this issue together with the corp and alliance tool overhaul which suggests a refactoring of the access rights and privileges that would also take into account raukhos and zosteras worries as to hangar access
roy kh navy danera 06 q8 surveillance khanidi would love you forever if you somehow got just this one agent in
you are quite wrong on this you are prolly too politically correct to write or even realize this but the sad truth is that most people run for caldari rather than other factions because most people are lazy unimaginative plain stupid or any combination of these most basic human virtuesyou can already make much more isk from amarr and minmatar agents than you can make off caldari ones yet everyone and their dog sticks to caldari for mission running heck many cattle dont even realize that there are other corps than caldari navy that you can run missions foradding more agents for the other faction will not change that at all there are more than enough rarely used agents out there already especially amarr has some very good agent running locations as well but they are not nearly as heavily congested as the caldari onesand to cherrypick missions you dont really need a multiagent system though that makes it easier you just need some 75 faction standingi will agree though that definitely gallente and maybe also minmatar could use a little help when it comes to good highsec agents seems every fool running gallente missions goes to dodixie so those numpties need an obvious alternative but far more of these people in caldari space so adding more caldari agents than other faction ones is definitely the correct approachyou cannot educate people that do not want to be educated but you can ease the load these people place on each other and the rest of the universe which is exactly what ccp is doing by adding tons of caldari agentsnot that i would mind a few more agents for other factions in general decent l4 khanid in highsec for example would be very welcome
i can certainly agree if there are too many people in caldari space emphasize agents in other space gallente amarr etc to encourage people to spread out
edited for grammar the basis for pve must be right empires should be kind of leveledthen again i am wondering if it is the neutral undisputable static db which makes pilots and i mean the big massive majority of mission runners who leandro disrespectfully calls cattle move or stay in a certain area let alone choose their race to begin with or would you not deem possible there are other more subtle yet more powerful forces at work like my friends suggested that i do missions herewhile i agree with ankhes suggestion should we not also think about a more dynamic approach to agents why do agents have to stay in one station dont they have a private life why do agents have a fixed quality dont they participate in personnel progress programmes of their companies why do agents have a fixed quality when it comes to your standing dont you have favoured suppliers in your companyand one final thought you want to spread out pilots how about more mission rewards of the kind you did a great job here is the corporate card of a colleague of mine who is in need of a talented pilot just like you using personal standing towards that agent now in order to making him available to the pilot in question
cross post from dev blog  as per op request im sure others can validate the stats below however here are a few stats for people to look at with a break down of all agents by faction for basic agents rd event story line fw tutorial etc excludedfactionname agentcount caldari state 133minmatar republic 114gallente federation 113amarr empire 89ammatar mandate 48over all this shows that amarr is in some serious need of love over all agent levels although you could argue that ammatar mandate is a sub set of ammar but thats a moot pointnow lets look at the number of level 4 agents by faction regardless of divisionfactionname agentcount caldari state 25minmatar republic 19ammatar mandate 17amarr empire 15gallente federation 15this isnt too bad ammar actually has the best ratio of level 4s to the other main factions with amattar mandate best over all with a staggering 35 of agents being level 4 caldari has 18 of its agents at level 4 and gallante is the worst with 13now filtering for the following divisionsdivisionnamecommandintelligenceinternal securitysecuritysurveillancewe get the following statsfactionname agentcount caldari state 18minmatar republic 16ammatar mandate 14amarr empire 12gallente federation 11the same trend continues with ammatar having the best ratio and gallante having the worsthowever with the new agent counts this moves a little and and increases the overall number of caldari level 4s to over 30 what im trying to show is that if ccp want people to move around eve and populate more of eves systems and factions then its about time they stopped focusing on caldari and make other factions as attractive to the pve community
bug thumbs up for this ccp facepalm they really stepped in it deep this timecaldari l4 agents need to be moved more homogenously in their systems and the other factions need to have an equity of agents similarly spread throughout their spacewhile i may not be a fan of pushing l4 into lowsec they should all have at least the potential of lowsec missionslikewise warring factions should have their corps moved to allied territory minmatar corps in amarr space should be relocated to gallente or minmatar space likewise with amarr corps in minmatar space many of these are inexplicably science corps core complexion creodron et al
the thing is if people do their homework at least minmatar and amarr agents already are more attractive quite a bit more in fact but people are ignorant about that because as i said above people in general are lazy and other not very favorable things and of course after they are told by their buddies with the same mindset that caldari is good they never bother to do their own research run caldari missions too and tell their own buddies about it and so it spreads and the people smart enough to run missions where the grass is greener are also smart enough to not try to encourage everyone to do the same so the cattle herd doesnt get a whiff of that green grass and tramples itand that actually serves both sides the cattle dont know what they are missing and the more professional mission runners can continue to get richer undisturbedso serving caldari a lot more agents while adding a few to the other factions seems to be prudentthe only thing i can think of to really move the lazy mission runner blob somewhere else would be to move jita and the caldari starter systems there palso if you count ammatar as amarr which you damn well should imho you need to do the same for khanid
supporting thisalso thukker needs one station with couple of lvl4 agents in lonetrek region
i agree with the point you made and i did forget about the khanid soe and interbus so for completeness here we are total agents for khanid  44total agents for soe  68total agents for interbus  38khanid lvl 4 agents  14soe lvl 4 agents  7interbus lvl 4 agents  5with combat division filters as per original postkhanid lvl 4 agents  14soe lvl 4 agents  0interbus lvl 4 agents  2statistically caldari level 4s are jumping from 25 to 41 level 4 agents thats a 64 increase and makes them double the next nearest single faction minmatar 23 with an increase of 21 gallante are getting a 20 increase to 18 agents and ammar get nothing i personally dont think there is a need for more level 4 agents but there is a need for a more even distribution of the existing lvl 4 agents around the universe say no more than 1 level 4 agent within 2 jumps of another agent of simular level which would also break up a lot of the mission hubsi also believe that these new agents could have been more evenly distrubuted around the factions say 3 each for the main factions and the other 11 split between the minor factions such as soe and interbus khanid and the pirate factionsedit  minmatar agent increases corrected

a few months ago you tried to fix the lag and you had some success in reducing it but by no means removing ithowever lag is not the only problem in fw quite simply fw serves no purpose it is a huge drain on resources both personal and regional and the only benefits are in the pockets of the ship builders the combatants dont gain anything from shooting each other nor for capturing plexes aside from ranks and systemsworse yet fw is actually getting more broken capturing plexes in cloaked ships wth failplease ccp fix my war

this was the original detailed unpolished version of the idea click meits a bit more complicated and a work in progress as you see it there this here is just the distilled and simplified version just the barebones of that much more complex proposal  the start of it if you willlet me give you one simpler examplesuppose the following would be the way the modifier table would be populatedif agent location security rating  05 then modifier for that agent  07if agent location security rating  05 then modifier for that agent  15if agent location security rating  00 then modifier for that agent  30in this particular rudimentary example all income for highsec agents would be decreased by 30 income from lowsec agents would be increased 50 while income from 00 agents would be tripledso a lowsec mission runner will not only receive the higher isklp he gets now at the mission completion but npc ratsinside the mission would also have 50 higher bounties and drop 50 more loot on averagenow i am not saying this is the way the modifier list should be populated i was just giving a very simple example that is easy to understandof course as a start you could just as well initialize it as above but with 10 11 and 12 values unchanged for highsec 10 extra in lowsec 20 extra in 00 just to see how the system works offering negligible initial boosts but still noticeablelike i said how exactly will the amounts of the modifiers be determined is not an issue right now  how ccp chooses to adjust the modifiers later on thats a completely different issueand also i said that ccp can balance the rewards any way they see fit anything from fixedrate adjustments using the exact same coefficients the lp rewards are adjusted with or maybe some higher securityrating based adjustments factors up to a fully selfbalancing automated system that would balance the rewards of each individual agent or groups of agents across the eve universethe reason to do it on a per agent basis is because you can enter as many rules as you wantyou could have implemented it on a regional basis or a secrating basis or any other rule but having the table itself on the agent level makes the most programming sensei mean why bother with implementing a coarse grain system then go back on it to recode it ifwhen a finer grain is needed if you simply can implement the system for the finest possible grain but set the initial table values on a level as coarse as you desire it then refine it later with minimal extra coding  tldr  summary  example make mission npc rat bounties variable increasing as secrating goes downdo the same for their loot drops and wreck salvagethis means boost lowsec mission incomeif you disagree with anything in particular about the proposal just remember this thread is not really about the amounts of boosting andor nerfing needed in any particular area of the gameits about the possibility to make those adjustments in the first place by coding the system which would enable these adjustments to be made at all
i cannot agree with this topic it would only cause people to swarm to certain agents and leave others alone which is exactly what ccp doesnt want to happenim in favor of removing quality modifiers completely or reducing their impact however this too wouldnt solve the problemmission agents are a sticky subject they need an overhaul but they do work acceptably so ccp is focusing on the more important topics scanning 00 sovereignty and hopefully mining will be looked at soon tm 
thismission running is plauged with swarming of hubs due to quality and honestly quality is a total sham salvage is salvage is salvagemission agents should be reseeded in such a way to prevent swarming of hubs and even out the spread in such a way that people could relocate if systems got too busymodifiers would only make it worse
if i read you correctly youre basically suggesting that rat bounties be modifiable by agent this seemspointless people are willing to change agents for fairly small differences in income i see no reason why youd need to have this mod apply also since your proposal doesnt actually suggest that ccp do anything youre basically suggesting that they add a variable which will remain unused to increase database calls in a way invisible to the player so that they have the option to do something that they dont need to do in future i have no idea what problem youre trying to solve here but i feel quite confident that this wont do the trick not supported

you seem to have forgotten one key ingredient in your whinesauce  the gallentesee angel cartel faction ships are mostly crosses between minmatar and gallente technology and i dont know if youve noticed but most gallente ships armor tankthis is working as intended no reason to change
alright and what about serpentis shipsthose need matar and gallente tooand those ships are armor tankin tooim stil think angel cartel ships dont be needed to be armor tank shipsmy problem is there is none shield tanked minmatar faction shipi think angel ships should be

i completely agree as a new player only 4 months old who ran missions in empire my standings with certain pirate factions took a big hit i am unable to get it back to 2 even with diplo so cant run missions alone even if i wanted to i should be able to increase standings just like in empire by tagging along on missions of others and getting a faction boost everytime we finish a mission this would be another way to foster team play would not require more agents to be seeded and would not increase gate camping this needs to be addressed
disagree eve is a game and it should be possible to change your play style if you so desire not easy but possible also this is a good use of the epic arc system d
supported even tho shooting blues is awesome oo
as matters currently stand mission running is the only limitless source of income in eve that is open to all players from the moment they subscribemissions are not a limited resource and thus there are serious implications for the eve economy and particularly detrimental effect on other professions in eve chiefly mining trading and industrythe unlimited nature and ungated income that missionrunning as a profession creates aside from manhours and the net effect this has on eve create sources of isk that lack appropriate sinksas a direct result of the way mission agent quality scales and the spread of mission agents concentrating them in certain areas and amongst certain factions to mission rewards certain systems in eve have become missionrunner hubs or to put it another way hundreds of people crammed into a single system generating crippling amounts of lag and latency issues while depopulating vast other areas of the gamei proposea lowering of base mission rewards isk and lp across each available level of missiona dynamic incremental rewards system where faster mission completion time gives increased mission rewards lp and isk and better standings gainsremoval of all t1 meta 0 loot from missionsstoryline missions give significantly increased rewards increased isk loyalty points and a percentile chance of being rewarded with a faction goodies ammo andor modulesthis would maintain missionrunning as a viable and lucrative profession but reward those whom make an effort to excel at it or have invested significant sp or isk into pimped missionrunning boatsit would penalize the afk missionrunners and macroers that like to play eve offlineit would benefit traders and miners directlyit will encourage people to gang up to complete missions as fast as possible to the point where the gain in profitability was ruled out by a smaller slice of the cake more player interaction is goodfurtherthere are a limited number of missions each agent can give out each 24 hoursas a mission agent reaches the end of his quota the missions he offers have reduced isk and lp rewards by a sliding percentile scale supply and demand its a hirers market out there and mission agents no longer have trouble fulfilling high priority assignments for their corporationthere is a flat artificial cap on the number of missions that are allowed to be active in each system for each level of mission available the above is intended to directly force the breakup of mission runner hubs and even out the population over new edenit will encourage competition for resources between players and indeed corporations in a resource that previously was without end more player interaction is goodthe exact nature the numbers threshold and cuttoff points are not worth discussing here but on principle i offer this idea as a soloution

while i do not agree with everything you say i support the discussion on this subject and agree that agents should have variable quality which goes down when more players use the same agent a hard limit on missions per system goes a bit too far but reducing rewards based on supply and demand is certainly worth looking intocsm1 raised this issue long ago with ccp saying that in the short run they plan to add more agents okay weve just seen how short term that is and how that worked out  not and in the long run they do want something along these lineslowering the amount of reprocessable minerals from missions is also something i would support as it devaluates the lowsec minerals and negatively affects the miner professionideally i would like to see the casual player the type that only runs one or two missions per day and doesnt play every day largely unaffected as the people earning 10m per hour through missions arent the ones that are causing the problemsedit didnt think id support one of your topics but i suppose this gets my thumbsup on the principle of the discussion not necessarily all your solutions
mission running is the one thing anyone can do in eve hell its an integral part of a new players initial game experience and the most easily accessible handle from other mmos for someone to get aquainted with the game and have a frame of referencemaking missions a painful experience for new players or the casual missioner would be a mistakehaving many more mission agents evenly spread around eve would be the ideal situation in my mind someone should be able to find a mission if they look hard enough granted it may not be the level 4 or agent they were hoping for or of lower quality than is ideal the agent may be in lowsec or 00 or a part of highsec they have never been to but there should always be options open for people even if said options convince a player to broaden their horizons and do something other than missionrunning for the time beingi am in great favor of a hard or perhaps dynamic cap on missions offered per mission level per system it is the only real way to effect the breakup of missionrunner hubs other more conservative solutions would only lead to reestablishment of hubs in other areas and resumption of the same problems a month after changes
the thing is however that people often run missions because they can log into the game and immediately talk to their agent and get a mission this opposed to exploration of which a lot of time is first spent looking for a signaturefor casual players that only have one hour available there should be something they can immediately do upon logging into the game perhaps have the agent have one reserved mission per player per day is a solution but that sounds way too much like wows daily quests that or something tied into standing in some way which would also prevent people repeatedly rejecting missions even taking the standing hits because faction standing always entitles them to more missions even with low corpagent standing to get a more profitable mission
yes
wow or not that does make sense having one guaranteed mission of each mission level a day is logical from a rp point of viewi can imagine the system functioning much as the storyline or interlinking mission evemails from agentsedit that is to say it would probably necessitate some form of travel limiting that to 24 jumps to ensure people rent clustered together shouldnt be hard each downtime missions could be assigned and viewed through the missions or expeditions tab saving thousands of evemails with mission location determined on player position at downtime
oh and one more thing id like to discuss here is how to introduce scalable income sources those that increase according to the amount of players in lowsec and 00 which are preferable to running highsec missionsive always wanted to see alliances making use of and developing their space allowing the more carebear type of players to live there under some degree of alliance protection for mutual benefit i had that crazy 00 idea a long time ago with player citizens being able to construct small anchorables which would provide trade goods alliance outposts consume these trade goods if alliance outpost gets enough trade goods it attracts agents or whatever for which the players can run missions alliance gets a cut of the missionrunner income as protection money of which the pvpers can get paid something along those lines pvpers can then raid opposing alliance space and attempt to destroy the small anchorable structures or kill mission runnersstill thinking on how to make lowsec more attractive though im sure you have brighter ideas than i
id rather see a separation of agent quality system security rating and reward amount agent quality should only effect the standings required to access that agentrewards would be based upon how many missions that agent has given out recently agents that have given a lot of missions highsec hubs would have almost no isk or lp reward but still bounties agents that havent given many missions lowsec or 00 would give large lpisk rewardsthis would spread the population as after a period of equilibrium most highsec agents would have similar rewards most lowsec would be another tier and 00 would be a 3rd tier of rewards
thats not really mission running as most people would define itinteresting idea best discuss it in detail in another thread please incidentally doesnt that sound like the ideal way to use planetary development to you
bleh too old and cant res it but i wont derail your topic so ill shut up about it
not supported until i see a better or more refined idea too many major issues here
any refurbishment of missions on the scale suggested in the op will have major issues thats the pointas far as refined ideas i dont want to get too in depth with this i suggested it as a topic i would like addressed by the csm and brought to the forfront as a suggestion for something ccp game dev should focus onthe level of detai one would go into in say the game development or features and discussion forums would be counterproductive herepeople would argue endlessly about the specificsbut hey issue not supported
i agree with most of the ops proposals buy stopping those that mission  without unduly affecting the occasional mission runner or the guy that needs a quick boost to faction or corp standings or just a quick income boost to get a new ship i like the idea of dropping incomebountieslp based on number of missions run though i would not have a cap per agent more a cap per toon per agent otherwise those in the us tz will be severely disadvantaged as the asiaeuro zones will have cherry picked all the missions as a miner im all in favor of removing meta 0 items from missions especially the higher level missions as it will help make lownull sec a little more desirable and lucrative place for the high ends and also push some of the midhigh end ores up in value and make them worth mining againpersonally the way to defeat afk missioners is simply introduce the sleeper ai into the missions it shouldnt be that difficult as the routines now exist and theyre pretty effective and challenging
some of the ideas about how to change rewards i tend to like but the whole idea of using caps to fix lag ugh
fixing lag isnt really the main consequence of what is intended from the op but an additional benefit from breaking up the overcrowded mr hubs
what is your primary purpose in doing this then
its all in the op
currently all races get an additional 10 bonus to a specific armour resist on all t1 ships this corresponds with their greatest enemies preferred damage type so caldari get 10 thermal gallente 10 kinetic amarr 10 explosive minmatar 10 emthis is all well and good but its of limited use to shield tankerskeep in mind that the number of resistance points on a t1 ships shields is 110 and on its armour its 130 including the racial bonus so perhaps slip a default 10 base em resist on their to start withnow i know shield tanking is not armour tanking shield tanks are by default stronger slot for slot but it makes no sense from a lolrp perspective for ship designers not to buff a ships shield so it corresponds with the damage of their greatest enemyadd a flat 10 bonus to the shields of all t1 vessels in the following fashionamarr explosive resistancecaldari thermal resistancegallente kinetic resistanceminmatar em resistance
supporting my own topic yo
well the rp argument doesnt work too well mainly because why would amarr desighners concentrate so much on shields if youre idea were to go through it would make more sense to have it put on the ships tank but anyway the pinicle of shield and armor resistances is t2 right
not supportednot every race is a shield tanker by natureparticularly amarr and gallenteminmatar do both when it suits them but mostly shields caldari are definatly shield tankers
and why would the caldari designers concentrate so much on armour systemsif you read the op and maybe actually played the game youd realise all t1 ships have a racial bonus to a specific armour resist but not to shieldsand not every race is an armour tanker by nature please explain to me why caldari ships would have a natural extra resistance applied to armour but not shieldsas i pointed out shields have a combined total of 110 resistance points armour has 130 resistance points
maybee im just angry at the ninja drake boost this entails i see what youre saying and yes i think its unfair that caldari and some minmitar loose out on the extra resist im just not sure if a blanket shield resist is the answer also i dont see any problems with shield tanks as they are i think the fact they are generally stronger and also self repairing more than makes up for slightly less resistsand dude insulting youre voters lol
well then why not change that caldari and minmatar lose their 10 armor resist gain 10 shield resist provide the sort of balance youre looking for in a more rpfriendly way
you have a good point however shields have the benefit of passive regeneration and id like to know how much that compensates
alternatively you could drop 10 from the self damage type and add 10 to the enemy damage typean exception should probably be made for amarr ships you cant drop 10 em or can you  i mean theoretically you could have 10 em resists the formulae should still work but its just unheard of for the time beingso you have from the usual 0em50explo40kinetic20thermalcaldari  30 kinetic 30 thermalgallente  10 thermal 50 kineticminmatar  40 explosive 10 emamarr  either 10 em and 60 explosive or 30 kinetic and 60 explosiveto be honest id really prefer the shields to remain exactly the way they are right now instead of doing it like described above
did you forget to drink your quafeseriously its not that hard to figure outarmor is nonregenerating without reps shields regenerate with our without repsits natural for armor to have a higher resistance due to that hell even a kid can figure that outadd to that each race has a certain style and flavor in materialsand are likely to slap on a particular resistance as a result doesnt mean they favor the tech just manufactured that way
maybe their should be a 5 bonus to shield strength instead of 10 or maybe give ships that are designed to shield tank a shield shield resistance not 10 because like previously said shields regenerate instead of an armor one
any base resist change would probably necessitate nerfing shield recharge slightlyi do not want to see the drake get tankier for free nor shield buffers in general become even more effective than they currently arenot signed
batteries suck please fix they dont need to be as good as turrets i get that theyre a compromise in their current implementation theyre dire
launchers also dont get a damage bonus torp launchers get a measly 3x cruise get at most 115 for faction whereas a laser battery for example may get a multiple of 17 or morethat simply makes no sense a single laser battery throws out the equivalent of an entire ship where it takes 6 cruise launchers to equal 1 raventhere also needs to be more launcher types small launchers using hamheavy defender launchers ectand yes they should remain online like any other weapon system
very simply proposal here which would make a massive difference to the eve market and create or help support the trading career please do these things they in fact would be not only very simple but hugely usefuladd a lower timescale graph maybe a 6 or 12 hour graph and hopfully down to an hour graph this will allow easier spoting of minerals and products on market while evening out trade inneficiencies2 with the added fine timescales make the graphs scalable3 add in atleast another few options for the graph a traditional western line graph and a candle stick graph which is infinitly more useful then the current graph even though they use the same method also add in maybe a bar graph4 allow customization of macd lines that are currently in also add in an oscillator and other graphing tools such as boillinger bands or elliot wave patterns5 for minerals and other products allower 4 decimal points so that they can be traded more efficientlybut what does this all mean and what does this do1 it allows traders to use proper tools to trade on the market  this helps and builds a whole career and associated careers to the trder profession2 allows more clarity and easier use of market graph instead of the mess we have now3 allows traders to see much more detailed information so that we can even out price inneficiencies and this will stabalize the markek and make sure products are worth there true pricebut how would ccp be able to do thisi imagine that they could easily convert there current graph system to be able to display these they are all very simple concepts and ideas with simple mathmatical forumlas behind them normally not more then 56 short lines and some only 12 linesthis would help traders and people buying off the market all over eve would satisfy some of the demand for a carebear expansion or update and help build the trader career please consider this and if you like the above ideas postbumpapprove this thanks and sorry for any bad english
i dont think they want to store data in hourly increments  that adds a lot of trash to the servers more graph types and analysis tools and scalable graphs im for four decimal points im against  it might make sense for tritpyer in some ways but itd be ugly and stupid in most other contexts while i agree with the idea of better analysis tools it seems a low priority because of the existence of the data export and the ideas i disagree with here are enough to dissuade me from supporting the ones i do kind of like
i know that the csm voting is done and all but i have an idea for the police force in lowsec and a possible working system i dont have a clear example of this but lets say someone has an alignment of 50 they could then attack someone with an alignment of 5 and below if their alignment is 40 then they can attack someone 2 and below also in pvp killing pirates will add alignment points to the characters status if they are engaging a player who they are allowed to attack this way a character can choose to go after pirates and raise their security rating at the same time with concordto add additional depth much like the characters displayed on the signs in space concord can have field offcies set up with special agents who will allow players to select from a list of random pirates who frequent certain areas and be paid by concord to hunt them down and destroy their ship for a reward and an additional bonus for podding the player this will add an an interesting dimension to the game play that takes place in low sec it will no longer just be a place for pirates but also for those seeking justice

ashloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhh 
this got to love it when lying tools are revealed as well lying tools
started by looking into all the candidates and what there stances were when it came to looking into you the most i could find was your first post stating what you wanted to do and implement that was about it where as other candidates really went all out trying to attract voters with various web pages and other informative gubbins just didnt think this time round you were really giving it all your all to get voted in and concluded you may not have been able to give your all if elected if you round next time round i wont be writing you off sraight away short version bit more in game experience lot more effort and possibly the use of shiny things to draw attentionp and you may well be a serious runner good luck cat
you know i would have liked to have seen cat elected and chosen as the secretary so all the minutes began with hi csm here
so i thought maybe i was wrong so i went back and checked again none of the candidates would claim industry trade or mining as their focus lets look at them using data from their own campaign pagesdierdra vaal  pvp from dierdas website  my 6 page document on guns for hire bounty hunters and mercenaries took me quite a while to makevuk lau  00  big alliance i actually like vuk alot but he is no carebear mazzilliu  first issue mentioned was pos warfare  seems smart but not a carebearzastrow j  goonfleeterik finnegan  take care party  fw and medals if ank is any indication  hope i am proven wrong avalloc  goonfleetomber zombie  likely most rounded player in terms of knowledge  not a carebear  but who i would have voted for if i wasnt running actually i would have split my votes between oz and vuk both impressed me in icelandlarkonis trassler  pvp  not a carebearmeissa anunthiel  20 plus years of software development experience right started at age 12 well at least a software engineer which could be good but clearly not a carebearso i dont think anyone there would be a representative of the casual players and pve types i had hoped to represent we also no longer have a csm member that is as focused on the economy as lavista vista was previously may not matter but would have been nice to see someone running with that as a major part of their focusi do think everyone of those folks is bright and has the best intentions for eve will take the job of csm seriously and will do well for the folks they represent the question is how many of them will think about the other segments in eveissler
balances out the fact that there was way too many carebears in the 2nd csm for anything to get done
id love you to point out any evidence you have that carebears in the second csm kept anything from getting done my point is that a very large segment of the player base ended up with no representation this term it will take a while to see if that matters at allissler
while i wont be posting them on the forums myself im always open to support properly constructed carebear topics and bring them to the council

not supported unless it refers to only neutral altsyoure in a rr gang you get completely blobbed so the order is given to deaggro and prepare to jump so instead of just sitting there trying to keep your friends alive you hope you all make it out alive i agree there is a problem with neutral logistics but this fix will also up normal rr gangs
so you sacrifice one to the pvp gods he tries to keep the rest alive and the rest deaggrosux not to have the i win button all the time
supporting this and bringing it up at csm meeting 1
not supported because this effects the way logistics ships in general work in pvp roaming or what not as it is logistics are usable they can still die and you can also scare that guys alt off or jam it ffs then kill him but if you change this logistics ships will become useless they dont have the survivability to be used most of the time without leaving the options open and trust me logistics ships still die i have lost a fewi suggest all of you that voted to support this go try flying a logistics ship in whatever situation you want 5 man hac gang 10 man bs gang whatever and see how long you survive if you allways stay put it wont be long most cases trust me while logistics alts are an issue there are ways of dealing with them and people will still play docking games and infact because you wont get them aggroed you will end up now with less chance of killing thembtw just to clarify i have never flown logistics in neutralnpc corp i am allways in the corp that is at war
supported aggression mechanics need a serious look you undock and engage or assist you should expect to face a fight less stupid station games the better imo
supportedrr alt spoonery is pretty spoon
awesome  thanks csm erik finnegan and csm dierdra vaal for responding and letting us know where you stand on this issue
btw you wont get rid of neutral logistics alts doing this they will just sit out of dronescramweb range so around 6070kms off aligned with a stab on all your going to do is as i said earlier screw up normal logistics pilots and in the end you will make it harder not easier to kill your station hugging prey and their logistics alts also this would effect remote repping bs gangs rather than being able to try and disengage and tank it out then jump you would just have to accept your going to die and sit there while jumping may seem cowardly not your fault if idiots dont have a way to tackle you on the other side also would have to change remote sensor boostingeccm mechanics at the sam time might alter some pirates play stylesi also find it ammusing having just realised whos started this thread given privateers love their alts with remote sensor boosting ect last time i checkedyou should look more towards finding a way to make it a pain to use neutral alts not to make remote repping give agression and therefore invalidate logistics as a ship class one potential way is to extend the agression timer for out of war related remote repping to say an hour or perhaps 2 making it a huge time sink for that alt or even for a day for helping a war target you become a target for 24 hours im sure there are other potential solutions just im sorry but screwing up logistics just so a few station huggers actually stay docked rather than fooling around is not worth italso just for a second assume as things are you briefly shoot the logistics so they dock uprun you then have a decent time frame 4050 seconds if you take into account lag from the jump both waysdocking loading systemstation  logistics decloaking then relocking most of the time that will not far off what you need to kill that person plus if the logistics decloaksmoves staright away after undockingjumping you have 30 seconds to kill them before they can bug out again so either your going to get time to kill them or you get another 30 seconds on top of the 4050 to kill your opponent so is it really that bad infact if you cant kill them that quickly they can just deaggro then dockjump themselves
supportededitit is annoying when you have a group of neutrels following the ship ur pvping against at 0m waiting to grab the loot with no repercussions i was fighting a war in a mission hub and this was terrible with a swarm of neutrels hugged targets waiting just to swip the loot then sit there while you cant do anything

cant support this one sorry only reason i launch drones in the presence of sentries is to absorb sentry fire otherwise they stay in the drone bay this isnt a new mechanic anyone who flies a domiishtar knows about these restrictions and must adaptuse a different ship

cool beans so its ok for anti pirates to bring rr domi gangs to fight pirates but not for the pirates themselves to use themi think people have images here of huge permanant camps of domis and ishtars with multiple sentry drones deployed in a transversal reducing rpe matrix around the gate not the caseyou can be an elitist about the issue all you want fact is 95 of combat happens on gates or stations any time weve sat at a planet for an enemy gang to come into us they just do one probably convinced its going to be a hotdrophaving been in many hilarious situations where i have been unable to engage a juicy target either at a gate or station due to my drone heavy loadout or the several times where ive been in a bs gang frantically rring enemy fighters from a downed carrier while we get some haulers on the job i must say this is something that needs looking atthis wont make any real difference in terms of capability to those dreaded pirate camps the unwise solo player will still be dead either way
either this or make sentries track their targets
screw it why not
drone ships need lots of love
no i dont support this as it would make rr domis fleets a little too imbai do however think that sentry guns should have significantly reduced damage to drones and other small targets to give players a chance at using their drones through skillfull management in the area of 34 volleys to kill a unbonused heavy dronesentries should be there to make gate fighting in low sec more difficult but not impossible for certain classes of ships
the part i bolded for you is the real issue seriously why follow the herd mentality of nullsec ie da blob on da gateda blob on da stationda blob on the pos and further encourage similar brainless pushbutan in losecinstead of buffing for the lazyproper incentive for smarter hisec dwellers to risk losec for whatever reason is the way forward along with canning all pos shields and take the ing things out of whs altogetherthe part in italicsboohoo also lol and boohoo againyes the number of camps in losec has always been made out far worse than reality by a mile a country mile but the silliness in rancer and other hiseclosec junctions woohoo awesome corp gets 14k kills of which 12k are shuttles go doodz  kinda puts folks offits simplenuke pos shields period all of thembuff losec rewards for those that wish to risk itohremove local and make it just a count of active pilots everywhereand ill have that pony and flying piggood luckediti forgotopen up hisec to outlaws without mommydaddy aggro babysitters concord is so silly and outlaws being automatic targets anyway thanks to sec status can choose whether or not to risk a visitjust like the various lolantipie types feel free to drop into losec with t1 pap blob
as a nondrone ship pilot that like to indulge in the odd lowsec escapade i like the way that things currently operate drones are not a significant percentage of my dps or ability and for such operations i usually just fill the bay with whatever light drones are cheapest at the timethe time it takes for sentries to cycle after destroying well instapopping a done is awesome and allows me a much greater window of oppourtunity when it comes to the gankthat said however removing sentry aggression from drones will be a bonus a bonus to those that i am trying to gank a bonus that want to give it a try but are drone based and a boost to those that want to combat pirates that arent outlaws yes we do existsupported
supported all the waygallente are at a huge disadvantage with the sentry guns shooting at drones sentry guns dont shoot missiles down they dont shoot energy weapons so they break so why shoot one of gallentes main damage dealing weapons
support all the way domi needs some love
definitely gallente pilots are at a major disadvantage at gates and thats wrongalternatively make sentry guns shoot down missiles

argee with this not so much because of the logistics ships issue and i fly logistics alot but more because an outlaw cant even remote rep his own drones normal ships not that important but fighters are a diffrent issue mainly due to cost without getting global crim which tbh is just plain stupidbtw if you do fly logistics legitimately ie player corp not hiding from wars to remote rep go read pitboss neutralalt remote repping thread and make them see that giving remote repping an agression countdown would screw up logistics
well i appreciate your enthusiasm then again this proposal will potentially consume much energy of ccp thus i would like to discuss with you and your mastermind nyphur before shooting it to a csm meeting and i am referring to the regular meetings where we build the list for icelandmining has been discussed in iceland early this year ccp was really vague seems like they have something which did not finish for apocrypha and the csm did not really throw in much at least it appears to me that the real trigger which excites everyones passion has not yet been found seems like mining is not tied to the endgame thus a lack of interest from the big players and i am not sure if they would be so fond of seeing mining regain importanceplease join us in the ig channel take care for live discussion
total revamps often win me over just for neveltys sake and mining really needs love solid concept here
i dont understand why the empires dont all have an equal distribution of agents imo within their prime fictioncaldari  rd corporate ectminmatar  combatgallente  mixedamarr  internal security et albut the total number of agents should be identical as should their relative qualities and distributionsand their agents should be in their own space or the space of their allies not in wholly enemy empire space
nerf caldari
a fine proposal even if i doubt it will still get meaningful support at this stage

i dont think anyone really wants walking in stations its a nice thought and were kinda interested but really for the game it just sounds like a timeisk sinkinstead im sure we could all benefit from any time assigned to that noncritical feature to be reassigned to ui improvements such as a new and working evemail interfacethere are many important things being skipped over in favour of features no one has requested which inturn add nothing to the gameif these eyecandy patches are released before bugfixes and ui improvements i think ill stop my subscriptions ahead of more inaction
maybe with all the time saved they could get around to picking a better font for eve 
maybe if you bothered to read and pay attention youd know this is a waste of time as the devs working on ambulation are not a part of the main core of eveits a different department entirely
regardless that department uses resources at ccp that can be allotted to better more useful projects id much rather see a new ship class or faster deployment of dynamic hidden roid belts than walking in stationsoh and btw ccp make hidden roid belts so that you have to run several scans and move your ship around to find the belt rather than dropping one probe and getting warpins on all of them
this game is like a 1940s russian tank the very best innovative groundbreakingbut shot out so fast its crammed full of rough edges bugs imbalances etc etc ccp needs to fix whats wrong with eve currently rather than introduce ambulation which none of its current customer base paid to play
umm no we do not get the ability to dictate ccp policy have a problem with that too bad i have loads of problems with other developers of other games but do you hear me whining no ccp can do whatever it wants you can quit the game in protest or go back to playing like you already areisaac
they are developing a vampire mmo and thought it would be nice to use the engine for something else so they develop ambulation too of course they could stop every involvement in eve and focus on their more important core task i cant see how this would help the eve codebase tbhand no
i would rather see the time effort and money put into ambulation used elsewhere on critical game areas
ambulation is a musthavewhybecause its one step to making eve mmo scifi game not only just internet spaceship game which is awesomemaybe it has small use at the moment but thats the plan to add things slowly
not supportedtoo much dev time money and manpower invested into a mechanic which is deep into production which ill agree could have been better used to refine the existing game ambulation is a framework for which future ccp products will launch from its unlikely to be stopped even if feedback from the eve playerbase was resoundingly negative accept it and move on
not supportedits a good feature and will bring in a lot of new players
while its kind of fun to rag on ambulation theres not a snowballs chance in hell of ccp abandoning this feature certainly not at this late stage asking for it would be a waste of the csms time and a pointless insult to ccp not supported
supported in full usability  to say the least  is a must
supporting this because twice now weve killed a freighter belonging to someone who is seen macro hauling in the area and its been full of kernite
agree but first can we get fricking pos to work off aliance standings as well as corp or a second tick box option for alliance standings to be used
what do you think will be more likely to get this stuff implemented bundling or as separate issues with their own levels of support well go with whatever is best
tend to support pos mechanics need a change and this is one of the many areas and directions in which it could be changed for the better
i would support a dual system whereby you can set access via pw and via standings or choose only to operate via standings
supporting this because oh man it is needed of course keep the password option but ultimately standings allowing access would make things a lot easier
csm needs to go slap some sense into ccp
20
i just noticed that ccp completely ignored this csm thread about this topic
makes indeed more sense to spread out people by adding more and better agents in other faction space rather then adding more caldari agents simply because caldari space is more crowded and more people start of as caldariespecially talking about level 4 mission runners is some group where u should expect from those players even if they mindless run missions in there whole eve career to look around in high sec for more and better agents even if u take the aproach that they are paying you money to give them what they want on a shiny plate p
this thread is just as stupididiotic as the orginal devblogthe op is actually agreeing with the dev decision to add l4 agents to the game in high sec this doesnt solve anything or help anythingwho cares about the distribution of more l4 agents between the races the fact that more l4 agents are being added at all is the problemwe need to be removing reward for no risk from the game not adding to it i dont support the ops idea at all simply changing the distribution of the new l4 agents isnt the answer not adding any new l4 agents is the correct solutionmove all of the high quality l4 agents to lowsec spread them out and make sure that the l3 agents are also evenly spread out and dispersed people who endure the risk of missioning in lowsec should be rewarded everyone else should have to suffer the consequences of remaining in high sec like a bunch of sissies and deal with the reduced incomeive run plenty of missions if for no other reason than to better understand my targets and to get bookmarks so that i could better kill mission runners before they changed the probing mechanics i dont get killed while doing so because im not an idiot carebear whos so lazy that they cant pay attention to the game if youre getting killed while running missions then its because youre too stupid to live not because the game is too difficult or unfair
as the poster above i too think both the devblog and op have the wrong approach to the problemwe need dynamic agent quality where it moves gradually over months based on how many missions the agent has been handing out compared to others thus the agent quality will drop to a point where mission runners will start considering moving to other systems eventually reaching an equilibrium between agent quality and location quality
89  48  137moot point indeed
yawn another move any l4q1 agent to lowsec so me and my bunch of corpies can has some easy kills against pve fit cnrs since thats all the sissy mission runners use commenttbh with the chars ive got i could probably make as much money mining as i do running l4 but i prefer to missionmission mechanics need a major overhaulgive players some variety in the missions they run i look at evesurvival and havent done a huge number of the missions listed as they are for other factions and minmy  gallente dont like me much increase the ai of mission rats but dont make it sleeper ai where they have your drones for lunch or as difficult as 00 although living in 00 is easier than lowsec imo and a properly set up system you can chain belt rats and earn more money than missions with less risk you have intel channels local and as soon as you see anyone you dont know in local you scurry off to the safety of your pos shields you did allign when you got into the belt didnt youive lived in lowsec lived in 00 and lived in empire ive retired to empire for a bit of downtime as i play eve to enjoy myself to not have to worry about other players ganking me in lowsec not to have to keep numerous chat channels open to see whos coming my way in 00so if you dont like the way eve is going then you know where the door is and can i has your stuff
agreed
as for those that want to move all l4 agents to lowsec period go away those that think the current mission system is flawed and that lowsec00 needs to be more lucrative and the current mission system needs dynamic qualities which drop if more people run missions and so on i agree but there are two other proposal threads for that to discuss things such as that inbased on ccps response to csm1 this is just the first step and the mission system will be overhauled in the futurethats because csm2 voted this issue down and ccp never got itsighcsm3 will hopefully do a lot better
i mostly agree with youhowever you are completly neglecting lowsec and 00as for bellum and people like him who are talking out of their intergalactic assfor most people doing lvl4s is a way to fund pvpwhat you want is to have oportunitys that have greater rewards in lowsec and 00 to give you more targets to probe out and killnot having less overall targets because they get borred of it all because whiney little es like you demand that that for the comparativly small amount of players who engage in your elected profession the majority has to suffer
really mate youre heading down a dangerous road the plain fact is that the whole mission systems needs reworking from the ground up the more band aid changes that are made then the greater the pain will be when the whole festering mess has to be ripped offgiven that why slate ccp for applying a small easy bandaid rather than a larger more time consuming bandaid
agree that the way it is being done is screwey i would also like to point out from a minmatar perspective yes atleast they are getting agents unlike amarr but 2 of them are administration none of the gallentecaldari are admin or similarly lower  combat mission agent types and only 1 has a posistive quality one of the administartions the rest are at 0 second admin 7 11 which seems a bit out of whack in comparison to me
this issue demands 23 new highsec l4 agents added for each noncaldari factionsounds good  as a first stepbust just adding more agents is not good enough it would be a first step maybewhat we really need is a dynamic agent quality system get rid of the fixed quality system but that would be a different issue
what about if agents give only a limited ammount of missions per player per day like for example 10 missions for a 20 and 5 missions for a 20 agentthat way mission runners would have to move around doing missions thus spreading the ammount of mission runners to a wider areal
give amarr at least one decent highsec agentthe best one for amarr navy is a q 7 with 2 adjacent jumps one of which is lowsec
ccps decision here seems to have come completely irrelevant of the whole debate it looks a lot more like a step in an ongoing evolution of agent services within empire space this step being focused on alleviating stress in high sec with the aim to create more mini hubs by encouraging people to spread out in line with the distribution of population of that part of eves population per race and playstyleit is dumb because of the timing and context of the emo debateit is smart because it really is needed in light of an ongoing growth of the mission runner population plus for the first time ccp is actually taking the angle here of abusing peoples own mindsets to achieve results which is not a discouraging thing in my opinionit would have been nice if it had been paired with a similar initiative in providing a batch of agents in low sec at the same time that would have saved a lot of emo
while ccp movement is dumb even to their standard this thread does nothing to help fix the real problem with level 4 or missioning it goes agaisnt the core of game because there isnt any real competition on them between playersremove the whole quality thing make them give limited missions per day easier to control the biggest isk faucet also and quality a fuction of usage that to start withm then add sleeper ai and totally revamp them and epic missions allready damn it then only then maybe it would be wise to add new agents 
i totally agree with the op as agents are now its hard to resist to do missions for caladari because they simply have the best agents and the most of themas passionated amarr player id love to do missions for khanid or ammatar but they simply have no usefull agent at all look for amarr navy ammator navy or khanid navy l4s with kill mission that are not right at or in low sec there are noneand afaik its the same for the minmatar factionso the problem is not with caldari having to few agents but the other factions especially minor factions having totally crap agentsand ccps attempt goes totally in the wrong direction
ankhesentapemkah allready got my vote on this
for years mission agents and their distribution are in dire need of support
make quality dynamic alreadyeach downtime rank the agents at each level in order of the number missions run for them in the last 30 daysleast used 25 get q20 till next downtime next 25 get q19 all the way down to the most used at q20problem solved
supporting this all our eve university directors agree the corp management tools are currently not sufficient
while i do agree with most of what you said having ceo reading my personal mail is stupidthats like saying that ceo should have access to your wallet and your hangar no thanks id like to keep my private stuff private
i posted a thread recently addressing my ideas for improving fw and would like to repost them here if for no other reason than  if i post it enough  at some point there must be a dev response of some kinda wardec mechanics which allow pirate corps to cherry pick individual fw player corps without drawing aggression from the rest of the militiathis fix would mean nothing more than making all four militia factions into alliances insofar as wardec game mechanics are concerned cant dec one corp within without deccing them all hell itd probably involve changing one line of code for each militiab provide a real advantage to establishing sovereignty deny station services but allow docking to enemy combatants in nonmilitia npc corp stations and disallow docking altogether in militialabeled stationsdoesnt have to be complicated doesnt need any new set of rules just use the nullsec docking code for fw with those stations that are militia in nature those having the respective militia in their names  tribal liberation force logisitics plant 24th imperial crusade testing facilities etc if you dont have occupancy your militia cant dock in those stations you could still dock in any nonmilitia stations in any system quafe company warehouse etc regardless of occupancy but perhaps with station services cut off to whichever militia does not have system occupancy perhaps cutting off station services in npc stations might be seen as too extreme i dont knowsome faction warfare systems have npc corp stations in them others do not systems which have only militia stations will be something for enemies to consider when flying through an enemyoccupied system  and give them a good reason for taking said systems themselvesthis would make fw a little bit more like 00withtrainingwheels as ccp say they intend if you are behind enemy lines roaming or fighting in enemy occupied space it will not be so easy to just dock up and get repairs or avoid fightsc plex spawning insure the mechanics are such that plexes spawn more evenly throughout the day and in plenty of outoftheway fw systems to encourage more solo and small gang roaming outside the major pipes kamelakourmaugaamamake tamasujheydomsthis requires no further explanation as most everyone  ccp included  agree the plex spawning mechanics are fubared at the moment as far as cloaking and speedtanking the plexes the solution there is also a simple one one must destroy all npcs in a plex in order to finish said plex you can still run the timer down cloak up and speed tank all you like but it will just keep flashing 000 seconds until someone finishes off any and all ratscontinued
d establish modest loyalty point awards for fw activity this should be low enough that highlevel mission running is still far more lucrative to dissuade farming yet provide enough incentive to plex thus opening more pvp opportunities in more systems not in the main pipes mentioned abovetaking a couple minor plexes down might grant enough lps to buy faction ammo for example changing sovereignty or successfully defending a bunker should grant enough lp to purchase faction frigates faction cruisers and other significant rewards should be the result of accumulating larger amounts of lpi dont think giving actual isk rewards would be the way to go with this at all it should be loyalty point based for such items as may be purchased only in the faction store and to avoid farming make taking a major unrestricted plex scale to about 23 what a single level iv mission would earn a high sec carebear and scale all lp rewards for lesser plexes down from thereremember that this is not like mission running if these changes are implemented youll have to not only kill all the rats in a plex but do so with potentially scores of wts searching through many of these systems looking to gank you as always make offensive plexing more rewarding then defensive plexing
sheesh  another ankhe thread i find worth supporting
not supportedits not ccps responsability to hold peoples hands or get them to grow up keep in mind eves development is one of trends open this can of worm and itll open the door for a range of confirmation tracks over time no thanksa nice reminder paired with account subscription timer would do fine you have 9 days remaining on your addiction and your password is 6 years oldstill maybe it is sometimes a little bit their job to help people grow up going over a number of posts here makes me a tad fearful for this csm round if this is how cases will be tackled  far from good
forced passwords especially those that dont let you set passwords youve used in the past result in weaker and weaker passwords as the users have more and more trouble remembering what theyve changed it tomy password is fine if yours is easy or you use the same pass at other sites then thats your problem
nothing and i mean nothing puts me more off a game or service than forcing me to change passwords or a specific password standardi dont want to suffer because others are too stupidlazygreedy to look after themselvesno sign
people also need to exercise better judgment in choice of pw11 letter alpha numeric case sensitive with an enforced change every month should prevent a lot of the current issues
oh god not more passwords it really would infuriate me to have to change them constantly on all my accounts with each having a different password presently at four maybe ccp could send a mailing reminder to change your password biannually with a link to the account management page hardware donglesauthenticators seem to work for another mmo i have friends very happy with blizzs authenticatori wouldnt be opposed to the idea that if passwords are not changed say annually that a small administrative fee could be charged for account recovery
this to be honest i cant believe this is the first thing you raise as csm mazz
if you knew me better you would have been surprised it was only second or maybe third issue i posted
it wont hurt i guess
poor wardec mechanics have pushed many good corps out of factionwar on all sides
good idea
you are confused about what is being suggestedas per current example the star fraction an alliance not part of any of the militias is war deccing individual corporations within the amarr factionalliancemilitia other corporations within the amarr factionalliancemilitia must pay to war dec back the star fraction in order to support their comrades against a nongallenteminmatar threatwhat you are proposing is that the factions be made into true alliances which would interact with nonaligned player alliances in some way declaring war on pie inc would be declaring war on the amarr empire as an example
would be a benefit to all concerned
this seems perfectly reasonable
given the recent postings on other websites and the existence of a document outlining how to manipulate the grid could ccp be asked to look at this issue and explain how they will improve the situation or what they are currently doing as i suspect they are aware of this problem admitedly this might be something that cant easily be fixed
who cares using those tactics in overpowering manner such as to shrink the grid of a pos to prevent sniping is already deemed an exploitusing those tactics to simply ensure your bs fleet is able to load a grid before engaging instead of going from coming out of warp to appearing in their clone stations medical bay in the 10minutes it takes to load grid otherwise doesnt create an unfair advantage actually it equalizes the unfair advantage those already on grid possess over the guys who have yet to load it
creating advantageous configurations of grid for aggressors is okay theni realise the solution may be involved however that isnt to say it shouldnt be looked at it may be a consequence of exisiting grid mechanics but it doesnt follow that you use the limitations of the mechanics for advantage
i think this is a great example of home field advantage the opposing side could also take advantage of this if they decided to put in the same amount of time and effort i can easily imagine opposing covops squads trying to prep the battlespace this seems like a great example of the depth of eve to me
thatd be great if the defenders knew about it many assume the method is known by most
well it is publically documented now and everyone can read it
on one hand i like the idea of battlespace preparation advance work providing concrete rewards and all that stuff on the other hand this seems like exactly the wrong way of doing that  forcing people to exploit mechanics in undocumented ways to do hilariously nonsensical things is a terrible game mechanic if they were to create something similar as an actual intended mechanic with proper balance considerations and documentation i might support it but the status quo is not a good one
hmm to make this official the only thing someone has to do is make a wiki article about this tactic if ccp doesnt pull the article it is official or at least official enough for me
theres not a whole lot you can do with grid fu thats useful if you shrink a grid down around a pos to prevent sniping you would need a load of covopses or else its obvious what youre doing and your objects in space can be shot down or petitionedpl knew about grid fu a long time before this document was released and havent really made a lot of practical use of it also i really doubt that ccp still have the capability to change that sort of code anymorei used to experiment with it and i tried probably every grid manipulation method in that document and made one of my own as well the two main problems with using it in a combat situation is that 1 they take quite a while to execute and 2 they are completely foiled by an object left in a certain place that you cant destroy so you would need at least an hours warning before a battle and you would need to have the resources to drop invisible undestroyable objects for example covopses you would need over a dozen covopses or twice as much to account for people crashing and logging out and then you would need to coordinate positions of cloaked ships which isnt so easy in itself
what needs improvingits a nonissue imopopping over a grid in the middle of a fight is kind of annoying im glad they do scale dynamically to whatever extent they do
i must have been hallucinating the use of gridload bms then
i edited the post i think after these replies were made so if you want check back on italso in combat you can usecreate a grid loading bookmark without having to intentionally expand the grid the size of the grid is usually large enough for something like that already
hehe last night we were discussing it with a few people which ended up with placing bets on who would start downplaying grid manipulation first plook grid manipulation has been a tactical tool for years now while the majority of the regular players has no clues what is going on the smarter folks can easily put it to advantage without this taking a lot of work or even time especially in fluid operations where there is a lot of movement simple tag teaming between scouts is enough in more static environments it takes even less tag teaminggrid manipulation is not even something which arose after ccp introduced pos even when people were playing station ping pong this was a common method around stations and gates but also around belts these days there is a lot more use for it obviously from prepping a warp tunnel to a gate so your titan pilot doesnt crash when loading grid to forcing a hostile force to go in close range around a pos or just being able to observe a hostile force while loading grid without being exposed to firekey is that if done consistently it does provide nice advantages and while both sides involved in a conflict can put it to use and even subject it to a sort of arms race it the focal point remains whether or not such use of mechanisms provides unfair advantages out of principleone thing to keep in mind however is that quite often such methods are one of the few things which do provide options to actually engage without admiring your desktop wallpaper after a few seconds preloading the combat grid prior to hitting effective combat range is not just something which is a tactical tool for all sides more often then not it is a method of survival to even get in the conflictdoes it provide advantages yesdoes it provide unfair advantages good question if there were an eve manual and litterally every grunt had the opportunity to learn about it then it would not provide an unfair advantage one could argue but eve is a game with a steep and blind learning curve we all know thiscan ccp even do anything about this well over the years we have seen this float up a number of times sometimes with one verdict sometimes with another ultimately there is nothing they can do about it not without completely redesigning dynamic grid creation mechanisms and that seems to me a big investment of time and energy in the mean time many people actually use this  without even realising as they follow and not lead  in order to facilitate pew pewmaybe its another example of ccp underestimating its customers p maybe this shows a bit of a hint to implement preloading grids selected as destination during warp to make the landing smoother for everyone
theres not a whole lot you can do with grid fu thats useful if you shrink a grid down around a pos to prevent sniping you would need a load of covopses or else its obvious what youre doing and your objects in space can be shot down or petitionedactually placing objects to shrink and hide pos are exploits as declared by ccppl knew about grid fu a long time before this document was released and havent really made a lot of practical use of it also i really doubt that ccp still have the capability to change that sort of code anymoreso if this statement is to be believed many other alliances and corps have made good use of it often to their oppositions demise are you seriously suggesting that ccp dont have the capability to change that codei used to experiment with it and i tried probably every grid manipulation method in that document and made one of my own as well the two main problems with using it in a combat situation is that 1 they take quite a while to execute and 2 they are completely foiled by an object left in a certain place that you cant destroy so you would need at least an hours warning before a battle and you would need to have the resources to drop invisible undestroyable objects for example covopses you would need over a dozen covopses or twice as much to account for people crashing and logging out and then you would need to coordinate positions of cloaked ships which isnt so easy in itselfhmm so you are suggesting that an attacker would need to plan attacks hell thats where most of us have been going wrongseriously have you read the document at all you dont need that many pilots and covertsand id go as far to suggest that 10 pilots holding open grids in a battle is not that big a deal considering the number involved often in such battles coordinating positions is very easy using the overview etcthe point of this issue is that the mechanics are being used to the unfair advantage of the attacker or the defender in some cases there may be various reasons why doing this is desirable eg grid loading lagging not being able to jump everything in etc but that doesnt make it acceptable when another is put at a severe disadvantage due to exploitation of mechanics
nothing to see here move alongi gave the document a brief look over i have played a bit with grid manipulation over the years but nothing on this scalefrom what i could gather its uses are limited to 1 shrinking the grid around a pos oh exploit2 setting up dd proof grid loads for sniper fleets3 using l shaped grids to cause confusionone or two other amusing tactical uses come to mind but its something that takes a lot of effort manpower and time to implement the document is now in the public domaini seriously doubt that this tactic has caused alliances to fall its both a terrible mechanic and an astonishingly amazing onekeep itedit i will add that espicially in the days now of the 10 second probe hit the advantages gained by using this tactic are significantly reduced
scanning changes have impacted this a lot indeed problem remains that it isnt about being or avoiding being found in todays conflicts of 800 in a system it is about who loads the first winsin that sense the advantage does remain very strong regardless of whether one force finds another force and warps to it the latter will have preloaded significantly better then the firstbut as i said i would wish ccp would follow up on this from another angle since grids are known to the server and objects are known to the server i would love to see a solution being creative and bypassing this all it should be possible for everyone to gradually load objects active in space in a given system for example during a warp i could imagine a check if a grid is existant whether it has objects and to pass these through a queue to the clientthat way wed have one less omg undocumented trick and a more level trenchwar p
i doubt they can the trick is to use the existing dynamics of creating and affecting grids on the basis of the same object on which grid creation works theyd have to replace the current dynamics with something else or make all boundaries absolute which in its own presents a world of trouble
well im certain there is some point in eula that speaks about manipulating with the game is considered an exploit and grid issue is more server related then ingame related as you use ingame items to manipulate gameserver performanceits same exploit as bookmark bomb was
if you want to be specific about it the declaration was only about hiding poses not about preventing 150km sniping you can prevent sniping without hiding a pos from the warpin i dont think ccp knew it could be donehow many battle reports have you read that ended with if only we didnt keep popping off grid pl would have lostwere not s we know the moment ccp knows about any of that  theyll declare it an exploitseriously have you tested a single piece of the information in this document you need one object minimum to hold open a grid and two objects minimum to expand a grid the document only speaks about shrinking the grid around a pos in a smaller number of direction but you can in reality shrink a grid around a pos in every single directionthat i found out by myself and wasnt included in the leaked document thats the only real way to prevent snipingotherwise they will just find a grid bulge and warp their snipers there and it requires a ton of objects both to establish the starting grid and to move it inwardsdue to post size limits ill only link rather then paste but heres a post i made on scrapheap illustrating my tactic that is subtly different then the one in the grid fu document that shrinks down a pos grid in every single direction rather then a few
people hardly mention it in battlereports for obvious reasons p it has always been a grey area to say the least its a common comment however in scout convos and the therapy rooms of pos defence managers over the years p please try to avoid getting caught in personal angles p youre a politician nowdont do it solo like most things in eve thatll drive you nuts it is disgustingly easy using a bit of teamwork which seems to be paired with the multiplayer concept p it was probably unintended but the use of the word tactic serves here as a good example how easy it is to see it as a tactic whether that is because people have used it over the years or because they approach matters from an angle of heres the problem now we fill in the steps we need to take to win or even whether it comes from unconcsiously classing it in with strategy methods tricks in our own mindsmaybe the question would better be is grid manipulation a valid sanctioned tactic independant of method objective or resultif ccps verdict is yes then this is a simple case of how eve doesnt have a manual and he who figures out stuff better then the other guy winsif ccps verdict is no then its an exploit we then have the problem that there is no way of tracking it or following up on it and fixing it would require such an allocation of manhours that the fix would never arrive
 added this comment to second post temporarily i see most people misunderstood the way it canshouldwould be usedlet me give you one examplesuppose the following would be the way the modifier table would be populatedif agent location security rat
yes akita we realize how it could be used the thing is thats not part of the proposal  you specifically avoided proposing any actual utility for your proposal and if this were to be implemented youd basically just be creating a lot of intentional database trash we understand what it could be used to do but there are other less obtrusive ways of doing the same thing under current mechanics  say increasing the security bonus to agent effective quality youre proposing the addition of an unnecessary mechanism and little else if you were saying double bounties for 00 agents that would actually be a concrete and useful proposal agree or disagree this on the other hand is just a waste of everyones time
but thats just it  what you described is not an effective measureone of the first things i point out in the op the entire focus of the second small section is that whatever we have nowadays is simply nowhere near enoughso you understand how the mechanism could be used you fully understand the example given for sure you see at least some of the benefits of the proposed system but you disagree with it because why exactly  because its intentionally been left openended by me for now ive left it openended like that precisely in order to avoid turining it into a complete flamewar discussions of dont nerf this and that doesnt need a boost in order to focus on the tool itself which would enable the possibility to change all that in many different ways any time ccp sees fit with minimal additional efforti even said at the end how exactly will the amounts of the modifiers be determined is not an issue right now but if you have ideas about that too feel free to voice them and i have added the link to the older thread where a concrete method a autobalancing one by the way that would use this system is presentedif i made a just double lowsec bountieslootsalvage proposal youd first have people complaining about why do you need to do that at all other people complaining about the word double arguing that 50 would be enough or other saying it would need tripled and other people cluelessly crying about how this is impossible to do because the game doesnt allow anything like that ignoring the fact thats precisely what the thread is about changing the game to allow that in the first placei never expected people like you to oppose the introduction of an useful tool just because the plans for the tool dont also include a description of the ways the tool is supposed to be used in great and painstaking detail only to have somebody else reject the proposal because they dont like the spelling of a word on page 379 of 9356but feel free to assume if thats what it takes that the example given in the second post the one with 07 15 and 30 is also attached to the proposal  does that suit your need for completeness better 
if i suggest you build a hammer its pretty clear how i intend you to utilize it even if i say just as an example  you could possibly use it on a nailrequesting you build a hammer does beg the question  do you even need one the discussion on its use is unfortunately unavoidable 
it is reasonable tool but at this stage of the product the desired application is more important and tools by themselves are meaningless sure ccp can make a setting that would decrease mission rewards how you propose what you intentionally omit is that they most probably are not willing to increase the rewards this is the core of the issuethey probably have some baseline iskmanhour ratio this ratio forms the upper limit of pve income this ratio is probably approached by efficient l4 grinding all you can do at this stage is nerf l4s which will negatively affect the majoriy of playrbase and reinforce status quo of old timersi suspect all the failures like fw t3 l4 scaling all bump into this wall they cannot for design reasons surpass current l4s while l4s are honed to perfection so they are not attractive enough this is where you need to introduce mudflation or just cope with effects of stagnant rewards or be creative and make alternate valuables which is what ccp tried with t3 skills but still was imo too afraid to breach the iskh wall
this will allow them to heavily increase the rewards of lowsec missionrunning which is severely needed andor also do the same for 00 missionrunning which frankly needs far less of a boost compared to lowsec missionrunning but it still could use some boost anywayyes its obvious this particular hammer would be used on a nail as its main intended usebut what exactly do you intend to do with hammeredin nails  it could be anything from building a house a boat or putting nails in somebody elses arms and legs or just breaking somebodys head with ita tool intended for one purpose initially can be used in many different ways and its not up to me at this point to determine all possible uses ccp can derive out of it or what exactly should they do with it at allso yes i gave a simple example and a link to a much more complicated example which illustrate what can be done with it  and now im asking for them to build that hammer and start using ityes we need one we need one so bad its not even funny anymorein highsec l4s are ridiculously profitable because you can do them in the most ridiculously overpimped ship with little regard to pvprelated risks while obtaining almost the same potential income level a lowsec l4 missionrunner would be able to obtain while the lowsec runner takes huge risks he cannot possibly be rewarded appropriately because the tools that would enable the proper reward to be dispensed are nonexistantnobody said to avoid discussing the uses of this system feel free to do so but the point of this thread remains  its not mainly about all possible uses or the way ccp will end up using it while that particular discussion has loads of merits and even belongs here to some degree its not the main focus  the thread is primarily about the need for this tool
i would prefer something similar to whats proposed in the op but not quite the sameagent quality should represent the standings required to use an agent no more and no lessthe economic value of a kill mission should scale with the security level of the system its in that of a courier mission with the average of systems passed through figured by shortest or safest route whichever yields the leastby economic value i mean direct isk payments bounties base lps awarded drops and salvage by applying a modifier to the drop tables any roids spawned should be appropriate to the system security and location
this is exactly what i was sayingthis thread is about the introduction of the system that would enable those economic value adjustments in the first placehow exactly you set the coefficients for it is of secondary importance and easily modifiable later on
idea in principle is sound but this requires tags to be radically over hauled or replaced with bounties personally i think dropping tags is the best solution and replacing them with faction bounties is better idea exactly the same as normal bounties but just add a line stating that the reward is given by x faction to the npc template would also provide a slight boost to factional warfare at the same time
thats the beauty of it  it doesnt since tags are loot and you adjust the loot too income from tags is also automatically adjusted without the need to remove tags and make them factional bountiesfor instance if before a certain ship had a 100 chance to drop 2 tags of a specific kind if you have a 175 modifier to this particular mission the npc will always drop at least 3 tags and have a 50 chance of dropping a 4th tag  overall giving you 35 tags on average 217535
sure it is you just have to be more aggressive with it its not necessarily the right solution but it is a solution my point here is that your topic is not actually a proposal it is an attempt to create a framework on which further proposals could be built but its not even the sort of framework which is necessary and in need of advance work this isnt the sort of proposal that the csm ought to be championing its the sort of proposal that ought to be invented by a dev in the middle of a brainstorming session at the pub after work stuck in a desk drawer and forgotten until a need for it arises focus more on what should be done and less on how it should be done  ccp is going to implement your ideas in a way that suits themand their design schedule and their future goals anyways might as well at least make it clear what you want rather than delving into the hypertechnical when you know or ought to know that that is going to be discarded before implementation anyways if what you want is for lowsec and 00 agents to be more rewarding then say so toss out a couple ideas on how it could be done and let ccp work at it dont take one of those ideas and suggest it on its own merits because it has no merits in a vacuum if you have a carpenter building you a cabinet you dont say go to the store and buy a hammer and i might at some future point tell you to do something with it you tell him to build you a damned cabinet and let him figure out the details he is the professional with full knowledge of hammers and the best way to use them and you are not give him objectives not handholding
currently entering highsec as an outlaw in a ship triggers faction navy spawnsi propose removing this mechanic entirely with regards to spawn triggers for outlaws but not when the individual has sufficiently low faction stating with that particular faction so as to be attacked on site by that faction navylet players police highsec in absence of a gcc not npcs
interesting idea and i do like the sound of it having lost more than a few ships to the faction navy from crashes and whatnot but 910 times when i pass through highsec as an outlaw im not even locked by another player nevermind attacked would have to give them the highsecees some real reason to attack us other than the warm fuzzy feeling of a ship kill and maybe a few nanofiberssupported to see where it could go anyhow
supported for teh lulz
bountys t2 loot pvpjust think how many outlaws would be trying to sneak ships out of highsec it would be glorious chaosas it is i cant go to trade hubs without being chased by interceptors all the way home so i dont think there is much need for incentives besides those that exist already
in two minds about this redsplat on the one side it would open up many possibilites for outlaws to go about and engage in combat against the oddson the other i know what id do sit in an offgrid with a scanning alt out and spend my days suicide gankingalso currently the faction police spawns are incredibly useful for getting bs through those pesky areas of hisec if they were removed all it would take is some noob in a rifter who was mildly lost and moderately bright to ruin ones dayits all very well and good saying let players protect hisec but do you really think thats going to happenthrowing my support in there anyway just for now
we can already suicide gank with utter impunity or rather to say we can attempt to suicide gank someoneif you remove faction navy spawns and that noob in a rifter does tackle you then you have a fight on your hands as opposed to npcs wailing on your shipwill other players engage you in highsec just cause you are an outlaw i think so but i dont know soits certainly true that all the advantages would lie with highsec dwellers and not the outlawsedit more pvp is good right
this change would make me go 10fact
i think it is a very interesting idea one that the knee jerk reaction from empire dwellers would be a definate no as they would imagine a player sat on a gate baiting people to engage knowing that he should give a fair few people with limited to no pvp experience a smacking but as a director of a carebear corp who has just come out of a war dec ourselves we several pilots who would like the chance to learn and dabble a bit and i think this would give people a great chance to pvp in a enviroment where they would feel as they have control over the situation as the flashy pilot and only the flashy pilot would be able to return fire only when fired upon and would not get the help from anyone either in his corp or outside unless they also were engaged the problem that will occur though is a flashy bs will just sit on a gate fighting anyone who will take them on then when it starts to get a bit hot for him will deagress and jump out leaving the one tackling him with an agression timer unable to jump and if he does get killed so what ship is insured and he had a load of fun so insurance should not be available to criminals in high sec so i will give a big thumbs up as it will give us carebears a chance to put a fleet together and try to get a bit of pvp where they can a greater chance of control over the situation but do think the insurance for criminals in high sec has got to be done away with and gate guns in high sec should insta pop a shuttle or interceptor to stop these crims from insta warping through high sec and give people a chance of tackling them or this proposed idea will simply be a way for them to get through high sec safer than at the moment unless they want a fight edit to add am assuming this would also be the case for faction warfare pilots entering opposing factions high sec 
how about when a flashy person attacks someone in highsec without aggro rights concord spawns instantly rplol could be that concord views pirates as more dangerous so puts more effort into fighting them but dont kill every pirate in highsec space as it would take to much effort without the empires backinganyways supporting this
too much of a nerf to suicide ganking i think
i wanna see old starting movie
agreeing
im a fan of the new starting movie just because it gives people an idea of what type of game eve is it specifically says that other people will attempt to  you over in whatever you attempt to do its like the games saying this isnt wowinspace without having to have the forum community scream it at them
right now its 4 hours i think it should be a 2 hour wait not everyone runs missions with more than one account or plays 8 hours a day if someone only plays say 4 hours and gets a load of crappy missions its no fun for the casual player how i get level 1 quality missions from a lv 4 agent is weird so if i cancel that and the next one is a mining mission from an internal secruity agent where i need the skills to use a gas harvester i either have to wait 4 hours or take a standings hit or i log people who run missions away from hubs and with one account shouldnt be penalized with a 4 hour wait
erm as someone that runs missions away from a hub ie i only got 1 l4 agent available to me for quite some ways i really dont find it a problem ill log in for maybe 4 hours a day this would simply lead to an increase in mission farming and heighten further the problems with l4 mission rewardsexamplei actually got to have a day running missions i got in the following orderdamsel in distresssansha spiesinfiltrated outpostsansha spiessilly miners declinedattack of the dronessahsha spiesdamsel in distressthe assaultnot what you would call a fantastic run still it pulled in just over 175misk if id been in a position to decline once every 2 hours instead of once every 4 then there is a much greater chance that id got some missions worth much moretherefore not supported
agreed withe idea but i think the mission arcs shouldnt be anything less than a chain of extremely challenging level 5 equivalents or similar in order that it takes effort and teamwork to get back from the place you find yourself in and isnt something people do every few days when they fancy a change that way if you really want to modify your standings in one direction you can but it comes at a heavy price in terms of risk and time
i hate absolutes supportedone caveat this should be in lowsec and not 00 and hence not as likely controlled by any one alliance or should havin multiple such agents but only being able to contact one
just reminding you people that this issue was already raised and ccp responded to it a few weeks ago not sure where the minutes are otherwise id point out the answer
well thought and crafted solution there should be a way to recover faction standings and this proposal may have residual effect to potentially reinvigorate fw
supported so i can do pirate missions some day without destroying the future of my character
fine in a rp sense i suppose in practical terms negative faction standings choke players out from accessing various null sec regions of space and thereby make joining prospective corps and alliances very difficult ie negative standings with minny can drastically limit access to great wildlands and points beyond
supportedthe new default overview requires you to move pilot is an outlaw and pilot has sec status below 0 down about 10 spaces for proper placement below warx2fleetcorpalliancemilitiaterriblebadgreatgood standingthen outlaw then below 0 the excuse ccp used for repositioning outlaw doesnt really hold water new players default overview should never show friendlies even those they can fire upon due to outlaw status and theres absolutely no excuse for placing sec status below 0 next to it oh look a 13 ship its on my overview that means i can shoot him right whoops concorded for shooting a target on my overview who also happened to be in my gang and bluein my alliance
supported
i hate ccp sometimes
they took off the outlaw flashy  how many have i misseded
supporting this
supporting this
at the same time make it so that adding war targets in empire to your overview works properly
this was what was needed not changing things so people started shooting blues
supporting
supportedit is far more important to know if someone is blue than if they are an outlaw
supported got attacked by blues because of my sec status
fail changei liked being blinky
shooting at pirates or negative standings players when they enter high sec from 05 and up to 10 becouse they are outlaws and by coming into high sec they are instant targets concord coud warn them but they woud be instant target for every player concord woudnt atack them if they didnt breach the sec standings but everybody else coud without any risk of concord atacking bouth players pirates or negative standings players woud be instatly red for kill also the target woud be red to the pirates or negative player which has been atacked explanepirates or negative player is marked red once they are shown on the screen every negative standings player that will haul stuff with haulerfreighterjump freighter it is hes choise if he wanna risk or notmy english is not my primary talk edit this idea can be readjusted and edited to meat the purpose to boost pvp
this is already the case with 5 and below which i think is sufficient
this
so you propose to delete concord you could just set anyone negative and attack him i think the protection of concord for not wardecced players is vital for high sec hence the name regarding outlaws  this is already implemented
congratulations you win today my friend your dream is already a realityalready the casealready the casealready the case although faction navies will attack negative standing playersalready the case although faction navies provide a slight hinderance
supporting because the op removes faction navys shooting us in highsec and leaves it to players to enforce antipiracy
also supporting as this removes faction navy aggro 
players are honestly so much more dangerous than faction navies though
fine with meid rather have a fight with another player and lose horribly than to be ganked by npcs
looking at this again removing faction navy spawns just for players with negative security statuses would be a good idea it would allow more pvp to happen in high security space while still keeping the security factor of concord cause they would still be there not sure if the op is saying this or not but id like players to be able to aggro other player on the same system security vs player security scale therefore22 sec player would be able to be attacked in only 10 security systems19 sec player would not be able to be attacked in any high sec system47 sec player would be able to be attacked in all high sec systems62 sec player would obviously also be able to be attacked in all systemsonly question would be how do sentry guns act in high security and low security space also how would aggro mechanics work around sentry gunsi would like this idea as long as it has the little buffer room from 00 and 20 where players are still immune in high security space
see here  new regions reachable at first only through wormholesit would also make wormhole travel more meaningful instead of simply mining and tech 3 production
the only problem with this entire idea are the problem pilots the eve offline quasiafk andor macro fleets who have so much backup or such a pimped ship they can effectively ignore the risk the rats poseall they will do is all be in the login que at the end of dt and as soon as the system is up theyll utterly glut the agent pool effectively ending the opportunity for more casual players to run missionsif someone is a hard core mission runner more than x  of missions in a day or whatever then the agent should just say sorry were pretty well caught up here why dont you go over to x an ask them and if said person is in a gang with someone that can still use that agent that pilot gets the message
so you just hate missions and want to nerf them that seemed about the only other form of rationale you hinted at
life is funny sometimes if anyone was to play that card i would have thought it might be ankhi do hate missions because they are boring to run yes i did run missions once im two days grinding off level 4s for caldari navy in empire and can run lvl 3s for angels down in curse riskless and exploitable and damage other professions in evethe changes in op arent suggested cause i hate missionsi suggest them as i think it will make eve a better game and mission running a better profession or aspect of the gamehell if sleeper ai and all the changes proposed above were instituted in some form mission running for pirate factions in lowsec would be a source of income for me
a couple of things that spring to mindi hate relocating im not a minmaxer im not remotely running missions for the best agent available to me at the moment and i dont seem to be in a hub at least not a big one judging from system population i just hate the process of moving my ships around that much if rewards drop to where im spending more on ammo than im getting from the mission simply because a few other people picked up missions from that agent then the majority of my time will be spent warping from jump gate to jump gate switching my ships around instead of on anything fun or productive this would also encourage me to forget about exploration since moving my mission ship ammo fittings salvage ship etc is bad enough without including in the journey my probe ship wh ship random other ship capable of fitting in a plex gatedepending on how low popular agents will go some care would have to be taken in how available agents and their potential rewards are displayed to players id rather things not go in an excel spreadsheet online directioni think the static resource faucet nature of missions is intended if every resource available in game was capped there would be a population point where production could not possibly keep up and many degrees of unfun in between
lets face it eve has enough industrialists that realistically production will never be a problemcapping mission income in some manner would only see a shift towards other profitable professions that would take up the slacki dont really think your worries are grounded therehowever i understand that you and perhaps many people dont like moving ships around but i ask you would a 4 jump trip somewhere really be so traumaticwith any changes to the status quo there will always be some people that dislike them for changing their game experience but lets be honest here would not the changes discussed be of benefit to so many other professions in eve that having to travel 24 jumps to a mission is a worthwhile sacrificeeve is a sandbox so they say well in tht case i think game development should strive for equal opportunity and hence profitability and support for professions in eve not having one trump all the others to their direct detriment and so warp the landscape that vast areas of the game are deserted
id support some dynamic scaling of mission rewardsquality and possibly availability with agent popularity kind of like how mission rewards scale dynamically with average completion timesthatd make say hubs like motsu devalue pretty rapidly and would disperse people it could also be applied instead of or alongside the current sec status modifier which would make lowsecs agents even betterand it would also let people continue to mission all day if that was what they wanted to do whilst still having an effect on riskreward balance which is important from a its a game point of viewi dont support a hard cap but i agree with the drift and by quality i mean missions can already be broken down into oh awesome i got gone bezerk and ah p0op the score maybe some scheme for tiering the missions and managing availability of the good ones too
for me id say it would depend from what you were describing before i was assuming around 10 jumps possibly more on average the 4 jump number would still get a bit old at least to me if it worked out to 4 jumps  1 missionpossibly but possibly not the harder isk is to come by the less risks im going to take less risky behavior would decrease profits for pirates as well as industrialists since i wouldnt be replacing shipsfittings as often manufacturer profits could also be affected simply by the fact that players as a whole might not be able to afford current prices given the new model i dont mean to state this as fact but simply mention it as a possibilitytrue but some deviation from the sandbox model is required in the interest of fun missions currently are a reliable fall back that among other things can be used to fund getting into other aspects of the game on the topic of balancing by isk  in my experience wh exploration has trumped everything i have done in game when it comes to profitabilityso far as population distribution it is likely there are also other factors at play proximity to trade hubs security status proximity to lownull sec etc
ideally you wont have to relocate every mission unless you decide to try and cram yourself into a system already filled with missionrunnersif ccp gets its act together and adds more agents spread across the factions and across space then finding yourself a system to call home shouldnt be problematicthe system proposed makes it unprofitable to overpopulate a single system and create a missionrunning hub
no offense but this one was posted a couple of hours before the op and based on a thread from last year and would be much more useful at least for a big subset of the issues presented in the opgranted the op here does raise a couple of more additional issues which do have a merit but the funny thing is most of the remaining ones could also be addressed by this here which is a thread from last year
this has been pointed out so many times with a lot of possible to solutions to push mission running into the same rules that apply to the rest of eve too bad you will get flamed to death by the usual suspects for trying againit doesnt look like ccp dares to look at missions either
its also important to remember that the number of people feeding the reprocessed loot column is much higher than the number of people feeding the ore onejust as an example say the number of people gaining and reprocessing loot is 100 to 1 person miningnow say its discovered that 40 of minerals come from miners and 60 from lootif you saw the second statement and not the first  youd think there was a problem take both into account and you see that miners still produce more minerals thats where we are right now we have the statistics from the second statement but no statistics on the first
that would ruin more minmatar ships than it would fix
just to chime in i like lowsec it needs to be made more attratctivei hereby present you mry the 100 sec alt of mrpirate i can tell you mry is going to die repeatedly in noob ships or cheap frigs at the hand of mrpirate to boost his sec statusbounties or anything relying on killing someone to give anything can and will be abused so long as people can have alts think about itmeissa
submitting the following itemsneutral alt repping
how do you submit items and how much support is the minimum before you can submit an itemwhat if you want to make a minor change to the idea based on feedback in the original ideas thread can you do that without having to gather support all over againedit and how do you vote on issues that have multiple points that need debate and voting i guess just vote on each subissue
you submit items via your internal email list or in this thread there is no minimum support aside from your own judgment but it has to be discussed for a week before it can be submitted minor changes are fine whether theyre intended as additional options or as amendments issues with multiple subtopics are split if anyone in the meeting asks that they be split though i suppose you could also split at submission time if you feel the need

yeah goons spamming certainly indicates which topics are in need of attention
if only for the drama and to make them feel even more persecuted
shame on you ccp
im a new player who was drawn to this game after hearing about the whole bob disbanding drama the idea of a game where player created countries fight and win by real world espionage turned this game from something id never heard of to something i had to play the true sandbox  game makers set the rules and within those rules players do whatever they want that is tremendously appealingchanging the rules when the rules do something you dont like ruins all of that
to be fair i can think of one notable example of this happening previouslyhowever as bob wasnt involved and in fact the people in question are allies of our enemies i very much doubt we will see a similar threadnaught demanding they are disbandedits a name people the name of collection of geeks in an interweb astrowarrior gamechillaxadded redux would have got my vote over reloaded  just sayin

so youre not content with taking all their sovyoull now go after them for getting a name change jesus christgive it a rest
all of their sov wasnt taken which is why everyone is making a big deal duhps you spelled your name wrong
what a shame ccpdisband bobr
i really cant believe were still seeing this type of treatment how is ccp trying to be neutral youd think that they would have learned their lesson the last oh i dont know 3 times they were caught in bed with bob seriously these events dont affect me directly but it still bothers meand actually i dont think disbanding bobr is enough i think that all corps in bobr should be disbanded and the corp members shouldnt be allowed to be in a corpgangalliance together ever
multiple broken rulesi support this
i keep hearing people claim that this has happened before but i have yet to see an actual example
rules are rules and everyone must follow them
they must lose sov and pay to remake alliance not just change the name for free this is sad
like bob is only one ive petitioned for my alt name to be changed from stupid letters kdkgfjkdjhg to a real name and got it and youd be shocked the favors to certain large carebear corp on reimbursements ah well the squeaky wheel gets the greasegood thing other corps know how to keep their mouth shut when a small favor comes their way

lol thats what this is really all about you guys should be happy bob is here it takes the microscope off all the other alliances doing things youd have fits about
so i am sitting here at work eating lunch and i am telling my coworkerthis food is bland i think it needs some saltlo and behold i run across this thread full of plgsmm and their alts tearslife just doesnt get any better then this1st failure being who you are2nd failure we take our caps back3rd failure your crying about a nameif your scared just say your scaredi tell you i love my alliance and the people the allies that i fly withwhen the alliance got disband and its assets stolen all i heard over ts was people laughing and the top brass telling everyone sit tightplz more salt my lunch is starting to taste that much better and maybe ill be able to save some for dinner
sorry i dont believe this for a second i have a corpmate that was unable to change their name and we are just a regular corp in eve no strings attached and if it is true for you then once again why the breaking of their ohsostrict policy for some and not others either way its a screwup that is the issue here enforcing the rules uniformly for all players
the rules should apply equally to all not at the whim of some gm who decides to break them for someone
hey guys hes right look how much we suck
haha goons failed because you got camped into an npc station for a monththats some serious spin
disband them 
supporting
though if you look at the alliance rankings it still says kenzoku
or maybe even let them keep their new name but change the ticker to t20
oops ignore this post
thats because the alliance number in the server code hasnt changed
shame on ccp
yes disband them
rules shouldnt be ignored for any alliance either let every alliance do it or none
no more preferential treatments
is this the queue for free t2 bpos
cry more it doesnt make you all look pathetic or anythingthis is not the first time something like this has happened but because big bad bob you are all afraid of is involved it must be badyour tears they are delicious
you are correct this is at least the third or fourth time that a ccp employee has unfairly favored bobedit theres plenty of pubbies and even bob pets posting in favor of this it really is an issue that transcends player politics a developer has to ensure that all of their employees act impartially period theres no rational way to argue against that
rename kennie to band of brothers or bobr to bobit was underhand what happened to them and if it happened to any other alliance it would be treated as an exploit everyone needs to get off their high horses and give them the respect they deserveccp should be enforcing measures to make sure alliances like bob dont get stung like this again
ive failed to see a single non gooncoalts postits pretty funny
disband them or sov 0
sure its all a grand conspiracy what could possibly be objectionable to rule changes and favoritism especially towards eves least pleasant group of beardos
also not an alt and too new ao dumb to figure out how to put my corp tribal liberation under my name but looking through this thread i do see a whole lot of people with corporations that arent goonswarm amazing how deep and insidious this goonswarm conspiracy goes

no actually they fail because we got outgood thing you didnt finish school i would have had to be worried about you
no
was getting out the reloaded part did anyone bother to explain blanks arent real bullets
no we failed to realize that even after you got out you would still just lose caps and not gain any space i think if we had known as much we wouldnt have bothered camping you into pr in the first place
ccp is violating our civil rights someone call martin luther goon
no to preferential treatment yes to consequences
they used kenzoku as an alliance because it gave them a sov advantage day 1 if they dont like that choice there are ways to change your alliance name through nondeveloper intervention
i support this
actually you know what they managed to find a name that sucks even more than random japanese gibberish and it makes it easier for us to scam using the real bob i say let em keep the name
i have a dreamthat all players are treated equally and the creators of our grand universe follow the rules that they have claimed a desire to enforce on behalf of all of usthat those band of brothers would gain the advantage of real stability through professional therapythat each and every player can play this wonderful game without fear of favoritism of one group over another in regards to the rulesand thnx for the idea cipher7hehehe
this issue isnt about new bob name its about a change in ccp public policy that they havent made publicif they are providing alliance name changing services they need to let everyone know how to do it
just to plaster this up again for the beaver fansit is not about the namei mean dont get me wrong the new name is hilariously badreloaded somewhere laurence fishburn is taking the blue pillits about the bending of rules by ccp yet againwhy have an internal affairs department promising oversight and then go bend the rules for the same guysthat prompted the internal affairs department in the first place t20 etc etcand please do not point out gm grimmies smokescreen nothing to see here move along postapparently we are deemed 12 years old no im not p
i support this petition one set of rules for all players no exceptions
shut up
i agree that it will be fun trolling them out of this name as well but the issue here is that ccp bent the rules for these arrogant buttes which is totally unacceptable bob knew the rules when they chose to run with kenzoku and keep sov over having sov take a little longer and creating a name that isnt stupid they should have to live with this choice or do as everyone else does and have to lose sov to form a new alliance im sure hundreds of players have petitioned to change an alliance name in the history of this game and this is the first case of it happening on top of that it doesnt even follow proper naming convention 25 characters instead of 24 and lowercase letters in the corp ticker
i spk for myself and my view does not reflect my allainces view in anyway i hereby place my vote to get ridof bob reloaded 1 rule for all no bias to one alliance period
aye man i hate getting lied to all the time by ccp ccp you did not have a flexible policy with regard to renaming alliances ccp you did consistently make corps and alliances disband and reform to change their names the game is about 6 years old we have 6 years of history to see how things worked ccp bobkennybeaver asked you to cheat they asked you to do something that you hadnt in the past done for anyone else nor would do for anyone else they asked you to cheat for them and ccp you did it you ccp can blah blah blah rationalize and lie all you want but thats all it boils down to plain and simple i dont care what side of the war a person is on i dont care if someone wants to be called prince i dont care if someone wants to be a weirdo and use odd symbols in a name and be referred to as the artist formerly known as prince its not the name that matters what matters is that with incidents like this ccp demonstrates how dishonest insulting and unprofessional they are on some issues this leads to the bigger question which is if theyre willing to act so poorly in the public eye what nonsense are they pulling when they know nobody is watching to those that say out with the conspiracy theories and away with the tinfoil hats i say you are dodging the issue stop just stop its all just blah blah blah to me i and others who are angry do not have conspiracy theories and tales of alien abduction and cia planned coups bob asked ccp to cheat for them ccp did it if ccp did that and other things on behalf of bob they arent trustworthy its plain its simple its public its fact ccp might get some things right but they got this and a bunch of other things absolutely wrong
an interesting thing to note is that issue is a public one  as opposed to private one the subject of discussion is not a character not a person it is a pure game entity therefore there is no reason to hide any gm action or conversation all gm action on this matter should be publicly available because there is no valid reason to keep it hiddenis there a reason to hide this information let people know
give us the list of criterias that needs to be filled for a wish to change alliance name to be approved and the timeframe starting at alliance creation within whitch the petition must be filedif you are going to give silly answeres as in the gm thread atleast have the ing balls to back it up with something other then empty wordsive been playing since 06 and every year some silly  about ccp favouring one entity is brought up and more often then not you can guess who is on the reciving end well not any more since we dont know what the hell bob wants to call themselves next week
ccp your community are asking for an explination as to what is going on and why it seems that you are increasingly bias to 1 faction in eve1st saying in a pre prepared statment that kenzoku request there name to be change when they formed up there alliance however the corps known as band of brothers corps were not even in kenzoku so your statment gm grimmi is false information unless you are saying that they asked for a name change 2 months before there alliance was disbanded making false and unjust decisions against eula when this is what governs ccp is against your own legal documentation 2nd this whole issue is mostly with regards to ccp making rules setting them in motion making them a legal document then changing aspects of it to allow an alliance to control ccp decision making internal affairs seems to think this decision has no bias in this however your own eula rules commented by people in this thread signed by senior managment at white wolf and ccp game is critisized for controlling in game politics 3rd game exploits dont even try to say that band of brothers were not involved with this their own leadership has said if there is a game mechanic we can use so we get the upper hand we will seeing large numbers of towers in 1 place setup the same announcements by ccp of the setups matching these setups used in previously owned space delvethen it comes down to supercapital reimbursement for no reason at all reimbursement of titans because they have lag when further released documentation by ccp games has said that lag is not an excuse to replace ships lost in a combat situation however to reimburse 2 titan class ships to 1 previously mention alliance is getting a little rediclious so through all of this i would like to ask some simple questions is it also fair to assume that a chars in game name of sir molle is a ccp employee1 who does govern ccp and why are they allowed to interfere with in game mechanics who completes the audit needed which manages ccp 2 can we get a statment with a real actual reason as to why ccp games and white wolf felt that a name change of an alliance was critical then to plz also comment why a name is meant to be 424 chars long however band of brothers reloaded is 25 3 plz provide a list as to any alliance who has their alliance name changed in the same fashion as this also quoted in your prepared statment4 will csa be allowed to have interaction with this decision making with this thread now reaching 57 pages which is 1697 posts and alot of posts in favor by the ccp community to not change the name
supportedsomething like this required attention and voting of the full eve online community if one name gets changed due to petitions then everyones names can be changed
this is truely amazing all your posturing all your petty demands you dont get it do you they do not have to prove or provide you anything they have n o t h i n g to awnser for you are not some all powerful agency who can shut them down for noncompliance there are no laws to bend them tothe only thing they would respond to is loss of revenue if you really want them to listenquitbut funny thing is everyone posting thier little thumbs up in this thread and the other 1200 threads wont quitso keep screaming into the wind i wonder sometimes where the world would be if more people went to this length and put this much passion into real life issuesjust lolpsthe csm is nothing more than a sham something to make you think you have a real voicesad really
i think people keep playing because they enjoy the game im glad they play because the game would be a lot less fun without other players even the ones in the alliances we are at war withhowever i think people also want every player corporation and alliance to obey the same rules
yea  you all for demanding clarification on what rules are in place vov
oh no we dont have a spy in the bob holding corp to disband them again lets flame ccp
not supported couldnt give a  what poeple call themselves tbh
law or justicewe all know that the disbanding of bob was done in a way that begs the question of what was intended by ccp policy with regard to the one button option that sort of thing was not intended to be used in the way it was we know thatfurther the letter of the lawis open to interpretation in its applicationand none of you are the judges in this case you are the public
ccp has done it again kenny can have whatever name they wish but they must do it the proper way leave kenzoku and create a new alliance as bobr no problem herebut renaming an alliance is pure nonsense and against the rules guess i ll start petitions to change my name cause well at least i have a valid reason it starts from a and when i began eve i had no idea of what impact will have in fleet fightsdo not disband bobr but change their name back to kenzoku if they wish they can create a new alliance from scratch as the rest of us peasants
registering disapproval at the manner and methodbad precedent especially with the precedent regarding sov mechanics
you are complicating simple stuffdisbanding of bob even though i do not agree with the action was under valid game mechanics ccp is to say what should be from now on and change the specific mechanism but what has happened is history and more importantly within the ruleson the other hand renaming an already named alliance is against the rules of ccp not to even mention the character limit not a game mechanism not even related to button within the game or option of every single eve pilot you got pumpered again on the backs of the rest that cannot because we must follow rules that you do not
plainly said we the community pay the wages of the gms devs and any other employee working on this game so we want answerstaxpayers get answers when a political figurehead screw up this is not much differentccp we need answers now please stop avoiding us and trying to dodge a bullet
oh mister high and mighty whats that make you then why are you special
again either you did not fully read my statement or chose to ignore the point i was making lets reclarify1 they can change rules or policy in the game without advanced notification or clarification2 i was saying the only way to really make them sit up and take notice is a mass cancellation of accounts which in turn would cause a financial statement to the powers that be and would cause serious discussion among the top echelon of executives that govern the policies of the company what most of you still completely fail to realize is that the only true power you wield is the power that comes from your 15insert currency here a month they know that even if 10 of you who have posted quit your nothing more then a drop in the bucket because tbqfh 90 of eves population either doesnt know about the situation or just doesnt really care
ccp is too busy sending all of their money to an unknown offshore bank account to respondwatergate apocrypha
1 yes the goons whine alot jesus god please stop whinging2 yes in this case it is warranted i am not a goon fanboi pretty much goons are pathetic3 can ccp please freaking respond obviously a lot of people are upset and it does appear to be favoritism4 my guess is this is just temporary anyway bob are having fun at goons expense and they will reform under a new name eventually since the remaining systems they have dont amount to much 5 people who think the original bob disbanding shouldnt have been allowed are straight idiots and fanbois it was legit game mechanics gtf over it renaming an alliance without losing sov is not legit game mechanics
the same rule of all of us hum in the old times for sure but not anymore  and finaly not fair for the rest of our community except kenzokubobbobr 
this is one of the most assinine statements ive read yet since you want to compare this to polotics if a polotician screws up yes he must by law awnser for his actions or be 1removedvoted out of office 2arrestedimprissoned based on the sevarity of the actionsthis is a company providing a service a service whos terms can be changed at will by said company in which you agreed to by clicking the accept button on the liscense agreementyour only true recourse is to quit or deal with it
i dont exactly like my name can i has get it changed
actually the prestige this whole situation brought on the old bob vs goon alliances made this known to the whole community they even update it in the in game news networks so people do know look at how many views and supports this topic got what made ccp different from the gold digging companies of other games is how well they pay attention to their customers take away the core players from the game then it will fall like a house of cards one rule for all ccp no favoritism dont allow yourselves to become like one of those companies
how many fsking bugs and poor mechanics are in this game that every freaking player has to deal withyou spoiled cheating piece of crapand damn you had a chance to rename your alliance and you chose that  phailbuffet
this isnt caod
rules are rules cant break them even if its your own rules especially as we all pay equally and so have equal rightsbobs want bob back  they start new alliance and do it the way everyones done it before
im confused what happened again a gm did something to favor bob really a gm so this gm did something epicly horrible and were sure its a gm so and like it was something game changing and unallowable what could this supposedly gm have done change a name dear god black is white up is down bob are goons its a ing game something unintended did happen remember when those guys bumped people out of a pos with titans game mechanics were in place to allow it but zomg it was so haxorly bad and game changing it must stop and it did and players got threatened with bans because of using a game mechanic in an unintended fashion take 2 an alliance got disbanded in an unintended way it wasnt closed it wasnt disbanded corp after corp got kicked until even the executor corp got kicked not left from its own alliance now compared to titan bowling to dooms day a few dozen ships this is a far greater issue when it comes to game mechanics bob lost most of its space 34 of 00 is down here making sure it stays that way weve laughed weve giggled and all thats really happened in the end is we got our name back sorta guys outside your door is this big wide expanse called the outside if you find yourselves really thinking that this is such a huge deal get your fat asses up walk outside and watch the wind blow and the leaves rustle for a few take a look at that real girl jogging down the street take a few deep breaths and then realize that theres far bigger issues in this world than a stupid game name being changed because ffs it doesnt affect your life unless you are a cyber tool who cant let it go
tell me about it so now that ccp are allowing name changes who do i contact to change mine
people still dont seem to understand its not about the name lol if a hooker gave your friend a bj and gave you nothing despite you paying would you be mad sure now imagine it happening a second timeitt learning comprehension died
does the csm have a position on this
nerds whining about their ecivil rightsnews at 11
oops refer to 5 post up please
again  which msn contact was it this time
the mittanni clearly intended to disband your alliancealso this isnt about a simple name change its about the rules
it is a big deal only because with the name change you kept the sov you could have done it the proper way as the rest create a new alliancei agree with you that game mechanics happen to not work as intended and are getting fixed all the time but thats game mechanins alliance name change is not a game mechanism it is pure favorism and that is unacceptable by ccp or any other company that want to see their fixed rate paying customers the same
renaming kenzoku was completely unnecessary i thought name changes were just for offensive names and such not for people deciding hey we want to jump into this alliance to quickly get some sov and then change it to a new name later
again youre quoting rules of a game not even a real sport but a cyber online fun game and even worse nobody is affected by this one bc nobody who wants a name change has a history to back up the logic for their change like bob does grow up you tool
id like an immediate refund of the isk spent when reforming our alliance after it was formed incorrectly the first time please just for the sake of fairnesslets see if that happens disband bobr if you pronounce the ticker it sounds more like band of bristolians now
firtst of all i corrected what you saidactually it was labeled an exploit and then suddenly because of your whining it was not labeled an exploit anymore despite no in game methods being there to stop it then you did it dozens of times a day for a solid month and then the very day goonswarm launched its first mothership thereby gaining the capability to do it back to you the gms suddenly said it was an exploit again and not to do itno sign of favoritism there really
or they could roll back the sov and give us our alliance back this is the far less of 2 evils its not like we didnt suffer initially talk about wanting to kick a guy while hes down
shame on ccp one rule for all
so even you admit that this was special favouritism ccp only shows to bob
at this point this is a 58 page threadof course its complicated the matter is still under investigation by ccp any changes ccp makes will benefit all of eve in fact i could reasonably argue that what ccp has done already has opened up all sorts of possibilities for flexibility in how ccp applies these rules this game is not static
i support this
i like your its just a game defenseits just a game get over the fact were at the center of yet another rulebreaking fit of nepotism its not important its just a game go outside let us sweep this under the carpet with our other shenanigans nothing to see here and then you see a ccp logo in an open closet making humping motions towards a loud slurping noise
the question for me is  would ccp have done this for anyone else and the answer is obviously no
quoting the rules of a game is wrong that shows how ignorant you are like bob does too bad ccp shouldnt be choosing favorites over others a failed alliance is a failed alliance we cant just bail you out because your too big of a company to fail wink wink
mate have they ever rolled back the server not even with the pos exploit that happened and that was a serious problem i totally get where you are coming from if you want to be named koukouroukou band of brothers thats a valid request the mechanics of the game allows you to create any alliance name you want the function that got bob disolved was a a valid mechanism right or wrong but it was there what happened cannot be changed although ccp must introduce a fix or something because it is really not how disbanding should happen but you must follow the rules because atm you didnt and that have impact on the rest you kept sov 3i for example 23 weeks ago i petitioned to change my alts corp history and delete a corp from the list that couldnt hurt anybody yet i got a negative answer stating that characters names and history cannot be changed iguess the gm was wrong after all should i petition again it was pure sentimental value for my alt to just have 1 corp in his history should i be treated differintly
oh snap bailout reference its on
while im not really a fan of goonswarm atleast they dont pretend to be some benevolent alliance of loving goody twoshoes and friendly to all like some people assume they should be theyre s and thats thathowever this does set a relatively poor precedent once again that ccp favors tafkabob whether through the action of a rogue gmdev etc in which this is obviously not a case of a rogue gm since it was not immediately rectified in which it seems like a sanctioned change specifically for this alliance with less of a reason to have their name changed than alliances that accidently made a mistype and have to reform their alliance  fees kenzoku existed for quite a few months before the former bob corporations joined into it to start on their sov fest there was no legitimate petition to be made here there apparently were no complaints about kenzokus name until the former bob members joined up at which point they had no standing they could have easily created a new alliance on the spot with their preferred name costing them an hour of time at most since alliance creation is instantaneous they did not do this when it was an option because they had supposedly bigger priorities and now it has turned into a big pr nightmare for ccp because of their actions in helping former bob members i cannot help but put in my support for this matter as it is an obvious violation of ccps own ethics to breakbend their rules for a singular or limited entity regardless of how big or small the slight supposedly was it puts into motion a very slippery slope of eventsas a side note for those saying paraphrasing here because quoting every single one of them would use up all my posting space bob was the first alliance to have this exploit legitimate game mechanic used on them so they should be given some leeway is a terrible argument for the mere fact that almost the exact same thing happened to maximum yarrage and if you did any sort of research you would know that
please link a post where ccp says that the game mechanic which lead to bob disbanding was unintendedgame mechanic please link that post or blog and i will go away
yup thats right i went there
if ccp allowes this to happen for you then ccp is obligated to offer the same service for all eve pilots characteralliancecorp name changes with just a petition for no apparent reason if that happens then i have no problem with the status of kenbobr then i ll vote the name change of yours in a bling
signedas george orwell said in animal farm all animals are equal except the pigs who are a little bit more equal
actually it isnt alliances before you have had to change their names by abandoning sov alliances after you likely will as well you do not deserve special treatment in any way shape or form i pay the same god damned subscription fee you do
haha easily said by the alliance that gets whatever it wantstry being a normal player and asking for favors
heh ccp does it again
i think they are obligated toofor no apparant reasonthere may be a reason whoever called me mister i am not
agreed can you plz petition to change my name to start with a letter other than the first and last 10 of the alphabet plz because when i started eve i had now idea that just a letter will play such a huge role on how fast i am getting primary and blown up in a fleet battlevalid reason hehedit can i have your number i am a mister
dear god ccp do you not learn from your past mistakes again we see ccp is willing to bend their own rules for a favored alliance the gm who did this is at best allied to the corp formally known as bob and willing to break their own rules at worst he is an idiot who did not consider the ramifications of such a contentious change and should not be doing the job he is doing
poor showing ccp figured you would have learned from the first time around

i like how the bob guys who clearly throughout this whole affair have held this game more dearly than most men hold their own families keep telling those angry at their cheating to grow up get over it its just a game etc theres an irony in there somewherethe people you bob members keep saying grow up to are by and large not part of an omg elite pvp clan they probably havent accrued years on this make believe world and they sure werent crying online two months ago because their lifes work was destroyed theyre probably by and large like me people who are not directly affected by this at all but still find themselves annoyed that the game administrators are so clearly favoring a seemingly random group of beardos by habitually changing the rules in their favor

by your logic titan bowling was legal and legit yet your mates still want us banned for that one
in all the hype over the new mission arc one thing is sorely lacking consideration of gallente standing i have a 521 gallente navy standing i had a drop on a mission an invite to come and run the mission arc i was gunned down by the gate guns the second i jumped into gallente space the invite seeding in caldari must stop most people running missions in caldari will have negative standings with gallente all this is doing is getting a lot of caldari pilots ships blown upi feel betrayed and lied to everything i read in blogs and forums and chat nothing was ever mentioned about this all i want is my hawk back and a public notification to everyone in eve warning them of their standings before they attempt this mission
signedtheir should be a big red sign at the login screen saying when logging into eve you might lose ships  items  whatever if you dont use your ing eyes do not login if you are not absolutly sure how to read what is written
im in support for the mission bitbut the loss of your ship is your own damn faultcheck standings next time you fly into an another empires space
i recall the first thing i ever read about arcs stated that they would be across all four empires if youre at shootonsight standings you cant do it and this is fairly well advertised in the information ive seen about epic arcs now the arcs are lame in a hundred other ways from all i hear  to my understanding its like grinding a l1 agent except with more flying around and less reward  but 521 is your problem not ccps
are you referring to that mission where you destroy a single frigate and you get an item called smugglers warning about sister alitura the description for that readsremember that sisters of eve agent alitura who nearly caught our trail the boss called in some favors and got her reassigned to arnon ix in genesis the good sister alitura may be resourceful but shed need a capsuleer with clearance to all four empires to be any threat and we know how much the sisters love capsuleers i bolded the relevant bit doesnt that pretty much tell you that you need good enough standings to do the mission
i brought up the issue long agothe sheer fact that the epic storyline arc deal is 1 mission thusly no arc at all on top of that people have horrible standings with sisters andor gallente where the mission happensthey responded with yayayay we will do that soon
thisa mission that requires people to read imagine that
this is a good thing
id love to see a new forum section one with a ticker next to it called hidea forum section so exclusive that it would make the forums so much more agreeable to anyone who doesnt really care about why what who or when the goons or bobkenbobrwhatever had an issue with their bathroom soapsnot to say they only discuss useless issues or that some things brought up in these discussions arent valid points but god damn it its turned into something thats worse than a public american election if it were led by chipmunks and all the votes were counted by who got the most tomatos thrown at them within a given timeframe while solving a sudoku puzzle we all know they couldnt do a sudoku anyway thats really all i have to say i dont want to add to the drama and if you have nothing more to say than bullcrap then please shut up in here either you support a new section called internal workings or stationside gossip or whichever name they may choose or find to their liking or you dontmy only motivation to post this is that the alliance discussion boards used to be interesting to read  when like someone other than the goons or bob had a thread there  threads that are majorly more structured and less cavemanesque once they hit two pages quick edit for those who may have misunderstood this would be a section for threads about all alliances that have outward drama or babble not just the two mentioned above
gentlemen of goonzoku reloaded if you could please relocate your drama to the conveniently ropedoff area it would be much appreciated sincerely the managementthumbsup for caods existence and keeping the drama out of the useful forums thumbsdown for the belief that caod would be useful without the drama  seriously about the only things you can discuss there are battle reportswhich invariably disintegrate into bickering over how it actually went down and drama there has to be a cesspool for that stuff and id prefer it all stayed there instead of leaking out
im sorry the rest of you are so completely uninteresting 
sweet a new quote edit rats too big for my sig argoh and this  supported even if it wont happen
if you are referring to the kengokus renaming themselves it wasnt about alliance drama it was about the rules
that bs about renaming is just the recent news you really havent been here enough if you havent seen the countless annoying and brainkilling threads that pop up regularlyand its more often goons than bob to be fair but not like i care i just would like to see some small inkling of something decently readable for once
its drama that happens to be about the rules its not a nice calm thread of people debating the merits of alliance renaming policy  there are some people doing that but theyre getting drowned out by raging goons harddoneby bobs and flaming alts on both sides and thats just in the main thread  the ten parodyrestatement threads add nothing whatsoever to the discourse except volume and yet people keep making them and thats just on the assembly hallunless something weird happens this is the last post im making on this issue its just getting out of hand and nothing were discussing is going to help ccp should explain which of their staff did this and why bob seems to have gotten consideration no other alliance has gotten and the csm should definitely be involved in the process at some level but talking in a thread discussing threads parodying threads about the real issue solves nothing lets stop bumping the tenthread drama bomb and get back to discussing the actual issues of the day
im pretty dissapointed in a lot of things about our most recent patch and im not going to make this a wall of text graphicsnew pos sheilds are ugly as hell too much to look athurts my face i really liked the old graphic can a brother get an amennow all ewar pointscramtracking disrupt looks the same its flashier and prettier maybe but again too much to look at bring the old stuff back plssound the volume gradient relative to the camera and proximity of the ship is much steeper now kinda sucks if you want to have sound but not be in the face of your ship all the time please fixplease consider this leaving some things to the imagination is a good thing i belive your dev team was going for spicing things up or something to that effect but to be honest i think a lot of stuff was overdone if you want to improve graphics i would do it subtly why not fix the sky coloring in starsystems there has always been that pixelated ugly transition between contrasting colorsand effects how about making asteroids or stations hard sprites ie they block turret or missiles lol that has always been cheesyok im about through and the reason that i decided to post today is that i have thouroughly enjoyed the game for several years now thank you ccp and all of the community but i have seen the development of eve take a turn down a path that i dont like with this most recent patch this will never be a game for the masses i hope
why just to show your support for the children in the world who have a hard time
im flipping the main breaker the whole dayhoping for a sunny day as it gets cold here in sweden
you seem like you may well have good intentions here but you picked a bad way of expressing them this isnt the forum for that sort of thing unless youre proposing that the csm officially endorse your suggestion of not playing eve to ccp and see if the devs will agree since that is rather clearly not your intent you may want to move this thread to events  gatherings or maybe eve general and not the assembly hall
you couldnt have picked a worse time to post this people are going to take this thread the wrong way on so many levels its not even funnyrun run far and keep runningnot supported for reasons i will not get into
no these kinds of events are stupid and the effort spend promoting awareness could be far better spend making money to give to these underprivileged individuals i do not see how not playing a game on a particular day will in any way help make their lives better if you really feel that motivated to help a tiny fraction of the species then cancel your account and spend the money on charity instead of eve
puts on his best falsettowe are the worldwe are the children
actually 11 to 12 eve time works better for me can we do it then
come to 319 we will congaline around the yz9 gate to cure aids and cancer
force it to senior gms and internal affairs of ccpchange the rules in
cheese cheesefree cheeese
no support your crying about a minor thinglock thread pleaseisaac
lol  u
lets let everybody play by the same rules
precedent has been set let the good times rollalso petition to ban puppet masters for being terrible posters
notice how the op doesnt actually display the name of his corp nor allianceoh right its a nub corp alt why didnt u post this with your main
says the pot calling the kettle black
i guess you can only change your alliance name if ccp pilots fly for you then you can make up whatever rules you want whenever you want
while were at it how about ccp stops deleting threads that expose their favoritismnot locking as per usual theyve been deleted
im not defending what ccp did here but my understanding is that there are more devs who fly for goon than for bobzoku reloaded it just happens that the sleazeballor maybe its the idiot  he did get caught after all flew for bob
posting in a looser goon alt thread
i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that have anything to do with in game political bull should be deletedlockedand thrown out of this boardthe csm has no business nor does it care to have business with a bunch of damned 5 year olds who have to throw damn fit over every stupid little thing that happensall of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behavioralliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the aboveseriously clean this filth from our boards
supported
little hint the csm was originally founded in response to the previous examples of corruption and favouritism towards a particular alliance by a handful of people within ccp if a single person within ccp has started displaying such favouritism towards that particular alliance again then this forum is exactly where it should be raised
the first thread on the topic was fine  as nevada said the csm is as much about transparency as it is about game changes its the halfdozen followups that are ing me off
i agree to this post this should stay constructive in this forum and issues should be raisedif one issue is raised it doesnt need more threads
then file petitionsthis hardly is what i call an effective way to get ccps attention
that thread has the feel of goonswarm harassing the assembly 500 supports  most of them dont say anything and are within seconds of each other this screams bull seriously i could not care less if an alliance is renamed especially when no proof has been offered that it was ccp or anything of the kind and witch hunts always stink of stupidityand this place was starting to look so nice and clean
if you rename an alliance you lose sov bobkennybeaver was renamed with a name longer than the limit mind you without losing sov so this was done by someone at ccp
what dear ignorant fools this thread is a good poll of who knows what the hell is even going on in this game and who has spent their lifetime in empire maybe you asinine dolts havent noticed but changing the name of an space holding alliance has rather serious ingame sovreignty related ramifications when kenzoku decided they wanted their old name back they should have had to disband kenzoku resetting the sovreignty ticker on their precious few remaining bits of space but thanks to gm friends they still have within ccp managed to avoid that little bit of awkwardness this means that the original poster has no idea what even goes outside the warm cozy blanket provided by concord
this poster would have brains enough to know that posting here like an ass would be a waste of timeand that he should spend his time filing petitions directly to ccpi guess your not that smart are you
supported also ban all goonfleet characters from ever posting ever againisaac
except your proposal starts with the accusation that ccp is directly responsible and therefore why would you bother coming to the assembly hall to draw the attention of the csm who are beholden to ccp oh yeah because youre a vacant  goons  the most aptly named alliance in the gaming metaverseno one here who isnt part of goonswarm gives a flying  honestly try a petition storm stop wasting the assemblys time
i beg to differ if you cannot see the possible ramifications of people in power showing favortism towards a minor group then i really cant help you the csm was actually made for situations like those not for your boring nerf caldari petitions in case you havent noticed many empire dwellers such as myself are apalled at the idea of game mechanics being tweaked at my own expense as was explained there is a hefty price too pay for your name change and the beavers have circumvinted that nothing is perfect but that doesnt stop anyone to strive for perfection and balanced gameplay is as close as we are going to get hope that helps
the csm isnt beholden to ccp its beholden to the players who vote those people in to their positions do you even know how a democratic system worksyoure right we have absolutely no proof ccp was involved except that the name was changed without kenny losing sov the name is longer than the allowed limit and the alliance has exactly the same alliance id as kenzoku other than you are correct we have zero reason to believe ccp was involvedmaybe some of you should go study what the csm was formed for heres a hint it was formed so players could oversee ccp specifically because of situations like this go read the ny times article about t20 and band of brothers and educate yourselves
except for the fact you arrogant pricks obviously forgot that the csm can say all they want ccp can choose to ignore themso skip the middle man and make a petition stormstfu and leave the assembly hall alone and cut the political bull out
im sorry that people using the csm for its intended purpose upsetting the balance of your precious assembly hall upsets you so much you should really relax about it youre going to hurt yourself
we wouldent have to make a stink if ccp followed the goddamn rules its a dman shame that we players left to police ccp
i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that are written by the op should be deletedlockedand thrown out of this boardthis board has no business nor does it care to have business with a terrible poster who has to throw a damn fit over every stupid little thing that happensall of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behaviorwhining about threads involving alliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the aboveseriously clean this filth from our boards
go back to your hole for now once this more serious issue is dealt with then you can get back to boost ravenn my raven missllez dont work to good in missions postsalso ps csm is not for proposing ideas actually that would be the features and ideas discussion so your attempts at pleading to ccp have all gone unheard for off topic posting in here
this is exactly the type of issue the csms should deal with
remove threads because you dont agree with them yessireesarcastic thumbs up
actually thats wrong the article in nyt is nowhere near right about what the csm is i suggest that you read the csm paper about what the csm really is
its a petition thread and goonswarm is rather known for having a lot of warm bodies most of whom are capable of following a link and clicking a checkbox doubly so when you consider that its getting a lot of support from other bobbobr kz t20 enemies the fact that the petition is growing quickly should be no surprise to anyone its not malfeasance its outrage among an easilymobilized base
the disgusting thing here is that there are pubbies dumb enough to think that since goons say something they should be against itdrake youre the reason why tafkab was able to get away with their illgotten bpos with their illegitimate motherships with directors running their capfleets and giving them inside knowledge into pos mechanics pubbies like you were too busy lining up hoping to join their ranks and cheering them on to realize that when ccp commits acts that destroy the integrity of the game it destroys any magic it hasthat ccp still hasnt learned their lesson despite all of this is truely sad with the current upheaval in 00 and the next expansion out eve should be getting a lot of good press on how exciting the game can be instead because they refuse to stop playing favorites with their pet alliance the gaming media is going to go through another cycle of how the company is corrupt and all of these prior acts are going to be rehashed and ccps name is going to be deservedly dragged through the mud againbut keep on raging against goonswarm it just shows how ignorant you are
its a good thing i didnt have to read the op to understand that youre an idiot you should stop posting this worthless crap here and go back to cnp or some other part not looked at if you refuse to stop posting that is
this has nothing to do with goonswarm you jackassread the damn post oh wait your too busy clicking a link and following the mobbut since everyone is actually responding to me i guess i struck a nervekeep it coming your responding is actually making you look worsekeep on beating that war drum and wasting your time herewhy listen to me if im such a pathetic troll why give me the attention
its a good thing i dont listen to alts
please post a link to where you supported this thread and not how you read it and instantly posted this one well wait all night if youre having problems finding your postbut seriously though go whine about t2 cruises in ship and modules or whatever it is that you do and leave this forum for what it was originally designed for a place for players to hold ccp accountable for its actions
a bloo bloo a bloo bloo bloo
i fully support that position
to the op try to imagine for a second that this is nothing to do with goons or theallianceformerlyknownaskenzokuformerlyknownasbob i should also point out that i am nothing to do with either alliance or their alliessince the dawn of the alliance mechanic the naming policy has been the same as corporations and characters afaik no name changes have ever been allowed and petitions have been ignored because those were the rules the reasons are pretty obvious constant name changing could be exploited as a result if you want to rename something you start again that means new n00b character disbandreform corporation or disbandreform alliancethe latter as has been pointed out many times on these forums now has several nasty consequences for the alliance being renamed theres the isk cost of setting up an alliance and the loss of sov in any systems the former alliance held that bobr has effectively circumvented a system that is in place for all other eve inhabitants is annoying its rather like me wanting to form a 00 alliance and being given several systems with sov 3 for freeso far arguments for the change have revolved around i dont like what goon did to bob so its justified to allow the name change or goonies annoy me so their tears are justified i find these arguments wanting for two reasons1 goons disbanding of bob was done using ingame mechanics and rules technically it was bob who disbanded themselves via a rogue director the fact that the rules allow for such a dramatic take down is not the fault of those who use them to that end2 lack of objectivity means that we cant ever be sure were on a level playing field if rules can be circumvented on a whim then whats to say it wont be your alliancecorpchar whatever thats on the receiving end when an enemy of yours gets an unwarranted boost this is the reason people should keep a very close eye on stuff like this
wrong ccp has changed names if people capitalized a name wrongly or something like that
who ive seen a lot of posts from people complaining that tweaks like that werent granted when they petitioned furthermore is bobr a recapitalisation of kenzoku i seriously doubt that i would be allowed to change my char name in such a way
from another forumstian empire was created someone noticed the typo told ccp ccp told them to disband the alliance and getting no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1b isk to create it and make sure to spell the name correctlyblack 0ut was created someone realized how dumb this was and so they asked ccp to change it to black out ccp told them no and that theyd have to disband the alliance and get no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1b isk to create it and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted toagainst all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didnt pay the maintenance build they lost all their sovereignty had to recreate the alliance and had to once again front the 1b isk fee ccp did not reimburse any of thatcorps from a defunct alliance known as band of brothers join an alliance called kenzoku they fight under the name kenzoku for over a month and a half they then ask ccp to change their name to band of brothers reloaded and ccp does so without making them disband the alliance or pay a 1b isk feeedit also stain allaince and initiative associates were told that they werent special enough to get their names changed
backing up the above post our alliance also disbanded once due a forgotten alliance bill and we had to recreate our alliance for the 1 bil fee if they now suddenly give bob special rights then i want a 1 bil reimbursement for our allianceback on the op post 1 topic should have been enough the others should have been closed or moved to coad by a mod
sigh in game in forum harassment is also banable  did you think about that
looks like the oposition is having a little trouble coming up with reasons to keep goingironic aint itlook i dont deny that something obviously went wrongbut spraying all that crap all over assembly hall like a bunch of damned kids foaming at the mouth is not only immature but practically degrading to whom they representevery bloody day i see goons are bad and bob is was badyou know what im starting to agree with them all i see day in and day out is spamming ego trips stupidity snobbery you guys cant even keep it real let alone serious your just a damn mob that changes its tune every 5 secondsyou cant even hold an argument without pulling bs out of your assesive said it once and ill say it again you want to complaint petition itim sorry you will get nothing from csm zero zilchnadaall they will do is have a discussion and if ccp says no its nowaste of bloody time and then youll make a bloody damn fool of yourself in posting in a ridiculously stupidly long thread that is obviously ignoredlike ghost training and nerfing missiles all your doing is making yourselves to be the biggest damned idiots that ever graced the forumsall for naughtso stop wasting our time and actually do something about itmake petitions or quit the frakking gametheres no other way to get ccps attention more effectively
hear hear drake agree 100
what rules
you guys truly make me laugh this is ccps game it is not your game it has never been your game it is ccps game if ccp decided that bob was allowed a name change then ok they get it but this is so ridiculous your all having a hissy fit about a damn name get over it it wont affect the change of the war between goons this is favoritism in the least possible way its a stupid name change bob didnt win its wars because ccp helped them if they had bob wouldnt be at its death door by goonswarm in fact ccp if they truly favored bob would have given their territory back free of charge but they didnt they changed a name big freaking dealget over it i wouldnt give a dang if i were in goons or bob so a gm decided to get involved in the game you all cry about gms not being more in the game and then then when they do something you all pull a hernia crying about it end of story and end of threadisaac
thisyes i admit that its a contradiction of policy but its just a fing name change peoplethere wherent given anything of value other than a damn name changeget over yourselvesit would be different if it was something more significantin all honesty i would think it would be appropriate for ccp to grant a valid name change request like a misspelling or a name that is free of anything inapropriatebut all this screaming over a name changeyou people need to get a life wrong or right i can think of worse things to scream over
people dont care about the bobr name what people care about is that they were allowed to change it without going through the usual route of disbanding their alliance losing sov3 in their remaining systems and paying 1 billion isk to create a new alliance with their preferred name there are many examples in all these whine threads where alliances were refused permission to change their name and were told to go through the process i mentioned previouslyas a result the allianceformerlyknownaskenzokuformerlyknownasbob has effectively been given 1 billion isk and sov 3 status in multiple systems im sure the other alliances who never had that priviledge are very happy at this socalled fair treatmentso far the arguments against have been of the goons hax0r3d bob so deserve what they get or its only a name thus demonstrating pointmissing of epic proportions
then make a damn petition and stop clogging up the boardsi dont have a problem with the complaint i have a problem with the jackasses that scream in spite of the fact they could have filed a petition and left it at that
its not just about a name changeits also about1 mechanics abuse usually an alliance that changes its name loses all sov and must pay 1 billion isk to reorganize thats a lot of money whether youre involved in corporations or not2 the larger issue of fairness frankly all players should want to have the assurance that theyre playing in a game that isnt crookedyou guys on both sides keep making this a carebear vs alliance  issue but its actually something all players should be worried about
snipped someimhoyou will never have certainty that the game isnt rigged human beings are in large enough numbers going to have a few who break the rules that is a certainty asking for a large corporation ccp to be 100 honest 100 of the time is naive again imho you want to really get ccps attention you will cancel your account  en mass complaining on the boards will probably imho accomplish nothinggetting 2500 people to cancel accounts even temporarily will make them sit up and take notice if you can get an entire unnamed 00 alliance to cancel for one day  that would get the accountants and administrators on the case of the gmsdevelopers to fix this nowotherwise welcome to gmdevs eveonline and dont be surprised when it goes to ppoopno i have no affiliation with any 00 entity yes this is my main no i dont work for ccp 
no this is a goons vs the assembly issue ever since this issue has been raised all of a sudden a rash of bs threads have popped up all over the board forcing several good ideas down out of sightand the ones im linking to are only a sample some have moved down through the pages and some have been lockedim all for correcting errors but overwhelming the system with aggressive overbearing whining is more than a little irritating to those of us who use this board regularly to push game changes
thisop is an idiot
it seems to be ing the goons off and that is all good in my book
am i detecting trace amounts of irony after all your remedy for this rash of threads which so aggravates you is the report link for some reason though you have decided to create a thread of your own to expound on your ideas i read it and was unable to find any of the followingits ok though despite what many people say the assembly hall is for seeking attention as much as for suggesting changes to game mechanics dont be a selfhating attention junkie
completely unsupported csm is about taking issues to ccp not just bugs or such
an issue is an issue as long as the proposed idea of the thread is suggesting changing the game in a way ccp could implement
also isnt this thread in of itself ironic because its whining about such things doing exactly what you dont want to happen in the beginning
i dont understand why people hate goons so muchthey have been highly good for the game newbie training vids accessible by everyoneetc etc goonsbobanyone should full well have access to post their issues in the game even if you disagree or something
good thing i dont listen to s who post with alts and has a serious lack of intelligence about himself
the only irony here is you proving my point with your foolish attempts at diverting attention from the problemhow many threads have i actually started in assembly hallthats what i thoughti rest my case
your an idiot for misidentifying the csm as being ccp itself or having any power over said actionas i have said time and time again ccp can choose to ignore anything the csm saysget it through your frakking thick skull it will hurt less
this has nothing to do with me hating goons other than the obvious lack of brainpower emanating form there end of the galaxymy problem is this mob mentality crap is bull and needs to stop making a mess of the boardsit is one thing to post a protest in a singular threadit is an another to start proposing stupid assed proposals in disbanding each other and compounding that fact with more stupiditytop that off with over half of the individuals participating in this are not even supporting but doing so illegitimately by playing a sarcastic attitude game which makes the whole point of giving support pointless and insulting
post with your main idiot
youre one to talk when it comes to insulting the fact is that your thread differs only by a matter of degree from this problem you so have done such an amusing job of exaggerating name me one occurrence in this thread offurthermore why didnt you just report the offending threads and move on not that i object to this thread far from it in fact im just trying to gain an insight into the reasoning that reached the end conclusion that this thread would be any different than what it rants so vehemently againstthe fact that youve never done it before is irrelevant every attention junkie has their entrance
heres the thing youre 100 right that there should have at most been one single thread the fact some people are overzealous does not negate the issue and is why there is a moderation team or mitnal who is a masochist but a team unto himself this is hardly the first time multiple threads with the same content have been made nor will it be the lastthe reason people are saying you are making it a goon issue is probably because you are being extremely rageish it would be one thing if you could link me to all your other posts where you heavily berated people for making a thread similar to ones already in existence maybe you have i dont know nor would anybody else just happening across your poststhe point is this it is a valid issue that has more ramifications than the issue itselfwhat i meanthere is the issue of the event  that the alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past regardless of your belief that a company can break its own eula but hold their audience culpable to it this event is of course the event in question and is the main focal point it has assuredly been petitioned many times already this events consequences need to be directed at those that abused the system  that would be the alliancebut there is the other event which may sound very similar  that an alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past etc this event is directed at ccp itself not the alliance it just so happens that the two events are identical in nature and so when posting about it they are going to by default be intertwined the consequences of this event need to be directed at ccpboth events are the same but uniquely different
finally someone who uses there head before they speaka i dont believe its ok for a company to violate its own eula thats just flat wrong now whether that this particular area is covered or not depends entirely on the eula and ccps judgement callhowever a name change is not exactly earth shattering if the compromised in favor of one then they should give favor to othersb the whole point of my yellingrantingraving at not just goons but every damn idiot who has to stand on there little soap boxes is they think petitioning the csm for answers is the answer is flat stupidi support the csm in there efforts of representation but somehow i strongly disagree that they are going to amount to a hill of beans on this particular issueyour trying to get ccps attention then why the hell mess with the middle mansurely you people are capable of speaking for your bloody selvesc i am a troll one with brains and many years of experience in the world of gaming eve being one of many i have issues in being nice as every time i turn around some idiot shows up and posts without using his damn brain and expects results only to get blasted by myself or any one of a few legitimate trolls around that actually give a damn about this gameim am neither piratecarebear or 00 basedim none of the above because this game cant be one of any kind it must be all kindsi undersatnd the underlying balance necessities of the game and i will be first to admit i am no expert on any particular area but alot of it is just plain common senseyes someone at ccp likely frakked upbut turning the assembly hall into a damn circus is not what i call a smart moveno one will ever treat a goon seriously let alone with any credability becuase you keep pushing these things1 your bigger than everyone else2 you dont give a  about what everyone else thinks because your bigger than everyone else3 you never treat anything with seriousness because you can afford to take a hit without flinching4 you can call in 100s of people to do the same ting without recourse
5 and to top it off you people refuse to listen let alone give any quater because your bigger than everyone elsegoonswarm has the power of intimidation you can afford to have stupid people flying all over the placeand it wont take a many to achieve thatbob is guilty of the same thingyou guys scream the most you trash the place the most you spam the most you scam the mosteveryone has it out for you guysand yet you expect to be heardand treated just like everyone elsejust stop and think about that for a momentoh sure you can pull up my posts and point out all the stuff ive saidbut i pale in comparsion to the toltality of what your alliance has saidstateddone in the history of this gamei try my damndest to remember that not all goonsbobs are alikeand there are a few who are actually decent people like youbut its getting just a bit hard to wipe the crap off my boot every time i step into these forsaken dump of a forum board thats getting overran with this insanityso forgive me for being a little terse if not blunti appreciate the fact you respect my position i respect yours as wellso do something about it and try the direct approach and leave the assembly hall out of this mess

did my first titan cyno today what an absolutely bugged systemfirstly anyone who does cyno is going to be sent flying falcon arazu and kestral all get blown away sent flyingsecond any ship bumped in this manner has a fair possibility of ending up in an exploitative naturethirdly anything jumped or near the titan when jumped will be sent at least 80km nyx went 80kmhow about as part of the sovalliance boostfix expansion cynos get fixed for these modern fleets
i have no idea what you are on aboutwhat happened 
did you jump the titan right on top of those ships
this is an issue with normal capitals jumping at the same time aswell it is in the patchnotes for apocrypha 102
id suggest you support this topic then
i have an alt id really like to sell but ill be ed if its this that makes me get a credit card 0theres no reason we shouldnt be able to pay for character transfers the same way we can pay for the rest of eve
yes i realize people have needs for escapes however to be frank i still dont see the need of this feature prioritiesisaac
i think the reason a credit card is needed is to prove the seller is the owner of the account its also the reason why the seller always has to pay the fee using plexs removes that safeguard
supported please if u cant use a plex make a similar npc trade good thingy to a plex that deals with transfer
i too would like yaay and the other bobr whiners to get over it and thank us
hahaha
if supporting this thread means that yaay brings his wonderful fcing to the beaver table more often then im all for it
the first duty of every goonfleet officer is to the truth whether its scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth it is the guiding principle on which goonfleet is based if you cant find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened youdontdeservetowearthatuniform
why dont you please quit eve yaay your a goddamn embarrassmentand no i wont get over it everyone should play by the rules except for you who just shouldnt play at all

dont disband the alliance just keep the old name this will be fair for all players
theyve renamed their alliance theyve made their bed time to sleep in it sov reset and 1 billion isk deduction
omg 1 billion111eleven111  where can one get this amount of iskiesincoming in 3  2  1
if its such a pathetic amount why feel the need to circumvent the games rules to avoid it
your moons in delveowai
let me go get you some aloe vera for that sick burn 
hehe
removing the 1 billion isk from them is just us expecting ccp to treat them exactly like they would treat any other alliance wanting a rename in the long run it wont make much differencehowever as they now hold some sov 3 systems the sov reset will hurt them a lot more as they will lose their cyno jammers again
cause lord only knows you barely have any sov left

i happen to like the new look for the minmatar ships myself the orange lighting details and intricate nonsprite frameworks and scafolds stunned me so much that i spent five minutes switching between my ships seeing how cool they looked now if anything they look better and even a bit sturdier i can now believe my tempest will not pull an enterprised on me every time the armor takes a cruise missle with that second support and all
for the most part i like the premium client especially with how they fixed the scythescimitar which imo previously challenged the moa for the ugliest ship in the game on classic i like the classic mastodonmammoth a little more than the new but only marginally in general id prefer to keep the new look minnies have in premium
considering i play with a friend whos been playing this for years hes the one teaching me and he saw me buy the ship and have it not appear in my inventory its not something im making up this is something im sure others are experiencing as well even if they dont post about it and part of my problem is that my ingame petitions arent getting answered even a week later so it occurs to me that it is a pretty big issue am i just supposed to not bring it up not supposed to talk about an issue im having like it doesnt exist when it stops me from playing the game if your not posting something helpful to somebodies problems your part of said problem cause your just causing aggrivation whats the point of saying anything at all just cause you can in which case why shouldnt i
petition times are slow after a big patch but i understand your frustration that said youd do better to ask in market discussions new citizens qa or issues workarounds and localization or even eve general than in assembly hall  find out if theres a known problem and if theres a simple solution rather than asking the csm to bring your bug report to iceland and meet with half the dev team about it in august im not saying your problem is illegitimate im saying that youre trying to use a body that really isnt suited to fixing it

i am a 31 year old humanities student living in the uk ive been active in eve for nearly four years now and have some experience in many areas of eve whilst not professing to be an expert in any one area i believe my wide experience will help to serve the general population of eve and bring what they want to the attention of ccp at all times i try and maintain a neutral stance and believe the subject areas i study help me to achieve this whilst still being passionate about the game i have applied for candidacy on the csm as i feel if elected i have the time and enthusiasm to make a difference alongside whomsoever else gets voted into the csm i would like to give others the chance to be as enthralled by this game as i have been and still am whilst trying to maintain an open mind i do have some areas in which i have a strong opinion in these are small gangsolo pvp which i think has mostly been overlooked for some time now by the developers i would like to see some effort being directed to nonsovereign infrastructure solutions such as mobile refineries mobile research and mobile production facilities beyond what is available now with the advent of wormhole space i think the need for this is greater than ever before lastly as you can expect from my corp ticker i am interested in the backstory of eve and player interaction with it i would like to see more development done that tie in the standard day to day actives of your average eve player with the vast scope of prime fiction that ccp has at its disposal this includes ideas such as widening the scope of the newly introduced epic mission arcs to include pirate and sub factions as well as simply providing more information ingame available to anyone who is interested in where they live what they do and how these things came about i am interested in the availability of background information as an in game asset rather than pushing this on people as i know full well many people enjoy this game without immersing themselves in the storylines and instead writing their own story for themselves if you have any question please feel free to contact me ingame or on here and i will do my best to answer you as promptly as possible

no this party would be focused on protecting their desired experience that goes without saying just as every faction and special interest would be driving their own agendas the reason i started this thread was to determine the degree of interest and support the segment i sought to represent had in the idea of a formal party to be their voice given what so far looks like a record amount of apathy towards the csm iii elections in general and the idea of a party i may have gotten my answerissler
to summarise briefly you whined about being wardecced by goonswarm after being elected pathetic to follow on from that you seem to have no idea what youre talking about in short youre a poor csm who probably only got in by block vote from your alliance
i suggested that the war dec appeared to be an attempt to interfere with the csm process in the end it was just random gooness we never tried to dodge the war and i never suggested any change in eve as a result of the waryour you dont know what you are talking about without citation is about as valid as me saying i think you are basement dwelling loser virgin who has a mother that dresses you funny and has unnatural relations with genetically enhanced livestock it is nothing but a pointless personal insult and honestly like the comment i just made about you not a very good personal insult your insult adds no value to the conversationtry adding some actual facts to your attack next time please or better yet run for csm and show us just how 1337 genius like and uber you are please i cant see how eve can survive without you in the csmissler
nexus the entire csm waz worthlezz thiz time from my point of view again issler you failed to conzider even raizing the war dec limitz for small corporationz by one continuing to support your big coalition friendz on the council plz dont run for csm again issler
why on earth would i have supported that since that certainly isnt something the folks i try to represent would want do you have any idea what a constituency is err maybe if i said i had a constiuanzmy big coalition of friends on the council yeah got me there most of my friends are people i dont know and have never met until months after my election do you really think we are some sort of unified group do you read the meeting minutessorry i wont have your endorsement stuff you truly are the master of the z keyissler

its true the old capital jump effects were way betterthe new one just sucks to be honest i think they didnt put any effort into it and just rushed for expansion
signed
almost all effects has waves type  jumps sensor booster etc old style jumps was more interesting and a bit more epic or so
im agree
i agree current jump effects are just to plaina stargate simply uses an allready existing wormhole to jump a ship through jumpdrives wreck a hole on the fabric of space as in create a new wormhole this demands a more epic fx
i also agree that the new graphic for a capital jumping in and out from point a to point b is very dull and doesnt impress even new players that want a capital i love the graphic myself and especially with a titan jumping to destination system can give a chilling effect to a doomsday imminent on a hostile force on the other end with the cyno or the jump bridging of bs and support ships to the destination
do something about it it is ugly now
even as i write this it feels absurd to say so but the old effect when a ton of caps or fleet jumpedbridged in was whoooohoooo here we godont get that feeling now and thats a bit of a shamegive back the irrationality of real life adrenaline on seeing a special effectzos

support this thread
i too am supporting this topic
agree with op go out with a flash
signed gimme my bright lights back
supporting threadhuh
this season i will mostly be supporting this thread
agreed but the faction stuff should req the same skills as t2 and the officer modules should require the max skills of t2 for a launcher officer it should req the specialized skill at lvl 5the better the modsships the higher the skill req should bebut the t2 ammo shouldnt have the nerfs reduced just their dmg boosted big penalty and big bonus too use
im not a minnie pilot and i dont know any minnie pilots who use barrage but i acknowledge that it likely has some utility sometimes thing is look at what ship would generally use it when i think of a ship that wants long falloff on its acs i think of a vagabond or something similar that likes fighting in the 1520 km range to put a point on the enemy and stay out of webscram range those ships are naturally speedfit to be able to hold the range against slower enemies how well does a fastorbiting ship do when you nerf its tracking people who fight in falloff tend to need their tracking quite a lot actually it was strill who said the line you quoted and me who made about the same points you just did thing is i acknowledge that a handful of slight advantages do not offset the stonking big disadvantages void has except in some incredibly niche situations its not good as a whole even if some aspects of it are and since you cant fire half a shot that means that void is bad sure if you know exactly how the combat is going to play out maybe its better but the thing about combat is that you dont  battle plans go out the window at first contact with the enemy and all that also who trains weapon spec skills to 5 thats just crazy
supported dispite the arguing
remove all t2 bpos from game

ive seen no finer proposal in here p
mmm hisec veldatar should be epic i hope they dont mine too much or the hulk pilots will cry
well in some way i am strongly against caps in highsec since it is not allowed by concord and thereby not the mechanicsbut well it is chribba so what the heck i support it
somehow i think chirbba is being sarcastic u know about the bobr thingythumbs up anyway

yes of course
i agree that it would be nice to be able to see a titan up close

yorda is forum banned for another few weeks  after flying the nidhoggur for over a year now and discovering just how awesome triage is it is really sexy im pretty happy with the nidhoggur the nag on the other hand has no redeeming features and is a worthless pile of  im fully speced for it and refuse to buy one as its a complete waste of money it needs something other than its insanely long training time if i could change one thing about training on yorda i would of trained for the rev instead of the nag been done training sooner have a good dread and probably be able to fly amazing amarr battleships by nowmotherships are a whole separate issue i never leave my carrier and have plenty of alts so that i rarely need to dock but yet id still never buy a mothership its just not worth putting a giant bullseye over your head and not be able to hotdrop or triage id rather lose a few handfuls of carriers
edit stupid eveo
any news if ccp are gonna pull their thumbs out their arse and fix the damn nag
i never understood why they made missile batteries that way in the first place if keeping them online while they have a cpu use isnt technically doable it most likely is sounds more like a question of effort the simple fix is to make them take no cpu and decrease caldari tower total cpu that would make them less useful as high sec lab platforms and useable in lowno sec the first solution is preferable but either way something has to change
even though the emoragers are flooding the assembly hall with bullcrap posts about alliance renaming go back to caod whiners and pushing legitimate issues to the bottom i think this still merits attentiononce again what exactly does it take to get a csm to even acknowledge this exists
i would like this really would eliminate some confusion
well it has been a while since the last time i got killed because of 00 gate blockades ive made an effort to never warp in a straight line in occupied sytems out of high sec since theni was in a 00 corp once but not for long i joined alongside a friend didnt learn much about them took a break from the game for a few months got kicked out for inactivity and to this day i still have 2 cruisers in their hangars which i dont feel like getting backi mean really noone even gave a damn about my questions when i logged in that fine day and procedded to fly a shuttle around until i was finally caught and blown up just before reentering 01 spaceall i have left to say about that is its fortunate clones get shipped back to somewhere friendlier when in a station one isnt allow to be in
so when
ok good
1 god idea
agree stealth bomber need boost 1
sure after all you wouldnt catch some grizzled veteran pilot sitting at a bar drinking some fruity drink like a pina colada that man is going to have a scotch in a pretty damn dirty glass with a cig definite support
everyone not supporting this should keep in mind cigarettes are already in game
are we talking the virtual burning of tobacco to create a smoke that can be inhaled by a person to get their nicotine hit in public which in many countries is illegal or a virtual ecig  aka electronic cigarette which is legal in rljust a thought  and dont have many of them al thorr
yea remind ccp so they dont forget to remove it next patch just like they did quafe girl
boosters are higher on the offensive scale and theres no way theyll take them out when they already got their t rating for the boxed set which was the whole point of removing the quafe girl cigs are safe for the foreseeable future
with all the wanton murder  and pillaging in the game anything to help chill the virtual mind and soul is only appropriate and welcome how do you define need anyway
yea i would like to be leaning against a wall in jita 44 smoking 1 with a black coat and a hat on looking all cool and stuff when i get run over by a noob in an ibis who didnt dock properly and realise i was in the docking bay and that was my ibis
i want to play an accordian while smoking a huge cigarim not kidding
lets make accordian hero game plastic cigar included
a fine puff of whatever it is people want to smoke is a good thing imo i myself would live a fine cigar and a snifter of cognac between missions
i was actually referring to the amount of time it took ccp to actually give them a purpose granted they do need a slight nerf at the moment but it took ages for ccp to get around to boosting themagreedminor how can you say minor if weapon balance issues are currently half of why amarr are far too powerful youre contradicting yourselfthe current low sec changes have done nothing to fix low sec ccp themselves have admitted that low sec needs help the majority of the problem is the completely worthless ore there when compared to high sec rats have essentially nothing to do with the problemim referring to huge influx of minerals from drone space that unbalance the current economics of minerals look at the valuedeamnd of trit versus supplyperhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and try to understand the numbers and math involved the nighthawks tankbuffer is hardly superior to what other command ships can fit as well gank what the hell are you talking about the dps of the nighthawk is awful expect to have tank and gank perhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and learn some math before you start running your mouth i provide very solid evidence and numbers that the nighthawk indeed has a serious pg issue its all in that thread respond there if youd like all the arguments are there for you to read if youd take the time before respondinghowever this thread isnt about any of the above particular issues the only topic of this thread is the amount of time it takes for ccp to respond to any given issue even issues that theyve admitted are problematic why is it ccp moves so slowly on balance issues were not talking weeks or months here were talking years in some cases
as it says to be honest never seen the need for them back in 2003 and do not see any need for them now other than for epeen as far as im concerned they have no place in eve and any of the arguements i have heard to support them have lacked any real substance and all lead back to what i said earlier more epeenif people want kill stats then they should go play unreal tournament or somethingjust my opinion of course but id like to think anyone that is a true eveer will support this ideathank you
if you dont like them you can ignore them me i like them
force new players to leave starter npc corps after a certain reasonably short character age and either formjoin a player corp or be moved to a new npc corp against which its possible to wage a concord sanctioned war players leaving player run corps are automatically moved to the same new npc corps
in before the flames
supported
op should learn to read before making the same damn proposal for the 1000th time
the game needs something like thistoo many people hide in npc corps
yes of course players should be forced to play the game in the fashion you prefer after all whats the point of a sandbox if people are allowed to play in it differently no this idea isnt any better the 500th time than it was the first
so we now have people who are what 3 months old and working on mining suddenly able to be mass wardecked into oblivion come on ccp isnt that stupidif you dont like people in npc corps give them a reason to leave it and join your alliancecorporation dont whine to the devs about forcing people down a path they wouldnt like to take im in npc corp so i can help the newer players and youre asking me to leave it because you cant wardec to your hearts contentepic fail
not supported for the 1000th time
i obviously support my own proposalnpc corps have a distinct advantage compared to player run corps  being in one entitles a character to practically unlimited riskfree income balanced with practically zero possibility for isk or ship loss this is unfair to players who choose to join a player run corpanother consequence of the loss free gameplay style is that npc corp players gain unfair advantage in the industry sector  they can afford to produce and sell goods under the cost with the excuse mineralsdatacores that i obtain myself are free potential loses would let them make more reasonable business decisionsnpc corps prevent a multitude of useful gameplay options  disrupting enemy1 industry  disrupting enemy1 supply lines  retaliation against ninja salvagers more commonly known incorrectly as salvagethieves  retaliation against scammers market gougers or just plain competitorsim sure there are more inventive people out there who can think of other possibilitiesdoes this proposal create imbalance or unfairnessnonew players have a choice  either join a player run corp and be equal in all respects to other players who joined a player run corp or join a wardecable npc corp and be exposed exactly to the same risks as other playersnew players should they choose so are of course allowed to enjoy the safety of highsec and starter npc corps for a reasonable amount of time  until they are deemed to not be in distinct disadvantage compared to older players due to not knowing the gamedoes this proposal forces a particular gameplay stylenobeing in an wardecable npc corp does not prevent any carrier that was possible in a starter npc corp a miner can continue to pursue his mining carrier an explorer can continue to explore a pirate can continue to kill a mission runner can continue to run missions an industrialist a trader a scammer all can continue to play exactly as beforeonly while being exposed to the same risks1 enemy means either or both of enemy corpalliance or individual enemy player
some repliesdrake draconis i assure you i can read and write reasonably wellherschel yamamoto npc or wardecable npc corp does not prevent any particular style of gameplay preferred by me or notbunyip im not sure what point are you trying to make that certain professions and players ought to be privileged
correct me if im wrong but if a pilot is out in space doing his thing anyone that wants too can come along and shoot that pilot if a pilot is sitting in a sation doing his thing no matter what corp he is in no one can do anything to him even if he is in a decd corpbeing in an npc corp does not prevent other players whacking that player what you want is the ability to go after high security pilots without consequences you want to dec the larger corps in the game so you can go after pilots that have no desire for pvp and will barely be able to defend themselvesand lets be honest here all 00lowsec pilots have some sort of alt to do their market work for them if you vote for forcing highsec players into decable corps then you should also vote for allowing one single account and one single pilot for everyone playing the game to truely level the playing field
you can read and write good for youso i guess its a severe lack of intelligence and foresightdid you actually check the forums to see the other exact same proposals and there answersdid you actually bother to research this instead of emoraging on npcsdid you actually think this through to the point of evaluating balance or are you just interested in padding your killsyup figured thatthinkbefore you post
a player in an npc corp cant be wardeced but they also have disadvantages  they cant issue a wardec they cant anchor a pos they cant rent a station office for extra tabs they cant use a corp wallet for extra tabsmore relevant than the last because there are no station containers for isk they cant issue corp contracts to up the contract cap from 21 to 81 and so on also your proposal fails another critical test  how many wardecs do you expect there to be on caldari provisions as soon as it becomes a decable corp having npc corps that can be wardeced means that it is utter suicide to be forced out of the base corp because you can expect dozens or hundreds of highsec pirates to keep permanent decs on those corps for the free kills of players who dont know that theyve just been dropped from safety into what might as well be 00 space so i want to have items scattered about without the ability for a ceo to pay a few million and spy on my hangars or maybe i like helping new players out and prefer to spend my time in corp chat giving them pointers or im paranoid of people i dont know and assume that player corps are just traps for the unwary and the ceos will scam you mercilesslyyes ive known people who thought that or god forbid i just want to pay ccp 15month to mission in peace and not have to worry about corp mails corp ops corp drama and yes wardecs eve is not the safest of games of course but it isnt defined by the gank alone either yes the bear is an unfashionable creature but we shouldnt just throw them all out and even if we should ccp never would for financial reasons its just not going to happen
i think its fine the way it is if npc corps offer such huge advantages why are a higher percentage of veteran players not in them
also keep in mind that about 75 of those npcers are not npcers but alts of mains who are in corps and or 00duh
force every player to mine the first hour they are logged why i love the pvpers tears go searching your easy kills another way
ravenesa i cant see how you comments are relevant to the discussion you point similarities between npc corp players and nonnpc corp players theres nothing wrong with that what is wrong is the privilege of npc corp playersdrake draconis your comments is nothing but flaming please grow up andor go to flame elsewhereherschel yamamoto what you describe is easily solvable by creating your own corp which is one of my points  join a player corp possibly your own or a wardecable npc corpboknamar i dont know whether what you say is true or not so i cant comment on it if its true it may be due to the fact that veteran players are ones who came to the game before it went half the way to world of evecraftdrake yes i keep that in mind in fact i have pointed out that its not possible to attack such alts thus harming their 00 mainsvenkul mul what you propose is forcing a particular profession to players unlike me also please refrain from personal attacks especially when a simple check on my killboard and the killboards of all the corps and alliances i have been will show you a negligible percent of empire kills it just makes you look like a stupid child
you try to force a kind of play stile you like to other players and then get offended when some retort your proposal against youi think the one that need to grow is you your idea has been suggested and soothed down hundred of times nothing has changed from the last time it was refused but you feel the need to repeat it again and pretend to be taken seriously the only reason to propose it is to get easy empire targets without loss of standing as it has been showed in all the others thread it is easy for macrosweatshop farmerstransport alt and c avoid the consequences of being wardecced so this suggestion only result would be to get easy targets in high sec if you dont know that it mean you havent searched what was already written on this topic
not supported for the same reasons i didnt support this the last time it was proposed and the time before that and the time before that and
not sure if this has been thought of butbecause a point is mandatory in any pvp encounter and due to alot of ships are limited to 2 mids sacrificing a rig slot to add a pointonly would allow for more variety on the fieldrestrictions only one point rig allowed per shipcalibration 300
getting the ball rolling
how about we limit it to t2 ships to bridge the gap to the t3 shipswe could also up their calibration to allow for iti dont think its a horrible idea id like to see some other opinions though
other thoughts if the penalties are not enoughoption 1if you fit a point rig you cannot add another disruptorscram to your standard midslots nullifies 2x scrams fitting and dual 24km disruptionsoption 2disruptorscram fitted using the rig receives a 50 reduction in warp disruption strength 5 strength will still prevent a ship without stabs from warping and dual scramblers will equal only 3 points instead of 4
this feature would definitely add a lot of versatility to ships but of course it raises difficult questions on balance since it can impact so much of the gamewhy would anyone want to fit a weapon damage rig if its much better to add a low slot and fit a damage modwhy add a rig to increase scanner strength or sig resolution when its more efficient to add a mid slot and fit sensor booster or eccm things of that naturehowever the general idea is definitely good you know how minmatar ships supposed to be the most versatile ships in gamewhat if we gave this rig only to minmatar it would certainly promote the main advantage of their shipsand so the other faction ships dont feel left out why not have special rig for each faction sort of like the national rig designed specifically to emphasize their faction strengths
a half decent ideai dig it
so youre asking for a scrambler that fits in a rig slot um wow its an interesting enough idea i suppose but at present theres no way to activate a rig  all of them provide passive effects maybe if the entire rig system was getting overhauled dramatically but at present i dont think this idea is at all possible to implement
it would act more like the tech 3 subsystems add midslots only you can not fit anything but scramdisrupters
i like the concept but its a large buff to shield tankers and bleh to armor tankers i think a better idea would be give all combat ships a built in warp disruptorscrambler and swap the disruptor and scrambler modules for attribute enhancers that affect the built in version rather than being items themselves
i like the idea but i would rather see a separate rig for each level of slot and cap each ship at a max of 1 eachadditionally each rig should still have a penalty i would propose if you add a slot to one area you lose a slot somewhere elseso for examplelow slot rig bonus 1 low slot penalty 1 mid slot calibration 200mid slot rig bonus 1 mid slot penalty 1 high slot calibration 200high slot rig bonus 1 high slot penalty 1 low slot calibration 200also afaik no ship has enough calibration to mount all three i could be wrong im still realtively new but two of them are definately possible

gamesetmatch etho demerzelvista you just got served
okey first offi really support the csm i think it is an extremely good thing to have a few people that can voice the oppinion of the community to ccp so it is not about who can scream the highest in the forums wuuhuuu which can only bring something bad with it so i am all for the csm and yes i do agree that they need some more power and yes i do agree that ccp ed up majorly on  well every turn of the way actually even with the reaction thing this cannot have been an oversight unless the employess at ccp have hat on their feets and pants on their heads while talking funny about grissley but well nvm all fine and dandy or whatever you saybut giving the csm credits for stuff which is not their gain is stupid the queu have been asked for forever the reason we have always been getting from ccp is ghost training as main problem ghost training was gone and every one screaming as crazy for the queu soo this is the reason for that not the csm
the reaction problem is understandable in a programmers point of view this game has roughly 40k people on at some of the peaks maybe higher some days each cycle one per hour would require four calls to the module to prevent the step from occuring two calls is what they implemented and it took quite some time to realize the mistake they made if you call this a mistake you should also consider the lack of foresight for the y2k bug to be a disaster even though it made perfect sense at the time of implementationwhile i do feel that this csm was both more in the news due to the pos exploit described above and the dissolution of bob and now this new problem with bobr we were also less in the news as many of the major changes in the game have already been presented by csm1 were working with ccp to get a good mechanic for 00 read the meeting minutes and mining could definitely use an overhaulall in all the csm isnt the bright ray of sunlight shining on ccps dark deeds but we do our job of being a liaison between the players and ccp if you doubt the level of sincerity required to be a csm member youre welcome to try it as its not an easy task
it is not irrelevant to the point he makes when he bases most of his argument on the idea that he was a gmit does however not justify the fact that he cheated you too are ignoring the evidence then go and read the damn csm minutesare you in internal affairs you too make assumptions based on things you dont know how do you know that nobody has been punished because otherwise is certainly the caseif you think a flight from australia and back is free then can i have free stuffsthe fact is that you havent been on the csm that means you have no real idea what the csm actually does because you havent been at any of our meetings if you had any idea then you would have another view on it it is more than a pr stunt and if you accept facts and dont just go by your circular reasoning then you would understand
wth a constructive thread in the eve forums the sky runin short i agree
ghost training never had anything to do with it just have the queues skill switch check account status  if account is unpaid queue is inactive alternately have the account expiry clear the queue i dont believe ccp ever said ghost training was the issue it was players saying that
the fact that he was a dev and not a gm just make the fact even worse and his argument even stronger a dev doing what he did is far worse than a gm doing the same what exactly are you drinkingive read them all there is nothign ther ebut praises to ccp transparence which is inexistent by the way and brownnosing from you the truth is as long as ccp is in charge of auditing itself any evidence they present is null and void if the csm was assembled to be an external auditing source as originally suggested things could be different as it is you are useless and all internal affairs investigation or evidence talk from ccp is a ridiculous farce i make any assumptions i wish in the absence of proof and i bet i am right here the absence of evidence not ccp ridiculous pr but real evidence of the opposite is quite enough for methe fact that you payed for this and had the availability to do it even considering how futile and useless the position is for everything but to gather some prestige in an online game only shows how little value your time has for youif i need to be in the csm to know what it does it is already useless by definition
lavista vista  dont waste your time debating etho ive seen his input on forum threads before hes already made up his mind and will put forth statement after statement that can be neither proven nor disproven when you cant disprove what he says hell think its victory and insult you its a classic conspiracytheory mindset silence is the best antiblowhard technique
i prefer telling him his mother smells of elderberries
you on the other hand is a nice little alt maybe lavistas alt who knows
i fart in your general french accent direction
i rest my case
i dont know if disbanding the csm is the answer but i agree something needs to change i would suggest ccp implement a new company policy that its employees no longer are permitted to join alliances over a certain size maybe even not allow them to join in at allthe fact is it is human nature to abuse any power that is given teachers are not allowed to date students and radio employees are not allowed to participate in contests there are reasons why this is done because it gets abused over and over again just like we are seeing in evecome on ccp grow up and get the devs out of bob and gs and stop this madness once and for all
please ccp return the headlights to my revelationi simply cannot see where i am going this is horrible
obviously i support my brilliant idea
i can never say no to headlights
nor can deer stand dumbstruck in the revelations path anymore
ccp hinted at this a while back but i feel it should be done if possible sooner than later it will drastically reduce isk farming and macros it would allow mining to be somewhat entertaining kinda itll open up lowsec to miners and also make hunting them easier and more fun they can become complacent some other stuff i cant think of right nowperhaps to balance this out with mining noobs have small belts enough for a frigate to mine 5001m isk around some hisec areas and increase mining missionsedit this means basically increase sites that require probing and completely remove the standard belts
do you mean the scannable belts as in the ones that already exist in normal space or do you mean something else op lacks clarity
you can already find scannable grav sites in highsec and lowsec space in wspace you can find some higher quality belts that have various different and more profitable roids in them but wspace is 00 with all the risks that come along with mining in 00 space
op updated
what will stop the isk farmers writing a macro to hunt down belts 
no it wont they will simple have the one person controlling the mining fleets spend all of 10 minutes to scan out the belts and mark them while the macro fleet moves aroundmining will never be entertainingahh i see now this is another one of those get rid of highsec because i dont have enough guppies to easily kill in lowsec threadsperhaps you should try thinking up an original idea to begin with instead of rehashing the force people to lowsec whinethis already exsists accept a mission complete the mission dont turn it in mine the missionfixed that last one for you
im an industrialist but thanks for assuming
personally i think all asteroid belts should be randomly seeded throughout the entire game and you have to scan them out to find themthis would effectively put an end to macro mining as we know it
exactlypeople think that macros can probe with the new system writing something like that would be extremely complex and not very accurateas to an isk farmer probing everything and from there on out farming the system if it happens it happens but the time that farmer took to scan down would add uptheres probably no way to remove them altogether however this would alleviate a large number of them
it takes all of 5 minutes to setup a macro to do basic mining a simple mouse recording program and 5 minutes is all you needstep 1 set bookmarkstep 2 adjust overview to only show roids and sorted by distancestep 3 record the followingundockright click mouse over to new bookmark warp to bookmarkactivate minersclick on the roid at the top of the overview that has been made to only show asteroids and sorted by distancerigh click mouse over to station warpdockmove cargo from hold to hangarset the delays between steps set the macro to repeat x amount of timesand you are donethe higher end macros work the same way once you have a warp point and the bookmark set they work off that the only work you have to do is finding where to go
that works with static belts yes however you have to rerecord a macro or bookmark every day its not a cure for macros just a treatment
there are several problems it will require several changes to the probe system again  as the mining sites should be accessible to people that havent trained the probe use so they should be scannable using the directional scanner making the probing skills mandatory is not a good idea it will not open low sec to miners easy to scan mining spots are as much death traps as belts respawning of exploration sites is borked as they respawn in a random system with the same security level in the same general area if that area is constellation region or even larger it is not clear the net effect is that they tend to pile in less used or less accessible systems so systems without stations hi sec systems in a pocket after a low sec system and so on while it can be interesting for gatecampers that want to kill miners at low sec gates it will not enhance mining in any way unless the mining pockets are small and so deplete fast it will make little difference for a macrosweatshop farmer it is easy to scan with 1 account while the others are mining at best you would remove the hauler for some minute while it scan all the gravimetric sites in system and bookmark them if the gravimetric sites are so small that they will hinder macrsweatshops farmers they will hinder regular miners too
i know it is possible to drop modules on spots where you want them by flying there but i dont find this system accurate enoughthe problem i have mostly is that i align my defensive mods from the center out this way i know the range of my guns and i can optimize the pos guns by rangein short i place my mods on a virtual axisthis isnt possible easily atm due to camera restrictions and placementi believe by making my suggested idea possible you can build your pos more strategically and precisely and a well aligned pos looks way better than a few modules flying here and there

as i was out of the game for some time did this happen after ccp stated it is an exploitif they did mark it as exploit of course if yes then you should get banned if not then its game mechanics and the rule apply here as well so depends on what really happenedi am an individual with my own opinion my logic state the fair thing not what suits my wallet or what my mates say to flamewhinepointtohaxbobedit hell people still pray to god yet we are in the same alliance that doesnt mean that i share their beliefes spelling too bored to google sorryyyy
exgonad posting in support of goons
this topic might make a fairly amusing eve radio live debate with an invited panel of guests ps not supported obviously since i believe the identity theft should have been reversed almost immediately and band of brothers invited to reform their alliance name and identitythe compromise solution we have now might be pretty messy and not fully satisfy anyone but its far better than allowing the goons to whine their way to reversal of whats obviously been a lengthy gm discussion and response to the identity theft petition

you call someone a tool then ask them to grow up real mature of youthe name kenzoku was hated by most of their members and it was a mistake mollee made and you have to live with the consequences of that terrible alliance name in your corporations alliance history profile mollee made a lot of mistakes he allowed haag to disband the alliance by removing the voting safety measure he lost a titan and destroyed your morale he decided to do nothing and stay docked in a npc station and finally he renames the alliance a fail name reloaded like darwin reloaded mollees titan that died this new alliance will die pathetically as wellhaving the name kenzoku demorazlies your members and was a vicotry for your ennemies and you can change it using valid game mechanics but you decided that you didnt want to pay 1000000000 isk and didnt want to have that stain in your emloyment profileno one forced you to choose the name kenzoku except your leader mollee now live with the shameyour alliance is a joke and will die as such none of your ennemies will pay you any respect
my ingame morals guys guys
same rules for everyone
id like band of brothers reloaded to follow the same rules as everyone else
same rules for everyone
you do realize that never before in the history of this mmorpg has anyone got away with such an outright identity theft as goonswarm stealing band of brothers by creatiing an alt corp to block alliance recreation rightin the past this has always led to gms nuking the stolen name and allowing the original owners to recreate their identitygoons are the ones who appear to be operating on a different ruleset to everyone else here if anything
actually haargoths identity is still his idiot
your post is full of lies
please dont tell us something like rules are meant to be brokeni want answers
maybe they where the first to ask for the name change and this is a new service now
i recommend reading before posting
seriously identity theft get out the corporation didnt exist its not like band of brothers was disbanding to rename their alliance to band of brothers reloadedoh wait i just figured out haargoth wasnt behind all of this
lotka volterranever before in the history of this mmorpg youre terrible at history fyi
funny where do the eve rules say that is illegal a name was no longer in use a player created a corporation using that name how is this breaking the game rules forget concepts of honor and morals rules how did this break them
one of the main reasons the playerbase was demanding something like the csm was because of scandles involving favoratism towards bobagain ccp has shown favoratism towards bob we want this to stop
you cant steal something that isnt taken the name was available and someone registered it no rules were broken here
same rules for everyone
everyone else who has asked for a name change ever has been told to fck off this is bs
im honestly confused here jade can you please explain in as much text as you possibly can how you can steal a name nobody is currently using again please make sure you use a giant wall of text because it seems to make you look important
ah so instead of this rather minor abuse of their authority you would prefer ccp have committed a much more significant abuse of their authority
bright colors and flashing images help too hth
yeah us goonies have a terrible attention span
the former eve alliance everlasting vendetta went to play wow their guild was disbanded and the name grabbed by another group of players before they could reform i know its absolutely astonishing that something like this has happened elsewhere in the mmo universekeep using scary words like steal and theft to suggest goons did anything but capitalize on bob stupidity and used anything but workingasintended ingame mechanics to disband bob and get their namekeep failing to see the difference between using ingame methods to achieve alliance goals and getting a gm to flip a switch to make changes to an alliance that are impossible for players to make on their own
disband them or allow the rest of us to do the same
even better maybe jade could put it into the form of a song with some guitar we could called it jade trolls unplugged
i support this edrama
actually youre wrong it happened in age of conan two guilds who hated and despised each other had a long running conflict brought about from sharing a resource instance with each other captain morgan society eventually destroyed the enemy guild the fallen guard when the guild leader decided in a moment of drunken madness to rename the guild rolving re tards no idea what rolving means i assume it was meant to be loving or maybe revolving when this happened one of the captain morgan society guys dropped guild and immediately made a new guild stealing the guild name before they could change back in the ensuing thread the action was actually compared to one you may find in eveonline and was deemed legal it occured on one of the strict roleplaying servers where guild name identity and reputation is probably more important than on a plain pve or pvp serverin essence its little different as sirmolle removed the safety checks ingame himself shares for votes thus was vulnerable to such an action by his own makingyou can read about it here although tbh its a pretty boring threadcaptain thunk
speaking of reading before posting jade are you going to read every post of unprecedented support for this ideaplease take the time to do so  that way we dont have to read your terrible posts for awhileoh yeah and heres something to think about while youre readingkenzoku was formed several months before bob was disbandedformer bob corps could have created an alliance with the revised namegoonswarm has had several directorlevel spies and hasnt been disbandedbob was only disbanded because their executor corp was structured for quick  easy accessget out
goonswarm before agtard gate  goonswarm after agtard gate  goonswarm after molle gate  thank youdr shot
so bob had 2 choices after they were disbandeda join kenzoku instant alliance and sovb make new alliance  with a better name and pay one bil dont know about a sov mechanics concerning a newly created alliance hope someone can explainthey decided for a and they get their instant alliance but now they decide want to do b instead and gm allowed that seems like cheating to me
same rules for everyone
i just see a standard gooncoalition threadnaught with no real substance demanding that ccp bend over for 5000 players in a dark corner of 00 nothing new really ultimately i think you need understand that a thread full of alts and mindless 1s doesnt really achieve anything this thread will go the way of the make goons in charge of caod thread and disappear in a couple of days in a puff of smoke and hyperbole and nobody will lament its absencemeanwhile the rest of the server gets on with playing the game id advise you to do the same
the most supported thread in the assembly hall should be dismissed in a puff of smokeyou obviously have no faith in the csm can you remember why it was created
there is no reason why the gms should change kenzokus name simply because its not the right name
my case after a few months of playing s9 ticker became available didnt had it at that time kindly asked 2 times the gms to give it to my corp since noone was using it no cant do so i had to close the corp  move all assets to corp members get outkick all corp members and finally leave the corp only to redo it 10min later with the ticker we wantedother examplesstian empire was created someone noticed the typo told ccp ccp told them to disband the alliance and getting no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1bn isk to create it and make sure to spell the name correctlyblack 0ut was created someone realized how dumb this was and so they asked ccp to change it to black out ccp told them no and that theyd have to disband the alliance and get no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1bn isk to create it and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted toagainst all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didnt pay the maintenance build they lost all their sovereignty had to recreate the alliance and had to once again front the 1bn isk fee ccp did not reimburse any of thatbobrs case the eula clearly doesnt give you any rights to have your alliance name changed as for bad game mecanics when bob was first dismantled it was noones fault ingame the same faulty game mecanics apply to everyone ingame other alliances can suffer the same fate sooner or later  until ccp changes something you went down thru legitimate ingame mecanis  have the spine to recognize itthe name itself has little importance you can have yer old name back for all i care but bending the eula rules still going strong for sov3 in some systems and not paying the 1bn bill  these facts clearly put ccp in a delicate position again because it clearly shows bobr plays this game by one set of rules and us the rest by another setfirst among equalsand lets make one thing clear this is not bobrs fault this is a ccp failure because they still want to interfere in eve politics why is this happening idk the only logical conclusion is that some people with a lot of decisional power in ccp still have strong ties with bobr after the t20 problems i sincerely doubt even lead gms do something big like this without asking permision from the headhonchoseve is not ccps lovechild anymore its a cash cow and it shows milk it while you can however some people will never understand that money even big money can be made in a number of ways it doesnt have to be like thisif csm has any voice whatsoever this issues will be on their agenda and yes internal affairs should be notified about this they should get mails from as many peeps as possible be decent civil but have a voice mail thembtw bobr i hope you understand why a lot of eve hates you now its not yer socalled elitism its the cheating you need to resort to in order to win something its the lenghts you go to bend the rulesas for sending us out for a walk in rl so we dont moan about internet spaceshipz business how about you follow yer own advice and when you come back at the keyboard you try to play the game fairplay and have some phun while youre at itthe irony is that its not gonna matter in the end enough entities ingame have the means now to take you down completely and keep you down youre not the elitist alliance you once were youre just average now as a lot of other peeps got into a lot of caps nowfame lasts 15min infamy lasts a bit longer
i have no faith in goons thats an entirely different matter csm was created amongst other things to provide oversight on correct goings on inside ccp in their relations to the community in this case a gm has provided a response to the community and a decision has been made this thread represents a standard goon threadnaught trying to bully out advantage in eve by threatening to damage ccps pr on the internetsnobody should cave in to bullying
excellently put at the very least ccp needs to go into more detail about how kenzoku is different from any of the cases mentioned
lol as if the intention of the hurry up and create a corp wasnt to steal bobs identity solely to rub salt into some virtual pixel wound one only needs to look at the silly toon names that post from said corp to see through that charade this whine fest has nothing to do with ccp this or gm that its everything to do with the fact that bob now has some of their identity restored i agree 100 with jade contantine and others that the original corp name theft should not have been allowed to stand rename the childish goon corp to bobr and bobr to bob at that point all will be well in the world of evestill its hilarious to see the goons and their northern nut cuppers stamp their feet like little children and spam the forums they someone think that making a billion threads and filling them with a billion posts from goons goon alts and goon nut cuppers its the same as having a thought worth listening to last year it was spamming the forums trying to get jade contantine removed as csm president and your own  put in last week it was wahhh isd didnt report us sitting outside a station for a month picking our noses now its wahhhh bob has their identity back no fair we stole their name proper like itll be something different next week the whineswarm will always continue
you make that quite clear in your many rambling posts maybe you should have a glance at some of the pages in this thread do you really think all those posts for support are by goonsyou have made your point several times that you dont like goons we understand maybe you are envious of their success i dont know please stop trolling this thread like it was caod
another bobr shows the mentality of a 5 year old stop posting sfsfailme you are only making yourself look an idiot
sad truth  btw i do not support this
my 2 cents01  bob chose to rename to ken for a reason it gave them control over some portions of space or something it didnt work out and eventually goons took even that away from them if bob had created a new name and got no benefit from it then i would agree the new name change is irrelevent but thats not the case bob benefited from using the ken name so they should be stuck with it 01  it didnt take ccp two months to figure out that bob was disbanded using legal game mechanics and that goons took the bob name if this was an abuse of the game mechanics then it should have been dealt with in the first two weeks it ticks me off that ccp waited for the ken thing to go bad ie get their butts handed to them by gs and then decided to let them change their name disclaimer  the opinions expressed here reflect my own personal opinion and not the views of my corp or the cva alliance
well i think the massive majority are from goons goon alts goon allies and good fanbois  a smaller proportion might be from younger players carried along with the hue and cry and mistakenly believing some of the complete nonsense that is being posted by the goons ultimately this is partizan political thread and the goon coalition has been instructed to follow the party line by its leadership
i really dont know what to make of thisone one hand a disgraced cheating alliance seems to yet again have been rewarded by gms in what appears to be a clearly inappropriate use of gm discretionon the other i am so sick of the pathetic puerile destruction of coad and the ingame spamming of goonswarmi am amazed to find myself ambivalent i really dont care the more i think about it the more i think that it is no big deal whether it is kenzoku or bob reloadedas for goonies whining i find myself thinking that perhaps if they showed more respect to others i would care that there was a bias against them by the gmsi suppose i will get spammmed with abusive evemails and 1 line abusive comments but as far as i am concerned is the only difference between goonswarm and bob is that bob got caught cheating red handedapart from that there is not much between them at all
right instead lets have them bendover for 3000 in public besides jade thoes 5000 players dont matter right they are all goons every single one of them in this whole thread are goons and goon alts whats a a few thousand 1s here and there oh thats right the whole point of the csm i really instensely dislike people like you at least with goons you know where you stand they wear their identity on their sleeve you you will support principles one day anything goes the next and have a public identity crisis on the third you have no principles and frankly it gets annoying trying to have a forum debate with you i dont know what to say because i know you arent reading or listening your just posting and reading your own postsare you saying there is no history of gm misconduct and are you saying that nothing here is wrong at all really come on jade please throw us all a bone and take a stand one way or the other goonswarm aside is it right or is it wrong
dont worry  goons have been caught redhanded a fair bit in the past too its pretty standard for bigalliance corruption
i see you are still out of touch with those you want to feel as if you represent
there was a history of developer misconduct it has been dealt with nowadays the dev misconduct thing is just a rallying call for goons to attempt to blugeon their way to victory in a political game that seeks to achieve results with whining and threadnaughts rather than playing the gamewhats wrong here is that goons were allowed to keep the band of brothers alt corp without having it renamed evecorp4234023049 in response to the bob leadership petition against identity theft why this happened is even more troubling because i very much suspect it was delayed and delayed through fear of negative press before the retail release of the latest expansion if this is indeed the case then it suggests the goon alliance has successfully bullied ccp into allowing full on identity theft to the detriment of an entire community of eve players and this is a very bad precedenti cant believe you couldnt read all that from my earlier posts to be quite honest
dont forget friends of goon helped tooand if anyone cares to look i believe it was on page 37 that 2 members of the bobr alliance posted support for this thread joke or not it still counts
no because ccp has already set up enough bad precedents pos bowling alliance renaming banning the guy who finds out about the cheating dev
jade i am still waiting for your explanation on how you can steal a name nobody is using however rather then explaining this please feel free to continue crying foul and crying identity theft that works just as well i suppose
well teeshirts mugs killboard graphics logos hell  custom keyrings and engraved nippleclamps  who knows point as you very well know is that when 3000 players build a community around an ingame identity that identity belongs to them in some greater sense than a mere collection of letters but we both know your question was a troll since your own alliance leader has admitted rushing to register the alt corp identity purely to block the rightful owners of the name recreating their alliance name after the directorlevel emocide
ah thank you that makes sense since they somehow own the rights to this name even though they are no longer using it nobody else can so what ccp should do is modify the rules of the game to disallow anyone from using any previously used corp or alliance nameticker see when you put it that way it makes perfect sense thank you againfollow up question since you were on csm do you think when they add the ability to walk around in stations they should also add brothels
yes and opium dens illicit bareknuckle fistfighting rings black market genetic emporiums slums and every kind of seedy local you can think of
actually the bareknuckle fistfighting rings would probably make for a pretty interesting side game if that was the case im not sure if i would rather see the mittani vs dianabolic or jade constantine vs darius johnson
stop crying goons
you havent read this thread have you its not a simple name change its about the rules and the favoritism they showed to kenzoku the only time a name can be changed is if its offensive in some way kenzoku clearly isnt it isnt a japanese swear word or anything so too bad that being said if one alliance gets to have their name changed due to petition of members within their own alliance everybodys name can be changed then
so everybody who disagrees with you is a goon or a noob and therefore their opinion doesnt count how convenient
technically no doesnt matter what their community built up you could use the argument that the usa television channel hbo and time warner has more rights to the band of brothers due to their 2001 tv drama series based on the life and actions of 101st airborne easy company in world war 2 than a group of 3000 internet spaceship game players who have no real world legal claim to the nameat the time after the bob alliance was disbanded through legitimate in game mechanics the was no alliance corporation or any other entity called band of brothers no one individual or group had any preferential right to the name regardless of how many key rings or teeshirts they had goons got their first and bob wasnt fast enough to do anything about it
approved if ccp wants to start enabling namechanges then let them notify the player base in an orderly manner and post their policy for such other games charge real money as well for such a privilage like portrait changesregardless unilateral action favoring a single faction or alliance again bob is intolerable and exactly why the csm exists youd think someone would have learned their lesson after t20 but whatever back to the woodshed we take themkrum
no compromise not even in the face of armageddoni see it is busy spewing nonsense like its going out of style here too has it found a cross to nail itself to yet
one would have hoped that ccp would have learned its lesson about giving an alliance preferential treatment out of a desire not to play a game run by people out of touch with reality one also would have hoped that after years of rampant corruption from isd an exposed cheating dev and numerous documented devs involved in bob that ccp would have noticed that it wasnt ok to blatantly play favorite with the same group of people againrename bobr to rkz and let them disband pay 1bil and reset all of their sov counters if they want to get the name that they were inexplicably given without having to following in game mechanics    just like everyone else i am actually having a hard time believing that this wasnt a unilateral action but some junior gm who didnt understand the storm he was walking into  cant conceive that there would be obvious preferential treatment like this and that they would actually break game mechanics by allowing them to go over the character limit
supported but disband goonswarm too once the drama dies down and the forums get boring again
shameful
something so insignificant get a grips of yourselfs people in the context of what has happened and the due process that went about to the renaming personally i see nothing wrong with itit appears that a lot of people are just caught up with the ehate and lack any common sensemy 2c but dont let me stop your winning
sup welcome to eve i guess you havent been playing for very long and dont quite rememnber t20 aura delve buffs and all of the other crap bobr has gotten handed to them from corrupt devs and gms over the yearschange the name back disband bobr or drop their sov this  has gone on for too long now

im not against bob somewhat getting their name back but if previous alliances has been denied a namechange in the same matter it clearly shows favouritismnot a big deal but still favouritism and that shouldnt exist in a mmo
shame on you ccp
same rules for everyone
ccp appears to be making up the rules here as they go along if this is more collusion between ccp and the former members of band of brothers what are we the fee paying players to take from this towards ccp as a company poor ethics unprofessional dishonest lacks integrityif that is the case certainly i would have to take a review of paying for multiple accounts and continuing to play the game on an uneven  biased playing field ccp dropped the ball with t20 lets not go back there to those dark days this is a job for the csm to investigate and report back to us the fee paying member base
naughty naughty very naughty
a sad day ccp you suck
ccp im really disappointed in you
poor show really poor
not happy jan
why should we be forced into complying with the rules if you feel that bob should be entitled to a neverending series of exceptions from the ruleswhy do you out of all people be allowed to do whatever the hell you wantit does affect everybody because whenever something remotely bad happens and someone gives you a tough beating you just emorage to your csr mates and it gets fixed we do not approve of a precedent we do not want you to receive favors of any kind and for that matter no one but especially youif you ask me you should be playing the game from a handicapped position just to make up for all the cheating youve done in the pastyour arrogance the constant disobedience and lack of respect for the rules to which we all abide regardless if indeed they are internet spaceship rules depict your antisocial mentality i and many others feel like it is time for you to be wiped from eve deadline yesterdayps start playing freelancer or something multiplayer isnt for you cavemen

so many whining goons  nc pets made my dayhahaha lol
not supported its a name get over it
just a quick noteif you support the issue check the little checkbox that says check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going onmight make you look less like an idiotandkeep posting
oh mai gawd does it really freakin matternot supported i mean does the name really matter stop your crying and start actually pew pewing you whiny goons
neither of those two options should be an option they are not an option to the rest of the eve world and should not be an option to you the problem people have obviously is that ccp shows favoritism to band of brothers this is yet one more case of this sort of favoritism rearing its ugly headyou were owned fair and sqaure i see you went qq to ccp to get some sort of dignity back but in the end you just look patheticgv
no expetions for single entitiesif this option is available to everyone then there is no problem but it is notmain point is one exception leads to another exception and so on and in the end you got ppl exploiting the system and ruining the game
what exactly is the issue would you  and moan if mr smith down the street changes his name to mr johnson as wellbob was crippled by borderline abuseexploit of game mechanics or lack thereof and they went through proper channels when they realised that the old name had been reserved by another partythis whole propaganda campaign smells like a masspsychotic break due to personal issues with the name band of brothers nothing good ever came from masshysteriaa name was changed no other action was taken if you feel mistreated or that an unfair advantage was gained by it put in a petition with internal affairsinternet spaceships are serious i get that but we are talking letters here for goddess sake  their spaceships still blow up and they will probably still partake in the localsmack we all know and love in nullsec
supporteddisband of cheaters
its a role playing game names matterif kenzoku can just change their name without losing anything then i should be granted this option too
id be annoyed if mr johnson got his name change and mr jones was told no and mr robberts was told yes but you will need to reaply for a new passport driving licence and remorgage your house as your current agrement will be invalid lol sovsafeguards were deliberatly removed from the bob executor corp a risk was taken it did not pay offsent a mail to ia they sent it to the gm team now if that isnt a waste of space department i dont know what is
im new and i cant say i know much about this but if ccp is cheating then ill find myself another mmo
100 totally thisif you do not get what this means then you will always wonder why bocbod will be witchhunted out of this sandbox for as long as the servers are live
i agree with most of the people here ccp stop favoring your own alliance and even if it wasnt your own then you still did something wrong but favoring 1 alliance over the others i know a name change isnt a big thing but a rule is a rule if thats not the case then i got a long list over rules i would love to be allowed to break on a daily basecpp fail
okies again ccp where is the response to this 66 pages on this many more locked many more peeps who again find this unacceptablethe gms response was hurf bluf everyone knows it from a noob to a vet how long are we going to wait 2 months for a proper and accurate response with facts 1who else has this been done too alliance wise2where is the change to the rule stated3who else was consulted before this was done 4and who had the final say
thread needs more support from alts tbhgo biomass alts who already supported this and make a new one and support again make ccp think that everyone supports this not just you spoonswarmnorthern cryalitionpathetic legion etc etc
another fun day in eve eh
i am a neutral party and i do not in fact think developer misconduct and favoritism is a good idea oh gee that must mean im a gs alt dont derail thread you barely disguised flamebait
ah bending the rules one more time in favor of exbobkenny shame on you gm in charge you should be fired imho
im no alt and have zero affiliation to goons pl or any other involved corpsyou are kidding yourself if you think only those fighting bob are fed up with ccp being constantly being in their pocket
but yes i have an alt and i think this situation is typical of ccp and raises questions about the integrity of the whole game
i support this
even if it is not really bobrs failure i support this such buddy deals have to stop finally
oh wait band of developers that should be goonswarm because they do have the most members that are gmdevsits quite hypocritical to call someone to be favoured by the devs when those people whining about it have the biggest number of people working for ccpand why exactly is this petition about disband bobr it was only a namechange if at all youre requesting something it should be rename bobr back to kenzoku because everything else just shows what the real purpose of this isto finally and utterly destroy bob and every member in it it didnt work with all naping each other it didnt work with using a clearly quite broken game mechanic using a defect member but yes it was intentional that you can disband a whole alliance yet you have to wait 24h to unlock a bpo wait 24h to kick an unwanted member out of a corp and still bob is there and fightswhat comes nextps thanks for killing aurora because they so clearly favoured bob and did all those favours for them its really nice that theres not a single bloody event left it brings the backstory soooo close to us makes us feel we can influence itpps having a spy in an alliance is ok but hacking into forums and ts servers or sniffing packets from the internet isnt truly inside the game rules
funny how people pick up on the slightest peice of misinformation and run with it like it is proofi assume you are talking about sharesi also assume you have never been in a position where you could actually try kicking a corp out of an alliancei honeslty dont know how goonswarm got away with identity theft which other corps have been punished for previously but i dont really care eitherthe fact is that they were shown favouritism that other corps have not been shown and i think that is a gross injustice the current situation is nothing more than an uncomfortable compromiseim serious
hi avon remember saying thishow times change
this is a tough decision for me because while i think what happened to bob in the first place was fairly trashy and unfortunate certainly not the way i would want to bring down a foe and i think meta gaming is lame true but this is all part of what makes eve great and it does seem like their may be some favoritism here if ccp could provide some proof that they have taken similar actions before which i do not believe they have then perhaps i would be more amicable to the whole name change situation furthermore now that a precedent has been set they better be ready and willing to change any alliance name in addition if bobr did get to keep their sov despite the change that is fairly unconventional too i think because usually an alliance to change their name would have to reform and lose sov so bob most likely should have had to undergo the same process at least instead of just having a quick painless transferso at the moment with the given information i support this cause bobr should have to disband then they should reform with their new name and sacrifice standing etc it just seems more fair that way i do have sympathy for bob because of the whole way they went down very dishonorable way to win goons imo but still it shouldnt get them sympathy from devs who should be unbiased and not show any form of favoritism lets see how it shakes out
goonswarm may have the most devsgms but theyre not the ones getting rules bent to help them win at internet spaceships like bob they dont have a history of devsgms flat out cheating to help their alliance
first id just like to say that sure the disbanding by one button is kinda fscktup butif molle hadnt removed the shares so alliance changes could go through without a vote then thats his mistakeand how come a absent director still had executor roles intactits like removing your firewall because your bandwidth suffers lag whos fault is it your secrits gets stolen you or the hacker capitalising on the security lapsenot anybodys fault but your own you did a stupid thing like thisand your letter of the law pointits not that the name changed most couldnt care lessits that you guys got the rules bent in your favour by ccp yet againcountless alliances have had to disbandlose sovpay 1bill and reform to get what you got by pressing 1 button ironic i know p so i guess
66 pages of spam by the 12 people who care and their 6 altsthis is quite a threadnaughtsee if you can get it 80 pages of wasted disk space by tonight
thanx for helping out
you are on page 67 thanks for helping the causeand there are allot more then the swarm raising their legitimate voice
lol double post thatUFFFDs been awhile
you know what  it following 3 accounts each char on a seperate account cancelled until this  is reversedthoradhtcupnavaj0might be back if this gets reversed
violation of the rules needs to be changed back until all other alliances can do this
i am a new player just plugged in my 60 day code a few days ago i mainly became interested in looking at eve due to all the news that was generated because of the goons taking down bob i guess that is a testament to the saying there is no such thing as bad press i think however questionable the goons taking out of bob was it does not merit any special treatment by the developers if they used ingame metrics to complete what amounts to a hostile takeover then so be it if that ingame metric needs to be changed then the systems put in place to make ingame rule changes should be utilized if there is an in game metric for changing your alliance name then it should be used anything else would be some form of favoritism regardless good luck to all involved
can i change my name please
hey look
ccp doesnt realize that with such a small game like this word of mouth is the best advertisement they cant get really now they have over 1300 players calling shenanigans most of these players are willing to stop playing if ccp doesnt listen to overwehlming opinion of the playerswith this massive amount of disappointment ccp will lose allot of businessi for one will not pay my subscription until this is fixed and i urge all of you to do the same

hey d ickheadof 2000 posts in the thread 1400 are unique votes in agreement with the proposal we only get to vote onceit amazes me that you big alliances think you are the only ones in this game i have no knowledge of or connection to any major player but i pay for the game and i expect there to be no cheating from the developers or ccpas has been said if ccp have repeatedly done such high profile cheats for bob how many other times have they given them things and not been found out
yes and ban all goon s aswell

who cares what you think jadeone game one rule if ccp hasnt dealt with this issue by next week i am thinking some other online games are looking better i can vote with my 6 accountshere is the root of the problem ccp in case you were not aware what everyone is so upset about we spend our money our time and our effort to sink into this vast game that you create we are not all massochists alright time and time again we get into conflicts with this bob entity this entity gets favors and has been caught for a lot of things who knows what it has not been caught for it is my suspicion that max damage actually stood for max gtcs cause if you think about it damage  gtcs perhaps the brass at ccp keep someone up high on the food chain so that they can increase the sales of gtcs maybe this is all about money manipulating the game to make more cash whatever the reason this whole thing is complete bull having one alliance that just seems to keep getting the favors yeah i have 6 characters to vote with your move ccp
this is becoming ridiculous
i want to change my alliance nameno exception for rules
no one should be above the rules
yesbending rules has to end at some point and this seem as good time as any to stop the insanityat the very least make return the name into its orginal state and give them the same option everyone else has had create a new alliance if you want a new name
im a pirate
down with band of developers and bob onlineps  jade no one cares really im serious
i will use one of your memeUFFFDs herei believe it isif you point me in the right direction of said rule stating that it is not then ill concede this point ofchowever taking your words for anything but spin is harder and harder for every line of text you writeccp nor you and the animals more equal then others can not ignore all these people cryingsomething is rotten in the state of denmark icelandooh orwell and shakespeare i knew that library card would pay of p
every alliance is born every alliance can diethats the game
i dont know who were kiddingeven if the csm has the brass to broach this subject ccp wont act on it despite having more support by almost an order of magnitude than any other issue ive seennot even if every player not in kenzoku supports itsigh what can you possibly do when the entity holding all the keys is against you
supporting this
its just a frickin name 
what you dont understand is sov mechanics if they wanted a new name they should have left or disbanded kenzoku and formed a new alliance just like every single other group in this game would have had toi guess i misunderstood what had happened originally i guess all the former bob corps joined another already formed alliance instead of creating a new one so they had no say over their name when they joined kenzokuthey had a choice join kenzoku or make a new alliance with a new name they chose kenzoku this never should have even been considered by ccp
yes change the name backno special rules for spezial friends
they could have made a new alliance called bob reloaded if they cared so much about their identity they did not they chose an already existing alt alliance to join called kenzoku to give them sov advantage in delve they made their decision they should have to live with it and not break the rules everyone else has to follow
found at least the right symbol for agreeing with the proposal
lets see if the csm has any real power not holding my breath tho
i dont like beavers
so false considering 90 of the supports in this thread are by alts which in turn are probably goonnc altsif you could only support this with 1 char per account then we would see the real number
says the bob pet
i dont agree with you ergo youre a bob altpet
grimmi already explained the action taken yesterday so theres no point in continuing the bitter rage regardless of what either csm says there really is no voice for the player base that will ever be heard and actions addressed in the right timeband of brothers and kenzoku are nothing more than a name much like any other corp or alliance love them or hate them it makes no difference log into eve and kill them if you hate bob that much the only voice that will ever be heard is the guns blazing and missile spamming of internet spaceships tbh
like an apologist asking why resist a military junta
bob made their choice when they decided to become kenny they should be made to live with their choice like everyone else has to soverignty or name not bothccp should be made to acknowledge their mistake other peoplecorpsalliances have been denied a name change and to bend the rules for kenny and change it is rediclous especially given that by now kenny was estabished as an alliance name and identitygms still need to learn some pr skills in the threads about this ive seen them not reply despite people asking them to while still managing to delete peoples posts and when they have replied they seem to make excuses to fob people offnot happy with ccp
why they did this they mustve know that it would create a storm its very disrespectful to me as a paying customer
i see alot of goonswarmsomething awful alts i hardly expect to see this thread taken seriously
you cant refute any point made so you whine about alts instead
bob and friends might dont take it serious but i think breaking general rules for a small group of players is an issue for the whole playerbase it in this case has nothing to do with bob itself it could have been every other alliance which has developers friends and got other dev favors in the past if there would be any
i support this no alliance should be able to use gms to circumvent sov mechanics i dont care about the name this about actualingame cheatingthey should be disbanded and allowed to to recreate the alliance with that same name well close to it apparently its too long for a player to actually create theyll be band of brothers reloade which is close enough id think im sure theyd be happy with thati actually have some sympathy for them but as far as i know the disbanding and subsequent registration of the bob name was completely legitimate and caused by a metagame betrayal which ccp has expressly allowed if not actively encouraged it is in fact one of eves strongest selling points so while i know it must suck to be bob this recent change must not be allowed to stand sympathy is not justification for cheating
the number of other goons that got trolled by the character limit on corporation and alliance names amuse me its not 2425whatever guys everything else still stands though one rule for all
the whole point is bias since the only people replying are the ones who would benefit from the proposal if one that demanded the disbanding of razor or goonswarm on some technical ground that was minor which this is effectivly poped up and got 2000 votes from mostly corpless alts would you expect it to be taken seriouslyanother thing this is is a pr attempt to drag bob throught the dirt again to gain credability something which the goonswarm has been lossing at a dramitic rate if any of my fellow empire freinds have to saywhat ever you say its obbious what is going on here anyone with half a brain can see so dont try and lecture to be about right and wrong your wasting the energy in your fingers
answer ccp were waitingmaybe a false advertising complaint wouldnt hurt you cant say its a player run world with this many complaints
1 rule 1 game no nepotistic bull
keep drinkin the koolaid man erase the names bobr and goons from this issue and the point is obvious the problem is being clouded by the entities involvedthis is wrong period
i support this
no the issue is minor and pointless its over a string of characters its fueled by childish vendetas and in game aspirations to gain a upper hand
sorry mate but i do belive that all this csm assembly wall n stuff was created only to keep us entertained with somethingand some hope but only thati belive ccp will do the same thing as others hideyou will not readhear a word from thembut as a wise man once said hope is the last to die seifer
some good ratting systems are cynojammed now due to this 
i do believe youre wrong shows a basic misunderstanding of the csm system which by its design takes some time to have an effect even if the skill que was the only thing they had ever done it would validate their existence but they also provided some serious balancing ui tweaks and the orcathats not the point here anyhow this thread is just another pr attempt by the goons bob did the same thing to them when they had any real power the two just go back and forth annoying everyone else in the universesince the goons will bump this for another year or so no harm in condemning the waste of a slot on the assemblys main pageyou frothing lapdogs
what do you think would be better  that ccp openly declares its support for bob or that it just stays silent and denies everythingwhat are you gonna do if they get balls enough to declare a favorite alliance fight them or ragequitid think itd be pretty amusing if they came out in the open
i strongly fullheartedly support this ive never worked with goonies nor with bob but the very stickiness between bob and ccp goes beyond ones capacity of describing it in proper words its like im unknowingly getting a lemon from a car dealer w exactly the same amount of cash his cousin pays for to get a mercede from backdoor if i am mad enough to go for being headlined id smash his store w the lemon he sold and shot him in his face w the so much public announcement of your love to your bob you are sharply indicating me that the portion of my life ive waisted is just digitalized as few binary glitches of the your database file and you are saying you can play it however you want it fine i get itlike ghost training issue and t2 bpo scandal however this one will go down a long way for the years to come you will never be free from people armed with these issues ganking you when and where most unexpected and i promise you that i will be one of themfly safe
need a tinfoil this thread makes me laugh everytime i read it stop the whining fight them all you want and stop annoying people with the same crap for the rest of the yearbig boohoo that they changed theyre name are you scared to fight them now or somethingand what do i think would be better for more raging goon muppets so i lol some more
you exploited game mechs no flame suit on
you exploited game mechs no flame suit on
how hard is it for your people to see the point its about the fact that theyve been given special treatment that allowed them to keep sov when other alliances would have been told to disband if they wanted a new name bob jumped into kenzoku to gainkeep a little sov easily and quickly then later asked to get the name changed to something they wanted instead of going about it the normal legit way and making a new alliance with the name they wanted from the start then gaining sov
nice ad for eve ccp before when people ask me about eve i use to answer it was a good game thank to the gameplay etc now f up the gameplay i will say to dont try it cause devs arent fair with all player gg ccp your game sucks by now
the op is mistaken that this has never been done before there are numerous examples that everyone seems to be ignoring in general and caod threads so based on that i disagree keep the tears flowing though since caod is much cleaner now that the goons and goon allies are around a circle discussing the issue
lol
nice sig ill take it
no more tears  i am very unhappy it has been hilarious watching the threadnaughts stay tuned i am sure something else will happen to cause fud 
no ccp cookies to friedns
enjoy it as much as we did this way you can reflect on your tears with a smile on your face 
considering 975454  of this thread consisted of gooons i demand a revote wo goons  or trial accounts of goons
amusing really since they really dont care about the game step on their ability to grief and they waffle like little girls 
name change was rescinded seems like a fair enough solution to me
we do not have to quit let us all suspend our subscription for 1 month i am certain we can find other games to play for just 1 month loss of a months revenue might not bankrupt ccp or even dent their wallet but its effect will be felt for alliances holding sovereignty they can cycle the numbers 33 of the alliance will suspend subscription for a month and for those with numerous accounts suspend subscription on one account this has to get ccps attentionwhat really gets to me is that no explanation has been offered
oh the irony of that sig its delicious
boosh
what was the social impact of bob being changed to kenzokukenny always dies at the end 
yeah but he comes back every episode like jason vorhees
i corrected your typo nbd no thanks needed

thread is now redundantlocked
is this real or a troll guessing by the amount of exclamation marks id say the latter  but we are on the eve forumi thought the whole point of that mission is that you have to visit all empires to complete itdoes anyone know if the agents will talk to you even if your standings are too lowthat would be nice imo  you could do the mission if youre fast enough to escape the local navy 
this might be me but since when do gate guns attack you if you have low standing with a empireafaik but thats been over a year ago all you got was some navy ships trying to destroy you which where at best a threat to lvl 1 frigatesguessing its gotten upgraded with faction warfare but by that much
if you dont know where you are going and what your standing means you deserve to get blown up take the lesson and dont repeat the mistakeeven the note that tells you about the epic mission mentions that you need to be able to access all of empire space if you found a note that said everyone who warps to the following coordinates needs to be able to tank 5000dps em damage would you hop into your merlin and jump right over there only to complain that you had no chance
yes the agents will talk to you but you always have them saying something like get out of my face before they give you the mission its almost comical but it worksalso if you cant travel to all the empires learn the diplomacy skill if you have it and still cant travel to all the empires it sucks to be you weve been trying to implement a way to gain standing for a faction without doing missions but were still at a loggerheadhopefully well see it soon until then dont do the epic arc

frankly im with drake it was bad enough when it was just coad  i dont read that forum so i didnt really care but when the forum mods cant even keep the asembly hall from degenerating into the equivalent of a kindergarten playground i have to seriously begin to question their ability towell moderatehand me the banstick for a day or two ill clean things up and then the useless lumps whose job this is supposed to be wont have to stretch their artificial intelligence
a goonzoku forum would be good
you can say that again my thread was locked and they left a damn sign pointing to a topic that actually made it worsemy whole premise was to stop that crapand honestly im not even going to bother complaining to them
call it eve shrinklooks like the goons have quite some psychological issuesmaybe itll help
whining post please lockps they are fixing the pos shields maybe if you bothered to read the newsisaac
i suggest you stop playing eve for an hour for each child in the world that is having a hard time the world will be a better place if 30 mins of you not playing eve helps children why not quit eve and help all children
which children you gotta be mor precise then that personally i dont really support those kind of things i believe certain people have it in a certain way because of how their believecommunityreligionsociatyraceetc have made them evolve and they have had the same chances as every body else if they are a dying species well then you should let them die and let a new and stronger element come in their place this is nature and evolution dont degenerate the human species because of a soft spot in your heart
let them eat cake
congrats kids you all assume and fail again i run a amd athlon 64 x2 5000 with 4 gb ram a msi ati radeon 4500 series 1 gb ddr3 ram card with windows vista home and creative sb xfi gamer sound card with a 600w modulated psu yes i do agree with some that maybe i have over looked something but to think i wouldnt use my brain drake hmmm no reason why your first thread was erasedi prefer the old graphics over the new graphics i hate the shine the glow the polish they added last time i checked space stations had no polish to them and i very much doubt they ever would in my opinion shot the guy that thought of adding polish no real life spaceship was polished they are all dull burned out from all the space debris and burns from the atmosphere bring a more rugged look a more real life feeling to a game that is bordering it anyways granted some scifi moves show polish but this isnt those movies
im soooo sorry for your sufferingthat is one lousy fit for a towereven that would give me headaches

hooray heartstoneweve had great progress in many areas of the game but i think nonsovereign infrastructure and player impact on the storyline of eve are two that need some lovegood luck sir
whats your view of the blatant favoritism within ccp regarding the alliance formally known as band of brothersand the blatant disregard to their own eula regarding the name change from kenzuko to band of brother reloaded and all that it entails
from a personal perspective i believe that the examples in the past of favoritism shown towards the alliance formally known as band of brothers has been much hyped up the t20 scandal for instance was a case of favoritism shown towards a particular playercorp within the band of brothers alliance and not the alliance as a whole i also think that when this happens it is up to ccp to investigate and deal with like any other business rather than the eve community in general as an example if you somehow got a meeting with a representative of a major oil company and demanded to know the results of a disciplinary against one of their plant workers you would be quickly told where to go in this particular case i cannot see how it happened whilst maintaining the precedent ccp have stuck to before having said that i also dont know what happened internally at ccp additionally i personally cannot see any significant way it effects the game apart from being an irritation to those who wanted to change their alliance corp or player names in the past and have been refused the chance and for those who would use such an event as propaganda for their own cause i would prefer to stick to issues that actually effect peoples ability to play the game andor find the most enjoyment from the game although if enough people wanted to know if this had been investigated by ccp i would certain be more than happy to ask that question of them as stated in the previous example though i wouldnt consider it appropriate for me to demand of ccp to release any details beyond the fact that an investigation had or had not happened if they wished to release more details that is entirely their prerogative i hope that helps you make up your mind one way or another
alright let me ask one of the more volitile questions i take it due to your associations with star fraction and your wanting to be in the csm that youve monitored the past two candidacies what mistakes have they made that you wouldve done differently if you had the chancesecond your corpmates reputation in the csm is well known and many dont look favorably upon the exchange that occured in csm 1 what would you say to make us believe that this isnt a repeat of the past and that you will behave differentlylast there are currently two hotbutton issues on the csms plate and youll most likely take up the mantle of representing these when you become part of the csm how would you resolvehandle the following issuesa 00 mechanics sovereignty incentive etcb mining adding interest balancing ores etcthank you for your time and i just want to see how youd handle the pressures inherent with being a csm delegate should the public decide you worthy of said position
i am not altogether sure this as straight forward a question as you think as most of what the csm does from my understanding happens behind closed doors and in part is covered by the nda i wasnt privy to that sort of information with the 1st csm as some might think as jade kept star fraction and the csm role separate and took his nda seriously the 2nd csm has also been as opaque in many ways as the first one if we are to take what we see of the csm at face value though i personally think that in some cases on some issues there has been a little bit too much self interest governing the votes and not enough critical analysis of the subject concerned the words critical and analysis you will see time and time again from me as its what i do and more to the point what i do well i hope that i could bring both of these to the csm from my training as an academic in the humanities simple answer to this one jade and myself are separate people with separate and distinct personalities many people attribute a certain pattern behavior too many groups in eve and beyond but this falls apart on close analysis if you were to ask me what personal qualities i have that i think would be useful as a csm however i would say that i am easy going and able to think critically about issues both abstract and mundane both of these i feel are important in a csm rep it is also worth noting that whilst this my main character i chose to announce my candidacy on for the csm is a member and director of star fraction my intention is not to represent any one particular group but to weigh popular opinion on a subject with close analysis to help my fellow csm members reach a conclusion to present or not to ccpas with most subjects i have a personal opinion on them ie sov needs a change to increase the dynamics of 00 warfare beyond that of the current mechanics and adding the ability for any sized groups of people to create an infrastructure to support their miningindustry endeavors which isnt limited to location andor sovereignty but as previously stated the aim for me is to interact with the playerbase and analyse the solutions that have popular support that isnt to say i shall except what the most people say but rather pass on ideas that bear up to critical analysis that warrant ccps attention that the playerbase agree would help to increase their personal and group enjoyment of the gameand thank you for your questions i am no politician and have no carefully designed platform to wave my banner over as such what i am trying to sell so to speak is myself and the more questions i get the better so as to allow me to represent who i am to the voters and allow them to make up their own mind about me and whether i would represent them best or whether someone else would instead
good luck dierdraben

was one of the best teachers back at eve uni used to teach alot of ecm classes what do you think of the proposed ecm changes dv
when i met the ccp devs in iceland last year it was interesting to see how worried they were about showing favouritism something ive recently seen enforced by ccp in an unrelated case if they actually made an exception for bob that would be extremely worrying however im witholding judgement until their internal affairs department finishes their investigation which im sure is going on atm it could be a gm error and that would result in the name being changed back it could be a change in policy unfortunately ccp has shown repeatedly that synchronising its public documentation and internal policiesmechanics isnt one of their strong pointsregardless until ccp makes a statement nobody really knows what is going on im confident someone on the current csm will bring this up my guess would be darius johnsonedit i just read ccps reply here ccp stated that they have done this before and if this is true i have no reason to think otherwise then there has been a precendent and ccp did not show favouritism that said this seems to be another example of ccp failing to communicate properly youd think theyd learn eventually i hope one of the current csms will force ccp to come with a better explanation of the processdecision thoughfirst lets keep in mind these are firstdraft proposed changes nothing final yet and any of those changes wont make it into the game in a hurryi think theyre ridiculous same for the sb changes admittedly the 230km optimal range on my falcon rigged for range naturally is maybe a bit too far although imo thats what rokhs and other falcons are here to deal with but removing the optimal bonus completely to turn an expensive but paperthin ship into a close range fighter is ridiculous a better solution would be to reduce the falcons range bonus to 1015 so its optimal would be in range of most sniper setups while it still has some combat viability the rook with its existing damage and tank bonuses might be better suited for ccps visions for short range brawler the scorpion is fine and im not sure why they want to change it and the kitsune could use some love but oddly enough ccp seems to forget about that onesignal distortion amps are fine as they are i think  they do force ecm pilots to truly commit almost all of their ships slots to their ewar gimping their damage and tank but i feel that weakness justifies the strength of ecm modulesi may be a bit biased because i do fly ecm but i think people forget too easily that for every time you curse because a falcon pilot jams you theres another time when a jam fails and the falcon pilot can say bye bye to his ship ecm is an all or nothing effect and people focus too much on the all and forget about the nothing
i would like to thank you for your document on bounty hunting and you were one of the brightest stars in csm1 unless i see another candidate which i think better captures my desires for this game you have my vote good luck and kudos
does someone have a link to these proposed changes i havent seen them yet

extreme for csm  eve player since the beginning motivated good manand thats all that needs to be said fyi
my name is poopsock alarmclock and i approve of this message
reminds me of the beavers mom no not that beaver and not that one eitheroh stewardess i speak jive  cut me som slack jack chump don wan no help chumpdon git no help jive ass dude don got no brainsanyhow
not a bad name actually as it gives you a psychological monopoly on reason and allows you to effortlessly paint your opponents as unreasonable by default
considering how the csm has zero political power creating a political party makes equally zero senseits an advisory council its not that you can influence the game design in such a way that would give those you claim for yourself to represent any advantage or greater considerationthis thread here proves once again how much egomania the csm is made up of and how little actual reason is behind it
what eve needs is an antimetagaming party
i dont think thats a fair statement these folks get to meet ccp face to face and voice their opinions some of it is bound to sink in even if the devs are actively trying to ignore themtheres no way to sit down and have a beer with someone and have absolutely zero impact
except that a party makes for a stronger route to communicate important issues the reps and being able to ascertain actual interest in the issue and ultimately be able to quantify that interest in terms of numbers of individuals who are aligned with that party imo might actually foster better ideas coming out of here you let whatever party ya knowwhichever interest privately debatediscussrefine their ideasissues before they bring it to the attention of the whole of the community aside a party might have the creativity and incentive to actually foster involvement which i think everybody can agree is a good thingi get that an idea like this might not work but it certainly wouldnt cause any damage if it didnt
i should qualify thatas long as there is some selfcontrol exercised on the part of a leadership structure in this theoretical party no harm comes of this if it becomes some sort of lame vehicle for court packing it would be the suck

apologies for the delay in replying i was on a business tripi couldnt resist making the subject sound so outragous it sometimes is the only way to illicit a replymy point is communication csms yes you may well be working hard spending long meetings late into the small hours with ccp and feeling under appreciated by the inhabitants of eve but many threads seemed to be opened over and over again and the same questions answered because pilots did not know that you guys had already been on the case another thing if there are petitions threads and you know it is being looked into post a link to the thread if it is an issue that is not currently being looked at dont be afraid to post a reply even if you just sit on the fence look at the missile petition for instance  i cant see any csm response from thathoweveri see a new issues thread that has been stickied in assembly hall this is certainly a start in improving lines of communication i have just posted a link to the bombs issue to the stealth bomber petition in assembly hall finally the search engine that eveonline uses is absolutley rubbish it does not allow pilots to research issues that have been previously raised and probably doesnt help csms in their causegrz
give us proper player owned structures something that resembles and functions like a basic station in space and not disparate lagfest of the bits and pieces we currently have thank you
hell yeah i wanna see this
much 3 for chribba
i dont support this one rule for everyone
agreed also i couldnt care less about titan in amarr
went through amarr yesterday and you werent therei was disappointedwell the amarr navy was trying to shoot me so i couldnt linger but ill support you getting back where you belong
supported
for the love of god put this into the game ccpnaow
i seem to recall a ccp dev mentioning that the pos code is huge clearly a redesign would be a very large undertakingthat said they did write all that code in the first place so while a huge task it is a task they can manage else we would not even have pospos are clearly an integral part of eve now they are not some fringe thing a few players dabble in but rather a fundamental basis in the game for thousands of players and numerous corpsalliancesand that despite pos and by extension sov mechanics being horrendous i am sure ccp has a lot on their plate even so this is well worth an effort whatever changes may come this is absolutely money well spenteta as for csm it is their responsibility to bring this to the devs if the community demands it in sufficient strength i think the devs will understand that the csm is merely carrying out their mandate and not hold it against individual csm members that they are bringing something the devs already said no to the devs can of course say no again and be done with it but at least it sends the message to them that the playerbase keeps this particular issue high on their want list as any business it behooves them to pay attention to what their customers want whether they can deliver on it or not
signed
definitly not worth going for minmatar caps as it is
not supported its great entertainment as is and still a decent source of info is you care to do some shifting through the threads
ban goons
dont screw with the towers cpujust fix the launchers so they can work while a pos is reinforcedgive a bonus to cal towers that allows missile arrays to still work while the pos is reinforcedeither way supported
i guess that sounds pretty resonable
would fix the issue without screwing over genuine disconnects may want to change that to still disappearing after 15 minutes though theres nothing really wrong with the current 15min timer its avoiding that timer which is the issue
every turret is visible even if you cannot see the difference between t1 and t2 but even now with two types of launchers for every caldari combat ship we still cannot look at them to see what they are fittingis that a torpcruise ravenis that a hamheavy drakeis that a rocketstandard crowwho knowsi know thats a 1400mm fit tempesti also know that megathron has neutronsoh look at that beam zealotanybody else wish ccp would put a few guys onto designing some launcher models
why not supported
yeah ive always wanted to see missile launchers visually on shipsim all for it
you raise a good point with the bit about looking to see what the enemy is fitting also i want to see just how ridiculous cruise launchers would look on stealth bombers supported
the devs say the ships who have missile launcher hardpoints have the launcher thing on their modelsbut i want to see mah launchers turn around and spin and launch stuff
this is something thats bugged me too
supportedmissiles come out of the center of our ships or on a random spot it would be nice to see a launcher rise up on a ships hard points fire a rocket into an empty area of space then track down the target
supported i do know that the devs are aware of this however there are several technical things that need to be worked out before it can be implemented hopefully well see it done thoughisaac
surprisingly good suggestion gasp
yes good idea people will finally start laughing at me when i fit assault missile launchers on the drakein all seriousness it would only make sense if it was implemented
yes it is time to move the damn missile away from the broken spawning in the center i want visible missile launchers which launch missiles just like turrets have nowcaldari need love
id like to see this idea taken the whole way and have every module even the mid and lowslots and rig on a ship visually represented in some way
sorry lavista i knew you supported iti just saw it as we are all human and can sometimes forget so i was bumping it
supported right click repair would make the process much smoother
this needs more attention
im not an awox alt and i support this topic
forgot somethingi on the other hand am neither a topic or an awox alt but i do support this topic
im not an awox alt and i support this topicaditionally carriers should be capable of carrying
i am not a support and i topic this alt althurr durr
i am declining to support this topic on the general principle that it sounds like a one person 20 alts whine festnow if you can convince drake to support it ill reconsider my position but thats only because once mentioned that he was kind of sorta maybe starting to like my posts and i want to encourage that sort of thing
de  i already owe you a few drinks postambulation for some fantastic posts sides drake and i troll so much weve decided to form an alliance
yesan alliance of trolls cough not really a troll just bitter geeks who know too much for there own good but would rather scream instead of be polite for the assembly hallto arms
yea not an alt blah blah blah supported
when ccp nerfed carriers they did say they were going to make improvements at a later date
this is true for the whole skill queuenow we have the thing so id like to have it better also just having exactly the problem prerequ skill finishes in the night but i cannot inject the followup skill and append it to the queue so im carrying it around in the cargo bay its a cheap skill not worth to hunt me nowsupported
no support it does add to the lazy man effect this really shouldnt be too big an issue if your logging on semioften otherwise youll need to figure out a new skill to train isaac
a simple timer would be nice
simple change i support this
supported
supported this may also help with lag as people would not spam the dockjump button as much
simple useful addition for everyone
support
i support this its a good idea and i think it would make things easieredit for not clicking support
good stuff support
that would make things so much easier when knowing if you can gtfo or just die lol
previously one just had to anchor a can at the warpin point of a moon and it prevented someone from putting a pos there until the can was destroyed this mechanic was changed so that poss ignored anchored cans now it is common practice in highsec to anchor a tower at a moon and just keep it offline to reserve or sell the moon whereas previously with a can you could just destroy it with enough firepower without declaring war with pos towers offline you have to declare war on the owner before you can attack it to clear the moon to use i feel this mechanic is worse then with cans destroying a large faction tower in highsec from a corp in a huge empire alliance setup to make wars expensive is unfair for anyone who wants to use that mooni would like to see some kind of mechanic be introduced to prevent this kind of moon reserving to make it fair for others to come and use the moon if its not in use either make a tower unanchor after a period of time from being offline few weeks or allow people to shoot offline towers without being in war in highsec or some other method
sounds like more support for the idea of being able to hacksalvageunanchor offline towers  all good ideas
use a different moon if you dont want to blow up an offline tower
imho if your going to play stupid little jerk games like that anchoring offlined towers to lock moons you should be under penaltythe towers should be online and fueled to do thatif its offline you have 2436 hours or the tower self destructs along with all the other equipment if not become stealablesimpleefficient and forces people to be more active and not a bunch of lazy morons
if you look at 07 06 and 05 systems anywhere near jita youll find maaany with just offline towers most of which is just a tower no other modules finding a free moon anywhere near jita is nearly impossible thats where the issue lies there is no incentive to unanchor a tower if your not going to be running your pos because its so hard to get a moon just leave the tower offline the chances are someone will declare war and be able to blow it up isnt that great im just proposing some sorta incentive to not leave it offline like it will get blown up easieranother option would be to just make offline poss subject to the system trash cleanup so after a month they vanish that would also solve it if you dont online your pos for a whole month you deserve it to vanish imho
how about hiring mercs and let them blow up the offline poswouldnt that be possible
well sure but it seems to me that this is just defeating some of the purpose that allowing towers to ignore anchored cans did the idea then was to prevent moons from being reserved or tied up anchored cans have immense hp but so does a tower you just dont need to declare war to shoot a can
fun fact if a tower is offline you can use closerange gank bs and the only thing you have to worry about is if the corp shows up to defend itfurthermore there shouldnt be a stront timer because the tower is offline so you can do it in one go
true but you have to declare war to do so fairly expensive if the corp is in one of those 500 corp empire alliances that exist only to make wars expensive if you didnt have to declare war in highsec then i agree that would be a good solution but having to declare war to clear a moon seems excessive but maybe thats just me
ive even seen reserved moons in low sec so i can imagine how bad it is in high sec fix it
thumbs up from meperhaps changing the mechanic so anyone canunanchour a tower after it has been offline for something like 7 daysthis may also have a benefit to 00 sov war by enabling some kind of ability to siege locking the enemy logistics would become a strategic tool againzos
well this isnt really an issue for 00 since a single dread would tear up any offline pos but in highsec youre limited to battleships at most and you have to declare war for small corps and such declaring war on a big alliance just to get a moon in highsec that someone has forgot about isnt using or is just reserving seems a bit excessive when viewed against the game mechanics that was changed to prevent cans from holding a moon this just seems to be the same issue although the can now is more expensive but it makes it less likely someone would shoot it due to having to declare war
too bad your premise is completely wrong anchorable containers are protected as assets of the individualcorp and shooting them is the same as shooting anything else in possession of the player and that is will drop concord on you like a ton of bricks if the 250 mil it costs for you to dec the corp that dropped 200 mil to get the tower out there isnt worth your time to take it out then that is too bad
war dec hire mercs ask the corp in question to take their tower down find a free moon in a quiet area go to lowsec there are plenty of methods available unfortunately as most of them involve interaction with other people they are not suitable for some of the more extreme mouth breathing carebear elements of highsec

go pod some boggeril they drop banjos oh wait
two trains of thought come to mind when i see this ideai like it the concept of smokey bars in a station where the pilots gather to drink and play games of chance or hammer out deals in illlit back corners makes sense that and there are drugs in the game already which are pretty nasty so they do have the precedent for this already established the thing is that its all textbased at the moment not actually being seen done and i think that will be the difference people react badly to the concept of smoking and drug use and in ambulation it would be visible useage so i could see thier point if they dont include it because it might be seen as them saying smoking  drug use is cool still  i am an adult and i dont let videogames tell me what to do so i vote yes its a nasty nitty gritty space world and the ciggy hanging from the mouth as u play a game of cards in the seedy space station bar works for me
supported if only for the hilarity of smokefilled bars in jitarensdodoursoh hey zed o
should also add a nice selection of luxury food and drinks
epeen sure but theyre also the single best source of longrun intelligence about an enemy in the game if you want to know combat info about a pilot look up his killboard stats plus people like things like that  having a record ofm what they killed knowing what valuable faction mods could have dropped but didnt and this is still a game also watching pirates whine is just pathetic  nobody wants to see that
supported for exactly this reason
hey guys we just sank a battleship and the divers say it had 16 guns not 12 like we thought the americans caught a couple more a while back posted the info on kriegsmarineclinic told us they were kitted out the same you think maybe the germans upgunned their navy while we werent lookingnah lets just ignore it and assume things with no basis in fact instead gathering intel is like cheating righttheres a reason ive never uploaded a kill to a killboard and its because i dont want to advertise what i fly and what i fit if other people want to pass around their valuable information like beer at a frathouse kegger though im going to take advantage of it
id rather people just said yes or no to be honest people are using intel as a reason which is a bit funny tbh the poster above me used a real life example of how some divers could find more guns on an enemy ship surely it would be better to find out that info before the fight even happened which you are capable of in eve to think you could find out a ships fit from an explosion in space is also ridiculous lastly the above poster pointed out that you should not post your losses for all to see i have just looked on battleclinic and im showing 384 kills and 98 losses do you want to know how many of those i have actually posted the answer to that is 0 i have never posted one kill or loss on that site and yet my setups are there for not only my enemies to see but for anyone who cares to know they have not had to work hard at all to find this info out as i said earlier this info is for epeen and nothing else
no killmails are fine just ignore em if you hate themthere simple enoughisaac
hate double posts
i say just yes and no when the debate is selfexplanatory this one isnt and so i explain dude scifi game you dont watch the pretty explosion you send a probe out to pick through the wreckage and figure out what blew up thing is thats so automatic that they dont even ask you thats the sort of crap your bridge crew does they just sent you the mail through concord as a joke  given how often we kill our crews they need a laugh every now and then more seriously there are two parties in every kill both will reasonably speaking know what happened in the fight if one publicizes it and the other keeps it secret well its still public again ill pull out the ww2 analogiesbeen playing too much hearts of iron lately  there were a whole lot of real historical battles where one side publicized the results and the other didnt of course those featured a lot more lying and forcible repression of data than eve does but the point still stands  if the japanese dont want to talk about midway because they screwed up but the americans trumpet their monumental victory then the germans read the battle report and still get a pretty good idea of what happened theyll certainly know if the americans start talking about how one particular spot of armour is thin that they should probably aim for that spot if they ever start fighting japan the japanese dont like it much but they dont have a whole lot of control over it your opponents are posting their combat experiences for the world to see and for better or worse youre in it like i said above if they want to pass out valuable information for free they can do that you dont i dont but others do and theres no sensible way we can stop them from doing so either in the context of the universe or the context of the game um i just gave a concrete example of something else its used for and you agreed with my claim
leave my kill mails alone some of us like stats go f off
its a pvp game killmails are how combat pilots keep score scores are kept in every game if anything eve doesnt have enough combat statistics stats are fun i love the stats in games such as battlefield and i am not that great at that game
thw killmails are not only matter of epeen but also tells you who in your corp is not so good in pvp and how you can help him to get better and the information getting form enemy killmail is very valuble information in terms of setup location and playing time
worst idea since greedo shooting first
now now lets not say things we cant take back
tldr not just no but hell nolonger versionwhile i can certainly understand the frustration of some players myself included at the protections that npc corps provide to those who arent deserving of those protections salvage thieves macro miners etc the fact of the matter is theres no real reason to force players out of themsome players again myself included really just want to be left the hell alone i chose to leave an npc corp because frankly i got tired of being bothered by all the stupid people in the corporate chat channel i joined a small corporation so i could in fact be left more alone than i was before sure i can be wardecd now but im willing to risk that to have more control over whos on the party line they call corp chatother players genuinely enjoy the huge player base in the npc corp they like helping out newer players teaching them the ropes of the game helping them choose a path what have you and thats a lot easier to do in terms of communication if you happen to be in the same corpfinally some players are just plain lazy its not that they like being in an npc corp  they just dont want to go through the effort of finding a new onethe point is none of these people should be forced out of an npc corp just because you dont think they should be allowed to stay there
some of it is some of it isnt for example you cant help out new players in corp chat if youre in a oneman and more to the point youre forced into being wardecable  sort of the point of this whole endeavour  which is one thing a lot of players will find very distasteful ive known several people who have complained that they cant stay in a player corp for a month without getting decced and that will drive people away pretty severely also ive never set up a corp myself but doesnt it require some amount of skill andor isk i know its not the month and a billion alliancemaking takes but its more effort than a lot of people will want to put inyou also still havent addressed the problem of having a corp with thousands of incoherent undefended members that can be wardecced im sure the privateers will love you but seriously it is a gaping flaw in your proposal because at present youre not advocating vulnerability youre advocating mass suicide
i kind a like this ideai support
would you like a box of tissues with thatall i see is a pathetic whelp of a pilot who will not read who will not think and who will not do researchall he does is answer arguments made by very intelligent pilots with stupid lame assed excuses and in total denial of realitydo i troll that oh hell yes
drake i love you but you troll everything
what can i say im your evil twin brother
normally i would vote yes on such a thing but ever since the 94 skill nerf to new characters i now have to say no
for the 100th time in the 100th thread that is merely resaying the same thing for the 100th timeno
no thanks you shouldent have to force players to experience the game its a little bit rude and will not win any long term subscribersthe noob corps should be there to filter out those who dont want to play cooperativally they will either discover that coop play is more rewarding or they will abandon the game eventually to set a time limit on this is as mentioned rude
in short exactly the same thing thats been proposed 1000 times before and rejected by everyone force players out of npc corps into a decable own corp if they want to or notso we can shoot the crap out of the newbees but just dont want to say that out loudand again the answer everybody gives is the same as the previous 1000 times no thankseditthe only way i could see something like this happening is with some kind of conscious decision from the player in question for instance and this is just an example you can not train t2 skills while in a nondecale corporation or return to one if you have them join a decable npc or player corpyou want to fly andor use t2 you take the decision and face the music or guns something like that but it has to be left up to the player and be a decent level skill or skillgroup
not supportedif they cant stay in these corps most will just quit which would be bad for ccp and worse for you they are your ingame customers who else buys all the faction crapedit when it comes to highsec alts you may have a point
tldr  thread
what possible reason could mission farmers  macro miners  all the other people who would be the main target of war decs have for leaving the complete safety of npc corps
ah gee lets think about that hmmme scratches beardwell uh how about the ability to use posscorp hangerteamwork larger gangsfleetswow i guess that was so hard for you to figure out musta hurt like hellglad i could be of help
95 tax
yes because that will clearly force all the miners into player corps
each races ewar compliments their tactics except for caldari here i draw out new caldari ewar that more closely follows the pattern of the other racesrace tacticprimary longrange ewar generally used by only one racesecondary shortrange ewar often used by all racesamarr big slow laser shipsprimary tracking disruptor  decrease tracking on gallente and minmatar gunboatssecondary nosneuts  bomb capacitor for speed ships and active tanksminmatar fast ships and gunboatsprimary target painter  increase signature on targetssecondary webs  tackling from speed shipsgallente close range blasters drone boatsprimary rsd  restricts engagement rangesecondary warp disruption  forces engagementso the goal here is to model caldari ewar off of the other races pattern but tool them to benefit caldari engagement tacticscaldari long range rails and missilesproposed primary range dependent ecm  higher strength close up forces long range engagements where caldari ships have an advantage redesign the mechanic to look more like periodic focused bursts where the frequency of instantaneously breaking locks depends on the strength of the jam rather than the current chancebased timersproposed secondary inertia field  a new ewar module that decreases ship agility could be used to catch ships out of alignment and force tight orbits out to longer distances and subsequently a lower transversalboth effects give an advantage to rangeindependent missile systems and longerranged slowertracking railgunsedit bumping mechanic needs to be changed if inertia field is to be implemented too powerful side by side
supported if only for the hilarity of inertia fielding autopiloting freighters
only if bumping is nerfed completelyotherwise not supported
how so its a little vague and i dont see the connection to ewar
bumping is the current tactic for preventing a ship from aligningif your going to make a module that nerfs your agility which slows your ships ability to align then bumping is nothing more than pure greifing compounded by this moduleyou cant have it both wayspeople wont use the module by default because bumping does the same jobbut those who have the module will bump and jam the agility of a shipbalance mechanics would make it an utter nightmareso in short bumping goes or your ewar idea goesnot both
ok i see where youre coming from the inertia field is more of a tactic for slow long range ships  mostly as an antiinterceptor module that counters fast tight orbits by reducing agility possibly forcing closerange ships outside their optimal rangesusing the module to slow aligntimes is a secondary tactic  but i see how it can be a huge bumping buff if bumping were changed so ships didnt spin around in different directions that would fix the issue good catch though thanksedit also the inertia field isnt nearly as important as the change in ecm mechanicsedit2 yes i think bumping ought to be removed completely the inertia field is a more consistent mechanic for slowing align times
im stunned a goon who dosent act like a goonnicely stated chapill keep an eye out for yah
drake raises a good point but its ultimately minor the overall proposal here of making caldari ew fit into racial tactics instead of just being a win button is a good one i think that the issue of range can be solved by dropping optimal increasing falloff and maybe upping strength a little which would make it a weapon for shortrange engagement denialso that they have to fight at long range to get around the jams instead of long range pwnage thats dangerous  at least the strengthincreasing part  but something along those lines might be justifiable and that seems to be what the devs are thinking broadly right now in a similar vein rsd ranges need to go way up  you cant deny a longrange fight if your ew cant hit at long range yes this means that the ew range is exactly inverted from the range on the rest of the racial stuff but thats actually kind of appropriate on the whole as for the inertia field suggestion its interesting but i wonder whether itd actually see use or just feel like a waste of a module i suppose if it was like 90 or something crazy itd see use but its not a very powerful effect in most contexts and i dont think it really does what you want it to do in terms of caldari racial tactics pushing ranges out from 5 km to 10 and even then only if the enemy is trying to orbit is not the sort of thing that a rokh is desperately looking for when a blaster mega jumps him if you want to give caldari a secondary consider smartbombs its a bit weird and im not sure itd work but theyre shortrange weapons that make quick work of drones which makes them a nearperfect weapon against the racial enemy or perhaps in a similar vein make ecm burst a whole lot better especially against drones again not sure if itd work but as theorymongering goes it seems like a decent enough starting point
id have to disagree with this as being fundamentally wrong tactics wise most ships that can lock you in time to use the inertia field on you can easily drop a point on you negating the necessity of bumping your ship around while i do agree that bumping is a craptacular tactic i dont think in correlation someone is going to use an inertial field instead of a point to keep you pinned down via bumping instead of just actually pointing you most close range ships wouldnt need the module and most long range ships wont want to be close enough to bump you anyways i truly think this idea has merit
interesting and well thought idea however i agree with drake remove bumping before we let this in isaac
yes unless theyre a supercapital sitting on a station sitting on a gate or sitting on a pos shield escape is not always accomplished via warp
most supercapitals use cyno jumping as their means of escape for which bumping would have no effect
even if it is little bit older thread i think it would be very useful as some people blocklist contains hundreds of blocked people due ot the recruitment channel jita scams etc it would be very nice feature to be able to export and import the blocklist
where do i sign for my wtfpwnships
i do see what you are suggesting however all ships are not intended to pointthere are obviously some ships designed to tackle those get the primary secondry tertiary points then whatever others in fleet should simply spread them aound the larger the fleet engagment the longer it will last and the more targets your tacklers will rotate through to keep the victim ships held downanother issue here is that essentially you are giving every ship an extra mid the balance of ships ability to tank etc could be seriously upsetthumbs down from me sorryzos
lol that was only a suggestion  i dare say the penalties should be significantly stiffer my point was the op didnt mention penalties at all that i noticed
maybe shield tankers should get the residual boost this would give as it stands now fcs rofl at the thought of someone bringing a shield tanker to battles i myself have heard on numerous occasions shield tanker lol let him die as it stands pvp is almost solely the realm of armor tankersone of the main reasons behind this suggestion is to help bring back 1v1 small gang engagements and add some flavor to them one on ones are hard to find and when you do its usually the same ships this would add more variety to your engagements  bigger box o chocolates if you willyes i did 300 calibration severly limits your further rigging options plus i have provided possible options for further penalties a couple posts ago
my amarr af alt would love any of these ideas 1 extra midslot would be happiness
supported but only if the rig 1 gimps your cpupg 2 gimps your resists and 3 is cheap and easy to produce oh and one for the low slot would be interesting too of course the 8slot limit should still applybut as someone had said the shield tanking for fleets would finally be as viable as armor with this implemented
ok before i say this i want to say i do not have this skill trained ofc this was a critical skill for probers before the update if it was all about time but now whats the point of this skilltrained to lv 5 which would take around 1820 days would reduce your scan time of each scan bywait for it5 secondsthis skill got no love from ccp with the new update lol oh and the worse thing of it is that this skill does not even open up any other skills or mods at any level again ccp where is the lovewhat i suggest for this skill is to increase the warp speed of probes by a large amount if ccp insist on keeping this skills benefit time based then why not 5 seconds off each scan is no incentive imo then again maybe this is another one of those skill that is intended to go to the skill grave yardso i say increase the warp speed of probes by 20 per level as well and the 20 to scan speed i think this would encourage the training of itmaybe
i didnt do probing before the changes but my understanding is that it was nothing special then either and as it is given normal probe warp times training it to 5 reduces your scan time by about 25 remember its not 5 seconds its closer to a minute for an average scanningout since you have to do a dozen scansroughly to find what youre looking for probably not worth training to 5 but its hardly unique in that regard  weve already got 28 weapon specialization skills that fit that bill whats one more train it to 4 and be happy
its useful i see no problems with this skill if your truly serious about scanning youll do it to five if your not you wont no supportisaac
supported the change really made this skill pointless at least i only trained it to level 4

hey hey just a simple request really could there be a new forum specifically for wormhole and all things sleeper with the addition of epic arcs yet to be seen the missions forum is becomming very cluttered wormholescosmoscomplexesepic arcsgeneral npc etc i feel that the community would benefit from a more specific wormhole forum if you look in the mission forum its littered with wh threads and the mission ones and the epic arc ones drop rapidly off the page with the influx of the retail players and generally new players it would be beneficial to seperate the two many thanksmikal dreyshattered crystal  the best place for all your online codes
nothing against itso why the  not p
i dont read missions and complexes much but what it sounds like is that youre being flooded in fotm threads which will die down fairly soon even if wormholes remain popular mechanicdiscovery threads will go away as will a lot of the okay how does this work threads i expect itll settle down within a month or so if its still flooded with threadson one topic that bump all the otehrs down then i might support this but for now id prefer to wait and see
revert the race you mean i hear from old vets that caldari boats used to be excellent pvp ships a continuous digression from torpedos that can strike at 100km to battleships speed tanking cruise missiles i still have a raven in my hangar though it looks mean so long as it isnt shooting at anything
too bad naomis bloodline is khanidamarr not caldari
 was drunk i apologize
thanks definately needed in some form and thanks
im sure its a good starting point but the entire alliance structure needs to be made more efficientas it stands an alliance is not its own identity when it comes to contractcorporateinsurance payouts and this really needs to be addressedthe idea of alliance roles with of course the ability to decide who has these roles for how long and when would enable alliances to further their member corporations ability and reach by allowing clear lines of what is alliance assets and what is corp assets of course there would still be arguements but it should be a lot more black and white as to who personalcorpalliance owns what anything in game from a shuttle to the bpo capital set and who can interact with items stored at an alliance officethe suggestions are a good start but there needs to be more emphasis on the identity and ownership at the alliance level so you have my support for what its worth
then what exactly would constitute proof for you any evidence regarding the punishment of a ccp employee in regards to a game which is the intellectual property of ccp will amazingly enough have to come from ccp and any communication with the public from ccp is going to be pr thats public relations so therefore any evidence that comes from them will be disregarded by you according to your own arguments therefore wheres the point in arguing with you when you are going to deny proof when you see itseriously take yourself outside learn some logic then come back and argue i dont know if lavista is right or not but you are an idiot
and just how do you know they are even thereall this mumbo jumbo and conspiracy crap no evidenceno proofme dons tinfoil hatseriously you people are making me laugh so hardits hilarious
hah this is too funnya list of all my alts is publicly available on the forumi dont post with alts i believe in what i say and ill happily smack somebody on their forehead if they are being too stupid without using an alt
so because ccp actively engages in conversation with us about key issueswhich we of course cant publish or talk about we are by definition uselesssorry your logic is fundamentally flawed its nothing but circular reasoning
technicalities differs from game to game i was gm game master in a game where i only had access to commands to unstuck players invisibility teleport around etc only the developers were able to alter stats and spawn items and npcs ie a higher grade gms i wasnt aware that eve was at such low level that belowgms can spawn items thats remarkablehint thats sarcasm try see the pointim merely showing ccps behaviour a pattern that is the key to my whole proposal and not discussing the case in hand i made an effort to really point out that i tried to post it as neutral as possibleif you have to know i supported the ghost training changes its posted in those threads go read if you wantit was marketed to include a game time card the box says 60 day game time as well as advanced career guide which in the box is constantly referring to the online guide that already exist and a vip pass which is a pamphlet with info of how to use the buddy program on this site as well as a special edition shipyou could argue that the guide and vip pass is delivered as promised the game time card and ship however isnt as theyre tied to each other you have to use the gtc on a fresh account to get the ship and you cant even use a buddy program invite ie fresh account use the gtc for this thus circumventing the free trial ie effectively a loss of parts of the 60d timeso basicly you have no freedom to chose how to use the gtc technically the things are delivered but the text the communication to the customer is a workaround buy 2 and get 3rd for free but the first two had their prices upgraded so essentially you pay for 4 technically correct horribly customer communication and treatment you dont get what the box implies that it deliversagain the key here is to show ccps behaviourcommunication towards customersyou are being silly and didnt read my post the situation in itself is not the issue im arguing ccps behaviour its very simple read the rules for name changes its clearly stated noone will get a name change unless the name is offensive etc i didnt ignore the case that a single gm might be behind this its perfectly in line with what i posted  poor customer communication from ccp rogue or inexperienced gms that should be subject to proper informationintroduction the company are responsible for their employees they are responsible for their eduction and behaviourspace adding up posting the other replies in following post 
i didnt read the nyt article about the csm fyi at the time of the t20 incident i was very curious to follow how ccp would treat this case in the game where i was gm we had multiple situations where gms of higherlower levels were involved in several situations similar to thismy interest here was not only as a player regarding game balance i know thats a subjective thing the case i followed here was to see how ccp would try solve this again ill try avoid discussing the cases itself so lets get to the red line that goes through all the things i presented here ccps communication with their customersplayersin light of the t20 incident ccp promised us an internal affairs division as well as the csm to add transparency i remember very little else of what was promised back then but i know thats the exact key phrase they used regarding csm transparency csm was supposed to deliver players an insight and control mechanism to see that ccp did their best to avoid another t20the rest is an afterconstruction im pretty sure both you and me see why ccp wanted a solution came up with this cool idea and then let it get its own life and develop its the exact same approach they do to eve which is part of why its a successful game however while this is innovative when creating a game its horrible for customer relations as its a 100 certain that the promised product will never be delivered since it has its own life evolve and changecsm has run its course its about to shut it down it never got off to do what it was supposed to and it evolved into something that isnt neededperhaps if you instead of trying to find arguments on the particular cases but instead reading the whole picture that is provided  the red linetheme going through then youd see what the post was abouti admit it was a bit long but i clearly made an effort not to discuss the single cases the details in them isnt interesting whats interesting is how ccp respond to it the rest would just be arguing semantics back and forth and noone would ever be right since its a matter of opinionswhats interesting is to see how ccp however really could use some help on how to address big changes to their customers and how csm is doing little of significance being virtually useless and throwing away money that could be better spentthats what this post is about
i wonder where you got the idea of conspiracy theory did you read my post i dont think theres a conspiracy anywhere and if someone is trolling here its you

aight dig ita dawg know him runnin but speakin as a dawg an not a top dawg in a race a dawg ask a dawg like a dawg ask a dawgwhat does a dawg do to make recycling and recovery better business a dawg see last time you dont say much about it so what about nowbe safe
o o extreme
and political parties make csm politics much more interesting lets not forget im still concerned that by having a carebear party youll end up with innately restrictive practices being forced on the csm to give to ccp  remove meta 0 loot from missionsrats would harm the isk supply of independent missionrunners at the expense of t1 manufacturers for example and therefore make private enterprise that much harder again i am all for a party that campaigns for private enterprise sandbox gameplay and other liberal values
due all respect i think that important aspects to the issue in question is being ignored in your argumenttheres many aspects which has to be considered when we discuss that very issue1 do missionrunners make enough isk2 should they make lessthe whole idea is that t1 manufacturing is not worth it because of the abundance that comes from lootif the carebear party is made up by smart people like issler then im certain that it wont end up with innately restrictive practices
this is my point i have nothing against advocacy groups but when you say things like i think the party could make its goal to maintain the freedom to enjoy eve with the widest variety of styles of play youre obviously misrepresenting the truth of the situation your goal is not to defend a variety of styles of play its to represent one style of play theres nothing wrong with that but please be honest with yourself also the reason nobody cares yet is that we still have a week before nominations even close we have more serious declared candidates in the race now than we did at this point last time my understanding of the reasoning for this party is improved voter relations not improved ccp lobbying it doesnt require the csm to have a huge amount of power for it to be effective in that role
doc all due respect but attempting to defeat a fundamentally good idea such as reliable representation for at least a moderately sized portion of the player base by putting an idea into their mouths and then playing kick the can with it is hardly a fair litmus test as to whether there would be any value in creating a partyespecially when i would think with the proper leadershipyour average so called carebear will be infinitely better armed with information and guidance thus producing infinitely more realistic and constructive issues hershi dont get it spell it out for me seeing as the basics of carebearism seems to be leave me alone im trying to build a sand castle here its highly unlikely that their interests will otherwise disrupt anybody elses gameunless of course somebody elses game is harassing people who just want to do their own thing with some friendsat which pointho hum advocacy works everybody wins
how left alone should they be though theres a lot of bearish miners out there who think that canflipping mechanics are fundamentally broken for example  leaving them alone is possible but itd negatively impact the gameplay of the flippers or a bit more to the point look at ankhs campaign to nerf suicide ganking in csm 1  a carebear csmerdont let the fw stats fool you who used her position to launch a direct attack at a pvp career choice and succeeded now im not saying that her position was wrong  on the contrary i largely agreed with it  but it was a bears argument that did negatively impact other people remember the old chestnut about this being eve online and not hello kitty online  harassment is a perfectly normal and acceptable part of eves gameplay yes it can be tweaked up or down but those harassers are playing eve too and their choice of sand castle to buildin this case one of delicious salty tears and the occasional loot drop is just as legitimate as yours the two do come into conflict sometimes and that has to be acknowledged
great hop back into those trees so hopefully we can all miss the forestlook im not here to debate what the appropriate can flipping mechanic is nor do i at this point maintain any opinion on exactly how left alone folks should be in high sec when theyre mining nor to even judge a definition of left alone its overly detailed and not pertinent to the discussion its probably an argument thats been had here a thousand times and with bringing it up as a universal straw man it will probably be had a thousand times more whats actually being talked about here is what if any value might their be to creating a streamlined point for players of similar ilk to constructively provide their interests to one or more csm members save your can flipping stuff for whenif this theoretical organization materializes and whenif they even bring this up in their internal discussions and whenif they decide to bring it to the attention of the general community
actually i want to make sure i understand whats being said here hershyoure not suggesting that jetcanners herein potential victims dont have a right to as much vocal and meaningful advocacy as the flippers do righti dont think thats what youre saying but i want to be sure
um its already hard enough to get players out into low sec you want to make that even harder

signed  we need repackaging and the ability to disassemble ships in null
signedwhy because through all the posts i havent seen anyone in ccp put their hand up and say ill take a look and give reasons why it cantwont be done other than because it cant
you are mistaken the main reason ccp said they wont do it is because  it is too hard i am serious it is because it will be a big project they feel they can not do this so they can do stuff but not when it is hard
signed i agree the current poss dont look realistic a bunch of modules floating in space around a tower just doesnt look realistic at the very least have the modules connect together in a streamlined way how it would be if we were able to leave ship and walk around the pos even though we know this will never happen

instead of capsecond t2 long range ammo should give a bonus to caprecharge its not a lot to ask since most fleet bs lack exactly that  cap and also because there is already the lowdamage of long range ammos and gimped tracking so that kind of small bonus would make it more usableperhaps the tracking of short range lazerblastermissileexpl velocity here should be looked into as wellor some sort of other bonus or something would certainly be a nice addition to t2 ammo
cant support this topic as its unclear what is being asked fori would definitely support a buff for shortrange t2 ammo  the reason its so cheap is not because its easy to produce  its bacause there is no demand due to the fact that it has crippling drawbacks for no noticable benefit  as it stands if youre using void  hail etc youre doing something wrongi would not support nerf of faction ammo however  and since that is a concievable inference of the thread title i cant support it
another additional note is that you could potentially add an option to allow current customers through the shield this would avoid having to hand out passwords and deal with the constant rerequests for forgotten passwords
good idea but i dont think it will happen in this formi would rather see a silo system employed everything goes into and out of the silothe corporation can still anchor silos inside cause they own the pos but the old rules applybut for non corp membersthe only way to prevent abuse would be to have the silos anchored outside of the shieldsthe person who wants to rent anchors there silo and agrees to a connection charge to the research platformso the silo would be owned by a person not a corpthis way protects the researcher and is a much simpler method you simply pay for the connection charge when you insert a job and you get disconnected when it is completeand as far as all those silos you could make a research beacon of grid from the pos so you anchor the beacon and everyone who wants to rent goes to the beacon and anchors the silo there ccp can even limit the number of anchored silosand for those that want to spam have a count down say 15 days after your job ends your silo gets unanchored if you dont que a new job so you forget about your silo and someone can steal itof course you would never employ this system in lowsec or 00 but then again why would you even want too so yes you are on the right track but no to your current implementation
i dont see how the researcher having to haul and anchor a structure one that is unprotected outside the bubble is better for the researcher the same amount of effort would still be required on the billing side for your connection fee as a simple locker rent would be only this allows the pos owner to control placementoptions better what risk do you see the researcher having under my storage array idea and how would them using their own facility unprotected connected to the owners pos be any better
i support this not because its a good idea but because it is silly also the inevitable ragefest that would ensue would be great to watch
voting in support as many have said chribba has done way more for eveonline than the average player and things of this magnitude are acceptable i believe since it will really have no effect on the supply of veld or the game mechanics just like the veldnaught this will be a shiny toy for people to ooo and ahh over and thats not a bad thing
this should absolutely happen
if it dont lag out the system i guess it cant hurt  supported
i will support this ideato those who say why should chribba get special treatmentbecause he gives us love ships love cans crazy events with awesome prizes along with trusted third party services and much more  this is a man whos put a lot of smiles on a lot of faces  id be happy for the eve universe to give him something to make him smile in returnobviously hell need some sort of doomspar device thatll reduce a belt to rubble once an hourgo on ccp  ya know ya wana
for everything chribba has done for the eve community how can we not support this gl chribba hope they do this for you

support this for all that chribba does for the community
what did chribba do for the community when chribba hasnt got the attention he so desperately needs he starts threads like this showing off and trying to get people on his wagon tastelessi really dont get this so much support for something that apparently is rulebending and attentionseeking

giving the naglfar an extra mid and a cpu  cap boost doesnt stop it from being a steaming pile of  i needs significantly more damage on top of not being made of paper
heh i fully suport this spliting weapons are a nice ideea but in this case training req are just insane compared with the rest and at the end youll be in the worst dread ever build anyway im not for shield tank keep it armor tank like the carrier make him 3 turet boat like the rest of the universe and maibe boost a bit xl projectile ammo
i could of easily have trained for minnie dreads as i have bs 5 and large projectile 5 but instead opted to train up amarr from scratch to get a revelation nice going ccp on balancing minmatar dreads with the other races
mini caps and bss need to be looked at the agility and speed bonus for minis are lost on any ship bs sized up projectiles may also be the cause for the epic fail that is mini bs sized and above ships

wormhole space was an amazing proof of concept which show that the dynamics of the absence of local is both interesting and fun lets take the next step and bring it to known space
no
ill say the same thing ive said a hundred other times if system scanning tools are developed to the point where local is unnecessary then i favour the abolitionwell delayed modeing of local local is a stopgap intel tool and it wouldnt be used like it is under a sufficiently improved system that said given that those scanning tools do not yet exist trying to extend this to known space is premature its fine for the funky space to be genuinely hard to find people in but not for the real world
i agree with yamamotosan
i support delayed local in all 00 space
no just nonull sec alliances get enough people raiding their space local makes it possible to defend against them
more risk in 00 would be great in my book
simply no what would this change exactly so you know the numbers of your enemy so what he knows your numbers too just leave 00 the way it is
one thing for certain local nerf would be a serious deterrent to chinese farmer operations in 00right now they occur on massive scale
wait wutso no more claiming 100 systems that you really dont have the resources to defendno more instablob because of a local spike thus encouraging smallscale pvp with roaming patrol gangsrequire active attentiveness to those allainces while operating in lawless spacegod yes this is horrible
the ability to know i am in a system whether i have been seen or scanned is whats kept me out of 00 for the most part sorry but this is a needed addition you shouldnt show up on a local cortex unless you choose to say somethinguse your combat scanners and kill the localspy
great idea we need more mission farmer alts and i need some free kills for my cloaking gangs
i support this ideaon the conditions that1 we get scanning tools that make local unneeded in 00 2 local stays in lowsec and npc00 but in delayed mode you only show up 30 seconds after you jumped into system or when you start moving3 hisec no change at alldoh forgot to klick the support iconerem
1 autoupdating scanner ui maybe a miniui might be nice2 no3 sure
nowhybecause in normal space entry and exit to the system is governed by jump gates which broadcast the info on a systemwide basis which is why you can gank someone somewhere fly to another gate and still be denied permission to jump until your aggro is clearthis information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in localwspace is accessed through unstable fractures that are not connected to any technological equipment that will broadcast this information  this is why you only see another player when they open comms by talking you probe them out scan them down or get visual contact on the same gridthe only time i would support ships being able to jump into regular space and not appear in local is covert opsclass ships that enter via covert cynosural field ie if they enter via jump gate they appear in local
only with suitable scanning substitutes ccp has made good progress in improving scanning but its not ready to replace local yetthat said im going to support this because i want to see what ccp can come up with
yes lets buff solosmall gang roaming thanks
this
by that logic anyone that enters through a wormhole shouldnt show up either i still support 100 delayed mode in local in 00 its a lot of fun in wspace picking up a ship on scan that wasnt there before and trying to figure out if its friend or foe and wondering if theyve spotted you it also seems to benefithinder pveers and pvpers about the same
funny because when you jump from wspace to kspace you instantly appear on local
the simplest solution would be to make it so that you never show up on the communications channel unless you say something periodits a communications tool not an intel tool it only became that i suppose out of ccps negligence the most logical system for highsec lowsec 00 and wormhole space is that you never show up on a communication network unless you fraking communicate any other system is ed does this need to be implemented with boosted ship scanners yes but it still needs to be universal  adding a second support

sweet free drinks count me in
but does it come with cheese
im not an awox alt and i support this topic
first a bit of a preface according to my source dss probes were supposed to have a starting strength of 5 instead of 20 and someone goofed fine however i also learned from that same source that when you run a scan with probes it only returns the four best results for any given result i confirmed this by using 4 6 and 8 dss probes around a site that i had scanned down and bookmarked via other means the results while consistent with this information were maddening at minimum scan range with 11 strength on the probes after skills ship and rigs the sigs maximum accuracy was slightly less than 25 it remained at that for all three scenarios furthermore i took the painstaking time to arrange the probes in tetrahedral with 4 octahedral with 6 and dodecahedral with 8 configurations providing the greatest possible quadrangulation even at 32 au  enough to cover the whole system from each side in four directions  the signatures in the system bounced around like a ping pong ball so the probes inherent accuracy has been severely hampered by the 75 drop in strength i believe i referred to it as a nerfbat to the ballsmy main issue is not the strength of the probes though it was nice while it lasted but the fact that only 4 results are used no scientist in their right mind would ever think to just toss out extra data points however precise they may or may not be so long as they referred to the same general area or range when were talking about probes each probe knows approximately how far away an object is within a given error using only 4 results does indeed give you a point result but if youre able to add more scans from different directions to resolve the error hypothetically you could eliminate the error almost entirely if you simply quadrangulated from many directions the result might not be perfect but it would be fairly accurate and you could move the probes closer to the result to give a perfect hitin short all i request is that every probe that a player can control be able to be used in the determination of a given signatures position not simply the four best also a base strength of 10 wouldnt hurt since these probes are supposed to be highly advanced and do require astrometrics 5 however the first half of the proposal is the most important
argh clearly i do support my own topicyarrsticks
it sucks that additional probes beyond 4 does nothing to improve the signal
this whole probing system is designed around stepping everything down by a factor of 2 each time until you hit 100 deep space probes just let you start 3 steps higher which is useless in small systems and necessary in large ones personally i thought the prenerf deep space probes were a great reason to go for astrometrics 5 which i likely wont bother with now but it does fundamentally make more sense you shouldnt be able to achieve final scan results with deep space probes you should need to swap down to something with better resolution as for your point about the four best ill say two things one youre clearly in the hard sciences because the soft sciences seem half the time to be all about throwing out data points to make the world fit the modeli dont mean that badly  you simply cannot analyze broad trends in a field like history or economics without making subjective decisions on what counts as a legitimate data point secondly while triangulation is a hard science in the real world its a game mechanic in eve the added probes protect you from deviation and give you significantly better results on the whole but they want lowskill characters not to be too badly disadvantaged under this system and so they capped the number of probes that contribute directly it may not make physical sensealthough to be fair it may  the data coming from these probes is obviously incredibly loose at higher ranges which you can see as you watch probes jump around by multiple au between scans and throwing out data may sometimes be reasonable but it makes gameplay sense and thats 95 of what ccp cares about
i think the issue is more profound than the op has itas noted in this thread in the game development forum deep space probes dsps are no better than core probes apart from a greater probe range and they warp faster and reallythe warp faster thing is not a big deal at all the greater probe range is hardly useful at all as the 32au on the core is plenty most times simply use more to cover a bigger system if necessarya trivial task indeed the core probes are actually better since they can narrow the scan range down more than dsps at the same range they are the same strengthso you train a 14ish day skill to l5 for what more expensive probes that take up more room in your cargo holdto make matters worse apparently the sisters deep space probe is now precisely the same as the normal dsp or so others have suggestedi have not checkedas probing existed before the nerf it was a hassle to find what you were looking for in a system since the game nicely forgets all your previous results on each new scan however the dsps made it somewhat tolerable as they were now it has become a hell of probing down everything to exceptional accuracy and pinning it and then doing that again and again boring and tedious barely cover it timesink understates it nightmare is closer to the markit seemed one of the main issues with dsps as they were was they were very overpowered when finding player ships no question that needed a nerf rather than a nerf though one which would have reasonably made dsps not good at probing for ships but kept their probing of signatures useful we get this hamfisted hatchet jobtruly looking at the issues of gutting a l5 skill so it is worthless to train and making the better probes literally no better than their lesser counterparts and to toss the whole need for an expanded launcher is nothing short of astonishing csm please ask ccp for their thoughts on this one soon at least give the players a sense if this is exactly how ccp envisioned this or if they what i am hoping merely gutted the probes as a very short term fix to avoid the ship probing imbalance on those and mean to provide a more balanced version soon and not trademarked soon but actual honest to god soon
i bolded the part you missed theres no concord response in 00 space
unless empty moons are so hard to find im not sure why people are concerned about it what is the main reason for a hi sec pos a research lab if so why do you have to be close to a market hub to set your pos up at
concord really should not protect offline pos
agreed i would prefer the unanchoring method myselfi would say 15 days and your tower gets unanchoredmaybe a week but no less then thatoh i also like the idea of no concord for offline possso both your pos goes offline it is considered space junk after 24 hours and someone can take it outor they can wait for it to unanchor in the 7 to 15 day period and take it all
you seemed to miss the part where she said that she cant shoot their towers without a war so were obviously not talking anything but high sec towers
again if the tower is offline for 24 hoursno more than 36it self destructs or becomes steal ableyou people who ask for 1 week or more your just making the problem worsethe idea is to only hold moons your actively fueling for not squatting them like a bunch of jackassesif you want the moon that bad fuel the damn towerotherwise leave
well rl comes into it unfortunately and that is why i say 24 hour and it can be destroyed and then one week and it can be stolen i really dont like the idea of it just self destructing that is too easy and not evethat does not create a problem cause if you want the moon that bad then destroy itif not then wait the time and see if you can steal it and make a profit
how bout if somebody else wants the moon that badly they kill your tower as youve obviously invested more time and money into that moon at that point than they have and working for rewards is what eve is about
rl is a poor excuseposs should be employed by people who can use them that means a corpyou get a partner to help outend of discussionalso read my damn post i said stealable as an option as opposed to self destructingit is perfectly logical and feasible considering the nature of eveyou leave a can out there in space and its open to the world what do you expectits gonna get tippedposs are a a rampant problem stop making excuses that favor the problem and come up with solutions that are rational1 week is too long and that would mean anyone could fuel it for a singular day and wait a weekat least with 2436 hoursif you snooze you lose
grumbles  stupid eve forums glitch
i am not disagreeing with you i am saying both options24 hours you can destroy it you will have to work to get that moonand 1 week is becomes unanchored and can just be picked up and stolendo you consider this an unreasonable option for a free 100 million to 11 billion isk pos 
the problem with your logic as ive already said people can exploit thatmost wont know that the pos is offline until they start looking aroundby allowing it to stay there for 1 week they can refuel it and bring it back onlineand allow them to destroy it implies a number of problems does this mean they have to wardec the corpjust allowing anyone to destroy the pos is not what i call a good idea its a can of worms at bestdoes the owner get aggro to fire backtoo many holes therethere needs to be a stern mechanic here either you maintain your pos or it gets turned into space garbage or robbedyou can suggest all you want as far as solutions go but 1 week is too long imofew months ago i would agree but now so many people want in on that territory its utterly insane today
edited for correctionsagreed offline poses should after a certain period of time become legally fair game for anyone to either shoot at or appropriate no one should be reserving moons that they cant usefrom what i can see poses near hisec are primarily used for moon mining because thats where the money is valuable moons shouldnt be beaugarded if theyre not being used unused poses are not uncommon it can be hard to find unoccupied moons of enough worth to justify fueling them in some areas and naturally corps will find it preferable to erect poses as close to civilization which makes unused poses very frustratingnow i do think that a corp in this situation is currently welladvised to simply relocate to a less convenient part of space but it seems silly to me that moons can be reserved in this way and often forgotten about
i would say yes the corp can defend its posand you should be able to defend yourselfhmm a can a worms yes but i think maybe it could provide something interesting  the same timesay corp a lets there pos run out of fuelcorp b comes in and starts taking it out after the 24 hour timer comes in to playcorp a comes in to defendwhen corp a fires  corp b a instant war dec starts for 24 hoursboth sides can open up on each other to fight over the moonthe price for letting the pos run out of fuel and the price for wanting the moon right nowconcord will not get involvedand if the corp is in a alliance personally i would rather keep this on a corporation level as it is a corporation issue not an alliance issuebut i doubt the mechanics would allow it which is a shame cause it shouldand yes someone can keep fueling the pos every other day but it still shows intent and would quickly become a pain in the ass to keep it upand you could always just war dec them and be done with itin most cases though i think more poss will just get destroyed without the owner lifting a fingerneed to think on this morebut i dont agree with a 24 hour timer and the pos just goes boom or can be stolentoo easy especially cause how this would effect poss in 00cause if you let a pos run out of fuel you have to unanchor everything else before it can be reanchoredand you would be surprised how many major alliances in 00 and low0sec have issues keeping poss fueled
too bad there are no mineable moons in high sec or this might have merit there are absolutely no minerals within moons in high security space generally the only purpose of a high security pos is running labs for research invention and from what i can tell t3 construction at this point
sorry youre right  i had confused myself and misspoke near highsec is what i mean  the barelylowsec areas as close as possible to hisec there are enough moons in real hisec that crowding isnt a serious problem there and particular moons arent more desirable than others since it makes no difference what moon youre orbiting
a your making a simple solution more complicated 24 hour wardec is not a good way of resolving this issueb this is just high sec call it a concord policy much like not being able to anchor secure cans in systems higher than a certain sec levelc make it 36 hours then but not a week 2 3 days at most1 week is too longat least your thinking this throughand for that i respect you but your compromising the balance in the process
looks like some alliances are having to relearn empirebut i also agree there should be a way to hacksteal highsec towers however you could always find an offline small with a one man corp and wardec them with an alt corp running amarr gank bs it wont take long and will be cheap and easy you can even turn it into a profitable venture if you can find towers that still have modules at them
smoking cigsweedcrack and drinking should be in eve itll definitely make spinning spaceships a lot more fun especially if there are fun visuals added in with getting high
i like keeping records of me getting pawned and podded
mercenaries pretty much nuff saidin detailmercs that can prove they did their job make money killmail  proofmercs that cannot prove anything dont no killmail  no proof
first off people dont have to report kill mails to a public kill boardbut they do and that system was around long before the kill mails even existedso the current system is a convenience to those that wish to report what they kill nothing moreso removing it would serve no purpose other then aggravate those that use the mechanicand for the rest of us that dont bother with it we just dont bother to look  itso rather then hearing wining about why it was removed from those that use it and for me cause i would rather have ccp working on actual issues then this i say no leave it as is
killmails are a good idea they tell you your contribution to the fight and who contributed to your demise otherwise all combat tactics would be totally theoretical with no one actually knowing what worked and what totally failedthe problems that need to be addressed and things that need to be added are1 logistics contribution to damage taken2 hitpoints transferd by logistics 15 minutes before rr ship dying3 a solution to fake mailsneither of which justify the removing of killmails an act that would create many more problems
this is a serious issue which hasnt been addressed properly although there has been talk about it for god knows how longthe underlying problems areregular cloaking devices noncovert ops cloaks and the mechanics that dictate that a cloaked ship is impossible to scan down aggro timer when engaging anything currently we have the 15 minute aggro timer when you engage a player ship and log off but aggroing npc ships is not taken into account this being a major issue when a person spontaneously logs offspontaneous logoffs when being aggressed by npcs like mentioned abovethe issue with noncovops cloaking devices has been raised many times already and it has been acknowledged yet nothing has been made to correct it at the same time scanning mechanics have been completely revamped scanning out ships is now more time consuming than ever before while a simple module like a prototype cloaking device can effectively make you invulnerable effectively what this means is that in a supposedly harsh environment of 00 a player can simply warp off and cloak using a noncovops cloak before anything can catch it a battleship with a prototype cloak can warp off an asteroid belt and cloak and therefore become invulnerable before any ship can warp in to the belt and tackle the battleship im fine with being slow and having crappy reactions but when catching a battleship on a belt 1000000 km off the gate youre jumping in from with an interceptor is considered impossible there must be something fundamentally wrongthe biggest problem of course is the nonhuman factor in most of the forementioned cases the player is using a macrobot of some kind and therefore can react way before a human on the other side can react even this i can still accept but the fact that they do this and then use a fundamentally flawed mod like the prototype cloak to become invulnerable is just unacceptable the other variant that weve seen is that the player simply logs off as soon as another player enters the system and with no proper aggro timer present from shooting npcs the player is impossible to catch especially after making ship scanning even harder than what it used to besummarizing the post scanning has been made more time consuming than before while no aggrologoffcloaking mechanics have been altered this has been unbalanced for a long time and is even more unbalanced now the biggest problem i see here is the macros and the current mechanics that make these macros possible and profitable to use this has to change either by seriously affecting the penalties of fitting a noncovert ops cloak making the noncovert cloaks finally scannable or by changing the logoffaggro mechanics something just has to be done
i hate to sound like a  here butisnt it called a cloak for a reason the only improvement i can see to your situation is a drastic increase in either the difficulty to produce cloaks of all types  or a drastic increase in training times to use them im also not sure what you were getting at with the logoff mechanics ships that have logged off can still be scanned down for something like two hours i believemaybe im just wrong feel free to correct me or clarify this some more and ill support
yes i just hate paying the corporate tax when i sell my mineralsoh wait

lolfunny funny
do not supportbefore this issue can ever even have a chance of happening ccp would have to fix a number of other issues1 the incredibly cheap cost of a wardec they are basially free at the moment2 the corp jumping thing if people get kicked out of npc corp then they will just join corps that have enough alts with their own corps that they can basically just leave altcorp1 and jump to altcorp2 and when that is decced jump to altcorp3 and so onneither of these things will be changedfixed anytime soon and both would have to be addressed before this could ever have a chance of happeningalso i am of the opinion that if you want to be in a npc corp and just play the game highsec worry free fine the only people that want to dec highsec corps are the ones that have trouble in low00 anyway
yeah mission farmers macro miners they sure need pos teamwork and large fleetslook how stupid you are troll
mining doesnt make much isk now anyway i can assure you most nonalts in npc corps do nothing but run missions all the time
youreyoure not a miner are you have you ever even turned on a mining laser one of my corpmates makes enough from mining in his hulk largely solo to pay for his account in plexes with some left over it may not be much isk by your definition but ffs 350 million a month aint loose change either
darth vader voice  you underestimate the power of the mining laser
noexamplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a livingi am a independent miner and dont wish to be associated with anybodyi am scammer and a pickpocket not sure how you would do that but you get the ideai am spyetc etc etci would love the ability to remove myself from any corporation thoughit would be nice to see people with a corporation identifier of nonenow that would be better then a npc corp and would show a personal choice
actually i am bearing in hisec right now mining veld with a hulkexp rigst2  crystals etc and solo a couple hours mining nets me from 610 mil if i mission i more than double thatbut to make enough to buy several plexes maybe if i didnt buy anything else that month sure
he dont know how to mine does hestick to mission running leave the minin to the pros not to mention the knowledge about them
apparently not assuming a couple of hours actually means 2 hours i can make 56 million in my retreiver for goodness sake with a fully fitted hulk i would expect to make somewhere between 15  20 in the same amount of timeme cant fly hulks yet  ive been too busy training for a typhoon
assuming you have a hauler alt going and are mining regular veldspar you make a shade under 117 million per hulk per hour thats about half as much as a missioner with a decent amount of skill makes but its far easier alternately if you fit a hulk up for cargo space and then mine semiafk you make better than 2 million every time you dock up its not enough to retire on but its a fully respectable income stream if youre making 35 mil an hour mining actively even solo youre doing it wrong
no hauler alt expander rigs ill get accurate times and numbers tonight
we expect full fitting spec sheet with charges and whatever your mining to be listed palif your going to ante up go all in or nuthin
yessir captn o7
let all npccorp players get conscripted to their empires militia 3 months after they started
we expect all pvpers to mine for 3 months straight before being allowed to fire a single shotohwait
they can join sooner if they want but not stay in npccorp longer then 3 months before getting a concord letter telling them congratulation you are now a member of your empires milita no go make us proud son
this is a pvp game whelp
pvp doesnt necessarily involve combat
if its a pvp game then why are there miners and manufacturers smartass
but only if you require all people to mine for 3 months straight
this is a pvp game whelp did you already forget i just told you
so what your saying is pvpers dont know how to read let alone answer direct questions rightwow i feel sorry for you guys
not supported because you want players forced out of npc corps offer incentives instead to encourage ppl and id sing a different tunepossibilitiesa after say 3 months npc corp start handing out missions to members that gain them nothing but standings gain with that corp if these missions are failedrefused they gain a standings hit that if not rectified will eventually have them thrown out to a different npc corp downside is that it still has elements of being forcedb start instituting a corp tax on npc corpsc let members of player corps use corp standings to access hostile agents from other factions as a means of repairing personal standingsd give bonuses to mining or some such similar to fleet bonuses but not stacking with them to members of player corps while in any system they have an office or a posi would personally rather see something like c or d as they are incentives and not penalties
youre right there is only pvp no missions no ratting no mining no refining no manufacturing no invention no trading no hauling right the only ships that exist are there to kill like the orcayoure just a jackass insulting doesnt prove a point npc corps have good pros and cons people dont need to be forced into combat when it will probably find them eventually even if its only suicide ganking
i think we should be able to have a no corporation association optionor if that cant be done how about one called none or independentsomething to say hey i do my own thing and have no need to be associated with anybodyexamplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a livingi am a independent miner and dont wish to be associated with anybodyi am scammer and a pickpocket not sure how you would do that but you get the ideai am spyetc etc etc
nonpcs already do that let alone 1 man corps
yeh yeh yeh i hit return by mistakethe rest of it is in there now
yesespecially combined with option to have wardecvendetta against individual characters no matter npc corp player corp or no corp
i agree with this actually i think a nonaffiliation rogue capsuleers as it were would be a neat thing to have
no this is game is designed with corporations in mind no supportisaac
oh for crying out louddo i have to spell it out for you low iq peoplenon affiliated pilots are worse than npcits nigh perfect immunityit will never happen hell will freeze over before you get that far
only if you can wardec an unaffiliated person but if you can wardec an unaffiliated person for less money than a corp everyone would and no one would choose to be unaffiliated as opposed to be in an npc corpif all you want to do is not belong to someone elses corp just found your own like the duke of plazatoro ltdif you were proposing replacing the npc corps with unaffiliated status such that individuals could be wardeced thatd be something elsein its proposed incarnation though this seems impractical to me
semithis1 man corp is far better anywaynpc corps are especially nice for new pilots who join up in there first days they get a corp chat for the npc corp and can ask questions related to there race so to speak its likely to be a bit quieter than rookie chatthats just one advantage npcs are typically nonaffiliated anywayso i fail to see the reason for this proposal to begin with even if you allow wardec to singular individuals then whats the point might as well allow that across the game itselfthis is a ridiculous proposaland a can of worms at best
fair enough its rare but the other three still apply quite frequently
i thought that too at first however it has nothing to do with orbiting it works no matter whether the enemy orbits or not it just requires you to make tactical maneuvers too if you do so you can take advantage of itthere is an old naval tactic called crossing the t the basic setup looks like this         the triangles are the ships in their direction of movement it means the one who crosses can fire broadsides at his enemy wave after wave while the enemy can only use its forward batteries and has to shoot a moving target with maximum transversal in eve only the transversal speed remains of that still if you cross the t of your opponents flight vector and you have his inertia beaten down he cant adjust his vector well so eventually you end up orbiting him and you can dictate range not by speed but by vector because he either stops to align to you losing distance and speed or he takes forever doing so on the fly falling behind on your actual vectorit is complicated but it should work at least in theory of course caldari pilots would have to learn that ships can actually move during combat first
problem is eve isnt a tactical movement game  the commands are simplistic and not designed to let you do what youre trying to do here really the only commands you can enter are to dictate range  theres move to x orbit at x and really thats about it furthermore theres a deep problem with how tracking is implemented in that it doesnt account for the rotation of the firing ship  if youre in a circular orbit of a stationary point the effective tracking is zero not radial like eve uses if they implemented that then youd have a lot more tactics in how ships move but at present its solely about dictating range the inertia gun makes it a bit easier to do that but it seems like itd be far less effective than a web maybe if you made it outright add an amount of mass then itd be better for antifrigate work but then its useless against big ships i see what youre saying and i agree to some extent but offhand i dont think eve is the game youre looking for here
thing is hersch eve would be soooo much better if it was a tactical gameits just too plain and jane to show up and open fire on a shipit would be so much better if ships had there weak points and strong points depending on the shape and positionfor example a malestrom has all of its cannons along the side of the ship on the starboard and port sidesone would think that going broadside on a ship of that magnitude would be a veryrisky venture if not fatalas all guns are brought to bearif the malestrom was firing her cannons in the front or the rear quadrants it wouldnt be as effective yet it is to a degreeeve would be more interesting that way opening up on a ships rear quandrent to knock out the enginesblind spotsetcetcbutalasnot likely to happeni can dream cant i  o 
i got some positive feedback on this topic in the ideas forum and am submitting this for an official votetopic 1i understand the need to restrict tractor beams in high sec space but i think the game shouldnt restrict you from pulling other peoples wrecks in null sec or at the very least extend the tractor beam to work on alliance wrecks this arbitrary limitation about wreck ownership makes cleaning up around alliance systems a pain in the ass for all salvagers especially when the owners are offline and cant fleet younotethis proposal is specifically for low and null sec systems 4  00 systems of sec status 5 and up should and probably will remain as they are topic 2someone also suggested allowing tractor beams to pull unanchored structures and containers so i am adding it on the main proposal as topic 2
i support this topic
you support this thats funny because it doesnt look like you are support this ehp
definitely supported for 00 assuming its technically feasible probably supported for lowsec as well
i understand some limitations for this in highsec maybe even lowsec but 00 should be free for all
supported
oh man we need this
supported for obvious reasons
sure why not an exportable block log file could prove useful for some users
a good idea
actually i think that could lead to alot more problems in imblancing than is already ingamea rig that provides for a fitting slotwhy cant i have a rig for a propulsion slot or more drones or 1 for a web at what point is it no longer a rig slot but just an omnislotnice idea but not really wanted
training it to 5 should allow the directional scanner to sort things properly

as a very knowledgeable player what is your opinion of fitting interdictors without bubble launchers and the loss of said interdictors to solo frigates what actions would you take against vocal critics of such fittings
lol still feeling bitter about having your access to our forms removed vit oh well in any case i personally wouldnt use an interdictor in that way but mostly because i think there is a number of ships that can do the job just as well having said that i can see that a high speed dessie would be useful in some situations outside of 00 and certainly wouldnt post insulting and snippy commentspictures about someone who did want to try it as for actions of censorship taken against people who critise such fittings i would be taking no actions as constructive criticism is a key way of helping others continual pointless smack and insulting of other members of a forum is another matter entirely of course and after consultation with other moderators of said forums i would be only too happy to remove that persons postingreading rights if there was enough continued complaints against said person hope that helps
i personally love to fit interdictors without bubble launchers i use the extra slot to fit minibars and jacuzzi and consider that since my clones cost 30mil isk anyways its a bit pointless to fly a tech1 destroyer when tech2 versions are available
where do you stand on the whole bob reloaded kerkufflewhat do you think about mining income versus missioningwhat do you think about militia members getting faction hits for rring fellow militia members who have criminal security status
well to be honest i find the amount of forum talk about it to be far in excess of what the subject deserves as it is i think that the changing of the name from kenzuko to band of brothers reloaded was a mistake on someones part within ccp i doubt there was anything malicious in doing so simply on the basis that it really doesnt mean all that much at the end of the day as mentioned by several people on both the giant threads in regard to the topic if the exbob leadership had formed an entirely new alliance and then petitioned the band of brothers corp for name squatting i can see how that would have been a viable solution to the affair as it is rolling back the decision was the right move in my opinion not becuase of the public outcry over the issue one way or another but simply because kenzuko had been in existence for too long to say something like whoops our bad we meant to type something elseas a csm i would as stated above be more than willing to ask ccp if an investigation had been carried out into how this whole mess had happened the issues with mining income versus missioning to me seems to be three major areas firstly the isk a miner makes is entirely determined by the market since the removal of shuttles as an npc item removed the lower limit cap for trit and as such fluctuates with supply and demand whilst missioning is a relativity fixed income which only relies on the time you put in the second issue is that of macromining which connects to the supply and demand part as the market value of minerals is artificially reduced by the abundance of minerals created by these miners lastly the reprocessing of mission loot seems to me to put in an inordinate amount of minerals into the market which further devalues the mineral prices i personally would like to see more dynamism in mission running in regards to the rewards you get and the quality of the agent being heavily linked to the number of requests that agent has for missions per day i would also like to see the loot drops reduced and maybe balanced by a small increase in the bounties of the rats in the missions of course this would be a delicate balance to achieve and would need some work by ccp as well as other options looked at that the players suggest im sure this will get some backs up but i agree with it the various factions are in effect subservient to the ded in regards to standings in many ways they all respect the negative standing placed on someone by the ded and as a result helping such a person would result in a lowering of standings towards the faction now i can understand this makes things tough for those militias who have such people in their midst but at the end of the day you still have the choice not to work with them i think it would be far more sensible and fit in with the way the standings system is supposed to work if people with a criminal security status werent allowed to join however this would be ignoring the long standing traditions of privateering i suppose there could be some sort of letter of marque given to a criminal but thats a whole different kettle of fish and would have to be looked at very carefully in order to not allow factional warfare to turn into a pirate free for all i dont have anything against pirates though i work with a number of them all the time but eve is about choices you make if you chose to be a pirate then official bodies such as the four core empires wont like you and if you chose aid one then you are aiding a criminal above the status of aiding a fellow militia member based on the idea that ded standings are more important than empire standings

transparancy most importantly thanks to ankhesentapemkah you now have a wiki where you can keep track of all csm issues and ccp is looking for further means to improve communication with the players i will continue this path towards transparancy and accountability after all what good is the csm if the players cannot clearly see what is being worked on  this is no vague talk or idle promise as can be proven by take cares track record over the past year participation i encourage all players to participate at take care and get involved with the csm there may be issues that are important for you and we would love to hear from you you can send questions concerns and comments to ankhesentapemkah and me and well get back to you with an answermy agenda in a nutshellfind in the following the issues which are my personal agenda if you want changes which i will try to push forward if elected csm delegate some areas i would like to see developed while not being an expert myself i can assume that a csm colleague will know a lot more in such areas and i will constructively support him or her in the submission process finally feel free to bring your own topics to my attention or to modify priorities according to your understanding programmable npcsprogrammable npcs shall give out your missions to other players creating missions should allow you to assess the best pilot for later recruitment build a renommee for yourself in the sector create an income for mission runners and yourself the toolset would range from simple courier missions to transport a pile of stuff from a to b sourced in slices from your own stock to acquisition mining  trade  exploration eg nailing down a signature to killing where either spawns would be triggered by the type of enemy the mission creator selects or capsuleers need to be eliminated where a mission would only be given out when enemy capsuleers are present of course concord refactoringcaptain we just received a distress signal in this constellation  having a computer generated police force was a logical decision at eves stage of 40k subscribers today with 40k pilots simultaneously online we have better options be it by tradeable killrights or introducing the role of marshals who may react on aggression or distress signalsif capsuleers do the job pirates will have equal opponents  carebears with teeth and imagine an adaptive system security rating depending on the number of marshals around and how that could reshape the galaxy we could testdrive the mechanics in lowsec first to provide incentives for players to police space and take care of the justice aspect of the game while providing pirates there with more juicy targets 00 incentivizingalready mentioned during csm2 but i want to emphesize that endless pos warfare is not the endgame we want allow 00 alliances to do empirebuilding let them add npcs to their outposts and provide more reliable moneymaking activities for the grunts to make isk on site having reasons for alliances to operate under an nrds policy and making money off visiting carebears would be a bonus for example by using the player mission system see above let 00 space be used and come to life  more ships there will then trigger or allow other activities my focus is an increased interaction between players making pilots travel more regions of space of course 00 needs other aspects to be looked at like the sovereignty mechanics themselves and moon mining
 finishing factional warfarethere are mechanical flaws which need to be addressed from known exploits to stupid spawning in addition to these engineering issues i see a much greater importance of factional warfare for the whole galaxy when war broke lose between the empires i hoped that it would bring a sort of endgame to highsec imagine  conquering a system will make it harder for the inhabitants loyal to the defeated faction to live in it also i do not see a reason why amarr can ally with caldari but a capsuleer alliance cannot oh and did i say that i hate spawning  let plex appearance be playerdriven not totally random  i can imagine playerowned habitats as factors in occupancy with solid profits attached until being conquered or destroyed by the enemy some kind of sovereignty in empire space leveraging the standing systemnow this last one is quite abstract and maybe it is too farfetched but lets see  all the greater aspects of eve work sidebyside connected more or less through the item market yes it is hypercapitalism and nothing wrong with that but the ubiquitous call for more backstory involvement sandbox and incentives leads me to believe that we need more than isk to compete with before we had the alliance system corporations already forged alliances outside of the clienttoday still a quarter of a million capsuleers meet eye to eye you sell to one other your contract is picked up by one other you shoot at one other and if you shoot well he use his killright to shoot back what you are doing inflicts a change only to exactly one other pilot or none when you shoot the environment and once it is done it is over it not really multiplies stages nor has indirect effectsmy goal is to add interaction between capsuleers and to make it little predictable by introducing a new abstraction layer on which capsuleers compete throughout new eden a second market your standing should empower or hinder you standing which others set towards you  for example from all pilots loyal to the occupying faction thus your actions will have a potential backlash upon you both good and bad standing you currently gain through npc missions and you only use it for missions standing given by other pilots is irrelevant standing given by a corporation to a pilot is irrelevant but in future standing may allow the marshal role for the occupying faction or sovereign alliance it might give real bonusses to your personal profit and efficiency of your corp the standing settings of each pilot towards you will gain importance to an extent as they are themselves liked or disliked depending on the region of space you are in occupancy the resulting standing network will be hard to exploit as we deal with thousands of individuals and ten alts will not make a differencethe cushion from where the ball bounces back to you can then be occupancy where the loss of a system affects the whole loyal community there aggression and killrights which may be used by other capsuleers than the involved two parties your creativity where your missions in good standing are required for an infrastructure which you may exploit further issuesthe above list is not complete as said earlier i cannot adopt issues where i am not an expert in the area of effect a lot of ship and module effects fall under this category personally i think there is something wrong with the turret mechanics in closeup battle i will support such submissions the least i can do is checking arguments for validity and completenessmy focus is networking and increasing travel and trade and interaction that is the view i want to add to the csm discussion
i express my confidence in erik hell make a great csm and continue the work ive been doing the past year
anyone can stand on a soapbox in the street and trumpet their desire to make life better for everyone to cure what ails us to produce winwins and to otherwise make happiness fall from the sky like rain this isnt limited to the csm either  were pikers compared to rl politicians thing is even if they do mean what they say they cant generally deliver yes its possible to have everyone gain from a change but a lot more frequently someone gains and someone else loses the gains can outweigh the losses but you cant carry on blithely unaware that there are people who will suffer a loss because of the change you propose this is why its fundamentally false to claim that youre trying to let everyone play the game they want because when the platitudes end and the policies begin youre not you cant you cant even increase the isolationism offered to players without affecting other people because youre withdrawing the new isolationists from interactions they would otherwise have engaged in and that would otherwise have benefited others you say im being too specific but im just pulling out one example of many there is no issue where you can propose a change that does not harm somebody and you cannot call those changes simple isolationism with a straight face bears have simple tastes much of the time but their desires will inevitably come into conflict with the desires of others as for the overarching issue i think we agree im entirely for players organizing to have their voices heard and this seems like a decent vehicle for doing so im not trying to derail isslers attempt here im just trying to make sure that everyone understands what it will actually look like at the end you cant get what you want without stepping on the toes of others at least to some extent so be aware of that going in if this party is to succeed it needs a clear agenda and a clear understanding of how it will enact that agenda and what obstacles it will face along the way you will never get unanimous support for anything nontrivial and you will not be able to enact that agenda without serious opposition understand that prepare for it and while you may choose to use pithy slogans in your communications with the outside world never make the mistake of using them inside your own head you are not making the game better for everyone you are not meekly asking to be left alone in a way that doesnt affect anyone else and you are not making it so that everyone can play the game they want you are advancing an agenda that you believe will help the game as a wholeor if youre a jerk that you believe will help you personally but there will be casualties along the way and they will fight you thats not to say you shouldnt try  on the contrary i fully encourage you to do so  but please go into this with your eyes open too many negatives in that sentence for me to be really unambiguous so ill just state this cleanly everyone has a right to advocate for themselves their play styles and their preferred gameplay changes to the best of their ability i may dispute your points i may disagree with your goals but i will never dispute your right to fight for them as best you can to the best of my recollection the only people ive ever attacked for speaking on these boards were obvious trolls  hell i tend to give likely trolls the benefit of the doubt this isnt about whether isslers crowd can speak up its about what it would wind up looking like when they do
do mission runners make enough isk its arguable on the one hand you have the average level 4 runner who makes shedloads but on the other hand you have the l321 runners that make virtually nothing in comparison id say hitting the people who run these lower leveled missions would be unfair perhaps a good solution would be to remove t1 loot from missions but replace it with higher quality salvage this would increase the price of t1 fits at the cost of lowering the price of salvage higher t1 prices would probably equal higher mineral prices too  youd get a healthy multiplier on the other hand what about the newbie mission runner if t1 prices increase too much the risk occurs that he is priced out too easily the idea of a liberal party is a pipe dream for myself personally so let me not repeat the assertion maybe when i can go for a csm position in my experiance carebears do not stay carebears forever  theyll eventually branch out into industry mining or pvp  its just that some people do this quicker than others
isnt this the other way around a liberal party would work towards social engineering and protecting carebears a conservative party would be based on having as little intervention as possible or is it just in the us that liberal groups work to protect everyone from themselves and conservative groups want the government to get its nose out of everyones business
agree with op
completely agree with the op we need our blazing flashes of light on the battlefield it just completely takes away from the feel of a hotdrop or any capital event for that matter without a spectacular flash announcing our arrival

hmm lets seewhy shouldnt he have his obsession fulfilled because its against the rules rolleyes yeah as if anyone in here plays by the rules all the time ofc depending on the rules i dont think everybody here uses exploits or so  he asks nicely at least
you guys realize with the current rules for highsec capitals if ccp were to make an exception for them and we all know how eve hates ccp playing favorites and move the titan to highsec he would either be forced to jump it out or never be able to log in with a single war decyou cant dock titans and amarr cant have control towers let alone capital ship arrays anchored being in space in a capital will mean you get it moved to lowsec i know chribbas not serious about the request in any way but i have a feeling some people think this could actually happen
thats why it should at least be brought in as a monument
highlighted important stuff
pretty muchyou should see my minmatar and gallente standings
the nag defiantly needs buffed not sure if i agree with your solution but something does need to be done the nid on the the other hand is a great carrier and even if cpu or base hit pointsbase cap need tweaking i again dont like your solution
worst dread ever build make it 457 change his bonus to rofdmglvl and you will have a nice dread like other races and btw do you know that a tempest have a smaller range than a domi
the numbers are in  with all skills at level 5 the naglfar spits out more damage than any other dreadnought right now as it stands with artillery and torps it packs about 345 dps presiege the next best being the revelation at about 340 dps with autocannons it packs about 435 dps vs the moros 425 dps assumes all level 5s and empmultispecantimatterthe downside is that it does indeed more skills than any dread and has the worst tank of any dread hence my recommendation that all it needs is an extra mid more cpu and better cap but that is my opinion and its a modest change as it doesnt screw over people that are already skilled for the naglfar ie myself the improved cpu and cap allows for damage mods to be fitted in the lows without losing a permatank and without having to use serious faction gear too outside of siege  permatanking in siege is nigh impossible doable but you kill resists doing it unless you have carrierlogistics energy supportif it was made to 3 turret slots with 5lvl damage at level 5 the nag would then do 480 dps with autocannons but only 310 dps with artillery just throwing that out therebut yes i still agree principally with the base argument  minmatar capitals should all be shield tanked at the very least with comparable ease i personally think that the extra training for both capital artillery and citadel torps is an adequate tradeoff for the best dread damage in the game if only it could tank as easily as the other dreads
that my friend is a good point that i had not previously considered by my own logic id have no choice but to support the notion that ships entering regular space from wspace through a wormhole would not appear in local until a wspacelike condition had been met  if someone made a specific thread about that id give it a thumbs up
the entire reason you dont show up in wspace is because it lacks communication devices that are in known space and cause you to show up instantly
supportwith a caveat that directional scanner needs a severe rework including autoupdate just like the overview and the ability to slave it to station sensors while docked for grid info
of all the players in this game the chinamacro farmers are the least likely to be bothered by endless monotonous constant directional scanner clicking for inteland for us legitimate players well we hate your poorly thought out idea
i already said there wont be the need for constant scanner clickingand even with real time scanner update its already a big step plus to being able to gank them
this would be a huge boost to small scale pvp no more of the silly hey local is 2 ok lets undock 50 people
that would help in my eyes the whole problem of isk farmers in 00 its already annoying enough to fly through your space to see macro ratters everywhere add delayed local and bring some risk to those macros i approve just for the plain fact that i want to pop more macro ratting ravensnighthawks 
why you people never search for a previous version of the same threadit was stated by the developers that a auto updating scanner is not a acceptable solution as 50k scanners updating every 23 second across all of eve with all the information gathering that they will do will add a unacceptable strain to the server with consequent lag crashes and so on from this point on it is my opinion not some dev statementlocal is the system intelligence toll that has the least impact on the game performance it was possible to remove it from wh space as most of the time a wh system will have a limited number of people in it so even if they are all using the directional scanner the impact on performance is manageable it you have 2 20 man fleets in a k space system with every one of them hitting the directional scan every 2 seconds and getting several hundreds of signals the lag will be unberable
ive spent a decent amount of time through the years in both 00 and empire and i definately support this i do believe there should be some sort of intelligence networking built into the game though seems strange that in rl now we can share intel across multiple fleets but in the future this is resolved to text or voice comms i also believe that nerfing down the localintel would lead to a more specialized intel gathering network and ultimately shrink empire sizes all of this i believe to be a good thingi detailed a bit of my idea for an intelligence network here though some of it is outdated with the newer scanning systems i guess i should write up a new proposal
i tentatively support this idea however i agree with a need buff to scanning tools so for the moment it does not get thumbs upone idea that may contribute is to tie this in with system scanners on a pos the current system scanner is essentially redundant since in home systems there will be many ships in space many of those idling in a pos perhaps changing the system scanner to show local in a system to the sov holders and their allies would help with this rational would be the scanner automatically scans and updates local with all the pilots in spacethis would retain the intel aspect for the home defence who reasonably ought to have an advantage where is concernedhowever simply changing this would introduce a significant imbalance to the setriment of a hostile roam therefore buffing scanning tools would be required as well perhaps a transponder probe could be introduced the mechanic being that when deployed it searches for active pilots transponders in the system as a whole this probe would not be a locator as combat probes currently are but while deployed by a fleet member would allow visibility of local to a hostile fleettwo seperate mechanics that need to be balanced well and ultimately allowing visibility of local to both where the benefit to pvp is concerned it removes local from systems without any sov unless the parties involved use a transponder probeactive scouting would be more essential and probers more common in fleetsjust a couple of ideas and maybe not the best but something to throw into the potzos
a simple scenario to demonstrate why this should not be proceeded withyou have a mining op going on in an ice belt with 10 people an orca and a rorqual you have scouts out and all is well you think you are safe and that you have prepared well but all of a sudden 20 covert ops force recons black ops etc  appear from nowhere and you start screaming as your well planned and executed little op gets torn to piecesmuch puiblic ridicule is heaped on your shoulders by whoeverpodded and annoyed at being bounced you scream at the scouts where was my warning and they yell back we saw nothingthen it dawns on you logonski by one character covert cyno and you were stuffed and despite all your preparations you really stood no chance what so eversmall problem perhaps anyoneuntil an instant scanning system is implemented that warns of hostiles in system and does not drive people to distraction proceed no further
i do support this for reasons allready stated in this thread if ccp improves and adds more scanning mechanics of course
refer to my post above and it is possible to see how some changes could balance this out arguably it would be foolish to carry out mining ops in a system with no towers with a tower and sov you would gain a warning from local as you currently dozos
i agree with this local needs to be changed either to have it show blank unless someone has typed or a 30 second delay at least
yeah
this is why you need ships in your op to protect your mining shipsit would mean you need to be more on your toes instead of having a scout 2 jumps down the pipe to give you warning it makes the game somewhat more exciting then sitting there watching your mining lasers mindlessly and without any worryits 00 space it only makes sence local should be removed from game completeley
supported  except we should have delayed local in all space
sounds like a plan
with the proviso of some much improved scanning interface oh god yes please do this as soon as you canat the very least to 00
you need to read that again more carefully what the devs said is that the current directional scanner on autorepeat is bad for the server this statement was in answer to a just put an autorepeat on the directional scanner suggestionobviously the number of possible resultsparameters the onboard scanner produces in auto mode would need to be reduced among other changesedit this is what was said 
more importantly  were not proposing an autorepeating scanner only a buff to combat scanning and or probesa wise man once said you want to find someoneuse your eyes
im not sure im understanding you correctly here but with a delayed local every ship needs to have the innate ability to acquire this intel in circumstances mainly limited by range without having to deploy anything fit any additional modules or spam button presses this ability should come from the onboard scannerdeployed and fitted equipment should only serve to enhance that ability
which is why i said we also need a boost to onboard scanners and combat scanning probesthe two go hand in hand boost scanners and probes  nerf localspy
the problem with that is the extreme boredom of sitting watching nothing to scout for hours its the most ed gameplay ever simply speaking in such a situation attackers have all the advantages and no drawbacks attackers dont have to wait and lets not get started on cloaks that would be extremely overpowered in such a place all you do is force the few that actually live in 00 to get a iskmaking alt in empire along with the rest of you it would be fun to run around in my recons in 00 but no way am i gonna do any ratting or mining in such a scenario then ill stick to missionsthe only way removing local would make sense is if there is some sort of replacement tool for local that would give some of the same info
heres an idea because ive been thinking on this for awhile if we were to come up with some science skills relating to communications networks and interfacing that would stand as a nice compromiseit would be some extra lvl vs to train but the idea is only the people with the right training can manipulate the commnetworks to use them for intel eh the bonuses could also extend to anyone they are commanding in a fleet this would allow small 00 corps to have one hackerscout to watch local while he plays he keeps the gate campers and sentinels informedjust throwing it out there
very intriguingid like to see someone expand on thisreading the back stories on fluid comms always begged the questionwheres the comm hackers
yeah im thinking that with two lvl vs edit two lvl vs not counting the prereqsmaybe a maximum of 50 names can be displayed on local even if they dont speakthis  a boost in strength to combat scanning even if its only nominal would be very nicei had some other ideas about actually hacking commchannels but i dont think ccp would ever implement them even if the skill requirements were insane
imo any skillbased solution will just mean an additional required timesink everyone will train the new skills and well be back to the current situationi believe the solution to cloaked ships is to add a cloak signature to scan results no range or direction just a presence in system maybe the visibility of this signature should depend on the size and type of the cloaked ship and its range from the scanning ship or probe
wellno because if you lower the bonus enough to say 10 nonspeaking people shown on local and you make the prerequisites hard enough then even if everyone trained up it would still be harder to see who was wherewhile the idea of cloaked sigs is novel it would have to be impossible to pin down any of the signals  or cloaking would be pointless i still think there is probably a skillbased and or modular solution
how about only having no local in conquerable space
yes please
how will those 10 be chosen seems a little arbitrary and how hard would you make the prerequisites do the high prerequisites stop people from having capshippilot alts this will just become another item for the alt marketin any case even just 10 showing up will completely negate the delayed local effect as a ratter will still safeandlog when someone shows up in local and a scout will show up in local to another scout or fleet etc everyone will either have trained those skills themselves or have a local alt in the same way as the current falcon alt maybe the cloak sig would show up at some relatively short range without giving up the direction and that this range would vary with the ship size and type this way makes the standoff cloaked recon possible but makes close approach risky
this is what was proposedreal time scanner updates if that is not a scanner on auto repeat it is a scanner in constant use or it will not be real time there is nothing obvious in this so you want to reduce the information you get from the scanner and remove local at the same timesome other nice idea
simple scanning sends out a ping you can passively scan say 3au and actively scan the 14 or whateverso when you scan you can also be pinpointedproblem solvedso those covops exposed themselves scanning down your position
not supported
i wrote about reducing the amount of info from ships scanner when in automode this seemed obvious to me to allow it to work in real time over ranges of several au and not overwhelmingly stress the server the manual scan may retain all its current functionalitygood idea adds some complexity to the scanning system
for those who dont know i recently lost a kronos worth roughly 5 billion isk in mods etc its my choice to fly it and i really enjoyed flying itafter the patch before everyone knew about the hp bug and the server seemed suprisingly stable i decided to take it for a spin as i had done many a time prepatch i jumped into a reasonably sized gate camp but nothing i wouldnt be able to tank as i decloaked none of my modules appeared to activate i was then instantly put down to 10 armor at this point i didnt know what was going on so i hit fraps to rewatch afterwards i managed to fraps for about half a second before my ship popped and although the graphics showed my mods inactive a armor repair cycle went through boosting me to about 70 armor a second volley popped me instantly the fraps shows clearly that just 2 zealots were actually firing the larger ships didnt even have time enough to lock methis kronos has 8084 resistances on everything and i thought i had been doomsdayed at first i quickly posted the mail and apparently 2 zealots were the only thing doing damage to me my kronos with 7k shield 9k armor with 80 resistances and my structure 10k with damage control had been melted by 29k damage from 2 zealots only 2 volleys for themluckily for the guys who popped me the best stuff lived including 2x centum atype lars and vizans eanm i petitioned and quickly received my ship back but of course minus the mods that livedthis policy has been in place a long time and ive never challenged it because quite frankly its never been worth the effort but ill be damned if i wanst gonna try and challenge it hereanyway to cut a very long story short after 2 weeks of escalating petitions i was given the finger this policy is ridiculous isk is something that takes time to make in eve and somehow ccp think its reasonable that a victim of a bug they admitted was their fault should lose 3bil isk because what they dont want to take mods off people who should never have gained them in the first place if ccp make a mistake ccp should fix the mistake i know if i make a mistake in eve i have to pay for iti have to live with the fact i suffered a massive loss to ccp but in the future i want to see people getting anything they lost back because were all paying customers and why should we take a hit because ccp fcked upi understand that perhaps it would be very difficult and time consuming to retrace those modules steps but at the very least the person who lost the ship due to a blatant bug should get the market price for that modules placed back into their wallets i dont think there are enough legitimate losses to seriously affect the economics of eve by doing this but regardless i think something should change

i sport this
im sorry but to be blunt i really dont pity your situation first off you went into a gate camp and got roasted alive im going to guess it was 5 v 1 and your complaining that two zealots blew you to bits claiming it was module lagright i can see why ccp wont even if you didnt have the claimed module lag im pretty sure you would have been destroyed you tried to solo pvp and got destroyed over it yeah you totally deserve reimbursementin my opinion the policy doesnt need a change no support isaac
thisto be honest ive sat here staring at this post several times trying to figure out whether this is a justifiable proposal or notand honestly i keep coming to one conclusionwhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaseriouslyi get the fact you flew your fancy ship into a gate camp and lagged outbut there is absolutely no way for them to detect a disconnect its just not how tcpip infrastructure worksfor all we know it could be the jerk down the street downloading a ton of torrents on your isps bandwidth some nut case plowing into a power line or a moron tripping over a cat 5 connection and quickly plugging it back inall of this over a shipyeah sorryim sure if i flew my freighter into a gate camp id be screaming toowait i wouldnt fly my freighter into a gatecamptankable or notbecause its a bloody gate camp
are you stupid  do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the face
lol you are for real or you were born that stupidlearn to read my halfbrained friend ship was reimbursed because ccp admitted it was a bug and the issue is something totally different what ill leave that to you or ask your parents  maybe they can read and translate it for youanyho signed for actually getting some rules for reimbursement atm its totally random stuff sometimes people get ships even including caps reimbursed after the battles ccp never reimburses fleetbattle losses amrite where in clear documented cases including fraps there is no reimbursementso not only ya need to make clear when reimbursement is possible but what can be reimburseddrake draconisminmatarshadow cadreworlds end consortiumyou sir are also stupid and your reading comprehension is that of 5 year old
hey for all we know this could be just a cleverly crafted argument all because someone was asleep at the wheel
trolling weatherman
no ccp gave ship back because damage recieved server side was 2700 wheras actual hitpoints of his ship were over 25000 and thats not including resistsi guess ya never lost battleship to claw in 2 seconds by being onesalvoed next time stfu and dont make fool of yourself
moderated weathermanin anycase i happen to fly heavy assaults and id like to see the killmails to see what those zeolots were packing i severely doubt that it was all due to lag as hacs are well known for chewing through anything larger than a cruiserif the case of the bug is true good for you in getting your ship back but nothing else here makes me think the reimbursement system is bugged or in need of worknot supported
i pity your loss but im not really sure what ccp can do here either they remove those modules from the hangars of the people who picked them up  hardly fair to them  or they open a loophole you could drive a truck through whenever a bug opens fly officerfit ship into combat lose officerfit ship to bug drop officer gear get officer gear reimbursed suddenly you and your enemy have made 3 billion for a few minutes work if you can come up with a solution that works better than the status quo im all ears but i dont see what it would be
probably not paying attention eating chillilasagne full of leeks least you got the ship back  pity about the mods
wow i must have touched a nerve by the way because you reported drake i feel its my responsibility to tell you i reported you sucks doesnt it now that we are over that little humpi see what the op is saying and agreeably ccp should have rules on reimbursement although im of the opinion that reimbursement shouldnt happen at all because it could be just as easily your fault as it could have been ccps fault but i dont suppose you would mind maybe having a suggestion of what those rules could beisaac
he probably doesnt and i still havent heard him explain how he takes on two hacs alone all bugs and lag aside marauders arent exactly made for solopvp
i agree with this statement if you do allow both sides to get a copy of the modules youl have people exploiting it eg you get your ship popped by the glitch and than have your offline corpmates log on and recover your items giving you 2 sets i do not support this unless ccp devises some system to track module ownership and fraud once this is in place i will support changing this policy
right now ccp is not aware of hp bug and frankly i am also skeptical since i didnt encounter it myself and have not seen other people showing impossible killsif your kronos died to a single frigate maybe 2 frigates then wed have serious evidence of something wronganyway if you hope to get your ship back you first have to help ccp identify the bug  if it exists without that theres no ground for reimbursement
supported but dont get your hopes upi asked about this at last years fanfest and it doesnt look to be on the horizon
would be nice
supportedim a caldari ship only pilot and this is something sorely missing
i can see the rails on my vulture just fine i dont see the problemseriously though this has been requested more times than moist things in game and still even after all the graphics upgrades updated effects theyve not devoted any time to it sad really
yes id like to see this in ccps next major patch
o might support box dont let this issue die make ccp hear us
sad situation yeah but i doubt anyone at ccp will give a flying f about it
we could really use this one
if youre transporting a skillbook youre doing it for someone else this wouldnt change thatalso jumpclonesyeah somehow i doubt thatkind of like how you were too lazy to come up with a real argument probably the only valid argument in this thread though i have a little bit of faith left in ccp that they havent gone that softsupported for why the hell notedited for potentially huge isk sink
says the pot calling the kettle blackit is a lazy mans featureand today i came that close to agreeing with youbut your smugassed remark turned me offme thumbs downhowever ignoring said persons argument im open to injection only under strictest of conditionslike the fact you can inject based on the fact your going to meet said prereqs within the 24 hour skill queue timethatis rational and sensible
umm nodont see the point of injecting a skill you cant train for months maybe if you can only inject a skill that you will be able to train after your current skill ends
based on the skill queue being created to allow someone to effectivly train their characters when they can only log on perhaps once a day at a restricted time and whereas the inability to inject skills without prereqs prevents this goal from being completely met i support this idea there really isnt a bad side to it other than the confusion that might come from someone injecting a book and not knowing that that doesnt give them the ability to use it until its trained this can be prevented with a simple notification window when injecting a nonprereqd skill informing the player of such
actually jorah cores have and always have had a sensor strength of 40 dss probes got theirs hacked from 20 to 5 the reason a result at 2 au on dss and 2 au on core is the same now is because 2 au is the minimum for a dss but 8 times the minimum of a core despite having 8 times the strength how an advanced variant of the probes with an expanded sensor suite is beyond me  by the numbers someone just took the regular core sensors and adjusted them to look farther resulting in an increase of range for a proportional decrease in strength thats not advanced at all thats bogus a strength of at least 10 would make sense for an advanced probe with that rangebasically dss probes are longrange cores and theyre not very desirable at all because of this huge hit in fact theyre even worse than cores since refining a scan is impossible with them not hard impossible dss are supposed to be the specialized exploration probes while cores were supposed to be the crappy doitall probesand yes i am in the hard sciences thats why i said no scientist in their right mind with that said i think it is fairly agreeable that astrometrics would fall under the socalled hard sciences an experimenter will only throw out a data point if it is very clearly not the same result and its value and error range does not overlap or coincide with any of the other values and their respective error ranges by a certain marginnyah the flip side of your argument is also applicable what is the reward for players that train hard to use the explorationspecialized probes right now jack and s and jack is stuck in wspace
longrange cores is about the reason yeah try scanning stuff out in a 200 au wide system and tell me cores are up to the task if youre in big systems and want to get a result without some exhaustive and irritating searching use deep space probes do they need more use theyre narrow but exceptionally good at their niche i say i wont bother with astro 5 because im not a serious scanner people who are will likely get enough use out of itand the 8th probe to justify training it
thats just it though scanning a 200au system is easy with cores easier than with dsss systems that large have widelyspaced middle and outer planets and its not hard to set a few cores to 816 au around each planet or the inner cluster of planets and scan each area one at a time since no cosmic sig is more than 4 au from a warpable object  unless such things have changed the main advantage of dss probes was that they could easily scan the more dense systems with relative ease  systems with 812 or more planets packed in a 3060 au radius dss probes allowed you to get a fix on the approximate location of each result  about 105 au so you wouldnt be scanning different results with higherresolution probes as you were trying to get fixes on eachstill you leave my questions unanswered why is an advanced variant probe specialized for exploration particularly en masse effectively no better than the standard basic probe aside from increased range  and worse due to the inability to finetune furthermore how is the game mechanic justified in only using 4 probes to calculate the final accuracy granted more than 4 produces diminishing returns but each one still increases the accuracy of the result up to a certain point given proper and effective trilateration more appropriate term new players will usually at least train astrometrics 3 and be using 6 probes when scanning
heyas u all know ccp personel is allowed to play on the live servers as they please obviously without using any commands to spawn themselfs stuff etcbut theres other ways to get very very richthis thread is about one of those ways inside trading trading itemsgoods using nonpublic information gained trough means of working at ccp even short glances at global economy figures during database access can be enough to get very rich in the right hands and hey everyone wanna have a lotta isk in eve rightdoes this stuff get investigated it does in the real world and are there limits to how rich someone working at ccp is allowed to become in eve online tq serverid
for years now this has been of big concern to me as you can do basicly anything given enough isk u can even fund wars getts lotts of people following your cause basicly you can completely unbalance the game depending what you do with the iskand isk makes isk if you know what to buy and sell because you have real figures to work with that other people dont talking manny trillians of isk here complete market controlinternal affairs do you investigate this and are there limits
1 your obviously not using spell checker and type like 5 year old2 you have zero evidence3 you forgot your tinfoil hat4 you epically failed to troll ccpinsider trading is a term used to define the act of someone taking company information they work for and using that information on the stock market to turn a profit and making it look like they got damn luckyfor you to use such a grownup term in the context of eve is laughableeverything is obviously pubilc knowledge as far as prices go duhall you people who whine about ccp playing amongst you wheres your proof all i see is you claiming they do this and yet there is no proofseriously get a grip on reality well yaheven if they did your still not producing proof put up or shut the hell up
if you keep this up i will report you for harassmenton topicproof ccp ceo made public statement when the whole t2 incident went down that they will allways play on the live serversthats enough to know that they are on the live servers and they are making isk for themselfs in eve the question is how much isk and do they use information they gained from working at ccp in their free time on their player characterswe do not all have access to the same amount of information for one markets are regional resources required to construct something thats in development ccp is allways first to know way before it even getts on the test servers the most information is inside the eve database all trading is recorded its easy to keep track of market tendancys so no we really dont have the same level of information as ccpand the question is aimed at ccp internal affairs not someone like you obviously baised to believe nobody  ccp ever does anything wrong history has proven different allready hence why the internal affairs was created
yet again you rabble on without prooflet alone a spell checkergo ahead and report me your just a whiny child with no hope of achieving anything other than encouraging paranoia and conspiracy theoriesgo on now put on your tin foil hat and repeat after meccp is out to get usccp is out to get usccp is out to get ussay it enough times it might actually come trueyou never knowyep laugh of the day here classy stuff
ccp have an internal affairs department which monitors all their accounts for anything strange this is done fairly regularly and from what we saw in iceland all the staff take ia very very seriously if you think they are doing what you described please let the ia guys know and they will investigate
i have no doubt that they take the ia very very seriously but is it within the confines of what they are allowed to do affect eve on a global scale and become insanely rich are there rules that say they are not allowed to have more than 1 trillian isk random figurebecause i believe they have no rules about this at all all we know is that they are not allowed to spawn themselfs stuff
for all we know they are spying on your computer watching your keystrokes tracking your movements every single little website you visit all of your bank accountswhy the thought alone is staggeringsomeone should contact the authorities
obviously ia doesnt allow that thats pretty much a givenas oz said we have talked to ia on several occasions trust me they wouldnt let that happen ia audits all employees on a regular basis
lock threadthreadisaacps your an idiot and paranoid also this is ccps game
recent events the renaming of bob have substantionaly lowered my will to simply take their word for it that all is well move on etcwhat i woud like to see is specific rules ccp personel have to follow when playing on tq can internal affairs possibly tell us just what rules there areit still wont garentee stuff but atleast we know there are specific rules about this for them to follow so ia what rules are there
a game with a global economy where developers play on the live servers and are abble to affect the game is insane so yes we need rules for them to be allowed to play on itthis is our game that they made for uswhat are the rules their personel have to follow
then why the hell didnt you ask for that in the first placewhy come up with some stupid harebrained idiotic accusation with no proof or basis which would lead us down this stinky rabbit trail of an thread which obviously is nothing more than someones stupid little soap box demanding answers which could have easily been accomplished by petitioning or contacting internal affairs directlyor are you just doing this because you wish to draw attention to yourself and shout the sky is falling
read vistas post you moonbat
assembly halla platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar managementthe csm this forum section is the playerbase conduit with ccp what your suggesting is that its possible to contact ia directly and get a answer about this
learn to read kidyou got your answer move alongmove along
if the csm wont get them to tell us the rules ccp personel have to follow on the tq servershow do i go around contacting the ia is there a specific procedure for this to actualy get a answeri been trying to find out what rules they have to follow for ages now if any specific rules even exist ever since the ia was created years ago we havent been allowed to see what they really do
i suggest you petition your question to ccp directly or check the information pages on the eve online website
troll troll is trolling trolls uh in here
nobody outside ccp knows the exact rules what we do know is under strong nda they wont tell you but you can contact ia at internalaffairsccpgamescom if you think a ccp employee is using insider information for very good reasons the rules havent been published but trust mere there is a set of rules which every employee has to follow im sorry i cant be more specific all i can offer you is my word and my confidence on this subject i can obviously not give you any proof
i knew there was a reason i liked the fact your in csmo7  vista
yeah read lavistas post also who the heck are you to demand that ccp have rules for their game when they obviously do ccp made this game they can just as easily unmake it live with itisaac
this with a longer timer all ppl would have to do is fuel up the pos with just enough to online it for an hour or a day what ever it takes to reset the timer
this also is a problem of towers being reserved from the standings game as well the standings check is ony there for anchoring a tower so you go around in the 7 days you have good standings for and anchor a bunch of towers then once you really want to use them you can online and anchor the goodies its gaming the system because teh system allows and even encourages it thats not to say that this is right the entire highsec pos mechanics should be changed offline towers anchoring shoudl decay fueling costs should be related to standings certainly a much higher charter expense with insufficient standings the 7 day window thing for anchoring needs to change so that corps must maintain standings to keep their pos affordable howerver changing this by itself would cause other problems so many highsec poss would become unusable thereby greatening the slot shortage issue this should be covered by public availibility of pos slots with the appropriate changes that this would require this would allow intrepid individuals who did maintain their standings to offer the slots up for rent this would remove the necessity for a lot of those placeholder towers out there
wont someone just fuel the tower and charge more for the pos selling to counter any offline pos removal idea
totally depends on the costs involved
yes but it makes it go from a no effort type of situation to an bloody annoyance
within certain limits for example you can currently evade concord with black ops ships by jumping to low sec i think that being able to gank someone in high sec and then being able to cyno to low sec should be fair game black ops are not all that common and if somehow you get tackled its game overwith wormholes i think raids into empire space should be possible and allow you to jump back through now this might mean that players would have to start policing themselves they would deduce that if a black ops ship didnt attack them then it is possible that a wormhole in the system is responsible so they scan it out and destroy the pirateswhateveryouliketocallthemconcord evasion should not be an offence in certain situations other ways of evasion should not be possible apart from black ops and wormhole evasion
i dont know whether to cry at the insanity or to laugh uncontrollably
i fully support this this is what is needed to make missions more fun
justjustnono wayin hellisaac
using black ops to evade concord is a bannable offense using any method to evade concord is a bannable offense
awesome idea eve needs it imho
runescape and lotro both have alcohol consumption and you can whip out a pipe and have a smoke on lotro neither are even teen games fully supported
oh yeah seen this same complaint in america all the timestop keeping score it makes the losers feel badkm fine toughen up and grow a pair worry about your own lack of epeenishness
havent got any kills latly dont get any kills from npcs or damn sick of ur loss mailseither way to much of the eve community like kill mails u get to see what ships u killed wat was fitted and much more
this is not correct ships with no aggression timer will disappear after 30 sec if they have aggression ie have engaged a gate station can other player with an offensive module and such they have a 15 min timer before they disappearand with the new probing mechanics it is impossible to catch them before they are gone as they will not be under the 15 min aggression timer if i read the op correct we are talking ratters farming safe isk in 00 yes i agree with the op the covops cloak and ships that can fit those have got a role but when every ship can fit a cloak and become invulnerable that is just wrong imo some sort of penalty should be applied to using a cloak that brings the risk aspect into it not just the reward an agility penalty perhaps a delayed warp out mechanicat least something that makes ship using a prototype cloaking device have to take some risk we are talking about 00 space after all and it is not supposed to be safei would also like it if cloaking ships using a regular cloaking devices noncovert ops cloakscan be probed out and caught with a well skilled character it shouldnt be easy but it should be possible imoand dont get me started about the macrobot players
cloaks are already balanced and fitting one comes with penalties  no change is needed
and what penalty would that be the scan res penalty and activation delaydoesnt address the problem and they can hardly be called balanced when they make ppl invulnerable
as i told the last million threads on this subjectno unless ccp changes how cloaking and all related mechanics to cloaking there is no change needed isaacps no reason needed because i stated it a million times you have no real solution your demanding ccp change the problem but you have no suggestions this isnt the qq this mechanic sucks forum its the bring your suggestions here forum
i agree that cloaked ships invulnerability really is a paintrying to catch a ratter with a cloak is pretty much pointless any more and searching for a red in local with a cloak is simply a waste of timethe principal of extended cloaking should be limited to specific ships and while others may use them it should be heaily limited in useperhaps introduce a cap usage on activation this would be a drain of a fixed percent rather than an actual amount the rational being that a larger ship requires more energy to remain cloaked so perhaps an activation cost of something like 10 percent if for the sake of argument the duration is 1 minute then any ship using a prototype can remain cloaked for 10 minutes max long enough to take a bio however not long enough to simply wait out a searching fleeti see this as a dynamic that would nerf titans in some way too requiring them to be more often visible on grid and therefore open to attack or at least their position and alignment knownusers of covops cloaks would have zero activation cost and therefore operate as beforezos
a noncovert ship with a cloak can barely move cant warpand cant attack during the times the ship is invulnerable every other ship in the system is also invulerable to the cloaked ship balance achieved if the cloaker decloaks there is a delay before they can lock and they have weakened the combat ability of the ship by attaching the cloak that takes significant cpu and a high slot simple test take any two identical combat ships and two identical pilots put a cloak on one of the ships fit them with the best possible pvp fit with the exception of the cloak have the cloaker decloak next to the other ship and attack due to the delay in firing and the sacrifice of the cpu and highslot the ship with the cloak will most likely explode
eveonline would be a better game without local and without noncovert op cloaking devicesit would end the isk farming problem
listen to this man or forever be labeled dumbspot on
the way rights are organized period needs to be taken into consideration and better documented the sheer bureaucracy thats being forced upon alliances just to function is absurd
supported  just because itll make drake draconis and efrim black cry more
the purpose of all these is to fund pvp what the point of the game watching your wallet grow and paint dryforcing people out if npc corps does nor necessarily force them into combat  it just makes them equally vulnerable as all the other players it may cause them to pay for protection or grow a spine and protect themselves or cooperate with others  there are many options
mining in my system i did one runtook roughly 15 minutes hulk wcargo ii  cargo rigs for 17991m3 cargot2 strip miners with t1 crystals only available atmi mined in one load  added it to my small unpreocessed ie below min amt to refine from last reprocess to get170000k dense veld4509k veld2115 condensedwith my efficiency im not in a high standing station but close so it yields to 685877 units of tritat the running price of 420isk thats 28milin that one load i could have done half a mission 500k and downed 4 bs rats at lets say 500k thats 25m not counting loot and salvageso no missioning is a lot faster in terms of making iskin fact i ran lvl 4s in tandem today and did 3 easy ones in about 2 hours and made 88mil on bounties and mission time rewards this oes not count loot  salvage nor does it count the faction drop i got this was shared so count double that as my counterpart didnt do much in the missionsbut this is getting off topic so ill stop here
what about people in major alliances creating freighterhauler alts to do all their important logistics work with 000001 risk factor instead of 01 that they would get with war dec00 logistics is already safer than empire since alliance people in 00 never use stargates only jumping between deathstar pos and then they hide in noob corp for the empire side of the businessnew players also benefit from getting early exposure to pvp if they grow old in eve without ever leaving safety of noob corp they become weak and too content with the carebear lifestyle without realizing what they are missing outthis game shouldnt be too easy and we should accept that this game isnt for everyone the weak must adapt or be greifed into quitting keep eve community healthy
you people are utterly stupid beyond all reasonits truely sad you cant see any further than the end your damn cannonget a freaking brain and try to figure out why this proposal gets shot downeveryfrakkingsingletimeoverandoveragainsorry trying to drill it in for emphasis
oh im fairly certain this will be a no go as usualon a side note drake i see you here so much when do you find time to actually play
grinsi have multitasking vand yes i am on just ask develdrinbroke in my new orca today as to your comment on the threadthis is the same song next verse number 100000000youd thinkpeople would figure it out its a nowin situation you favor one side its unbalancednpcor pvp you will never reach a conclusion without compromising the other
true enough while there are ppl who abuse npc corps there are also ppl who have legit reasons for being in them i spent a while in them myself when i didnt have net access at home cause i didnt feel it was fair to a player corp to sign up when i didnt know for sure when i could play had nothing to do with the fact that i dislike pvp for the most part the only reason i offer ideas to some of the things i reply to is that i have a habit of trying to see things from bothall sides of an issue not always possible but i try hell some of the ideas ive posted have been along the lines of a random what if moment i know they wont necessarily be good ideas but i float them out there for a response and feedback hoping that it leads to an actual good idea
so basically your way is the only way to play the game nice do you even realize what an unmitigated ahat you sound like sadly probably not this is essentially a whining rant against people who have already left npc corps  they just keep alts in themon a side notesince griefing is clearly against the established rules of the game if not the eula and is a bannable offense well be expecting your resignationbanning imminently for advocating its usecan i haz ur stuffs
i do not support this i fail to see how you can properly learn from veterans in the game if you do not chat with them the easiest way to accomplish this is to talk to the vets hanging out in noob corp chat
okfirst off i sincerely apologize if i trolled you a little to muchi would be hypocritical if i didnt respect the effort your putting into making new ideasat least you have the sense to reason it outsecondly as ive said before most of these pvp idiots fail to remember that 75 to 80 of the npc corpies are in fact alts of major alliancecorporation pilots trying to sneak around and do business they normally cannot accomplishand until you get that through your frakking thick skulls yells at the rest of the pvpersyour going to look like a bunch of idiotsjust forcing someone to do something to your so called demands is considered criminal in this gamei did not buy a subscription to this game to be forced to play by someone elses ruleseve is a game of chaos and sandbox you make your own damn rules and you for the most part do as your bloody well pleasethe moment that changes is the moment i quit spending my hard earned money on it and go somewhere elsei choose to be an industrialist so i can make lots of isk and stash it away for the day i can afford to blow gobs of ships up just by pvpin like the rest of you because the funny thing is you guys dont even get paid peanuts to do itstop assuming the world orbits around you you ignorance on the matter is obviousalso keep in mind that i do not favor the carebears in this matter eitherwe need equal portions of both pvping and carebears as you would put itit keeps the game intersting having it go full pvp or full carebears would suck
nope though it would help fight off the macros it makes it too easy to grief ppl
this is easy to fix just one toon account1  new players shouldnt be forced to do anything the moment you force someone like me anywhere  i kick back in this case stop paying2  realize what they are missing cmon you cannot be that selfcentered pvp just is not for everyone most of you are too young to remember elite but eve does the best job of bringing that game into the 21st century please not everyone wants toneeds to play your way the game isnt easy the learning cliff takes out quite enough people now as for greifing people into quitting hmmmm i believe ccp has an answer for that no
so what your saying is you want to cut down on the funding of pvpyoure not very bright some people dont like playing the game the way you do just like in reallife not everyone likes to do the same thingso get off your little pedestal and grow a spine and learn to deal with reality
of course yes losses have to hurtthanks i dont need appreciation from an isk farmersure so go back to wow or hello kitty online or go dress barbie dolls whatever makes you feel good just dont ruin the only decent pvp game

quote of a moderated post weathermanalso i think you may need to take your tinfoil hat off im not in an npc corp to address the rest of your rhetorical spin nothing about npc corps makes this wow there is still plenty of pvp to go around im sorry youre not getting enough industrials on your killmails  taking that out here will get you a pat on the head and ridiculei for one dont really care that you dont like npc corps ccp isnt going to just penalize people for not wanting to spam up the game with even more 1 mancorpsgo wardec some macromining corp and stop wasting your time trying to sound intelligent
plays an online game to grow his wallet avoids interaction with other players and never pvps  yep thats your typical npc corp farmer
except im broke in game from losing a ship in wormhole space in pvp i also founded my own corp i was in an npc corp for quite a long time not to make money you sniveling rat but to learn how to play the gamesome people are slow starters bumping this moronic slagfest wont change that nor your paltry amount of support
this game is built on greifing people some to the point of quitting ccp are themselves the biggest greifers in eve because 9 out of 10 new people who try play this game get so bored or frustrated at what ccp forced them to work with that they quit the game without ever getting into it then there are thousands of players who quit routinely over the game changes ccp introduces with patches or because of the negative answers they get in petitionsand if ccp wants to keep their game from turning into wow clone they will continue to encourage greifing separate the weak from the strong no single player or corp has caused more greif to players than ccp
7 out of 10 people agree your full of oh you dont like it when i make statistics up on the spotsez you  o p
the ability to import and export fittings is a great idea but i think there should be an option that would allow you to specify an export format that eft or evemon can understand because right now it only exports as raw xml which is pretty much useless because none of the fitting utilities use it
signed
why is the onus here on ccp to fix it let the eft people learn how to read xml
agreed this is something they need to fix in eft not in eve eve has the ability to export and import its own fittings so they can be shared with whomever you choose that is enough ccp should not be responsible for tailoring the game to 3rd party tools
two specific issues directly related to current scoop mechanics1 when you command some light drones specifically warrior iis to return to drone bay often 12 will try to return but for what ever reason they dont stop mwding when they get into scoop range and as such they will orbit in and out of scoop range while continuously running their mwds its a minor issue but it adds a lot of extra time and attention to achieve what should otherwise be a relatively mundane task getting your drones back into the drone bayto solve the issue which seems to be a relative recent bug would be to simply fixchange back what ever changes caused this or to simply make drones turn off their mwds once they are in scoop range most times at least some of the warrior iis do this just make them all do it2 the second issue that in my opinion is tantamount to a flawed drone scoop mechanics and which seems to cause more headaches then anything else in this regard are the current sentry drone scoop mechanics the issue is prevalent in carriers but it defiantly affects several other shipsclasses of ships as well the issue is especially noticeable in pos sieges when your sentry drones for what ever reason wanderdrift several kilometers away in various directions and can take several minutes to fly after to scoop them all the other option being the continuous scooping and redeploying of sentries to keep them close often this extra time flying after them if some all get out of range cannot be taken and one is forced to either abandon or leave 1020 mil worth of t2 sentries in space less obviously in the case of t1 sentries the issue could be fixed easily enough with a 50100 ms return velocity for sentry dronesa third issue less directly related to drone scoop mechanics then the first two issues but in some respects related none the less is the issue of sentry guns aggroing drones in low sec its fair enough that drones are freely targeted and killed by other npc entities specifically rats but rats also tracking disrupt sensor damp apply ecm fire defenders and neutnos cap all these issue affect various other forms of weapons systemssentries on the other hand apply none of these tactics against players and their weapons systems they do none the less target and destroy drones often in 12 volleys all this seems to do is limit if not remove dedicated drone boats from gate and station camping in low sec dont get me wrong people still find ways to very successfully camp gates and stations they just for the most part rely on nondrone boats to do thisdrone boats are by their very natures balanced around the use of their drones just as other types of pvp ships are balanced around the use of their weapons systems why specifically limit if not remove the use of dedicated drone boats near gates and stations and none of the other weapon typesi could see issues with gate camps supported by posed carriers with assigned fighters but maybe in the case of fighters continue to have sentry drones shoot them but it seems i hate to use this term unfair to limit the use of dedicated drone boats and only dedicated drone boats at gates and stations where the majority of low sec small gang engagements take place
what purpose would this serve how is this possibly worth considering in any way npc corporations are the default none anyways that you end up with a chat channel you can completely ignore is just a side effect
no for many of the reasons already stated on the other hand this gives me an idea
issler dainze  voice of reason candidatewebsite soon tmeve online forum thread soontm
firstly i would like to wish you luck in your campaign i voted for anhk in the last election as i think she did an excellent job in the first term and seems to have done so this time round as well in regards to this section of your manifesto i am very interested to hear your thoughts in this area as i too would love to see that come into play in eve please feel free to contact me in any way you see fit about this or simply post your thoughts and ideas here
confirming i will be voting for this candidate d
hello eriki created the csm chat channel for this very purpose and the third csm is welcome to use it to keep in touch with the playerbase i agree with your viewpoints on informing the players of csm activity but i am currently drawn between you and dierdra for the csm vote i only have one votethat being said i am against the concept of a party in any political system let alone eve if take care is an ethic rather than a party id be all for it as i tried to implement that very concept in csm2keep up the good work and i wish you the best in the upcoming election
i have to concede that despite corporate differences i would certainly vote for lark as he at least has an idea of what he is talking about and appears to have some kind of vision insofar as to the role unlike some catoninetailsi have read your blog very kind of someone to make that for you and think your ideas are well thought out well presented and balanced good luck with it lark i for one hope you make itkrasedited for spellingbeer does that
i would be happy to see someone representing mercs on the csm but alas i dont have the time to do so mahselflarkonis what you gonna do for mercs
helloafter taking some time to reflect on comments both in forums and conveyed directly about my proposal for a political party to represent the players often described as carebears i have decided to run for the third council for stellar managementi will be doing this to guaranty that the proposed voice of reason party will have a candidate in the elections i will be driving party focused dialogs to establish the core tenants of this political organizationat this time i have not formally submitted my application for the election but will complete that in time to comply with the deadlinefirst steps now will be to establish the party and develop the political process to create our visions these early steps will include1 creation of party forums and website2 establishment of the process to join3 establishment of the party planks4 a virtual party convention5 preelection activities to raise visibility and participationother early activities will be creation of logo and selection of a slogan for the party for this electioni want to make it clear that other candidates can join this party and process if they commit to the part values if prior to the election we determine that the party needs to field a reduced set of candidates or even a single candidate i support the idea of an election as part of the virtual convention to select the candidates the party will vote for i will gladly submit to another candidate if the party determines that this will best represent their interests in the csm processso i hope many of you will join me in this new experiment in eve politicsissler dainzeceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordcsm ii memberfounder of the eve voice of reason party
issleri agree with you in the call for a party and as my colleague ankhesentapemkah has already pointed out above  the call has been heard and take care was formed did you have a look take care is a promise to the voter  give us your vote  we will use it well and we will even tell you whycontinuity  not conservatism but using the methods which were found during a term also in the next term take care delegates need not reinvent the wheel in the councils next term we have a network to communicate to pilots to the council and eventually to ccpefficiency  we are offered a supreme opportunity of participation by ccp in building the best game universe ever take care will make sure that council discussions are aimed at one supreme goal  put the voters voice through to ccp discussions and conflicts must be fought out with that one thought in mind that an issue entry needs to be shaped for ccp to understandcommunication  i know from my own experience how hard it was during the first term to reach information about the topics which were discussed in the council thanks to take care i had a competent partner who would not throw incomprehensible minutes at me but explained what essentially was going ondialog  take care does not make an end to the eternal fight between industry and piracy we keep the fire burning in fact we turn up the heat i enjoy mining outside highsec a lot more because risk is involved more than taking a position towards industry take care takes the position of the moderator who makes sure every voice is heard who understands the need to shape an idea which is in the end put onto the table of the council and has a chance for a majority for a better game i agree very much with herschel yamamoto in that point  take care is a platform to let this conflict be discussed to let it be discussed by many many pilots and to build a strong position from that discussion which can be put onto the table of the counciltake care party for eve csmedited for layout
im with you issler at least insofar as it will not effect the freedom that makes playing eve so great i would be excited to support a canditate who would for example help push the already discussed sov changes that might encourage alliances to be more inclusive to peaceful players that would be a change that would benefit the game in the long run by forcing more interaction between players that is really what makes mmos so great in the first place if thats you im on board
why are you posting a campaign advertisement in a thread about the formation of a separate party

and this is the man running our alliance cripes3 vuk
any progress on this
very soontm instead of just soontm im affraid
well thats something i supposethanks ankh
i love 90 of the updated effects but i have to agree you fumbled the ball on this one ccp give us the womf the omg the brown pants time that these vessals deserveplease
the old one was alot more dramatic
even if i cant watch it devour the amarr system
i would understand them saying flat out no if we asked for it next week but we can wait we just want them to start work in it how long it takes is no issue as long as the current poss get the job done but at this point its like they are ignoring poss and how bad they are in favor of new stuff i do understand the importance of new content but ccp do need to think of all the players that end up running all these poss they said that they would like sov mech and poss to be addressed post trinity and we have seen nothing changedif anything all i and a lot of others want is a simple answer if not today then when will our stick poss be replaced with something that looks like a player owned station and when will you quit disappointing new players who get excited about seeing there first pos only to be let down with the junk in space that it is today
yes i bashed into their heads that there should really be an interbus station to at least fix empire standings on the pirate ones they were very vague but said they would like to see some mechanics that allow it dont expect anything soon for them though faction standings really need to be dynamic based on game events imo it makes no sense to have them fixed like this
supported i would to fly minmatar caps but with the current broken state of them i abandoned the idea in favour of another racezos
what the nag does the lowest damage of all 4 dreads by a large margin maybe its because its 6am here but out of siege damage what on earth are you talking about im completely lost
awesome idea and much needed traing to switch from nid to hel is painful
minmatar ships are made from trash and should also have trash weapons
nope this is in eft with all level 5 skills the main reason that the nag does so much better than other dreads is that it uses four weapons instead of three 2 proj 2 torps and an extra slot for the siege mod its the only dread with 5 highs i did not in that instance throw damage mods into the mix that is only the ships themselves plus weapons  max skills across the board as well as topdamage nonfaction ammo i did not include the siege mode damage because it is moot  all dreads get the same damage boost from siege modehowever as i was writing that i redid it with siege modeand the dps results are the same using longrange turrets the nag takes the cake at 2497 the rev is a close second at 2470 although lack of need to reload may make that better the moros is kinda sad at 1998 and the phoenix is  poor at 1955with shortrange turrets the nag again wins at 3163 moros in second with 3088 revelation with 2823 and the phoenix again loses with 2127 one torp swapped for an ion siegeso yeah the nags damage is not bad per se you just need to do 23 times the training to get it better than everyone elses and even then your tanking ability in a nag is awful in relation to other dreads thats all im saying  weeps at the sorry state of minnie caps
the main reason the nag is terrible is because you have to fit damage mods for both guns while a phoenix or rev can throw 3 damage mods on and it applies for all their weapons the nag throws 4 on and only 2 apply for each weapon the 4 weapons are completely negated by this fact and the fact that only one of the nags bonuses applies to each group of weapons where as the phoenix and rev have two for each gun the moros has one and the crazy drone bonus throw in the fact that faction crystals are easy to come by and last a long time and its easy to see why the rev is the bestthis is of course assuming best case scenario setups as most alliances realize how bad the nag is and just brick tank them
yes please
systemnetwork scannerspersonally i would prefer something linked to sovreignty as a system scanner if sov level then you can anchor a module at a tower make it a big powercpu module so it cannot be on a deathstar and make it fragile then you can have a small gang attack the module offline it and then go on there merry waysov 1 makes people in constellation appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishessov 2 makes people in constellation appear instantlysov 3 makes people in system appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishessov 4 makes people in system appear instantlythat way if you hold sov space you get some protection
what protection is local an arbitrary list of names how do you know if player x is in a recon or just sitting in a shuttle somewhereyou use the scannerenhance the scanner scanner sends out a 10second cycle ping when its opened and the window can be made smaller in fact if you remove the local window that people have up separately you instantly have room to place it from there on you can have 2 options active and passive scanactive scan sends out a ping which signals itself to other players running both and active and passive scanpassive scans are useful when cloaked in a covops you have a more limited scan range say 50 and you cannot activate any weapon groupsmodules while in passive modean option to steal from freespace is to have a scanner able to detect a hostile configuration which can determine if the ship on scan is set positive or negative based on standings i dont see why this isnt the best solutiona players that have these vast empty systems and rely on localalts to be afk monitors on hostile fleets now will have to defend the space they claimb covops can still do recon missions in which they were designed forc mining ops still have that level of protection you just cant afk mine solo in yor hulk without at least watching the scanner occasionally for a blipd there is still a mystery especially if the other person is beyond scan range having a full system scan range negates the purpose if hostile configuration is implementedthis option keeps your intel tool that requires some level of intelligence to use it removes local allowing some mystery and not the instablob of some alliances when you want to come down and have some lovebest of all it makes black ops useful
no
so after removing local you give less informations if someone dont use the scanner actively see that as balanced and think that people will not use it actively dont work that way you will get some new player doing that error but the largest part of the people will be pinging the scanner constantly and you will be still giving less information on a passive scan less than the current scanning system and less than active scanremoving the information gathering system can be some pvpers wet dream as they think to get tons of kills that way but the results will be more blobbing and less kills as people will become even more paranoid and stay in high sec not the reverse
i am strongly against itthis will not help pvp it will get some poor random sobs jumped while mining or ratting yes but actually finding a fight with your enemies will be made harder since you cant tell reasonably quickly where hostiles are unless theyre literally on the same grid as you arei only support specialist cloaked ships not showing on local while cloaked thats fair if you want to sneak up on someone get a sneaky ship
are you intentionally trying to be obtusethe autoupdating directional scanner does not need to see anything but manned ships there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have realtime updates on unoccupied ships asteroids wrecks pos structures and all the other crap that the current directional scanner can scan for all of that can be left for the manual scan that will presumably be left as a subfunction of the new ships scanner
there is no pvp in wspace cause there is no local there see
hes already gotten his ship back along with the destroyed modules hes asking for people to get the droppedie not destroyed modules back in future as well
dang that lucky eri lost dozens of multibillion battleships in pvp and i never petitioned themso ccp officially acknowledges hp bug they have to if they agreed to reimburse can we got some official bug hunter or ccp to confirm
i would really appreciate it if people actually read my post this wasnt about getting reimbursement and it certainly wasnt lag i didnt mention lag in my post at all i said that 2 zealots killed me in 2 volleys under 8 seconds and ive taken on far bigger camps and lived maurauders for anyone who actually has an iq are perfect ships for pvp they have an awesome bonus to both damage and tanks and the only weakness is ecm atleast in the kronoss case as i have already said i do not expect reimbursement my case has already been declined but i think that things need to change for the future
pyramid quoting is not allowedapplebabeare you joking this post is ridiculous and you are actually stupid let me put it this way the maurauder has 9k armor 80 resistances and with t2 aux nano pumps exile booster and the reppers it repairs 2719 armor per repper or 5438 armor every 11 seconds wow at taking on 2 hacs what was i thinking and just for the record i have fraps of me taking on 15 or so hacs and tanking with ease i can upload if you want me too
this isnt the forum for showing off your internet  that would be crime and punishment that said tanking 15 hacs with a 3000ish dps tank sounds like one hell of a feat their drones alone should down you also dont post gm discussions publicly  its not allowed
dangit herschel ya beat me to it that just goes to prove go to work for 8 hours and the whole universe changes while youre gone basically see herschels post above  for the reasons why this will never work unsupported
say is this something i should reportyeah i think i will
has anyone from ccp confirmed existence of hp bugbecause if its real its a game breaker
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
killmails are bugged especially damage dealt in fact i dare you to find one correct killmail since the last patch i see you are claiming hp bug but since ccp denied your request and you cannot show any evidence logs can be modified and one second of fraps is useless there is no reason to believe you i know you are super leader of triumvirate but i have killed some very efamous people and they ed and moaned about lag and dropping when that clearly wasnt the case would like to hear from the people who killed you since they have little reason to lieas for getting your modules back lets think about this shall we by using the petition system you know that petitions especially reimbursement petitions are not answered immediately in fact they usually take a few weeks if you escalate them what happens to dropped modules in a couple of weeks people sell them of course so do you yank the module from someone who legally bought the module no you have to reverse the entire transaction now consider the module changes hands multiple times now you have to reverse a chain of orders and screw up a lot of peoples walletsassets i think you can see the problems that this will cause another what if lets say your corpum lar dropped when you died due to a bug in the game and i loot it i put it on my kronos i get killed in a legit manner a few days later and it drops again ccp grants your petition and all modules now they either have to yank the lar from someone who fairly got the module in a fight or duplicate the module you also run into the situation where if you recovered your own loot with an unaffiliated alt and got your ship back youd have another corpum lar out of thin air from ccpyou might think it is worth it for your super expensive marauder to go through all of that but with a standard t2 loss it is too much work and we cant have different treatment for different people just because they lost a few more expensive imaginary pixelsnice little tri threadnaught you got going on here its cute 
no they havent i have been in plenty of armor based combat with session changes and have not noticed any problems i have noticed that modules refuse to online when i first fit them but anything can happen and strange things have happened on tranquility plenty of timesif there is evidence of an hp bug we really need to get that narrowed down asap as that would be a show stopping bug
well the bug has been fixed now but as an extreme example we noticed that just after the patch our titan which was at the time cloaked in a safe had one hundred 100 armor hpanyway this thread really isnt about the bug or reimbursement for me but as deva said a call out for a clear and fair reimbursement policy for the future i dont really see why people dont want this how many people have had petitions that have been succesful then petitioned again with the exact same problem and it gets rejected there is quite simply no consistency on ccps part
i have reported your post as it is once again off topic this isnt about tri or me so please take your bitterness towards us and throw it out the window read my entire post again and actually try and understand what im saying this is no mail bug and i got the ship back
while i can see how this works in a 1v2 battle how does it work in a larger battle where the process of obtaining your loot may cause several other people to lose their ships doing so only to then be denied the loot because the original destruction was a bugyes its a bug yes it sucks but unless its an exploit i cant see how you can justify the amount of time it would take to come to a decision about what to do in x situationyou certainly cant give isk as well as the modules what if an ally scooped the modules free isk what if you then knew how to reproduce the bug more free iskalso you petitioned and quickly received your ship back  after a patch even  wowkeep in mind that with every loser there is a winner and when you lose something to a bug you can thinkknow its a bug but the minute someone loses their loot from someone they killed it will be for certain a gm acting inappropriately
i agree it would be difficult if not impossible to take back said items from the players who have them but if the servers show clearly there was a bug i see no reason why ccp cannot simply give isk as a means of compensation to that player think about the isk lost even in a fleet battle in loot it would probably come to no more than 12 bil even in a battle of 100s of people unless someone fitted pimped gear that ammount of isk being given back to players for their loot wouldnt make a dent in the economics of eve but it would be fair which is really what i would like to see if their logs dont show anything then fine but for the blatant bugs such as mine where yeah within 24 hours i did get the ship back i should also get everything else back again i am not asking for reimbursement now but merely using my loss as an example because its the best one i have
signedsucks losing a ship to a ccp feature good luck recovering
if a bug is identified as a bug and reimbursement takes place it has to be complete that would be bad for those who benefited from the bug as theyd lose the modules but when did ccp ever allow those who took advantage from a bug allow to keep it especially not since it even fits the exploit rules when i shoot something that goes pop so easily that i should know something is amiss i would have to petition it myself even if it is to my disadvantage at least that is what the rules say when i last checked
this is a toughie on one hand i agree in prinviple that its a tough loss which should have been advoidable howeveri assume you have been playing a while and know the reimbursement policy if that is true you should be aware of the tough stance ccp take on these reimbursement issues and also you should know that as soon as you undock anywhere your ship and mods are at risk either due to game mechanics desynclag ecti remember a while a go i undocked in a pod during a war dec black screened long enough for my pod to go pop losing implants this was petitioned falling on deaf ears  but i accepted it grudgingly for me travelling in 00 and low sec in a faction fitted ship adds to the adrelenien so with those thoughts and the difficulty ccp have for tracing and returning lost mods i cannot support this although i do feel for your loss and for that im sorry to read what happened
thats exactly what i mean though i knew the second i saw those mods lived i wouldnt get them back but ive been far too lazy to fight the cause of full and fair reimbursement because ive never really lost anything of high enough value to botherbut i think its something that should be changed
i would support a fair and standardised method of reimbursement by the gms and on those accassions where a esculation happens a more human approach is adopted by the gms rather than them applying rules1differantly to differant people2in cases where a exception can be made based on sound judgement and if the situation warrants it my main gripe with ccp is applying rulings unfairly and differantly to differant players if your op included a reform of the reimbursement policy and procedure to include my points above  you will have my support 
signzored
since so many morons fail at reading even when the op repeats ithere the storyship goes into gate campship dies and drops modsccp reimburse ship and destroy mods but not the drop modshere what the op is requestingthat drop mods also be return to the owner of ths ship in a case that ccp does reimburse a shipi dont see any logical reason not to support they dont have to take the items from the people who loot the wreck just give the person all their stuff backthis game is already eats up a lot of time losing a few billion to a glitch that ccp is willing to reimburse for got to suck
if the proposal read likei recently had a ship reimbursed after i lost it in a glitch they did not reimburse the billions of isk worth of modules that dropped from the ship however this policy should be changedi would have supported instead of that he wrote a two page pityparty about losing is fraking kronos if he wants my support he can clean up his main post or maybe the halfdozen posts in response to dissention that sound like this are you stupid  do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys shocked and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the faceim not stupid for thinking a marauder cant tank two hacs solo anyway neither is isaac main poster is a rude jackass and i havent seen any evidence to support the claim that ccp wouldnt reimburse the modules from a bugkilled shippersonally i think its generous they gave him anything
i support this and ive been wondering why its been this way for some time my friend used to fly a typhoon in lvl 4 missions and it looked like he was giving birth to missiles at a rate that would make rabbits jealousi dont see how this could add too much effort to the cpu as we can already turn off a lot of effects the only thing that would complicate this issue and not by much mind you is finding where to put the things on the already small ships such as a rifter the line of effect should be easy for the clients to calculatesigned
agreed
its one of those things we all just got used to and to a point accepted but that doesnt make the request any less valid
i have been wanting something like this since 2003 i guess pi mean the icons of the launchers even show how they could look just put it in allready
needs looking at explosion velocity is ridiculous
definatly supported the numbers say it all and cit torps are just pathetic currently
so i trained a phoenix a few months ago the moment it was ready i hopped on sisi and started pew pewing and realized that the missiles go about 1kms and cant hit anything that moves for any damage at all the ship is so laughably bad that i sold the charactercitadel torps need a big boost for both the phoenix and naglfars sake its really pretty sad how awful those dreads are compared to the others
i quote this and remember the thumbs up 
the concept of a physical skillbook that must be transported makes no sense and adds nothing to the game
theres your problem  the within 4 au mechanic has changed stuff can be anywhere now meaning that a rack of cores isnt enough also its not worse in any meaningful way because its not a choice between the two you can scan with cores or you can scan with ds and cores nobody scans with just dsat least not after this nerf you find it to 2 au range reel your ds probes launch cores and finish the job adds about thirty seconds to your scan time as for the fourprobe complaint i think we all agree its unrealistic i just dont expect to see it change because then theyd have to rebalance everything from scratch
deep space probes are still useful for quickly canvasing very large systems for exploration sites if you want to visit any of those sites you can easily switch to exploration probes and get to work just because the deep space probes are no longer the be all end all of scanning doesnt mean they are uselessit was a good nerf
a only using four probes ensures that scanning is about placement not ting out as many probes as you can and throwing them around a hit i like the lack of clutter thank you its hard enough to see whats going on with four overlapping probes nevermind 8b what youre proposing is basically making scanning easier its already easy to scan down stuff if you were to double the scan strength of dsps allowing you to scan down sites even faster then youd need to make all signals harder to find youd either just raise the skill cap to explore with any decent measure of success or make exploration once you hit astrometrics v incredibly easy
i can support what the other delegates in the csm with me have said i would also like to point out that it makes no sense that the developers would sacrifice the game they know and love for the epeen of saying i have 3 trillion dollars ccp is a business and as such it runs by rules to ensure the game continues to move smoothly
it is a good thing that ccp employees play the game because it is the best and only way to ensure that they know what the game is all aboutit is a good thing that they do so on the live server because the test server is not a true representation of the actual game environment since it follows a lot of different rulesit is logical that they make isk for their characters somehowit is also logical that they do so based on what they know as long as that does not include using exploits they cant avoid knowing things after all you dont expect them to drug themselves thick and dozy every time they play rightyou have to trust in ccp ccps internal watchdogs and the csm to keep a watchful eye on this if you dont it makes no difference anyway because if ccp actively tried to smash the game theyd succeed with or without your trust with or without controls even if it just meant to go bozo on the server blades with a fire axe that would be pretty dumb though after all eve is their biz not just their hobby
im gonna believe they have rules for playing on tq  its a damn shame they arent public thoim sure they woud never ruin the game they worked on so hard however they might think its fun to get rich and wage wars on tq if even the ia team thinks its fun for them to wage wars we got a problem as it can get pretty unbalanced to fight someone with near unlimited iskim into pvp a lott but i dont like putting a lott of efforttime into beating a enemy that has unlimited resources it is why when the t20 thing got out i started to put very little serious effort into evechanged from a 10 hours a day pvper believing everyone can be defeated to a pvper that plays a few hours a day casualy as the person ur fighting might be one these ccp guysquestion is  is it funallowed for them to wageorganise wars or notand from what you have seen are they into that stuff on tq or is that nda aswell
you do realise that this forum is for the bringing of ideas to the attention of the csm and not ccp internal affairs rightdamn you fail
well done
are you a shareholder or something ccp is a privately owned company so no they didnt make the game for you they made the game for themselves and released it to the public in order to create profit that they even listen to people in order to improve the game and thus their profits you should be thankfull for
cripes another mm loser that believes all the propaganda his leaders spew outget it through your tinfoil covered head ccp is not out to get everyone and there is not a great ccp conspiracy on tq most ccp employees have no idea how the market is going to react to changes just like the rest of us any sort of blatant market manipulation based on insider info would be easily caught by ia

youre under the impression here that concord is new edens police force its not its the carebear defence league  if you shoot a bearone that isnt stupid enough to reflip a can or similar at least concord comes to smack you around its not supposed to be balanced its not supposed to be fair its supposed to be a deterrent backed up by the banhammer such that the bulk of eves user base can play the game in relative peace and that will never ever change get used to it
good god no
i value pew pew as much as anybody in this game and maybe more but i still groan every time i see i get rid of concord thread i realize this is not precisely what youre proposing but the bottom line is concord exists for a very important purpose just because you need to get your pew pew fix doesnt mean we should be able to evade concord if you part nonconsenting under prepared riff raff from their ships just go to wspace
ccp makes industry a fulltime training job someone who really wants to explore the industry side cannot train the skills to keep up with a pirate you want to remove their protection just so you can have easier access to easy targetsyou wouldnt happen to own a van that likes to sit outside elementary schools do you
i remember a long time a go it was possible to outrun concorde specially when ur mine exploded in 00 whilst you were out and abouthowever it was decided that breaking concorde rules was punishable by a ship loss and it has become a exploit if this was somehow advoidedi fully agree with the current mechanics and do not support the op
hell no
itt op doesnt grasp the concept of concords wtfpwn setuphow about concord pods and can nullify your clone contract in empire corp stations
not supporting thishigh security space it is high security for a reason namely the protection of law abiding citizens those who break high sec laws get punished if caught just like in real lifeif you want pew pew then stay in low secnull sec or declare an empire war
i want to be ablr to collect exotic dancers and open a strip club when we get corp storefronts
how old are you try being constructiveedit just checked your avatar ingame and you are an obvious troll you have barely been playing five minutes and i doubt you have got any killmails from shooting mining lasers at roids
as i said at the start the people that are against do not really offer any good reason as to why we haveneed kms if people really need to keep a record of what they do then why not just fraps itas most people seem to do anyway if you want the enemy setup then scan the ship if you want stats then keep a diary do any of you remember when ascn lost their titan the first titan ever made did you need to see a km to know it had been popped the answer to that is no
actually several good reasons have been given 1 it makes sense ingame that people would look at the wreckage to see what exactly they killed2 its a game people like keeping score3 the game should do that kind of monotonous recordkeeping for you not demand that you do it yourself 4 tracking corpmate performance to help you improve their play 5 tracking corporate performance for the purposes of creating a clear and unambiguous combat record which can then be used toeg advertise mercenary services 6 theres no good reason to remove them its fine l2p also i know i dont use fraps  doesnt it utterly ream your system performance my computer isnt exactly the fastest machine on the market it cant handle another highneed program while eves running besides expecting players to be forced to use thirdparty tools when the firstparty tool already exists is silly
signed for the counterargumentcloaking is a balanced mechanic as it exists in the game you cant find them but they cant harm you and if they try to harm you theyre doomed the exception of course being stealthrole ships since that is their purpose to hide and lie in wait and ambush but compared to similar ships theyre still weaker combatwiseyes cloaked ships are impossible to scan down the cloaking device bends all electromagnetic radiation around it seamlessly rendering it invisible to any form of detection while it is cloaked its sensors are offline as well so it is not emitting anything that a probe would pick up on since it is far too small to register passively on magnetometric and gravimetric sensors
i was watching the video of revelations and in the background of space you can see thousands of stars in a narrow band seperate from the basic background stars all around you these are the stars that we can travel to in game and that we see when we open map it depicts the stars all around us and its so neathowever after revelations ccp no longer has the map stars visible in the background just the basic background stars are visible i am wondering if they can put them back into the game because seeing the stars in the background as you play helps with immersion i think i wonder if they removed them from view because they created lag or why dont they have them visible in the background anymorecan we get them back visible again maybe even add in the thousands of stars we can go to via wormholes too that would be neat to see as you look around your ship in space
to me it sounds way more logical if all the ceos had to vote for some important decisions such asdisbanding allianceinvitingkicking a corporationhell what about simple introducing shares of a sort this way the guy who started the alliance can decide if he likes a vote system or not
im for the pvp community i hope to represent them at best of my efforts 
sounds wonderful but what specifically are you in favor of
frankly i would not feel comfortable with small gang pvp in your hands
thanks for asking gothar there are a number of ideas that i personally like include looking at group dispersal weapons both modifying the existing ones ie smartbombs and launched bombs to make them more use able and the creation of new types such as chaining weapons one of the key areas though that i feel could benefit the small gang pvp group would be an in game record of intelligence gathering allowing the fc to better track what is going on outside of his own vision i would like this to be integrated into the map so a commander could at a glance see the disposition of potential enemy forces assuming he has scouts in the area obviously this would benefit large scale pvp as well but i think the effect it would have on small gang pvp would be extremely beneficial obviously this wouldnt replace the old tested methods of voicecomms and a pen and paper but it would supplement it the long outstanding issue of transferable kill rights if implemented would also help to increase the opportunities for solo pvp and am very much in favour of this issue and would hope to be able to raise it again with ccp i feel the concept of bounty hunter subcareer would not only fit right in with the feel of eve but would open up exciting opportunities to those who like to spend time gather intel and finally strike at the moment they think is right the issue surrounding it that would be problematic in my eyes would be the old clunking bounty system which at the same time would need an overhaul beyond these areas i think that factional warfare could do with a change to decrease the benefit of large numbers of people in a single plex capturing it although that ideas isnt fully formed in my mind how it would work and therefore i cant go into much detail right now these are just the ideas that have captured my imagination so far that have been bought up by various people of course and if a proposal is put up in the assembly hall that would benefit the area of solo and small gang pvp it would get careful consideration from me if i were to be on the csm well thanks for the input anyway sak please feel free to give your reasons so the other people reading this can be aware of your concerns and better come to their own decision
i like your ideas and may vote on you good luck in the electionerem
heartstone bunyipthank you for closely reading my op and let me give you a few thoughts regarding the two topics you were touchingsandbox and factional epic warfareour positions are very much related heartstone and i can see where you are coming from jades plea for more pilotstoryline interaction is among the most captivating ive ever read and using fw as one possible vehicle to flatten individual and erratic influence onto possible storyline branches is quite clever still as we stand today the sandbox is too imaginative factually decoupled from the games foundation ie the plot anyone still remember why we have fw its war stupid and isk is the least original incentive for player activityon the other hand sandbox and storyline impact present two economic challenges to ccp  how to balance gooning which threatens effectivity of investments and how to offer content with as little man power as possible  one part of the solution and very much web 20 in that regard is to let the players create content and the second is to give them choices  not too many choices for man power reasons  and make sure the choices depend on many pilots rather than one that is why i advocate two ideas as my very own agenda  tradable kill rights programmable npcsthe former might one day replace concord and the latter i see as a major milestone to boost the sandbox into a new dimension  it will bear a sister to the playerdriven economy which is the playerdriven mission system it will link wis to space and it comes for almost free for ccpwe should cooperate heartstone and make sure that ccp shift their focus accordinglya party is a party is a partyand then again bunyip  it is not look at it as a mechanism to make the communication pilots  ccp more efficient ill give you three examplesissues are not always risen by posting on the forum let alone the right forum which is the assembly hall the mass of pilots is using their network of friends to communicate and exchange that is where the idea of our party network kicks in  having a csms ear everywhere thus many good ideas will not only be discussed on an alliances forum but also picked up from the perspective of a councils member who knows how to work with the issue until is gets presented to ccpsecondly the csm has rules which are written and then there is the unwritten governance regarding communication within and to ccp having the party as mechanism to assure forwarding of experiences from ankhesentapemkah to me will bring continuity into the discussion between csm and ccp not so much in terms of evas personal favourite issues to be continued but knowing how to deal with people that will allow me to start at full speed and give both csm and ccp a predictable read reliable team player in the end this is to the benefit of pilots who will turn to me to have their ideas representedthirdly and just mentioned as a pilot you will want to find someone to get your ideas through to ccp nothing more teadious than now having to convince the csm first before ccp reads your idea take care has a clear identity in addition to the above said professional yet less tangible aspects  small industry  gangs roleplay balanceif you as a pilot have an idea in this area take care will be your addressee and your voice to ccp
introductionmy name is weazy and im running for the csm i thought about doing this the last two times and basically assumed that the people who would run would be representing the majority of eve online players however through following the progress made by the last two councils i would be neglecting my responsibilities as a player if i did not run the bickering pointless arguing and general neglect of the playerbase has led me to believe that the people who have been in csm have done a poor job making any noticeable progressbioplatformfirst and foremost i am a pvper i dont mine i dont rat i dont plex and i dont build my only occupation is 00 combat both small gang and pos seizing i am under the impression that eve was designed to be a combat environment with a secondary emphasis on everything else i currently fc for the dara cothrom alliance in cloud ring where i run ops daily in all combat situations defense roams pos seizing and gatecamping i am not a pirate i do not grief new players but i spend my time in eve as a human wrecking ball over the last few months i have observed the shifts in pvp tactics from an fc and combat perspective and think i can provide ccp with valuable insight as to how combat in 00 works and can be improved im not signing up to run because i hate falcons or think amarr is overpowered im running to represent the so far neglected voice of combat pilots who have always adapted to flavor of the month combat and will continue to kill because thats why we play the game i have been playing eve since 0707 and run three accounts with my two mains at around 30m sp each i have been a member of many 00 and high sec corps and alliances including bruce daco pure and others i have experience as well with high sec mission runningt1 and t2 productioninventionresearch and am well versed in the carebear arts but i have enough isk so i dont need to manufacture any more my toons encompass all four races so i am not partial to any in particular i have led fleets to all ends of the universe and my favorite type of op is of course the small gang roamreal life infoim a 23 year old student living in the southern united states i attend university with studies in a broad range of topics ranging from history to computer science summaryif you vote for me you will be voting for someone who really enjoys combat and will work with ccp to make it as fun as possible i have many ideas to bring to the table and know i can make a contribution to the combat side of evea vote for weazy is a vote for pew

hello allmy effort in the campaign as a csm will be focused on pvp let me introduce myself my friends call me leo or ruri i am 24 and study business management at university currently in my final year i hope to set up my own wine importexport business soon when im not out or studying youll probably find me online on evemany players love this game because it offers the most fun pvp out there in the mmorpg selection out there my focus will be directed to interfacing with the pvp focused community and to make that voice heardarguments that will be discussed with the community will be matters such asthe current sovereignty system how can we make more fun and less boredom warlow sec loss of sec status rebalanced make low sec engagements less demanding but keep empire safeish without limiting access to someone just because he popped a couple of shipsrevise the bounty system to make a bounty hunter profession viable where assassination contracts are handed out between players playercorp a hires playercorp b to kill player c no point in assigning me a bounty so that i can pod myself in my clone with no implants to collect the bounty maybe the contract could specify variables such as if ship kill or pod kill required maybe if ship what classfrigbcbs capital etcwreck ownership if you kill something and a third party steals it flags the thief to both wreck ex owner and aggressoravoid corp hopping schemes make it so that if someone joins a corp he cannot un join for a period of time 35 dayswork and talk with community and devs to find a way to let players that in the sandbox choose a purist pvp a way to survive purist missioners make loads of money purist miners also a pure pvp char will have many more costs but substantially less rewards this needs to be rebalanced also links in the next point of t2 efficiency over price vs insurable t1 what point is there in having many solutions and many ships when they are not viablework with ccp to find a way to give small hacrecon gangs a game play more enjoyable maybe not bring nanos back but find a way that gives small groups more choice of mobility in engagementdisengagement what i would like to express in this point is the difficulty of groups of skilled players to be effective a 50 mil sp char on a hacrecon vs a 12 mil sp char on an insurable bs should take in account not only the sp count but also the cost of utilizing a 250 mil un insurable hacrecon or a insurable bsalso a discussion on the surrender war option to make it so an official contract is accepted by the ceos of the two corps where an item exchange section is displayed and a safe time in days is displayed so that the cessation of the war is mutually agreed by both parties the winners take the agreed cashassets and concord can sanction the contract by saying that for x amount of agreed days the winning party cannot declare war again before the end of the agreed contracti hope i can do my best for my brother and enemy pvpers so that we can all stay in this fun place and keep enjoying itplease send me feedback and talk with me my voice is yours to useleonardo dalessandro  ruri dant
question in what way do you see the establishment of a political party as having any effect in a nonbinding advisory body such as the csmyouve indicated that you put some thought into doing this and im wondering how this will actually matter what are you thoughts madamedit apologies didnt see the party post before putting question here if you like you can direct your response there
i looked and i dont think that the party referenced was anywhere close to succeeding in gaining support the fact i had to have someone point me at a thread outside the forums that were used for promoting candidates indicated to me that the party was not viable in the form it exists nowas to the stated vision of the take care party i believe that the party should decide if they need to reinvent the wheel the voice of reason party has no interest in keeping a fire burning we seek to assure the freedoms we believe are essential to our members within the basic tenants of eve that risk and reward are directly related and that the pilots of eve have the right to choose the degree of risk they will most enjoy that when the risks of eve are all compared that there remain a logical relationship to the rewardswe are conservative in that we believe that the fundamental principles of the riskreward framework must be maintained we are however a party that embraces changes that maintain the balance but add new and interesting elements to our lives in spacei have announced my commitment to the voice of reason party in a separate threadbest of luck to all candidates and any political affiliations they happen to represent in the upcoming election of the csm iiiissler dainzefounder of the voice of reason party
thisi vote on individuals not partys a csmcandidate can be a bear and have good ideas that improve eve for everyone without tilting the game the game to much in a certain direction that will alienate other players with their preferable game style however im 100 certain that you issler are not that person that i can trust with such thingsandas for the name im sure you thought you were clever when you come up with that for your party but for me that is just a big warning sign it reminds me of small often extreme local parties who desperately tries to get their ideas heard but no sane individual takes seriously and gets hardly any votes on election day no doubt you will get all your friends in honda accord to vote you in a second time but i hope more reasonable people look elsewherebut at least the name tickled my funnybone for a seconderemedit fixed some typosedit fixed more typos
we can pretend all we like but theres not a whole lot of leeway between carebearism and wanting to lick carebear tearsits a 01 togglerepresenting being left alone as a blow to pirates rights is a bit of a sham isnt it either one person gets to be the sad panda or the other
for reference my position on this issue is as follows there is no place in the csm for political parties the csm is meant to represent the eve community as a whole and not just a select group of people whilst personal focus of individual candidates may influence where they put their vote and what subjects they cover due consideration must be given to all topics by all csm members with as little bias as possible the idea of voting blocs parties and vote trading seems to me to smack of corruption to quote james madison the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties  james madison the federalist 10 thursday november 22 1787edit for spelling
of course there is a place for parties  how can the pilots those who vote be sure that an individual candidate will represent their vision as he might claim to do  except the faint incentive to be reelected one time for a voluntary job there is only his bio and his network which define himin addition to that most of us show their alliance  corporation in the posts would you display them if you were not in favour of their position and deem showing your affiliation to be helpful to your cause  that is whya i show my face to the voterb i think players will appreciate a csmthemed affiliation on top of any ingame referenceas for the 1787 reference of madison i tend to answer pragmatically  would we have parties if they did not do a good job  cause on one hand parties are apparently well condensing peoples opinion to an executable position and on the other hand they balance individual eccentricity to make sure the public good is not forgotten my rough estimation  more harm was done by selfcalled peoples representatives who did not have a stabilizing surrounding
not at all read the op this isnt so much to make lowsec space harder to get into than to make it a more enticing and worthy challenge as a mission runner i can certainly see this idea having legs and taking offi also see this controlling the 10 population

awesomesauce
lol why the hell not
yessss
not a very big change but i would be good if on the orbit option in the overview we can have perhaps 3 defaults set so can change range fast while in combat rather than having too bring up the box and manually swap the orbit range ie one can be set for close orbit one outside of scram range and another at the gtfo range as it is now if want to hold a gate in close before the jump got to swap to say 1k then keep remembering to change it to outside of scram range and tbh when in a drunken gang it does make for comedy deaths and missed tackles etc but even those wear thin after a while so please give us a chance to preset a few more defult orbit ranges
and support
sure
great idea
supported and id also like to be able to map the orbit range options to hotkeys
this
great idia plus the hot keys 
frankly id like to be able to have default keep at range and orbit configurable to my overview tab view since i constantly use different ones defending on whether i am mining or mission running
i like most of these suggestions yes

the numbers are in but they are wrong you are ignoring the moros drone bonus and the fact the nags damage mods only applies to two turrets eachnews flash this just in you cant transfer energy to a seiged dreadnought

1 you havent definite your less information before this post 2 most of the posters suggest a range reduction in passive mode and that is the best way to make the scanner useless3i would very much want to see other things beside manned ships for example probes drones maybe wrecks it will give me an idea what the other guy is doing cans same reason as wrecks unmanned ships if identified as such the function of a scanner is to get an idea of what is happening not simply to know there are 3 pings
oh yes wouldnt make 00 as boring
if you dont understand what weve said then just say so1 what are you asking2 read again you misunderstand3 okas to your last part its the same interface only actively scanning makes you more visable thus the ping reference
till the post 65 i cited no one has defined in any way what less information when auto scanning was i dont agree that reducing them to only manned ship is a good idea but at least it define a starting pointsaying you havent understood what what we are saying when you hadnt defined that vital point has no meaning maybe you should read the posts again suggestion so far1 replace local with a pos addon linked to sovereignty2 passive scan with reduced range3 no we dont want a auto repeating scan good having a starting point helpedthe last part mean that getting only the ships and pods hopefully is getting there are x pings targets or however you want to call thempeople need to know more informations to try to guess what they are doing so if i lose local with his friendnot friend display i need to have more informations by the scanner to compensate for example if i am in high sec and seeorcapod apod bpod cunmanned combat ship 1unmanned combat ship 2unmanned combat ship 3and then it change toorcamanned combat ship 1manned combat ship 2manned combat ship 3as a miner i can suspect i am in trouble even if i dont see that there are 3 red flashing guys in system a useful feature to add to an active scanner if local is removed is the detection of friendly transpondersie i actively scan and send out a signal all friendly blue pilots transponders reply and the relative ships are identified as allied the others simply as not identified
seeing how the 2 post about reduce range when in passive mode are yours 50 range and 3 au can you care to explain how that will make the passive mode useful
this only works in wh space atm because there are a limited number of poss up without a bazillion ships foating in space plus most wh system i have encountered have been fairly small in reality in proper 00 it just wont work
no
if youre not using the scanner and its just sitting there exactly what would it matter other than a quick glancesee you want to have everything simple and easy and handed to you you want to get a full picture of the situation without any work as you posted above you want to know for sure based on scan results if some ships are manned or not or what changes have taken place hell lets just make a huge systemwide map that shows everyones position and what theyre doingno a scanner should essentially say x ship is roughly y aukm away and in z direction with n accuracyive posted the interface will not change but if this would be a local replacement with the scanner constantly being on the main ui then unless hunting for someone actively then reduce the range and add some mystery stop wanting to play the game on easy mode
because there is people like you that want to get a easy ganker mode3 au passive range is laughable it will not detect any probe but then probably you dont want probes detected it will detect a ship that is already warping to your position and only a pair of seconds before it drop on you coupled with a refresh cycle of some seconds it mean it will miss a ship warping to you at least 75 of the timethat mean that passive scanning is totally useless at that point we return to step one mash the scan button every 2 seconds and kill the server and find the scanner made useless by lag you dont want a replacement to the local system you want what you dream is a get plenty of kills systembut the effect of a change like that would be exactly the same of the change of the probing system with kalia pair of week of easy ganking of mission runners then years of cries in forum where are all the low sec missionrunenrs force them to run in low sec we dont have targetyou will not get more easy pickings you will simply increase the number of empty systems and cloaked shipsmaybe you think that cloak on line will be a beautiful game i think it will be a total waste of bandwidth
yep i really rack up those kills oh wait you see heres where people like you have a huge problemyou say nope that wont work so instead of finding a way to fix it here and there you throw everything outheres a thought passive scan range 14 au active is 25 ausuddenly nothing changes except we get an auto scanner that broadcasts the locationlocal does nothing to prevent anyone from getting ganked oh wait thats unless you use it as a batsignal when to run hide and log outbecause when you run to station you cant do anything you cant scan where heshe is for all you know theyre cloaked and afklocal does absolutely nothing right now but give a false sense of security enhance scanning by benefiting those that want to be found and those that dontmake it so stealth has a purposemake it so hunting down people takes workmake it so theres no instabroadcast of whos in spacemake it so alliances cant take 100 systems with 30 peoplemake it so 00 industrialists have to actually be cautious instead of parking a scout 2 jumps upits a joke and im an industrialist
signedlocal shouldnt show you in any systems if your not talking
learn to read i clearly show how item duplication and ownership of dropped loot cannot always be distinguished due to alts and trading and marketcontracts report me all you want throw a tantrum whine and holler no one caresunder your idea which you have changed from getting all items back to getting isk value back and who determines the amount of isk to be given back hmmmill go very slowly and hopefully youll actually engage brain this time1 you get popped to a bug faction module drops2 your unaffiliated alt picks up faction module3 you get back your ship  all modules via petition4 your alt also gets isk since ccp refunded the items it took away from your alt that looted all the modulesget it
signet sooooooooo much signetthis policy is more then just rediculesssince you only get your ship back if it was killed due to a bug i dont see how they can let people be rewarded by using the bug which is actually exploiting this is so rediculess and should be fixed immidiatelysigned signed signed aaaaand signet p
you have records of everything in eve it is just to ran everything back module wisemeaning if you got a module due to a bug it will be removed and you will rescieve a eve mail where it states that it was a bug and therefore was removed and if it was done on purpose it would have been a exploit and therefore banneble so people complaining clearly know it is a bug and therefore wish to exploit well shouldnt need to say more
im torn on this issue as wellunless ccp can find that the items have not changed hands fitting to a ship refined or jetision i would say yes give the mods backbut the problem goes back to the logs show nothing and trying to track those items let alone the chance that someone doesnt try to quick sell the mod for isk or fit it to their shiney shipi think it could leave room open for abuse and cause more problems then it solvesthe hp bug is something i hadnt heard of before but its just that a bug and its good you got some reimbuirsedi support you in ideal but in the current devplayer relationship through petitions the time it takes usually to resolve reimbuirsment its not fesible to implement imo anyways
im with ignit on this one as well its sort of like the legal principle that the will not disgorge an unknowning purchaser of stolen merchandise i do believe certain exceptions should apply such as the wreck being popped before being looted but id be curious as to how youd redress this problem creating items or removing them from people who through no fault of their own came into possession of them before id give my full support
the problem with this is that it starts to throw the rarity of a lot of mods into question wait dark werent you the raison detre for the speed nerf in you 18 kms vaga oh screw you not supported
yet again i ask you to read my post and if you have a look at the bottom i havent changed my mind on anything i said market average value in isk is a possible option as to your exploit what so ok if it is a genuine bug then it would most likely be at random like all bugs are so in your situation you would run the risk of blowing up your own expensive items and run the risk that a you get it back and b the expensive modules are the ones that live if ccp put a banning rule on this sort of behaviour i highly doubt anyone would try it because it would be incredibly difficult to do so plus bugs are very different to exploits exploits are consistent bugs are randomall your posts are saying to me is that you have some kind of personal dislike for me or tri and you still have not fully read my opening post
i think there are two possible fixes for this either give the player isk back based on the average market price or perhaps impliment a new petition section giving it priority much like petitions filed under stuck say we call this new petition option bugged loss the player who has lost his ship or items petitions saying i beleive my loss was due to a bug etc etc the gm then freezes the items or removes them from game temporarily and passes the petition on to the reimbursement department who can then do a full and normal investigation taking as much time as required for it this minimizes the work load on ccp and doesnt  a load of people off who have shifted sold or used the modules themselves by having the items taken back the petition response generally on a stuck enquiry for me has never been longer than an hour or so no item can move very far in that time
dark i know youre smarter than this to not see how many horrifically myopic problems the bolded bits would bring in
its just a possible solution but i would be interested to see possible arguments imagine also that ccp said abuse of this system would have punishment i doubt many people who arent drunk would do it
we just need ccp to stop responding like robots and actually consider what happened and as far as i know this bug still hasnt been fixed i keep seeing it
gather the evidence and report it i consider this to be a very serious issue  yet theres not enough evidence to show that it really does exist in a way suggested in this thread a bug like that would be of critical importance to fixotherwise its just rumors and excuses by people who lose stuff where is the evidence
were playing the same game here right
drunk people will petition anyway regardless of situation or drop down options also ephemeron the only evidence i can provide could also be falsified the only way for you to really know is through a gm reply but i dunno how you get that

ive no idea if its the exact same bug but you can see basically the hp bug happening in one of farjungs old vids edit wave of mutilation 1110 in from several years back where he two volleys a freighters hull with a blasterthron theres been quite a few reports of it just recently so i dont think theres any doubt its a real bug thats not the point of the thread thoughthe reimbursement policy is horribly inconsistent theres no debating that you can submit the same request in identical circumstances and depending on the gm you get you either receive your ship back immediately or have to wade through lots of firm nos an escalation or two and then quite possibly a yesi have heard of a couple of cases of looted mods being reimbursed or duped rather unfortunately i cant cite concrete cases i guess even with a nodupe policy recreating the odd t2 mod seems insignificant to the gms i dont know what the solution is we used to have a set of implicit precedents like no looted mods reimbursed no supercaps reimbursed no ships from fleet battles reimbursed all these policies were grossly unfair but at least they hit everyone in the same waynow theyve all been broken gms take every case on its own merits that should be the ideal policy but unfortunately theyve proven several times now that theyre just too prone to ballsing it up theyre obviously overworked and with eve being as complex as it is its hard for them to hire enough knowledgeable people but something is very wrong if they cant even consistently call the headline cases correctlythe specifics suggested here on what to do about dropped loot i cant support there are too many corner cases it may not be a big deal to try to reimburse several bil in lowend officer gear fortunately isk isnt instawin in eve but there are a lot of items in eve that are so rare you just cant put a market value on them if the gms cant even notice how long an alliance has existed before changing its name how can we trust them to accurately determine the value of a t2 hac bpo looted in a bug ideas to try to freeze loot associated with suspect losses is just unworkable in generaluntil we reach a situation where genuinely unbiased commonsense usually prevails in petitions i tend to think hard limits with noexceptions on various reimbursement scenarios is the unfortunate way to go nevertheless ill support reimbursement policy being raised by the csm not because it will lead to a silverbullet solution but because it will remind the gms they have a lot of room for improvement however hard that improvement will bei know vuk campaigned on customer support in general and probably will again and has been very tough on the gms whenever hes gotten the chance but im not sure its ever come up as an official csm issue so heres a tick and lets hope it doesid also personally like to see more qa effort and attention paid to the kind of bugs that lead to these situations there are some signs thats happening but theres a ways to go yet
nice post and i have to be honest i have no quick fire genius way to fix it ive just given some small suggestions as to the kind of direction it could go but this is about raising awareness to ccp that their reimbursement policy could as you say use some improvement thanks for post
yeah so everyone can see just what our damage potiential is wait what damage potential since the nerf not like it matters right now missiles are a minor at best threat in most pvp
agree
not supporting this then people will know im in a discoraven when i warp into the bubble on the outbound
been saying we need launcher grafic for ages support
i figured that this was already implied if a skill is injected already i can queue it up until it hits the 24 hour limit of course the same would be true with injecting skills based on prereqs that are in the process of being trainedfull support here i was actually a little surprised that they missed this when they implemented the queue
fully support this only if the required prerequisites are already in the training queue
wellbecause ccp saw fit to erase all your previous scan results on each new scan the problem becomes sorting through the clutter now with core probes you have to narrow each one down one at a time to 100 so you can bookmark it even if it is a site you do not want you need to go through this rigmarole so you can bookmark it to avoid probing the same site out on your next go to find whatever it is you are looking forpreviously you still had to get some accuracy on it but did not need to pin everything to 100 to focus on something you wantedand againit is more about them being essentially the same as a core probe for usefulness yes you can scan a bigger area with one probe but so what you can get better hits with a few cores running a shorter range plopped to cover inner planets and remote planets i think the guy above is wrong that sites can be anywhere all scans i have run have all the sites within 4au of some stellar object even if you use dsp you simply must revert to core anyway so while not a big deal to call them back in and redeploy core why bother not to mention this makes it worthless to train up to l5 on the skill
this get over it
1 youre obviously not using spell checker and type like a 5 year old2 you have zero evidence3 you forgot your tinfoil hat4 you epically failed to troll ccpinsider trading is a term used to define the act of someone taking company information they work for and using that information on the stock market to turn a profit and making it look like they got damn luckyfor you to use such a grown up term in the context of eve is laughableeverything is obviously public knowledge as far as prices goduhall you people who whine about ccp playing amongst youwheres your proof all i see is you claiming they do this and yet there is no proofseriously get a grip on reality well yaheven if they didyoure still not producing proofput up or shut the hell upfixed
they might not be alone in thinking its fun to get rich and wage wars on tq after all a lot players try to do either or both and i dont think ccp employees are any differenti assume because wagingorganizing wars is part of the game and they are allowed to play the game they can wageorganize warsthe rest of your post seems to say you have more of a problem with big alliances playing eve than with ccp employees about 05  of all players maybe playing eve if your worried about getting into unbalanced fights in eve you have bigger fish to fry so to speakps even someone with unlimited resources can be defeated so there go back to playing 10 hours pvp a day
there should be a easy way for filtering local from unwanted players based on their corp or alliance currently you can only block a single characters which is avery ineffective way of making your life easier if you want to avoid entire groups of players for example noob corp playersisk spamming bots or some alliances you just dont want to read many messages in same time can increase lag but long block list can give you simmilar effect
im supporting this
im sure theres probably a good reason for this but ill wait for the parade of people to emorage on me to explain why the modules in question are sensor backup arrays and signal amplifiers taking a look at signal amplifiers between their midslot counterparts it comes out to thissignal amplifier iitargetting range 30signature resolution 15max targets 2no faction variantssensor booster iirange 30resolution 30activation cost 5 capscriptable to 600faction variantsin this case shield tankers are already juggling their mids for other utility slots such as tackle and propulsion not to mention the cpu advantage is generally lost on shield tanks given their high cpu amount the lowslot variant is less than half as effective in resolution important due to agility changes and the only benefit you have is a passive module that is vastly outperformed and a bonus that doesnt work because of broken mechanicsnow onto sensor backup arrays and eccm radar backup array ii48 sensor strengthpassive18 cpuradar eccm ii96 sensor strength12 cap usage10 secondsoverloadable to 1248in this case the module in question is once again half as effective for about 33 cpu savings and minor cap usage with overloading it becomes about 13 as effective and is detracting from propulsioncapdamage modifiersfitting utilities in sum these items as well as tracking computerstracking enhancers need to be reviewed from a balance perspective as its already one more disincentive for shield tanking in pvp
the most reasonable thing to do without any radical changes is to seed faction variants for mods that have none
now compare tracking enhancers to tracking computers low slots are allot more valuable then high slots yes those 2 mods are weirdfor the rest if you have atleast 34 mids then low  midslot
moar standings options would be good

ok first of all im not trying to say that scamming should somehow be removed or bannable if ppl are not wise enough to read contracts before excepting the terms they deserve to be scammedwith that said my issue here is the blantant abuse of spamming of scam contracts in jita local im sure i speak for many others in stating that the scammer spam in jita local chat impacts the legitamit players significantlythe solution i constantly here when ppl complain about this is simply block them well thats a fine idea however you can only block so many ppl and that really does not impact the potential buyers of the legit contracts unless the potential buyers also block them not to mention that there are only so many ppl you can blocka few ideas i have that are probobly not perfect but may help i hope others chime in with ideas and the devs take a serious look at this discussionidea1 drastically increase the amount of players that can be blocked like to say unlimited at least if only in jitaidea2 there needs to be a time limit when posting with contracts linked possibly 12 minute delays before posting another contract link this wont affect chat maybe not the best idea due to the fact that it will limit legit traders contract posting as well however it will most certainly hurt the scammers more than legit traders i believe it will also give ppl a chance to read the contracts and determine the fake ones vs the real ones and the block the fake traders idea3 im out of ideas for now you chime in on what you think may be a good solution
i agree on idea 1 the others not so much
just to clarify the 2 idea about dealying posting with contracts is intended to be towards the same person posting multiple contracts one after another although admitedly its not the greatest idea just a thought
and what is the problem with closing local when you enter jita and then reopening it when you leave unlimited block list would be nice but if it is because of server performance limitations then i would rather have better performanceeven if all the scammers and spammers were gone from jita local jita local would still be completely stupid
maybe a report spam system would be a good thing simply right click the name of the player add to spammer list and once every 5 minutes the system checks for people with more then 10 25 or 50 reports and then mutes them for an hour as punishment this could also be used in other places of course like yesterday in 49 the goons took it on themselfes to spam the hell out of local for no appearant reason i might add and it would be nice to be able to stop that without having to call for a gmthis doesnt prevent anyone from scamming but it would curb the pantsonhead ation that is currently jita local its like reading the viagraspam mails all day its not like anyone falls for them expect people that deserve it its just plain stupid and a waste of bandwidthgmtime etc
asura starfield would be displeased
how about not allowing a contract to be posted more than say 50 times in a day or maybe a total limit regardless of how long like 100 max contract links
dr eyjog mentioned it at fanfest 2007 people have been asking for it before others tried to make one themselvesan eve isk saving account  bank that people can put their isk to and receive intereststhe interest rate is supposed to be small eg 05 per month or lower so that player driven eve banks and other forms of investments can competethe isk can be locked for a certain period of timealso the interest payment can be done on a daily basis where people have to login and push a collect interest button so that they receive the daily interest otherwise the interest for that day expires this way there wont be an uncontrolled growth of isk on inactive accounts it would also motivate people to log in the idea that money generates more money without that the owner of the money has to do something is not new interests are common in any economy system receiving interest for money occurred even thousands years ago on earth even mentioned in the bible a realistic financial system that eve is supposed to be shouldnt lack it
and why dont you just put your money in the player driven eve banks
eves financial system doesnt lack it put your money in a player bank or a bpo or a better mission ship or its not that im opposed to this i just dont see the point
this
because i dont like to lose all my isk in the next big eve online scambanking requires trust and security this naturally doesnt exist in eve the bank owners can simply not pay back your isk thats legitimate gameplay no scam and you couldnt do anything against itin real life bank deposits are secured in many ways the prohibition of scam for example and finally through government guarantees in eve there is nothing alike its a big invitation to pull a scam player made content doesnt work properly in that trustsecurity based system id love to see a secured banking system
then this sounds like the issue you should be proposing be fixed not creating a system separate from the one that already exists
evading concord is actually very easyyou just dont go into systems where they patrolproblem solved
absotively posilutely not and this is exactly why carebears rely on the rule of law to run the supply side of eves economy because by and large they cant rely on themselves especially when theyre working in space in ships fitted for industrial tasks
yes while in it i keep a sniper rifle handy and practise satanic rituals i also think concord should be more easily defeated but changed so they are more like sleepers this info is the worst of them allshudder
you are still operating under the mistaken delusion that concord can be defeatedi believe its actually been said somewhere else by one of the ccp folks that if you can figure out how to beat concord its an exploit and bannablebesides i already told you how to avoid them what more do you want
ok on a corp shopping trip to jita loaded a hauler with 600mills of mods and rigs and bpos  at a jump gate in jita which is 09 sec  lag and high player count meant locked down gate  i was on auto pilot waiting at gate serious lagg  next thing i know i was in a capsule  wtf  wreck lootedchecked loss mail popped by a large smart bomb from an abbaddon battle ship piloted by a 10 sec rated player  my hull armour and sheilds amounted to approx 2500 hps yet kill mail showed i was popped with only 299 damage  the mail smelt to me rotten and not quite rightccp quoted as saying to me gm reply removed navigatorcan someone please explain to me how this was possible  how did the 10 sec player avoid concord and was able to operate in 09 sec space freely  why did my loss mail only show 299 damage and 1 person involved yet my ship should have taken 2500 plus hps i am at a loss to understand this despite me also having to explain to my corp ooops sorry guys lost the shopping any ideas
so you were on auto pilot in a little hauler carrying over half a billion of cargowrong forum and the loss is your fault 10 are punished for being in hi sec but they are not prevented
a wrong forumb do not post communications with gmsc being 10 just means the faction navypolice will chase him not concord it is possible to fight them off or tank them given he was using smartbombs he likely was expecting to be target jammed by the faction navypolice being in an abaddon he probably had a hellacious tank sucked up the damage and decided to instapop whatever he could at a crowded gate where everyone is locked outd seriously bad move toting around 600 mil in a mere hauler at the least a tanked to hellandback platesextenders transport preferably a freighter you are asking for trouble with that much loot in a haulere no idea why km was odd maybe lagdunno
lock threadwrong forum you chose to afk pilot a hauler with 600mil isk of mods stupid stupid idea btw and then cry about it get a t2 haulerfreighter and pilot the dang thing send this to cpisaac
supported as a nonsmoker dont we play immersive games to do what we cant irlalso if theres rating issues label it a healthy thing airborne medication of regenerative nanobots leaving a smoky residu trail
do we really need it my employment history is long as it is mainly due to me being a bad choice in player corporationsi would like it as some sort of option as much as i would love to cut some player corps from that list i know that wont change
not supportedany intelligent corporation that considers you an as applicant is going to want to see those changes
unless youre booted from your corp unknowingly you never need to see a npc corp  you dont need to drop corp to switch if you have a pile of npc corps in your history that says that either you dont understand game mechanics too well or that you got booted from your corps both of which a potential recruiter wants to know beside the gaps would say just as much as the npc corp entries do itd just mean that people would have to examine the startend dates on every corp swap also youd lose the ability to check character creation dates not supported
heh id settle for timely updates on what ccp is thinking about fixing then wed know exactly what their priorities are
enough talk do it ccp
boy wants mails done away with cause it an epeen stroker then trying to flame a new player for not killing enough people thus flashing his epeen around for all that cares none btw careful nebie too much epeen stroking makes a mess 
with my corp we made some testa covert jumpfleet of black ops consume isotopeok we measure the consumption of diffrerent ship for a jump of 4ly manticore  258 isotopepilgrim  3218 isotoperapier  2725 isotoperedemeer  845 isotopethe cargohold of the black ops being 600m3 of 4000 and may contain isotope consumption of covert jumpfleet was modeled on the fleet of jumpfleet of the titan  but the hold or consumption is a big problem i am not in favor of increasing the hold of the black ops to prevent abuse of all kinds  but reduce the consumption of ship is a good solution
they already implemented a supplement to this and that is with the blockade runner ship it was designed to be able to use the jump portal as well so it could carry fuel and supplies for the fleet
i support thisother mmos dont require years of trainining to make 1 character proficient in an areadoubt it will every happen because ccp would lose a cash cow
neither does eve unless of course you define proficient as super omgwtf pwnage army of one
ditto with one slight difference you can only create one personality per account but have the other slots available should you buy another
no
you have nothing new to add to the discussion you have not read or understood what we are trying to say you are just copypasting from other cloak related issues and think you have come up with a smart reply what you are adressing is not i repeat is not the issue here please read again think think some more use your imagination to understand what the op is actually saying then reply
cloak is called cloak for a reason works as intended no issue here macro miners are a problem which every mmo has changing a game mechanic to aim at macro miners will aim at legit players in general aswell we just have to live with macro miners or better hunt them down yes it is possiblesorry no easy free carebear kills for you
ah i see now its an arguement so strong and so pursuasive that facts have nothing to do with it only our imaginations can unlock the wisdom of this idea ill try hard to imagine a world where this is a good idea i really will
oops sorry i forgot to put proposal
candidacy postno website yet will update when i throw one together
i think ccp has done a very good job making 00 interesting by allowing the player base to make it what it currently is however i think that there needs to be more adjustment to make it more tempting for players to come out and enjoy it one of the major problems i think eve has is the divide between the players in high sec and the players in unsecured space one could go his entire eve career become exceptionally rich and never enter 00 if he did not want to there needs to be more incentive for people to leave the comfort of high sec for better riches and more rewardalso i think pos sov mechanics need to be reworked to make it a bit more interesting shooting down posses that are unmanned is about the most boring and tedious parts of the game i would like the regular pos ai to be reworked so an unmanned pos is harder to kill and also would like to see poses take a more backseat role in regards to sovereignty one of the things that makes the game unfun for 00 inhabitants is the fact that we have to deal with posses all the time filling anchoring transporting emptying and have people in our alliances who do only that if we could remove some dependence on poses for sov everyone would be happy i assume
rurii represent a different group of folks in eve and am running myself so i wouldnt be voting for you and i would be encouraging folks to vote for members of the voice of reson party that said i hope you will run you definitely have been committed to an important part of the eve experience the eve csm is only better the more diverse we can become i hope you give it a shotgood luckissler
i am hoping that the formation of a party will increase the visibility of the csm i also believe that while i have some ideas about what makes sense for the folks i will or whoever the party ultimately supports represent adding additional channels of communications and opportunities for participation will improve the input for this constituency into the csmthis is very much an experiment i was partly inspired to take this course after some conversations with folks in ccp about this interesting venture into virtual world politicsi am excited to see how this unfolds so id love to continue hear what folks thinkissler
ive gotten commitments from 8 of the csm canidates for interviews and hope to see commitments from more in the near future i plan to post the interviews on my blogthat said heres a link to my lead post on the subject it also contains an index of all my interviewsif youve specific questions youd like to see asked just go there and leave a comment ill update here as this progresses expect the completed interviews by the 20th of april
i appreciate the time you took to respond to my post erik and i respect your position in fact in many ways i agree with a lot that you are saying but dont personally see the need to bring in another layer of titles and names to be able to achieve it let me briefly address some of your points from my personal perspective so you  and others may see where i am coming from whether you agree with me or not i believe one of the essential things for a csm to be able to do is look an issue brought before the csm with as little bias as possible to say you ascribe to one vision or another limits your options in certain circumstances if you hold to it in every case yes there are areas in which i have opinions and thoughts for myself but i think it would be remiss of me not to consider counter arguments against those ideas for the good of the whole community i can think of a number of ideas that would be of great benefit to sologroup pvp that would negatively impact the industrial sector for example but wouldnt vote for them precisely because of this negative impact to a large portion of the player group in this instance i am not talking for my alliance i am not here to represent the views of the star fraction on certain issues i am not even here to represent the views of the roleplay community or the pvp community i was actually considering creating a blank character to run on who had no affiliations but thought in the end that such a character would be ignored so simply went with my main character personally i think this is a tautological argument we have parties in my opinion because they are to an extent political easy mode i see a certain value in them in real world politics but cant really see the need for them here i agree that parties can be a stabilising influence certainly but the stabilisation they are shifted to more often than not seems to be towards the benefit of the party than the public that voted for them in the first instance in the case of the csm i certainly dont doubt that the public good would be forgotten by anyone who wished to run as a party member my concern is with the implication rather than the current reality at the end of the day though i certainly wont be railing against those that are members of parties or those that wish to represent one cause over another i respect your position and wish you luck with it its just not for me
lowsec is already underpopulated due to the risks far outweighing the reward before making lowsec even more dangerous adaquate incentive needs to be created to make lowsec worthwhile
the tunnel was a great sight which i loved seeing jumping now is a big disappointment bring back the old cyno effect
quotin dis
im running for third csmand ill support this even if just for the lulz
nice idea especially with hot keys
i posted a thread months back about orbits and hotkeys and especially how baffling it is to see hotkeys for certain functions like lock target but nothing else like the various movement commands it hardly received any notice but no matter this one fits the bill nicely give us something that shouldve been present in the game ages ago ccp
supported
very much a good idea
this was on the wrong page saying that the 3rd csm should bring this to ccp we will see if they fair better the our current csm
what this guy saidso no
the were the one suggesting 3 au or in alternative to cut range by 50passive at 14 au is functional 3 not scanner dont broadcast the location it give number of presences in range and there are those like you that offer one sided solutions and then get all offended when people shot them down you want it changed your job is to offer functional solution i dont see much reasons to change my job is to shot down unworkable solutionsi have suggested some idea you fell they are overpowered and shot them down good you are doing your part of the job but dont pretend that your suggestion have no flaws all your argument have a value if you offer a a workable solution but most of your suggestion so far have been about removing a strong intelligence tool and giving in exchange a tool suffering from myopia
space is too small with local blaring your presencei support this as it would make small roaming gangs more validand extend it to fw space too for extra fundirectionalscanners need work though
its a change proposal if you actively scan it shows even on the passive scanner within the maximum range so if youre looking for someone you can be seen also of course this doesnt work for cloaked so instead i had a thought last night with ghost images random blips or such this would need more thought as to houw its implemented but i do agree removing local without making it possible to detect that someone might be cloaked nearby is too overpowering for covopsreconsblack ops believe me when i say im not offended and also when i say my ideas have flaws i even state several posts above that any ideas of mine have issues and need to be fleshed out a bitive spent a lot of time in wh space recently ive been a nice guy there and one thats not so nice ive harvested and hunted with no local and constandly looking at the scanner ive had a blastif you delay local in lowsec and 00 it wont change much lowsec is about as populated as a wh system these days anywaypart of removing local though would be to also remove static belts this would give your lookout if you were on an op to notify the fc if hostiles were nearbyand if youre really that worried with a few recons coming and disrupting the party have a couple bss intys and hacs around those recons will melt like butter
im so disturbed right now by how many people have 00 alliances in their name and support thisthe reality is that 00 space would be forced into becoming capship stationgames far more then it already is the system wouldnt be defendable the only people left ratting or mining in 00 would be farmers
lolwhy becase you cant park an alt 2 jumps up the pipe to see if local popsor because those superalliances might find its fairly difficult to defend that much unused space without an instant intel toolno there would be no farmers as they wouldnt be able to run and log as soon as someone enters local
you know rp reasoning for this can be used either waythis information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in localcan you explain why this has to be
oh can you imagine how awful that would be oh the horror the horrordisclaimer would not really be horrible
speak for yourselfprotip ratting can be done with other ships than lolfit ravens warping to beltmarkers at 0km and staying stationary until the last rat is dead
you must tell me this secret of awesomeness
really i doubt itjust a thought but a possible set up that will work for rattlers raven with extended probe launcher instead of cloak sure it will have cpu problems they it will not be so hard for ratting drop a combat probe max range filter ship only and smash the scan button forever war to a safespot when the probe detect someoneboring as hell but probably anyone working for a sweatshop would get a macro doing it for him and automatically recalling the drones and warping him when someone was detected it would work even for normal players too the only drawback is that they will hate smashing the scan button every few seconds
macros input commands how they respond to dynamic data is not known and cloak means noshowup thank you for finally agreeing with me actively scanning to replace local
how about thisthe people who want to keep local will have an option to always appear in local but those of us who dont want to show up in local we wont show up unless we speakeverybody gets what they wantand you have no right to make me show up in local against my will
stupid idea 00 is already too empty who the hell will do ratting or miningif they can get nearly as much iskhour in supersafe empire doing missions if this no local will be implemented noonethen who do you want to attack with your small roaming gangs possibly noone will be there to be your target or maybe another pvp gangbut because you wont be able to know their numbers for sure you can be eaily out numbered lots of them can be cloaked one side will surely bring in more numbers to achieve victory  blobbing so there wont be small fleets only some larger fleets without targets and the usuall high end moon blob wars in 12 systems thats all if you want to increase the riskwhat this proposal will do in 00 okay but then increase the gain too especially for the average 00 players and not for some rich alli leaders with moons what ccp should do is greatly increase asteroid mining income in 00 and reduce the stupid jump transfer possibilities like jump bridges also there should be possible stacionary target for small gangs like pos shootingstation service shooting for huge gangs where they can hurt the enemy even if the enemy doesnt want to fight back
 omg  so who the hell would use the show local type if he wouldnt get 100 accurate info he only gets the negative from it but no benefit
i would rat in 00 with no local chatand i would enjoy having less competetion from the chinese isk farmer  because i will kill them if they dont leaveand maybe with less farming and macro mining the prices of 00 goods will go up slightly making my efforts more profitablethe big alliance mining ops can easily post alt scouts on all gates  essentially alerting everyone of any new arrivals so yea basically we get less isk farmers more reward for real player more excitement and theres nothing wrong with losing your ship now and then when you can cover the losses in just 1 hour of farming
i will also rat in 00 with the proposed change to local chat
not supportedimo the reimbursement policy is as great as it gets dont want to loose isk  dont be an idiot and fit the ship with mods 3x its price and take it to pvp
sorry to hear you lost your shiptotally signedand for your reference just over a year ago i petitioned a carrier loss due to a bug and when the ship was reimbursed i got it back exactly as it was fitted before loosing it including all modules entire contents of corphanger and every ship in the ship maintenance array even though a lot of this doesnt appear on the killmaili dont know if the policy has change since then or if is inconsistant or down to the gm dealing with it i know i had to petition twice before getting it back and iirc in the end it was dealt with by a senior gm 
ok so darknesss is jumping into our camp i was dealing with internet spaceship drama so basically i was the sentry i was there to say hey 80man bs gang is about to jump in better vamoose darknesss comes back into local he had been jumping into our camp mwding to the gate getting away i say on vent darknesss is back in local i see nothing maybe 1min then on vent omg hes back im thinking maybe someone came from the other way then on vent wow what was he in he instapopped was he just a shuttle no the wreck says gallente elite bs what the hell happeneddarknesss warped to the gate right next to me jumped i never saw a damn thingas for the whole idea of the threadsurely he doesnt suggest getting the modules back that were dropped so he suggests getting a gm to spawn items or isk value which certainly cant be good for the economyalso think of the exploits then someone figures out how to replicate said bug with 100 success fit the most expensive ship possible have a friend kill you lewt and get gm to spawn new modules for youalso where is the cutoff can i get my t2 fit insured drake completely respawned and everything or is it just for these highprofile eve player 5bil isk kronos bugstoo many holes
this would unleash a flurry of accusations of favoritism ccp got that kenboku members officer mods back to him from a goon an didnt explain what the bug was or they explained the bug but baaahh not true ccp cheatsthe ship only reimbursement policy exists because that will be enough for new players but screw old players they should know better the universe is cold unpredictable and unforgiving
the universe should be cold but im not talking about the eve universe im talking about ccp being at fault and fixing their mistakes as for players doing it over and over again and exploiting it i dont see how its too random to and if they got caught it would be a perma ban even so im not saying my suggestion is the best way to go but merely the situation needs addressing because atm all eve is is favouritism some people lose things get everything back some get nothing back the ammount of times ive heard people who have petitioned in a fight got their ship back someone else in gang petitioned the same thing and got turned awayccp couldnt possibly be any worse with reimbursement than they are now
who needs to do it more than once 3b off an exploit is more than enough for a few minutes work
try it it would take you hours to find a worthy target in high sec then you can repeat your ganking attemps with concord killing you until you no longer can enter high secyou think youll make money
support
supportedexploiting aggro and logoff mechanics is making pvp too easy to avoid not simply because of the ctrl q at a gate but also seeing gangs log off everyone but their cloaked scout until you go awayi like the idea of a packet sent to differentiate between a ctrl q and a genuine disconnect dont know if it is possible but that would seem to be a solid idea in principlezos
should be changes yesand no it is impossible to differentiate between real disconnect and a ctrlq well that would be possible but then they would just pull out their network cable or disable their wireless or do something more fancy by letting their firewall block all eve packets
love the idea because itd look awesomenot that i think itll be implemented in the near future but oh well
yes please id like to see the citadel launchers open up from the hull on my phoenix or cruisetorp launchers on my ravens
agreed i want phoenixes with some nice launchers opening up
have you tried flying a torp raven it will even put up a fight to the most feared gallente mega pilots anyways supported definitely more shinyness always welcome
signedwould be very useful with no drawbacks that i can think of
plenty of people are signing without reading the counterarguments the skill que knocked off most plausible complaints from the skill system to go this far is just pushing it the point of not being able to inject the skills before prereqs is to facilitate a number of things 1 the skill stays a physical item until you inject it this allows you to change your mind and sell it or lose it  which to me is a fine risk for something you cant use yet anyway2 you cant do physics without arithmetic it finetunes your skillque to mainly leveling skills you already have and want to get better in which means3 you actually have to fraking sign into eve and change your character sometimesnot supported we have our skill quelets not get ridiculousedit  yeah because textbooks add nothing to reallife
i actually bumped againt this the other day let me give you the examplei was training drones v and knew that immediately following that i was going to train drone interfacing 1so i wait until my drone v gets down to under 24 hours left  ie i actually have room in my skill queue for a new skill i try and add drone interfacing 1nope sorry no can do admittedly its a minor annoyance  i just stuck a three hour skill in there and then waited until drones 5 completed before i added drone interfacing but it doesnt make much sense to me to have it implemented that way
except that the reason ccp stated for the skill queue at all is to allow you to more easily determine what time of day you fraking  sign into eve
and the skill queuq accomplishes that objective so what exactly is the purpose for this other than to further distance and abstract the skill systemi havent seen a single logical argument for this implementation only people who want to manage their characters a little lessif you cant manage your time with a 24 hours queue plus the ability to tag long skills onto the end of it then perhaps this isnt the game for you
its more about completing a feature yes the queue does let you keep your training time utilized but it in some instances does not allow you to fully maximize your training time this would get rid of the only hurdle in the way and with virtually no work required by ccp i guess i still dont understand the reasons against this unless the general population is so used to almost complete features in the game that the prospect of something being finished is foreign and frighteningit doesnt really matter either way to me as i dont think i even have any skills to inject that i dont meet the prereq for but i still wish to see the game constantly improved
if the block list works like i think it does this should be fairly lowlag i wouldnt use it myself but it would have use to some people its not a priority but sure
tracking enchancers are likely that way because its meant as a compromise to gank for snipers and more or less useless to most short range weapons pulse lasers are still quite well effected by them
hi i am in the wormhole with some player since 4 days with a posand some players have began to mine some gravitometricthe situation is too stupid i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetorthe first proposal is to increase the capacity of refining arrayexample  medium 25k  100kintensive 200k  500kor to add a new array for make the compression before refining same process than the rorqual
stopped reading right there tbh refining arrays are fine get a dang rorqual or live with the array isaacps want more support for your idea quit saying its stupid its how it currently operates and thats what ccp wanted now why dont you be more constructive also they will never make the refining array act like a rorqual otherwise that nerfs the ship
sorry but in some wormhole its not possible to pass with rorqualand how do you make in this case and not every body is in low sec
maybe dont live in the wormhole
im likinnot likinsome pretty damn stupid playersya its a funneh thing the reactor basically anyone who might want to use it will easily overrun the stupid thing add on top of that the thing basically hogs the whole tower takes forever and uses tons of fuelbig waste of time isk and energyyep our mining op got to about 150km3 and i was like ya um time to stop miningthusly making the actual rorqual uselesssorry but proposal isnt supported as it isnt very practicalthe refiners blow chunks thats for sure 25 loss just becauseboosting these refiners hurt who rorquals more or less but even then theres value in using rorqual still who is left to take advantage of the boost 00 and low sec people they dont have stations to put stuff into im pretty sure a 00 mining boost sure wont hurt thingssome might come and say but jason what about the drone regions pff those guys are so heavy in sov 3 and minnie outposts and easily defendable choke systems rolling into like 910 systems those guys wont even bother using refiners
i dont think any of that post had any sentence structure in it but from what i have read you want a array that can compress orethat sounds like a good idea but it would make the rorqual almost useles apart from the bonuses and the jump ability
yep the rorqual have not the same utility than the compressing arraywith the rorqual have an nice bonus the clone jump hangar array compressing oreand its not possible to use the rorqual on all wormholesorry for me this request is interesting
understanding that english is not your first language there is a problem this statement in english doesnt mean anythingthe situation is too stupid i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetorplease restate
i think hes saying that the array cant keep up
yeah that was my guess as well i guess it comes down to how long you are mining in a day i believe an intensive refining array can refine 1111mUFFFDmin so really a single covetor would only really exceed its capacity if mining more than 18 hours a day need more capacity get more refineries
completely agreed
imho there are a few ships that need theyre bonuses tweakedguristas shipsall guristas ships have split bonuses caldari skill boosts missiles gallente boosts hybrids every other pirate ship has either twin bonuses focused on one weapon type or a bonus to a weapon plus a bonus to some other element of the shiprattlesnakeive never seen a rattler fitted with hybrids and this is probably true for a number of reasons1 it only has 4 hardpoints2 even if it had 678 it doesnt have the pg to fit them and anything else3 if you try to fit hybridsmwdpointwebcap booster you either have two slots for a tank or have to armour tank and either way you run out of pg by a huge factorfix scrap the hybrid bonus add a different gallentestyle bonus 510 drone hp  damage bonus would be ideal also would be very nice to add a 7th launcher hardpoint and bigger drone bay even without bandwidth to match gilanot as bad as the rattle but overshadowed as a hybrid platform by deimos  brutix  vigilant  eagle and even probably the thorax once again changing the gallente bonus to a drone based one and giving it a reasonable drone bay would keep its different flavour but make it more useful 1 launcher hardpoint toowormtbh i have never flown one so i wont comment on downsides  upsides of bonusespilgrimim sure this has been mentioned before but the only use i can find for this ship is ninjaratting against sanshas its too slow to catch intys  dictors and without fitting faction neuts it cant attack anything larger without being in overloaded web range the rapier  arazu get a bonus to their primary ewar range the falcon already has range and gets a strength bonus yet the pilgrim is left with shortrange  strength bonusfix swap the 20 per level neut amount bonus for 20 range bonus or give it 10 range bonus and 10 amount bonus
youre putting together two very separate issues and you might have more luck splitting them that saidpilgrim agree fully the pilgrim has always seemed a joke to me  without a range bonus it doesnt really do very much its in need of a bonus of some sort and dropping neut effect for neut range seems the natural way to go guristas again agree fully who slaps a blaster bonus on a raven the vindicator is the right sort of model for putting a third bonus on an existing ship  find something novel that combos well with the existing twoa mwd bonus on a blaster ship and youve got a ship that is actually sensible and functional put a mediocre bonus on that doesnt fix very much and you have a mediocre ship once the nano fit stops being brokenmachariel and put a bonus on that most people actively ignore and youve got a ship that just feels like a raven you bought because you didnt notice that extra 0 in the price faction ships should be different in ways that make them useful a shieldtanking paladin is a novel concept and the nightmare runs with it admirably a battleship tackler is a fairly bad role and the bhaalgorn isnt very good at it but it at least feels like a faction ship  it does weird cool things the idea of a missiledrone ship that is actually worthwhile seems like itd be in the nightmare category  usable interesting and effective if you really boost the crap out of it it might even be worth the isk but yeah i agree with both and if you can arrange a review of the blood and maybe angel ships while youre at it thatd be cool too
then why have a curse thats always been my question the pilgrim has in your face neuting while the curse is farther out why change it isaac
the whole full speed warp cloaked lets you get a pretty good setup off on people in most situations id think neut amount would be better then range however in the more bloby situation that which pvp is pilgrim really is left out pretty badhonestly giving em 20 range and 20 amount wouldnt be terrible then again falcon is being nerfed bigtime so might as well let one of the recons fail with the falconyep horrible needs to be fixed we were promised this during empyrean age we didnt get itps i could swear the nightmare used to have torp bonuses with 4 launcher slotsproof of nightmare with launchers  old 2007 nanobs vid
in large fleet battles 100km warp ins big complexes whatever sometimes you just want to look at something far away i mean you can physically zoom out and spin the view around so you can get close to an object but this is very annoying to do with objects far away since eve is a very pretty game with beautiful spaceships and whatnot why should you be limited in what you can see i propose that one should be able to look atset as parent on anything on the grid as long as you can zoom out and see it why cant you zoom in for a closeup this would make it a little easier on film makers and also further facilitate the detailed graphics of evetldr if you can zoom out and see something you should be able to get a closeup you can get a closeup already its just difficult
agreed
agreed this has always seemed weird to me look range should be grid range
your client already knows where the object is so why cant it look its only a clientside change we are asking for herenow if it was at the edge of the grid and on the other side there was a ship that you couldnt see but the ship you chose to look at could see you still wouldnt be able to see it because seeing it would require more work from the server
simplest optionrclick player select spam option until you leave system they will be blocked for you if enough individuals select spam in a given period of time the person is gagged for a certain period of time i would be satisfied with an hour lets me get my shopping done without their annoying yammering if enough people flag the spammer in a 24 hour period or in multiple systems in a short time the character is gagged or their account locked pending investigation of the spammed materialthatll stop the spammers dead in their tracks but leave a little breathing room for legitimate sellers
thing is he has no chance whatsoever of getting that problem fixed  its fundamental to eve he at least has a chance at getting a npc deposit bank implemented
so what youre saying is his overall chances range from slim to none
that and that i wont fault him for giving slim a shot even if it isnt terribly good policy
id like to just be able to split my isk up into different piles  it would make keeping to a budget much easier if you had all your spare isk in another wallet
if you want to keep you isk then dont give it to random people you meet on the internetworking as intended imo
oh multiple wallets is definitely something i could support  one of the beautiful things about being in a small corp is that you can ask the ceo for a spare wallet for when you want to track a couple things separately id be all for that option being open to others as well thing is this proposal isnt that
i recommend eve bank thats evebanknetlavista vista helped write the code for that one i believe as for an npc bank thats probably never going to happen
i have been playing with this idea of adding a ship which is capable of scanning like the covert ops but has the ability to participate in pvp as the covert ops class have no added value other than scanning which doesnt drive a lot of people to choose this ship as theyre ship of choosingso i present my idea of adding the patrol attack shipbased on the destroyer class hull it is a ship designed for probing down opponents and holding them down for a limited amount of timei wont bore you with endless statistics which will bore you to tears and will never see the living daylight so ill outline the main points of my idea heregeneral bonusesit would include something in the likes of a bonus to the range orand strength of combat scanner probes and a small bonus to the range of warp scrambling devices also standard a cpu bonus for the expanded probe launcher should be added so it can be fitted easilyoffensive capabilitiesmake it able to wield a small amount of small guns and possibly even drones but make sure that it will not become a solo shipdefensive capabilitiesgive it a medium sized tank so that it can last and will not have a paper tank on top of that give it a heavy mass so it is not the next best nano tank due to heavy armor platingshielding equipmentcloaki dont think a ship such as this would need the ability of a cloak the ships scan strength orand range should be enough to make it able to scan quicklyrace bonusesonly dependant on the gun types so it has a little firepowerprerequisite skillsracial frigate 5covert ops 4destroyers 5astrometrics 5it should be in line with the skill time of the interdictorsin conclusioni personally think this could be a viable ship in pvp for finding people in safespots without sacrificing good tackling ability and a capable damage shipnow support it flame it discuss it
i think this is a cool idea as it would possibly call another use of the destroyer classmy only problem is your name i think they should be called hunter killers
a couple changes i thinkfirst off skill requirementracial frigate 5covert ops 5destroyers 5astrometrics 5my opinion it should be five for all four skills offensive abilitiesno drones unless its gallente about five guns sounds right to me cloakt2 cloaking device sure but no covops cloak otherwise ship sounds pretty good but i dont see the need of it atm yes the covert frigate is not the greatest thing to fly in the world but it gets the job done really well some people i know also use it to tackle people at risk sure so in short i dont see the need but more ships isnt a bad idea isaac
i agree with the basic idea a probing ship that can do something other than sit there uselesslywith caveats of coursebase it off the tier2 bc hull give it an insane tank give it the marauder weapon bonuses and limited weapon mounts so they can fit utility modules such as tractorssalvagersmake it slow as sin do not give it any weapon bonuses of any sort other than the marauder damage bonuses on limited hardpoints do not allow it to fit covert cloaks allow it to use noncovert cloaks as bombers do to prevent them becoming cloaking guerilla fighters but no velocity bonusessentially give it the ability to do two thingsscan swiftlywork plexes findsbut worthless in any sort of pvp or theyll become fotm gank fleetsend of story
lol so you figured out a couple ways to evade them mehso basically you want to make a system where you can kill someone in highsec they cant even see you coming while taking no losses at allyou know theres an exploit where you essentially have a person accepted into a corp while they are basically in warp and about to drop in on a group of people or have the gang log out where you know the camp will be accept their apps log in at the same time etc etc all these are considered exploits gms have made posts saying they are exploitswhy do you think your exploit is better then any other exploit
i wouldnt mind seeing the black ops exploit get legitimizedi mean dropping over a billion isk on a gank ship that has a very good chance of not surviving long enough to jump out is both 1 awesome and 2 very riskyi dont see the problem frankly if you lose your hulk to a black ops get another one and mine in the same system with a cloaked friend in fleet with tackle nearby next time he tries it pow concordokkened and you get a bunch of shiny loot to replace your lossi feel like that would be fun as hell for both the black ops and the targets and considering the immense cost of the ship i dont feel like it would start happening all over the place remember the black ops really only has the time to strike and jump out in 05 maybe 06 space and it has a window of only a few seconds to pull it off
there have been a hp bug which reduce your effective hp to extremely low properly what happenedthe 10 sec pilot well thats just extremely bad and lame mechanic from ccp which they should stick where the sun dont shine so ertarded
atards all of you ffs read or is it over your intellectual levelhe said he had auto pilot on at the gate which means at 0 from gate so he garentee to jump as soon as possible then to manually jump to next gateffs people are such a holes these days
indeed
its rtardanyway by his typing let me paint this picturehes on the gate either into likely perimeter or jita to perimeter traffic control closes the gate he has 600mil in an apparent t1 hauler worth roughly 200k isk my math sucks whats that like 003 of the value of the goods transportedok so hes got ap on so when the gate opens he jumps through are you sure never tried itso ill put myself in this situation for a secondim stupid enough to haul that much worth with that little yugo shipthe instant i realize the gate is closed i will buger off and warp away i will not sit there hoping some miracle opens the gate for methe 10 player did nothing wrong this shouldnt be in this forum it should be in cp where he can be mocked repeatedlyi have done runs into lowsec 00 and through all the hubs with hundreds of millions hell even billions in cargo not once have i ever been gankedive been targetted ive been attackedplay it smart and you minimize your losses ill die eventually but ill be sure its not because of doing something this idiotic
1 dont go to jita if you can avoid it 2 if you cant avoid jita transport your stuff via courier contract let someone else take the risk3 if you cant wait for a contract use a solid vessel that has a good tank that means battleship or orca in highsec4 always split your risk if you can do it in multiple runs dont do it in one unless you can risk losing it5 if you carry immense value never stop if a gate is locked use another if all gates are locked warp around in the system till they open up again never play sitting duck6 if red flashing people are anywhere near watch like a hawk7 dont go to jita if you can avoid it ps be glad it was only 600 million your corpmates will understand after all they were bright enough to let you haul that much unescorted and all by yourself from jita they could have jumped into some ships too would have split your risk
concord doesnt pod  he flew in in a pod grabbed a bs and shot you in said bs if thats what the gm claims its likely what happened as for the 300 damage thing youre the second person ive heard complaining about that  look at the reimbursement policy thread some guy was saying the same about his kronos and mentioned a titan having 100 hp as well petition it on the basis of this hp bugsince it sounds like you just petitioned the 10 guy shooting you and you might have a bit more luck
get off our board troll this isnt an issue or a proposal you are simply full of fail
im not sure posting on a public forum that you carry billions of cargo in a hauler might come close 
if i were smart i wouldnt be hauling it in this char
supported on the provision that smokeless tobacco products such as chew dip and snus be added to the list
as long as we dont have to train the new smoking skill to level i before being allowed to i like the idea of having tobacco in ambulation
my name is melgaladh and i approve this messageand if you go over and look at what ccp said about ambulation they brought up three movies aliens blade runner and star wars the empire strikes backblade runner was covered in cigarettes i think the idea of having a cigarette during a corp meeting sounds like a nice touch

hello my fellow internet spaceship captains i am pleased to announce my candidacy for the csm my history in this game is very different from most of yours joining goonfleet on day 1 of playing this game i flew my ibis directly out into 00 nobody told me about podjumping  and right from the start i have immersed myself in all that is good and bad about life in nullsec i am a firm believer that the best parts of eve are found in the high space drama that occurs out in 00 yet so much of the playerbase is unwilling or unable to venture out away from the protection of concord i want to make 00 more fun and rewarding for everyone and my goal as a csm is to push for 00 changesheres my campaign website
its not concord that draws ppl to highsec m8 its independence freedomi got tired of being taxed ordered to show up at xxxxx at a certain time also i was a meatshield for other peoples moon mining operation and they dont give nothing back basically i was playin the game for someone elses benefitnot sayin all alliances are like this but it just left a bad taste in my mouthright now i have every part of the game at my disposal at the time of my choosingi got rd production goingi got nice sized rats spawned for my killing pleasurea minihub 6 jumps away for tradinga lowsec system 8 jumps away when i wanna get froggya mining system 13 jumps away when i wanna mine and watch a movieif i want 00 providence is closei log in when i want do what i want and best of all no taxyes i miss having gangs to fly with but i cant imagine trading away my freedomfreedom is why i play eve when the freedom is gone so am i
everything you said is true life in 00 is a hassle and the real rewards of life in 00 moons plexes supercap construction are only feasible for big alliances i see this as a problem and i want to improve it without nerfing anything about life in empire
your ideas have merit however i think larkonis managed to get in a bit before youhe seems to be the unofficial cp delegate and given how many carebear candidates there are i think it would be important for at least 1 pvp based candidate to get throughim unsure if by running you would be increasing or decreasing the chance that a delegate who regularly pvps and more then just shoots stuff actually understands wtf is happening is voted in
issler thanks for your words although we have been on opposing sides of the battlefield and the smack talk i can appreciate your words i believe we can work together focusing on the different facets of eve so to make it a better game keeping in mind all game play stylesmickey simoni have read now the pod of larkonis whereas his manifesto looks more like a dark side of the pvp i hoped to work for the benefit of all pvp i for example dont think that resources have to be diminished in empire just make it so that empire stays as it is low sec should be richer by a multiplier of 15 than empire and 00 richer by a multiplier of 2 than empire but this is my opinion what i would like is to hear as many different people as possible so to understand what the specific view on different points is my view is that there must not be a compartimentalization of the game the blobbers  the crazy piratesmercs  the carebearsmy candidacy will have the goal of better defining pvp as a profession noir im sure wouldnt mind yulai convention approved contracts for mercs and assassinsthank you for your input guys
simple  i want to promote freedom to play the game in as many ways as possible the large sandbox for all i also wish to help ccp improve the game particularly with balancing of game mechanics and follow up on various initiatives that ccp has already started upon i will also try to offer a newer player perspective to the game with me personally having less than 20 million skill points and less than 2 years playing the free trip to iceland is also cool although i will have to bring my wife so it wont really be free cause if i dont bring her she will kill me
why arent you running as friedrich philwhatever your mainissler
because he is not one of frieds alts perhaps
the idea of doing away with local has been floating around for some time the recent glitch to local on sisi whether intentional or not has sparked a few discussionsrages about its potential fate i am completely local neutral so if it stays or goes i could care less i do however see a potential repurposing for the recently defunct pos module the system scanning arrayempire for all intensive purposes is civilized space per concord mandate system occupants are reported via the local system for all to see nothing changeslowsec and npc 00 space are a gray area since technically they are faction not concord occupied space for these areas local would be paired with positive standings with the occupying faction take molden heath for example if you have positive standings with the minmatar republic local appears as it currently does if you have neutral or negative standings local is reported on a broadcast only basis similar to alliance chat access to local would be based on true standings not as modified by the various social skills so players seeking to gain access to local must earn the tactical advantage00 space being lawless and unoccupied does not report local by default it acts solely on a broadcast basis where you only appear upon posting now bring back the system scanning array sov1 anchor sov2 online and make it so the controlling alliance has the option to provide local through associated standings this provides a home turf advantage to the occupying alliance that they can see system occupants in local but hostiles can not this also means that just as jammers and jump bridges are taken out as a part of 00 sov wars it allows local communications to be taken down as wellthe data elements to do this should already be inherent to local as standings are reported to make the little blue and red boxes next to names all that would be needed is a conditional prefilter to determine player access to local on a systembysystem basisthe end result would leave local in place where it is most wanted while adding a whole new positive element to lowsec npc 00 and alliance controlled space
i understand what it means to repackage a ship its basically taking it apart and packing it into a smaller space what i dont get is why they wont let us repackage ships that have rigs on them technically the rigs are a part of the ship when you install them when you remove them they are destroyed so they are nonetheless part of the ship and can be taking apart with the ship and put back together since its not being removed from the shipi dont see any particular reason to have it to where you repackage a ship you lose your rigs wouldnt it increase the risk of transporting ships if they still had the rigs installedsorry just kinda angry since i couldnt fit a ship thats 55000 volume and 5500 packaged into an obelisk that has over 800k room even with the ship unpackaged theres plenty of room for it to fitwhat yall say repackage ships with rigs ok
i think t2 bpos are fine as they are for the older corps to last this long in a world like eve is proof that they should hold onto that bpo eve isnt about fairness and older characters are always rewarded for being with the game because they sat through a bunch of  does it hurt the market a little and make an unexhuastible source of income for the holder yes but it doesnt matter since they were here first and got it before it was goneif es me off just as much as anyone that i wont be able to get a bpo of a t2 item and if i buy any bpcs then its just pure profit for the guy who made itbut how about instead of taking it away give it a decay factor just like ships and mods if the t2 bpo isnt used for what3 months it goes back on the lottery instead of destroying them how about recirculating them if their on inactive accounts or if they are just sitting in hangers not being usedeven though i like happy mediumsi still stand by that they lucked out on it and everyone else will just have to deal with it and suck it up
get some billion and buy it no on the first count the only field where the t2 bpo influence the market are the items where no sane inventor want to invent anything remove the bpo and the t2 items will disappear as the few t2 items build today will be replaced by namedfaction itemsone example are the t2 armor plates they are worse than rolled tungsten and cost the same remove the bpo and i doubt anyone will care to invent them for the unexhuastible source of income they work exactly as any other bpo after you have brought it it give you an income if you build from it so any bpo is a unexhuastible source of income
thats pretty much how it worksif you want a t2 bpo buy one but be prepared to wait for a year or so before you start making your money back they are not isk printing licenses these days not like they were before invention as an inventor i may not be able to make the margins but i can vastly outdo the t2 bpo holder in output
