"i just read that cover mining frigate - prospect can jump trough and fitt covert cynosural generator as well as blocade runners.but there is no ore ship capable to fitt and use an jump portal. and i ask myself why the hell miners shouldn't have their own covert mining operation deep in enemy space ?the basic for the idea is that prospec find a place in for examle deep, not used part of 0.0 space for example trough w-h, and call for friends, but not trough w-h, that is not so reliable for transport numerous, heavy ore ships, but refit trough mobile depot to cynosural covert generator, and folks jump or bridge trough it mine a bistot/crokite, and when full ore bays put a pos and copress ores, jump back to empire. all operation takes max 30 minutes, so is highly probable that nobody would never know about it exept participants.the ore blackops should have high range to reach such unused deepspace.so there is an idea. to remove exploits like using this method to moving modules and resources exept ore, all \"jumpable/bridgeable\" ships should have small cargo, and vast ore bay"
"that would mean killing the cargo bay size of every covert ops ship. i am all for new ships and tactics.however, a ship already exists with these capabilities it is called a rorqual. it just doesn't use a covert cyno and can't make a jump bridge. however, you can get the same effect with a rorqual and a black ops battleship."
"true, but you have to admit that a t2 black ops orca would be totally hot."
"i would add new types of missions. something more pictorial and more story driven than the current ones.like this:here we have an example of how eve in stations adds a greater variety and intensity of missions. combining game mechanics from the existing core game with new ones. it also doesn't have to be linear. different ways to get a solution and to end it would be nice."
"sounds like adding a whole new game to an existing game, do you think the playerbase is big enough to warrant creating something like this and creating something which would encourage people to stay docked in the station? moar pve! sounds more like mass effect style game... calm down miner. as you pointed out, people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl... like for example illegal mining... - ima wreckyou*"
"i wouldn't say that missions which are more complex define a new game. but they can tell a story, which can be continued with every update. giving people a reason more to stay or even to join.the question how such missions, which \"force\" the capsuleers to fly into space, should encourage them to stay docked i can't answer. i say it's rather the opposite.is the playerbase big enough for that? i really don't know. i could point to self invented facts like with gambling halls on stations nobody would undock. same with quartiers which can be modified. for both examples you need isk. to get that you have to go out into space!after all, wis will add definitely a new type of gameplay to the existing game. is it per se bad to have more ways to play this game? to add more possibilities to spend your ingame money? no it isn't.will it wipe out the pvp player base and make them docked, staying 24/7 in their corp headquarters? no it won't.will it provide eve with a new face or facette of it outwards? yes it will. is that bad? no it isn't."
"the miner bridge module could have restrictions to pass only ore ships or something like that. totaly miner character would not/should not train battleships to lvl 5 - they could and should have an alternative like this.it would be a nice addition to high sec miners, after the shortage of zydrine an mexallon - not obtainable in high and low sec systems right now"
"you may have noticed the lower and lower number of pilots online. i shouldn't be able to easily get into jita on the weekend or during midday in the week, and yet, no jita congestion. we need to bring those days back. but how? i've mentioned before that eve players aren't likely to go door to door like mormon missionaries, preaching the word of eve online, and word of mouth by other means doesn't seem to be bringing people in.has ccp mentioned anything about any advertising?"
"maybe we should stop with all the griefing and player harmful behaviour that prevents organized groups of players from expanding into the universe.essentially, it's players ourselves that are guilty for creating a newbie unfriendly environment."
"pvp is pretty central to eve online, however. are you suggesting a 'no non-consensual pvp' area of null or something? i think we'd see interesting trends from that, but it'd still be against the grain of eve."
"might want to add seller names while you're at it of selecting exactly which order to buy from."
"while i agree with the above statement i'm afraid that i'm cynical enough to believe all this proposal would encourage is the creation of yet more marketing alts in solo corps. never leaving station and existing expressly to insulate the source corporations from just such \"shooty\" interaction."
"you sir, need to stop posing your horribad ideas.first, gather the materials for a station on your own (all of them) and set it up somewhere. after you've done that, you can argue about why stations should be destroyable and not a moment before."

"the only real suggestion i have is to keep submitting bug reports and post in the forums threads relevant to the topic that concerns you. if something really bothers you, mail the csm directly - every mail we receive is discussed. as for feedback from the csm specifically, we give ccp a ton of feedback on a wide variety of topics, sometimes our concerns are heeded and our advice taken, other times it's ignored. however, even when ccp does heed ours or player's advice, with this new 6 weeks cycle, the completion date and release date can sometimes be only a week apart. a good example of this is the icon changes, as you mention.furthermore, there are certain aspects of eve's development that cannot be tested on singularity prior to release. a good example of this is the new sov system. even with the duality wargames having gone on for three weeks, ccp is hesitant to make changes to the system based on the meta that evolved on duality. with 100isk ships and modules, combat is not the same. player density is not the same. logistics is not the same. it could potentially lead to an issue where you balance a feature for singulariy or duality specifications, but the content falls flat on tranquility. coming back to the ship icons, i personally really liked them, until i got horribly confused in my first large fleet fight on tq.tl;dr - i understand where you're coming from, but singularity and tranquility have differences that must be respected. that being said, the majority of stuff can and should be tested on singularity first, but it's up to those testers to post comments and file bug reports so that the developers can actually see the feedback."
"closed."
"in my humble marketing opinion, ccp needs to court social influencers aka gaming celebrities to play eve.i am by all accounts an f-tier youtuber. i have about 25k subscribers and maybe another 5k fans via other platforms. yet by my own analytics at least 5,000 players have started or returned to eve via referrals from my content.now imagine someone like day9, who has 20x my fan base, starts playing eve. that could be 100k new and returning eve players.now imagine hiring or incentivizing 100 f-tier youtubers. this strategy has flaws but is already working for several aaa developers."
"this is summer time, a low time for eve, plus a few more possible factors at work like players waiting for the new sov, or the removal of isboxers. i would not say the current low numbers are too surprising, or dire.efforts to bring new players in should be focused at the start of college/school i.e. september, not the middle of summer, but imho the main problem is not really about bringing new players in, is making those players that come in and try eve to stay. if we do not improve efforts toward retention, then efforts to bring new players are just a waste.from the newcomer perspective, there are so many systems that favor vets: high cost implants, off-grid links, purple modules, fancy expensive tech/pirate ships, existing networks and batphones, without mentioning the fact that established powers can so easily spy and collapse/scam newer corps/alliances, or vet players with multiple accounts paid from the taxes of the many and top down income that most new players can't even dream of unless they stay engaged in the game for a few years.new players must be presented with perspectives that they also can achieve something, within a few months. i believe fozziesov can deliver on this perspective, which of course goes against the interests of the established powers/players. this is a very difficult balance to maintain but retention is the core of the subject at the moment, more so than acquisition of new players"
"going way tangent here, but you got me thinking of wow's 'what's your game?' commercials with mr. t, william shatner, etc. i was envisioning one with r. lee ermey: a raid goes into a lair, someone messes up and pulls a group early, causing chaos. then you hear sgt. hartman: \" who the f*** pulled that??? which one of you elf-kissing, twinkle-toed commie maggots just signed his own death warrant??? nobody??? the fairy-f***ing godmother did it??? outstanding!!!\"then the camera would pull back and you'd see a pink haired female gnome in charge and hear \"i'm r. lee ermey, warrior! what's your game, jackwagon??\"(end advertising tangent)"
"i agree they should be removed but at the same time we need a replacementthey're only reason why i will not go into low security space or wormhole space i simply cannot afford to replace them they're the most expensive thing i own"

"eve is science fiction that has by nature not such a large fan base like other genres. i'm pretty sure that many people who are into science fiction and online games have already tried eve and decided for or against it, for whatever reason.so who are the new players? for which kind of player ccp should make advertising? this is a question we have to ask ourselves.a shiny tv spot at the prime time sure will get a lot of subscriptions, but if the game can't fulfill the promises it is pointless. the subscriptions will climb fast and after some time go even so fast back down.what long term effect has it to pay youtubers or twitchers to play this game? already the point you have to pay them to play is an argument against the game.for me the strength of this game is its diversity. that's something that needs more attention, not only the pvp elements. so eve can reach a broader variety of players and potential subscribers.i don't think that eve is too hard for new player to start. yes people can be assholes and some of them will always be but in terms of isk i think it's easier today. if you don't agree with the latter, throw your venture away and start mining with an iteron."

"also ccp should remember how important is the translation of the client in the first hours of user experience. one of the reason that make the spanish speaking comunity so small is that it takes greater interest to pay a game that is so hard to play alone when even the basic client is not in your language.when tou start playing the game is very different to be pointed to a tutorial on your language and a official spanish channel where you can ask silly questions and get recruited by a spanish speaking corp than making you bother to make the effort of doing it on choppy english somewhere else.imho removing the language channels was a big mistake. im sure that player retention of spanish speaking who join a spanish speaking corp is much much higher. and corps used to recruit on the spanish channel. ccp could ask the community for help on the translation. a volunteer could translate a men<U+FFFD> or a mission text with little effort, and all that would be left would be a review. thats half work. misions could be translated to slang for pirate factions. woulnt be glorious to have angel cartel speaking mexican slang, serpentis speaking porte<U+FFFD>o and guristas speaking gitanillo style?."

"i have not read the rest of this thread but your op makes me so angry i just have to reply to it. well that is partly the reason why they cost 20 times as much as a standard carrier, or 10 times as much as a dread, or whatever scale you want to apply. have you ever tried moving a sole super somewhere? good luck, with that. they are strong as a group and as a group only. erm.. are you bitter cause you dont have one? you know, you can just buy them, theres a forum for that. if you and your friends can grind the isk together, what stops you from acquiring these supposed weapons of mass destruction and wrecking havoc to all those poor bastards that cannot afford them?i really dont understand what your point is. if they are so overpowered why dont you/your corp just acquire a few? have you ever actually tried fighting with supers? you have to drop all your tank and refit specifically for tracking to be able to hit battlecruisers or smaller. and thats with fighters then, forget about fbs, so you get a lot less dps already. many people buy officer items for several billion isk just to be able to max out their tracking. are you saying a 50b super carrier (with fit) is not allowed to hit a ******** sabre that isnt warping off?please field half a dozen supers and fight actual people and then we'll see how much that \"i win\" button works out for you.you obviously have no idea what it means to commit supers into a fight in 0.0. otherwise you wouldnt be saying this.sorry but you are obviously ranting about something way above your experience, so i doubt people will take you seriously."
"so my main competitor in providence area took my votes to get his csm position, and then steps down leaving us both out of it. very well done."
"not as long ccp thinks that people play this game only for shooting at stuff.they are creating a sandbox and giving us mostly weapons to play with. that reminds me somehow of this citate from henry ford: \"people can have the model t in any color - so long as it's black.\" (i know he probably never said that but nevertheless). i still want this game more sandboxier with more different toys to play with."
"the thing is its going to need way more people than just you to want this for it to even have a chance of happening. ccp got burned badly by incarnas reception and i highly doubt they'll push for anything like it it again without massive support from their own players. simply saying 'i want this' is not enough."
"true words. fortunately the previous 9 pages of this thread demonstrate that it isn't just me. they also contain some examples of what to do with it and why it is not just a nice to have thing.i understand that ccp is cautious regarding changes to their flagship game. investing resources in other projects (wod, dust, valkyrie, legion) is presumably the easier solution to open new money sources. i'm not sure if this strategy has paid off since incarna."

"for those of you that are curious...the council of stellar management is designed to represent the interest of the entire player base.while i feel that alot of good has come out the the csm, i also feel that new players have (for the most part) been marginalized.as a new player i find it more than a little unsettling that our \"elected\" representatives; (a) don't truly represent the actual players, and (b) have on many occasions used their influence to further their personal or alliance goals.i am not condemning the idea of the csm, its' past, or present members. i am speaking to the new players, and players yet to join eve. i feel that we need a voice, but to achieve that we need to be proactive.make sure you get out and vote!i support liam oliphants. i believe he will provide a fresh perspective and a new (player) voice for a new (new) eden."
"while a lot of you will look at this thread and wonder why i didn't start it, i've actually been on the fence on the whole thing. i'm currently a very new player to eve online. i didn't know the csm was a thing until a day or so ago. i think lemon is right though. all of the voice that is (more than likely) getting through to ccp is from players who have been here for quite a while. just like with any group of representatives, stagnation is never a good thing. all players need to be equally represented to the best of the csm's ability for a more accurate portrayal of the voice of eve online's player base.so, consider this my official campaign for csm. i'll get back to everyone here on the forums as i come up with what i hope to bring to the table as it comes to me. remember, i am a new player. i need to do some research, figure out things. my overall goal at the moment, is to hope to make eve online even more new player friendly. not to say i want to dumb the game down, not at all. i like the overall complexity of the game, and i am (for the most part) having fun with it. the game would still be niche, and not for everyone to just be able to pick up and play. my goal isn't to flood eve with new players because it becomes too accessible.so yeah, umm, vote for me for the next elections if you want a fresh voice for the csm."

"there is no sov in w-space. with that, you cannot gain any bonus to increase the population generation of relic/data sites, combat sites, ore fields, etc. also, you cannot gain the benefit of reduced fuel costs to poss (which may be null and void when they bring in the citadels).i'll first off state that i would love to see an occasional ice field pop up in w-space. make it a neutral ice field, so when you process the ice you get no racial specifically needed isotopes, but you could still gain the heavy water and liquid ozone needed by all. this would still require the sov holders inside the wh who have a pos deployed to leave and go to the market or friendlies who would have it to be sold/traded.why can't we deploy a w-space specific version of an ihub? make the bonuses for owning \"sov\" different too.... i.e. sov holders gain shield/armor hp/resist bonus, while the invaders do not..... or.... industrial ships like transports, or even mining vessels can get bonuses to warp core, shield/armor resist, etc.... also there needs to be a change made to the directional scanner. if a player brings in a covert ops cloaking device enabled ship... the dscan is completely useless. most ships initially scanning a wh would be cloaky ops anyways. the only chance you have of detecting their presence, before they are uncloaking and scramming you, is the instant they initiate warp when they jump inside. the instant they start moving they are cloaked again. with that being said... why not make there a device or very intensive maintenance required structure to block cloak? ******i'm -9.6 with gallente, mainly due to being a noob with the game and running caldari missions, which fought a lot of gallente faction ships. now, when i fly through gallente space, they prohibit use of my cloaking devices (along with killing any ship remaining in space for any length of time). why can't we do the same in our -1.0 status wormhole? why can't we, the wh residents, deploy an array that blocks use of cloaking devices for everyone?people will argue, \"but bfe, there is a waiting period after uncloak before they can lock onto your ship.\"sure there is, and it is still quicker than initiating warp in a skiff strip miner/etc.\"but bfe, there are bonuses already in place on the skiff that boost its warp core, and you can still add three more modules to boost it.\"sure you can, which are all null and void with a bubble. sure, this is all part and parcel of being in >=0.0 space, i understand that. however this is wh space.... separate from nullsec. w-space should also act differently."

"when i first started eve, i thought the same way you did, sara. however, upon analyzing the structure of the game, you'll start to learn why this is a bad idea.most people claim that eve is a pvp game. it's not. it's also not a pve game. it's a game where pvp and pve combine to create the wonderful universe we live in.the market is mostly player run. to have this kind of market, you need to have supply and demand. supply is carried out by the pve players, without whom the game would quickly collapse. demand is created by losses, mostly by pvp. again, without pvp, this game would quickly collapse.the mechanics of eve work in a beautiful harmony between pvp players and pve players. it's this aspect, plus the camaraderie created by corporations, which has given this game the remarkable lifespan it has had, and will continue to have.not supported."
"i would quit eve intermediately.the only act that keeps pve interesting (every plex/mission/anomaly can be found in detail on the internet) is other players that are praying on you your loot and making obsticals, an npc never could.i can have the most fun by getting somewhere in hostile space run a site escalation of plex and get out of there with the loot. it gives great satisfaction, mostly because it isn't certain outcome.and i create gameplay for the hunters and they for me, sometimes i win sometimes i lose.it great fun try it."
"allow me to introduce you to the dersen lowery law of game design: any mechanic introduced into a game, no matter how badly designed and regardless of the intention behind it, will attract people who find it appealing for one reason or another. maybe it would be worthwhile to hit some high sec belts and mission hubs and ask people? try not to torpedo them first; you might get better answers.mining is one example--hilmar spent a lot of time mining!, but here's a better one: the giant wall of structure hp that was the signature of dominion sov was intended to discourage people from destroying the structures. how'd that work out?"

"hello fellow players,if you look on the market, you'll see a wide variety of clothing options available, with the art assets already completed and visible. however, the actual number of those items (of variant colors) have yet to be introduced.therefore, i propose that we introduce those clothing options into the game, both in the aurum store and the market (eventually by players who purchase it from the aurum store for resale). if we had a new eden store option for each type of clothing (structure dress, command pants, etc), then allow the viewing and purchase of said color combinations through a drop-down on the detail screen, we could introduce these long-awaited items into the game.this would require a bit of code (for the drop-down menu and such), but since the art assets are already existent, no further art work would need to be done. this is the main thrust of this post.ps: i'd also recommend as a side benefit the addition of gloves as an apparel category. i'd really like to see some fingerless gloves or similar items in the store.thank you for your review."

"no i don't. i suppose this is the part where i go study my eve online history so i can see how it's changed over the years and see (if any) mistakes that were made, so that i can not repeat those same mistakes, or make a similar one. let me go do some research, and i'll get back to you on this.edit: after doing a little bit of research into the csm x campaign, i've discovered that i don't care. i am a new player to eve online, and my point in running is to be a voice for the new players. i can't say that i will be able to speak on behalf of all of the new players, but my opinion as a new player shouldn't be to far off from most of them. true, i don't care about going pew pew in space, but there are honestly a handful of other games that allow me to blow up ships in space if i honestly wanted to do that. eve means so much more to me than the combat aspect of it, and i'd like to see the other aspects grow.i'm not here to further some secret agenda, i'm here to maybe one day help a game deal with it's new player experience. with what little research i did into the csm x campaign i noticed that a lot of the people who said they were specifically catering to the new player crowd specifically were not elected. that tells me that as long as the general public hasn't changed by the time the next elections come around, that i probably don't stand a chance of being elected either. it saddens me to see such a great game have a player base willing to stagnate itself by not allowing the game to have a voice from a more recent player base. if the \"bittervets\" want to keep electing more \"bittervets\" into csm, that's fine. older players deserve a voice just as much as the new players do. however, when only the older players are getting their voice heard on topics, it will skew everything the csm stands for in that direction, and the content ccp will release as a result will be likely skewed as well.people probably wonder why eve has such a terrible player turnover, and i have a good guess why. this game has been flooded with opinions and voices from players who want to see the game benefit themselves, and players like them, and all of the newer players have either quit the game before their opinion can even be heard, or their voices have been drowned out by the overwhelming roar (or cry if you will) of all the older more experienced players.however, please correct me if i am wrong."
"the entire point of this thread, ( and associated campaign ) is about getting an actual new player on csm xi.. saying \"yeah so\" instead offering any honest criticism or actual debate is the type of attitude that encouraged me to support liam in the first place. the csm would benefit from having the voice of a new player in its ranks... especially so, considering that ccp is very interested in getting new players. malcanis... \"better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt\"<3 <3 <3lemon :)"
"ugh. i just hate how it's year round campaigning now, no break after an election, it's right on the next one. if i wanted a baby-faced infant in charge i'd have voted for kevin rudd*rimshot*ok, where do you stand on the following issues:some say the new player experience does not adequately prepare new players for the harsh realities of new eden. i propose that aura returns to the tutorial, only this time she is here for vengeance for her unfair dismissal. she ganks the player with her catalyst, taunts them, and tells them to htfu. thoughts?have you stopped murdering puppies? yes or no answers only thanks, i don't want your life story.how old is too old? is chance not good enough for you? are you interested in a timely torpedo delivery straight to your hull?what's your life story?have you accepted james 315 as your personal saviour of highsec?why should people vote for somebody trying to fill a niche and yet can't be bothered to do some basic research to establish whether or not that niche is already being filled?what are you actual proposals for the npe? concrete proposals, enough wishy-washy \"i'm for the newbie\" \"fix the new player experience\" stuff."
"why would ccp be so interested in a new player that has no idea what eve is all about?it would be the same thing as walking into someones business, not knowing anything about it, or very little and start telling them to change this or that."
"my role isn't to be some saint or hero to come fix all your problems. it isn't to be some villian who came and wrecked everything either. my role is to be a voice for change, preferably good change, but change nonetheless. with my little experience from my corp i've joined. i've come to the realization that a lot of \"bittervets\" like to use a circular logic defense mechanism when you try to talk to them about how eve needs to change. you're all sitting on your self made thrones for the empires you've built over time. well here's a history lesson for you guys. empires don't last. they crumble and fade over time. some were lucky enough to make it into the history books, others were forgotten. if people are so adamant on keeping eve's player base stagnant, then the game is going to die off, and everyone loses because eve is such a great game. eve would be better if it had the ability to change and evolve with it's player base. what are you bittervets going to do with all this stuff you've done in eve when you die? not your character either, i'm talking about you, the player, dying. everything you've done won't matter. i think it's in everyone's best interest that eve continue to live and evolve over time so that future generations of players have the chance to be able to experience what a great game this is. your killboards and amount of isk you earned over your lifetime, while recorded for all of history, will be just that, a record in the history books. after we are all gone and future generations pick up this game, they won't care about most of the things that we did either. some of them might see our records has challenges, and try to break them, and set new records. however, none of that will matter if the game stagnates and dies off."
"removed some off topic posts."

"better incentivize youtube content. i'm a recent trial account gone full subscriber, and it was the \"this is eve\" trailer that got me to jump on a longing standing desire of mine.but it was the plethora of really great content by youtubers like wingspan (hey!), johnnypew, scott manley, and others that made me hit that upgrade to full account button."
"people need good space to find their play style, to find their place and excitement in new eden. basically, re-vamping npc null and parts of non fw lowsec would give players a place to do this.sov, even fozzie sov, isn't for everyone. people want a small gang haven, some place with personality, where they can actually learn the game at their own pace, and get involved in their own stories and happenings. npc null and non-fw lowsec just need available and accessible income for newer players, sources that will reward their risk taking versus their hi sec cousins; the security status tags are a good example. sov is still way too impersonal for many, as is the security of leveling one's raven in hisec; you want people to get involved with the social aspect of the game as fast as possible. making places worth living in, worth braving in new small groups of people, could make people's game play experience much better to the point where they actually have chances to see what makes eve actually different than other games."
"now imagine someone like day9 streaming the npe to 600,000 viewers.can you think of any reason why that might not end well?"
"people like you are great for getting people to take a look at eve, so was the battle of b-r, come to that. attracting that initial attention has actually not really been a big problem for eve - it's eyecatching, it gets news stories in the non-gaming media as well as the gaming media and so on. so yes, by all means ccp should put some effort into attracting some social media types, but before they do that, they need to think about what is going to get broadcast.the big problem is, and always has been, bridging that gap between \"ok i ran the tutorials, what now?\" and \"yeah i'll probably be playing this game on and off until tq goes dark\".ccp will need to make good and goddamb sure that those other \"f-listers\" are broadcasting a decent answer to the \"what now?\" question, or all they'll achieve is to show 100,000 potential customers that they shouldn't even bother trying."
"the problem here is that we have two types of personalities.the ones who can entertain himself and the ones who need someone/something who says what to do. most people are of the latter kind even if many of them may disagree.and here we have a problem. a youtuber/twitcher leads through something. same with articles and books. but eve is different. after the tutorials the player is left alone. many of you would now suggest that the newbie should look for a corp, to find someone who shows him/her how much fun eve really is.exactly here we have again the problem that the player has to be active by himself to get to that point. he has to look for a corp, has to ask, to try, eventually to leave to try it with a new corp again and so on. that all doesn't look like fun for me. it also gives a new player a lot of time to think about the differences between selected youtube content, a few single battles which made it into the press and the reality of eve.that's why i would like to see more npc and story driven content or even wis. keeping new players busy, showing them the diversity and possibilities within new eden and give them more time to get into touch with real peoples.the end of the story is, without changing the game itself youtubers and adds alone won't get many new players."
"history is a great leson that we all fail to grasp and take lessons from.one thing that is blatanly clear is that everyone is so focused on what is here and now, but have not bothered to ask the questions as to how we got here, how did eve grow to where it is now, and what were the methods for eve to attract and retain new players. i mean let's get real for just a moment, peak night was at one point 3,500 people. if you step and look at teh growth, something happened to create the growth, what was it....what was it that recently changed that hurt eve's growth?if you really want to approach this correctly, you have to sift through the changes of the game, and find the things in the game that held folks like myself for long. it baffles my as to all of a sudden we have issues of attracting new players, but we had not had a problem really in the past. personally, my view, is that eve has lost some of the cold, dark ruthless feel to it, and has lost it unique appeal. the forcing of a product from niche market to a broader market can spell the end of most products. - stephen herfst"

"thank you. it means a lot to me that you are willing to at least offer help. i'll be sure to keep that in consideration as time goes on."
"first off although i have been around a bit, i am not a bitter vet. not even sure why that term is even used. change for the sake of change is not a solution, and to make a change is not moving forward. a qualified, well thought, balanced reasoning to make a change, is something i can work with, even if i do not agree with it, i can understand it and work with it.you on the other hand, with your diatribe of hate towards anyone that has had any sort of success or has invested in sort of time, seems bent marginalizing players that have stuck with this game and ccp through all the frustrations, trials and tribulations through out the years. actually, you should probably thank a \"bitter vet\" for sticking with the game so you and others can enjoy it also."
"i don't even have an official platform as far as what i would like to address as far as actual in-game mechanics and stuff goes. the next elections are still quite a ways away from my understanding. i've told everyone i would get back to them as i figure things out. besides, isn't the whole point of the csm to be representatives of the players of eve? that makes it a similar function as the house of representatives here in the us. to me, it seems both systems are flawed because not everyone is being equally being represented. without getting too much into religion, do some research on the house and you'll see that the majority of it's members are christian in some form or fashion. while, if you were to look at the us population, not all of us are christian. i myself am an atheist. i'm not being properly represented by that fact alone. that's all just a small portion of it too. the lgbt community isn't being properly represented either.which leads me to the csm. new players aren't being properly represented. well here i am running for csm to represent new players. new players aren't going to understand everything about eve, i don't either. new players aren't as experienced as the older players, i'm not either. new players are going to make mistakes, i have, and will continue to mistakes, no one is perfect."
"thanks for the informative link. one thing i still don't get is, reading about incarna is always about the nex store and the price policy about ingame items which don't do anything game breaking. only sparsely there are informations about wis between the lines.and yet wis is used by many old player as scapegoat for the failure of the incarna release. something that doesn't fit in my opinion."
"so, i was and still am very much in favour of incarna/wis, but even i had issues with the initial release, and thus i was part of the people posting on the rage threadnought back then.but i still want to see the door opened. and i know i am not the only one who was raging back then, yet wants to see the door opened.i only mention this because some people seem to think that everyone who took part in the summer of rage is against further wis development; i know that's not true.also, when i look at the graphs for new players and peak concurrent users, incarna seems to not have done too much damage, but the last months/years of \"fixing core mechanics\" does not appear to work anymore to keep those numbers up, as far as i can tell."
"eve online is a game about meta politics, the null sec shite-lords saw that the company did the following and changed the perception of ambulation, now known as walking in stattions (wis) to further their cause for flying in space (fis).1) csm was told by the company no \"resources\" were available for at least 18 months (this covered the time frame of incarna) to be used on any of the csm ideas (this would be the internet space ship part = serious business).since the csm is a player voted organization, and null sec alliances having larger constituents, this meant the message was delivered (in)directly to these people.source:"

"you talk a lot about representation, but this requires identification from those who choose to vote for you ... i don't see much of an expression of your opinions about the game, what are you doing in eve, why, what's good, what's bad, why, and how it shall go in future in your opinion. the alternative is to shine with your actions in game, so that people know what you stand for, but this requires time and effort of course. you don't like pvp, that's what i read, but is there more?"
"not sure why you brought up lbgt, religion or politics, this is video game, not a platform for your own political and social views. now to correct you, 76.4 % of the population of the united states declares themselves as christians, so your analogy of trying to draw that the majority of the representatives do not represent the majority of the population is erroneous. by declaring a run for some representative seat for a video game community, and all you spew is \"change\" is very disingenuous. change for any of us may have different meanings when you actually discuss what \"change\" means. with in the same group of like minded individuals, \"change\" still has different meanings and each individual may vote as to what they view as the change the want. but when it comes down to it, they have been tricked into believing this is what the platform is and becomes quickly disappointed and bitter towards the system,because the \"change\" they voted for was not to be. so far you have not presented a single thing that \"new players\" are screaming for that requires representation. all you will aquire is a bunch of low information voters to make changes to a \"video game\" that they have no idea why it needs to be changed except for some emotionally invested ideas that really either been addressed or some veiled attempt to make some changes that benefit a small majority of the player base."
"the main problem with making new players your base for votes is the fact that a majority of new players don't vote. they are not directly represented by their own fault or by ignorance that the csm even exists. that is just one of the hurdles you will have to jump. but i take offence if you say that new players are not represented. go into the rookie help chat and you may come across sugar, steve, or myself interacting and helping. you don't have to be new to represent new players any more than you have to be an animal to support animal rights. what you need to be is able to communicate, to listen, become known to the voting public. twitch, blog, podcasts,whatever, step 1 is always get known. i will amend that with getting known/famous in a good way. there are some notorious candidates who are very well known but unlikely to be elected. mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
"thanks to che biko and freelancer117, your comments mirroring pretty much that image i have about incarna.errors where made, but that's human. the error wasn't wis itself, it was about managing the development process and the communication. but that's 4+ years ago. also this thread shouldn't be about past events, its about today and what wis can do for eve in the future.so i still like to express my support for wis as a general project, knowing that wis is way more complex than just adding a button or an overview or nerfing a ship. that's why i also don't really like the expression wis.under this term there are so many different things, starting with apparels, stuffing your quartier, missions, avatar interactions in different places and ways and so on. it's not about walking around long empty corridors as critics describe it.i won't start a discussion again if wis is doable. ccp is currently able to develop at least two complete new games (valkyrie, legion) plus working on eve and dust. are there any resources to give walking in stations, or eve in stations i call it, a real try? yes! and that is what ccp should do. not as a big single expansion like incarna but as a new additional line of development step by step, parallel to the current ones.we can argue forever if wis/eis will be a success or not. without at least trying, we will never know and miss a big chance to improve the game."

"let's just call this what this is. it's a coathanger up the yazoo. you're really going to allow your \"official\" csm campaign to begin as a post from someone else who started a topic that you happen to agree with? and you're going to research eve first to learn more about it but want to run for and be on the csm so you can represent players that are as clueless as you? there's a red biohazard bag over there for that coat hanger and its catchings ---->"
"liam,by the time the next csm campaign season and elections roll around, you won't be a new player anymore and will have a very different take on the game, the community, and the csm if you put in the effort to inform yourself on those fronts. before you judge the effectiveness of current and former csm members relating to new player support, you might want to do some research into what they are actually doing in-game and out. a few relevant examples: sugar, mike, chance, cagali cagali, and even myself. we--and others--have been engaged in helping new players and communicating with ccp in various channels on the subject of new player challenges for awhile now. incidentally, not all good ideas for helping new players (or anything else) are delivered straight to ccp through the mouths of the sitting csm. ccp folks are well tuned in to the community via forums, twitter, the tweetfleet slack, and elsewhere. if you want to be in that loop, you need to be tuned into and active in those places.while more can always be done to help new players get a good start and become invested in the game, i don't see ccp as the primary solution for accomplishing that. experienced players will *always* do a better job of helping new players get a good start. yes, opportunities could be better but they will evolve and hopefully that will happen. yes, ccp could provide better ways for new players to reliably discover player corps that are a good fit. yes, ccp could provide tools for more experienced players to use to build custom missions or tutorials for new players (this is me dreaming and wishing, here). but at the end of the day, this is an extremely complex, highly nuanced, meta-driven game. i believe strongly that only through interaction with experienced players can a new player truly discover all there is to eve in terms of mechanics, options, careers, and more.if you're serious about campaigning on a \"new player voice\" platform, i recommend you get informed and start doing something very visible and very tangible to gain credibility. i could point to chance's wingspantt videos, mike's operation magic school bus, sugar's dedication to helping in the rookie help channel, cagali's newbro focus in brave, and my own corp's mission to help new players get started in exploration, nova haven, pandemic horde, karmafleet, etc. as a good examples of initiatives to help new players. just having an opinion won't be enough to get you elected, no matter how many words you use to express it.tl;dr action speaks louder than words."

"in addition to wis i would like to have a kind of virtual reality device which my avatar can plug in into his neck while lying in bed.with the help of this little device you can transfer your mind into a station clone on a different station and do there whatever you want. maybe with some restrictions because of your security status or reputation. it should give you the possibility for player interactions but not replace an actual visit (price checks, buy and sell stuff etc.).also with this device we can implement new types of training missions and tutorials.i like the idea to start the game for the first time and find myself inside a ship right in the middle of a battle between two huge fleets. explosions everywhere, huge titans dwarfing your own ship, the sound of your firing guns together with alarm sirens filling the air. after a while your ship explodes and your avatar awakes, covered in sweat in his dark empty quartier. yes you should be able to switch on and off the lights. he then is plugging of his virtual reality device and giving you back the control over him.replaying historic battles or parts of it can be a feature of this device too, to show new capsuleers what eve can be. eventually as part of a tactical simulation or just for the sake of space battles. it also provides a virtual room to train with more and different ships, in a controlled environment."

"some ideas for what a ambulation/wis gameplay could include. for content it would naturally be interesting to have npc's in the station. apart from those just being there or passing through, you could have occasional mission offers when you meet certain criteria, like good standings with the corp running the station. similar to the storyline missions. the agent would invite you to meet personally, because of the sensitive content of these offers.there could also be information brokers. who could offer you information and coordinates about special asteroid mining fields, exploration and hacking sites, not able to scan down otherwise because of their location in deadspace. more often than not the coordinates would not be sufficently accurate, making it necessary to bring out your probes when arriving at the location. for this information a reflecting amount of isk would asked from you to get the info. some npc's could also be talked to without any particular purpose, if anything it would be interesting to see their reactions towards a capsuleer coming up to them. it could give an interesting background to how capsuleers are regarded in society. they could also tell you some general news or reactions to recent happenings.other players would of course be interesting, not only when communicating but just seeing them there.shops with content relevant to this setting, of the see and try before you buy type, like apparel. these would be something for the players who wants to show stylistic imagination. selection in shops could maybe vary somewhat between stations and regions. buying apparel could not be the only way that would change your appearance. a high security status would make you eligible as a concord recognized person offering you a badge or symbol to put on your clothes. completing certain tasks would offer other further symbols. like it is currently in eve, a high standing with one of the four navys could give you similar visual acknowledgement.another possibility of this new setting would be as a backdrop to explore the differences in culture, trends and events between the four empires. for example, depending on which station you were in, on the news screens in the common areas you would get some news centered around what is most important to them and from their respective companies, in addition to galaxy spanning news from the scope. a purpose which i think was one of the things that ccp had in mind for incarna, and that would have even more meaning now with valkyrie and legion soon to come, is to have ambulation as some sort of ui for accessing and tutorial for valkyrie and legion and eve. this would also work as an introduction or starting module for new players, being able to present the different game modes as well as new eden. but even for existing eve pilots, this could be a transition setting or at least a place to try out exploration and warfare down on planets, or flying spaceships in different way not using the capsule. maybe this would work in some way with your capsule or the vr device suggested by aelavaine to remote control a simple drone test ship with a first person view like in valkyrie and a trial, though basic compared to a capsuleer, droid soldier in legion. giving you a taste of the action before taking the step of getting your own clones for these purposes, and before spending isk on the special ships and equipment required. this could also be a place to plan shared operations, for the features where that's possible between eve, legion and valkyrie.some things i find interesting from a design perspective, is to have the light and play of lights types, varying between the four station types. it could also change with the seasons, making it feel more vibrant and alive (this idea comes from evelopedia)."
"it's being thought about seriously. not necessarily the suggestion given, but with a holistic approach."

"correct, though the addition of two new armor skills (armor layering and armor resistance phasing) closes the gap most of the way.i count a total of 20x training for all sub-cap non-remote shield skills, and 12x for all sub-cap non-remote armor skills (plus 6x for the two mentioned above). with the two new skills, it's 20x vs 18x, instead of 20x vs. 12x.it could be said that the balance lies in that armor tanking relies on the compensation skills (8x total) as they affect eanms, while shield does not rely on those (also 8x for shields) and can skip them entirely for hardener-based fits. the major discrepancy in training time lies in the base skills:mechanics: 1x+5% hull hphull upgrades: 2x+5% armor hprepair systems: 1x-5% repair systems durationshield management: 3x+5% shield hpshield operation: 1x-5% shield recharge timeshield upgrades: 2x-5% powergrid need for shield upgradesshield compensation: 2x-5% capacitor need for shield boosterstactical shield manipulation: 4x+5% shield uniformity"

"i respectfully suggest the op might be playing the wrong game. eve online is a competitive pvp sandbox universe based on the constant destruction of player-built assets. suicide ganking has been confirmed by ccp as an intended mechanic many times and it facilitates the destruction cycle. the game has explicitly been designed so your stuff is never 100% safe even in highsec. as for other player behaviour, that is not a csm matter. if you think someone is \"cyberbullying\" you, you should take that to your local law enforcement. also, the eula is crystal clear that real-life harassment and personal insults are not allowed, so you should make a petition to ccp if you experience that and they take that very seriously. regardless of your feelings on the matter, this view that ganking is bullying ("
"counter-argument: you are playing a game set in a dystopian, hyper-capitalist society where almost every mechanic and playstyle is generally designed to \"step on the toes\" of others and cause conflict, chaos, warfare, and ego driven pissing contests.moreover... the lore is filled with prostitution, slavery, murder, mass murder, assassinations, torture, suicide, ransoming, blackmail, back-stabbing, corruption, genetic atrocities, cybernetic atrocities, deliberate man-made environmental catastrophes, poverty, starvation, human sacrifice, necro-resurrections, manic psychosis, sociopathy, and every other shade of grey between.seriously though...ccp has stated that they take such things on a \"case-by-case\" basis. that \"clear line\" you are looking for will never be, nor can be, \"clear\" as any and all interaction between any two people is never \"clear cut\" from the start.some people are too sensitive.some people are too desensitized.everyone has a different range of things that will set them off.and because of those things you can never scrub any interaction down to the point where no one is offended. someone always will be.you, mr. op, are leaning too far towards the \"too sensitive\" range. i advise you to harden up a bit lest others start making demands on you offending/insulting/disregarding us and our playstyles."

"it's not broken. it's intended to be that way. gameplay is more important than realism."
"confirming. the mobile scan inhibitor was designed to hide everything from d-scan except itself.the idea is that any anyone that sees a msi will have to assume it is either a bluff (only one person is hiding with it) or it is a trap (there is a group of hostile people waiting for someone to warp to the msi).if you want to really hide, use a cloak (which comes with its own tradeoffs)."

"introductionwe are the people of nullsec! living for years in this epic and massively rich in conflict environment, we set aside our differences to join forces against destructive actions from ccp against sovereignty mechanics.the new game mechanics, called by many fozziesov, turned out to be the greatest discrimination against nullsec dwellers in all of eve online history. this untested release shouldn<U+FFFD>t build the platform for life in 0.0 for the most organized, united and active part of new eden. alliance leaders, who signed this statement, have collected enormous amount of proof that confirms this statement.we, like no one else, can see that this release leads to stagnation in 0.0 and death to nullsec. only in a short while since the release, we have collected a record amount of negative opinions about the new sov. we combined our strengths and analyzed, what does it mean to live in fozziesov for the nullsec people.our opinion is - this game mechanics needs to be tweaked and the shortest time possible.problems and suggestionsproblem: fozziesov in its current state critically reduces chances for large scale fights, fights that significantly separate eve online from its competitors. large amount of spawned beacons, motivates sides to not engage, but to hunt down ships fitted with entosis link. in one of those cases, to defend off 2 structures players spent 6 hours of game time, most of which was spent jumping through gates and warping around in systems. pilots who took part in all of this were rewarded with exhaustion and emptiness, instead of glory from being victorious and enjoyment from the overall process. besides that, fleet commanding and fleet bonus structure took a hit as well. we want massive fights, not cockroach races.solution: reduction of beacons (nodes) , to about 1-3 per system, which are located next to a contested structure.problem: low skill requirement practically affirms harassment towards any sov owner. while new player harassment is subject to a support ticket. roaming fleets or interceptors shouldn<U+FFFD>t be able to affect sovereignty. the game mechanics shouldn't be a tool to force exhausting actions upon players - a single ship can force entire alliance of players to take part in tiresome and hollow defence. currently the entosis link module is a tool for trolls, not a key to sovereignty contest. solution: reduce the amount of tactics that create invulnerable situations, which are currently based on ship<U+FFFD>s speed. entosis module should reduce speed dramatically, up to 0 m/s.problem: ccp didn<U+FFFD>t give the right interface tools for players to engage in sov-wars, every aspect of ever changing situation has to be memorized, written down somewhere and kept up to date. this results in quick exhaustion and aggravation towards the game instead of enjoyment.solution: introduction of a new sov window, similar to watchlist, that displays information about structures/nodes that are being defended or attacked using entosis module, with pilot's nickname, solar system, structure id and progress.problem: fozziesov has a potential exploit in relation to entosis link ii - using this module allows attackers to do a quick 2 minute cycle, which sets structure vulnerable, regardless of vulnerability period or until the status of vulnerable structure becomes known to its owner. vulnerable structure can be noticed after a close inspection. this aspect of game mechanics negates vulnerability period.solution: remove vulnerability from such structures at the the end of the vulnerability period, but allow owners to entosis structure back up. if structure was partially attacked, it should be clearly visible.problem: structure that exits reinforce timer, doesn<U+FFFD>t regenerate back, which in the old game mechanics served as a defensive mechanism against sov trolling. attacked systems spam node beacons, which can last forever, which is discrimination against sovereignty owners - they must defend their space despite the fact that no one will show up to contest it.solution: a new type of status - defended. if the nodes are not being captured by any attackers during contested campaign for a period of time dependent of defence index, then structures change from contested to defended.problem: notifications about attack contain no useful information except the fact of aggression (and system). solution to this should be inclusion of information about the system, structures and nicknames of attackers. command node names are too long, which obstructs quick overview of the system nodes and forces to expand overview window to 1/4 of the screen, just to see the full list of nodes.solution: to use abbreviations tcu, ihub, station and remove \"command\" from the name.problem: in dominion sov, alliances had means to transfer sov between them, however long and inconvenient it was. in the new sov, this ability was removed, which is ridiculous for a sci-fi game.solution: allow executor corporations to transfer remotely structures via listed sov structures context menu, similar in the way it is now with the customs offices.conclusionfozziesov is currently a long, exhausting and inconvenient sovereignty warfare model. sovereignty is absolutely unprotected against sov trolling. this game mechanics stimulates unintended usage. this situation can no longer exist in its current state. we are highly determined and if all our demands and solutions are not addressed in a week's time, we reserve the right to fight back for our game time and fun, which we were stripped off by the new game mechanics."

"like i mentioned in other places i agree that fozzie sov lacks the deeper motivation and drivers behind them, why own and hold sov, why defend it ratehr then evade the fight. thr meaningless of activity makes it turn into fw, or arranged fights, which isnt why we play eve. feels like a test server battle.purpose too null, unique opertunities and perks for holding sov, buidable sov over time with niche oppertunities, make those first, combine that with fozzie, fix bugs, and then u revive null and the game we love"

"in it's current incarnation, my fellow test pilots would rather be playing the dominion sov game rather than this. we tried to hold our breath and see what ccp would deliver, and while the system shows there was clearly a ton of thought and effort put in to it, it is still not ready for primetime. while this system does promote fights, it doesn't promote battles. we tend to see one or two people in interceptors or frigs/dessies who run the second you form to defend. there are times when you see 4 person omen navy fleets and you fight them, there are no real skirmishes anymore over sov as far as i can tell. gone are the large fleet battles that we came to nullsec for in the first place. it was explained that this would be a system more akin to the faction war style of gameplay, i was not fully aware of how deep that meaning would go. i strongly agree with the op and feel that ccp needs to pay a bit more attention to this sooner rather than later."

"problem: you're trying to hold more space than you can defend, and in some cases, rent it out, when the mechanics don't favor that anymore.solution: stop that."
"its old more than two weeks, its been explained and analysed before, and its been on duality, where some of the people mentioned won the sov competition, and also all of them have hands on experience at this moment, which gives them base to be informed. none of this people ever claimed to speak for you, but for sure they don't need your informed approval to voice their opinion about the tweaks."
"is \"collective petition\" high or lower on the tears scale than \"open letter\"?"
"there is no \"stop\" solution for this.cause if you want to get a claim - bring your fleet.if your fleet wins - you ll get the claim.right now it is more like omfglolz type attack on multiple systems with 1-2 interceptors or even t1 frigs."
"i'd like to propose some questions to the above alliances:what type of systems have you been defending? how many pilots are typically active in them, what do they do in those systems, and how far do they have to travel in order to mount a defense? why do you want to retain those systems?what type of systems have you been attacking? what made you want to have sov in those systems?your goal should be preventing anything from being reinforced in the first place. if you cannot do that, you do not effectively hold sov of that system and you deserve to lose it, or get burned out trying to win the capture events. you should stop fighting over those systems you can't hold on to. getting burned out is your punishment for trying to operate in the dominion sov paradigm.interceptors are perfectly suited for effecting aegis sov - because the only sov they can challenge for is unoccupied sov, and unoccupied sov isn't sovereignty at all. if you want to hold on to a system but can't be bothered to have pilots in it during its vulnerability window, you don't deserve to hold sov there.in npc null, chasing off a lone interceptor is incredibly easy. we simply undock. they never stay within 25km, the range of a t1 entosis. if a hostile interceptor is entosing your outpost, undock. blap them if they stick around, enjoy the view of the stars for a little bit if fly off and ruin their entosis cycle. if they're after a tcu or i-hub, simply warp a navy vex or caracal or whatever to it. if this happens in an empty system four jumps away from anybody, you shouldn't have sov there and it's your own fault you're burning yourself out. you need to adapt. that burnout is aegis sov working as intended.and if that interceptor is bait for a 100-pilot t3 gang on the other side of a wormhole - there's your large fleet fight you're looking for.i do agree that there should be a sort of passive regen of defense index, so that simply going after hostile ships without bothering with your own entosis ships is a valid defense tactic. that way defenders can put all their pilots into mobile offensive ships if they so desire. this passive regen should not happen if there is even a single node being entosed by an attacker, so that it does not extend the time of an active attack effort."
"as head diplomat and alliance command for gentlemen'sclub, we support the reforms proposed by uaxdeath."
"multiple systems that are so empty you can't even blap a single t1 frig? sounds like the very definition of \"holding more space than you can defend\" to me. even a lone skiff can chase off or kill a single t1 frig."
"there is. here you go:1. claim only the space that you intend to live in.2. live in it. your indexes will rise.3. if someone comes during your prime time to troll space that you are actually living in, kill them.4. profit.your days of being an absentee landlord are behind you. so are your days of holding an entire region of systems populated by one nullified tengu and a tower. adapt."
"my point is, that i am absolutely for a good fight.have your fleets ready and claim everything you can claim!i am not against the principles.but it looks crazy then you start a war with a country, gather your troops and next day 1 spy is putting enemy flag on central square and you lose your capital.wtf?!!!!i want a fight, not \"hide and seek\" game. i have them enough in a kindergarden."
"no. no! you're still not getting it. claim only what you can occupy. it is easy, by design, to claim something with aegis sov yet it's difficult to retain if - unless you live in it.no big deal - simply attack a target that is vulnerable during your invulnerability window. then they cannot attack you while you are on the offensive."
"you're joking, right? i used to live in your neighborhood, remember? explain to me how what you are describing is any different from planting an afk cloaker in a system 23/7. hide and seek game, right?if you live in the space, you can deal with the trolls. if you deal with the trolls, you will have no timers. if you have no timers, you will have no problem. the only time you will have to actually defend your sov in a capture event is when someone comes heavy, looking to take it."
"when ccp thinks it's ready, it' done.it's the same thing with the new icons, players just don't like the new icons, what happened ?absolutely nothing, ccp will not go back to old icons, and so ccp doesn't care about sov anymore, it will stay no matter what we do.what's super funny, we just took a station, and now our alliance owns a station, when i try to dock at that station it says: you're now allowed to dock, and it's our station, so yea fozzie sov really is stupid.anyone with a noob ship or t-1 cruiser can now go and take any system they wish in 10min."
"well if that one spy drove up in a jeep and you didn't have any soldiers for miles to shoot him, then yeah, that could happen.you're treating this like dominion sov: ignore the first attack and defend if necessary only at the reinforcement timer. the defender wins by making the attacker do the work 2 or 3 times to win, while the defender only has to show once. you win battles in this system by having lots of buffer systems and exhausting your opponent. it rewards holding more space, if only to make it more painful to attack you.the goal of fozziesov is for you not to let them reinforce it in the first place. in fozziesov, holding space you don't need, don't regularly use, and don't defend, is designed to be painful. it's to tell you that you need to downsize a little bit.you get to select a limited window, when you should have your maximum population on, as the only time you can be attacked. furthermore, if you are actually using your systems, attackers have to orbit for silly amounts of time, uncontested, to do anything. if you can't deal with it in that amount of time, you probably have too many systems.now certain things i could see, certainly fixing any outright bugs like vulnerability timer issues, maybe bumping up the fitting or penalty requirements a *little* bit so that you can clearly counter an entosis ship with its mirror if its undefended. but your post just comes as someone basically wanting the entire basis of the changes reversed, because they liked the way it was. to be expected, since many of the alliances on that list of yours paid for lots of space and/or made lots of money renting it out. this system will no longer work, by design."
"welcome to 2 months ago, when the rest of null sec realized how bad all these points that you bring up are."
"i agree with rusrusreguards, iskies-mommies-toonies-corpies-goonies 0707 m8m8m8"
"also one stupid mechanic that should be fixed is the ability to buzz out of entosis range and make your link cut off so you can warp away. much like cloaks show the secondary timer that runs back counter-clockwise to note your recloaking timer, entosis links should have the same thing, although this would be fixed by adding a speed penalty which is exactly what should be done.reguards, iskies-mommies-toonies-corpies-goonies 0707 m8m8m8"
"slight alteration:make entosis link reduce speed to under 100m/s for all ships. make ships available to be repaired by logistics ships, or other means.you will pull more people in to grid, and provoke more fighting!as attackers of xxdeath's space, i will say that we have done a lot to just harass them, and its worked nicely, but it has been too easy.-signed"
"you think ccp will listen? think again. the have already change to game to iphone mode. that interface. please do not let me started with the rest..."
"1 5 and 7 maybe some tweaks but over all i support fozzie sovnot signed"
"yep...we are still cleaning up after domi sov<U+FFFD> thousands of unused systems all over eve that had sov the day fozisov kicked in that needs purging of sov as there<U+FFFD>s no other way of doing it now.people are trying to defend these unused systems for some random resign..there are no real wars going on. no one is actively trying to take over some one else<U+FFFD>s space so they can live there. all that<U+FFFD>s going on at the moment is a clean-up of dead systems and trolling to try and make people fight."
"we won by dropping titans on everyone making 70% of the people doing it quit in the 1st week and then naping the other 30%we took 95% of the systems totally uncontested. so i would hardly call it a real test of the sov.... we did fix loads of problems tho so you all should be happy about that.not one single alliance in this game has any really proof of anything other than wield speculation on what might happen, as not one single active alliance has done anything of note with the new system to come up with any sort of evidence showing anything<U+FFFD> when a few alliances have had a few wars and real fights over systems then maybe we can start coming up with what the problems are<U+FFFD> the only problems any one knows about so far is everyone hates 4k/s+ entotsis interceptors and it<U+FFFD>s a point in the ass to do the nodes in systems you don<U+FFFD>t even live in. that<U+FFFD>s it that<U+FFFD>s all any one really knows as that<U+FFFD>s as far as any one has really got with the system<U+FFFD> no one has tried to actively take anything people use from any one yet. the whole point of the changes was to stop someone dropping 1000 people into one system or in to very few grids and try to fight. the point was to make every one split up hence nodes all over and you needing 10 of them to win so you cannot just sit 500 people on one grid and 500 on another and win. just having 1-3 nodes that you have to get is just going back to slowcat fleet on node 1 all supers sat on node 2 and all your blues sat on node 3 and never having to move or do anything yes having 10 nodes you have to defend is hard if you live 10jumps away but it<U+FFFD>s not hard if you live in the constellation and were able to stop them rfing your stuff in your own prime time before it even gets to the nodes. most of the time even if they do entosis your stuff there is no real rush to do the nodes if the attackers don<U+FFFD>t come back.. you can just continue using the systems and slowly do a few nodes per hour on alts. also ccp don<U+FFFD>t like the big fights as it kills there servers"
"see bold.no1 shows up to defend but you want to keep it?if no1 shows up to defend it means you dont want it bad enough..."
"and if a whole alliance cannot muster up 5 alts in there semi prime time to afk 2 nodes each at 12mins per node (i.e 24mins per afk alt) they don't deserve sov.if you drop the nodes down to 3 or something dumb your all going to be screeming when us and nc dot drop out super fleets on 2 of them and then you loose anyway. at-least with 10 you have a bit of a chance of defending.you could also make entosis mods only fit on bs's but then you will cry when people drop carriers or dreads on them...all that's going to happen by making pretty big changes at this point is when a real big coalition war comes along you will all be crying that nothing has changed and they the system is crap."
"a \"its on our list we are bugging ccp for\" would be nice. csm hasnt posted **** about what they are bugging ccp about or results they have got from ccp other than the yearly csm report.it would be nice to see something giving us some idea that the csm is achieving anything..."
