would be a tick to select

right now if you want to
add few players to

have to add one by one.
you can select few
players in fleet but
clicking add to watch list
adds only one. could
you please change this
so that when clicking
"add to watch list" it
would add all selected

could you please add
ability to select all items

impossible.
right now citadels are
sort of silly. you can
place anything,
anywhere, so long as
you have the proper
fleet ot guard the repair
window. there is also
very little real reason to
kill the hundreds of
citadels infesting all
areas of nullsec. there is
also nothing stopping
you from plopping down
a fortizar in an enemy's
home system, again
assuming you can
guard the 15 minute
repair window. to give
more meaning to
citadels, sovereignty
and the topography of
your sov i have a few
suggestions to improve
citadel dynamics. if sov
is held in a system by
anyone that isn't you.
you cannot anchor a
fortizar or keepstar. if
you are not the sov
holder and your citadel
dies. only half of the
contained assets make it
into asset safety. with
the remaining half being
dropped. if you do not
hold sov, the
vulnerability window for
your citadel is doubled.
lowsec citadels no
longer have to be
attacked three times. a
single reinfo
this is about that ibis , in
m-oe , isn't it ... citadels
were fine when you
guys were sling bubbling
everyone and their
brother into yours in
7rm- ..now the tables
are turning , the little
guys are catching up ,
and you run to ccp to
protect you .same as
every large entity , that
establish the meta , to
have it turned on them ,
then it needs fixing
.history repeats itself ,
ad nauseam ..
i don't even know what
you're talking about. we
are one of the biggest
abusers of citadels. still.
these changes would
hurt us more than most.
ps. you should fix your
keyboard.


bold is a suggestion that
would inevitably hurt
smaller groups more
than larger groups. if
you want to live in a
world where your
victim's **** drops head
to wormhole space. this
is clearly a suggestion
coming from a member
of a larger group who
would likely not be put in
the position of potentially
losing their **** to begin
with. i mean unless pl
has suddenly decided
they are going to punch
around their weight
class and go siege
goons?i would instead
suggest something to
dis-incentivize multiple
citadels in a given
system or constellation
with exponential
maintenance fees or
even limiting citadels
anchored in
systems/constellations
while still allowing
outside alliances to
anchor maybe one for
offensive purposes. bam
problem solved without
beating the **** out of
smaller groups. most of
what you have said here
is nonsensical, to your
credit however his
perspective is coming
from that of a large
entity. it is however
undeniable that citadels
are an issue but i do
think he is going about
changing it wrong.
> wants to de-
incentivize multiple
citadels in a single
system> doesn't want to
beat the **** out of
smaller groupsi think
you need to read your
thoughts over, slowly, to
understand how
absolutely ******** you
sound.
i like all these
suggestions, but would
also add that citadels
should require fuel.
abandoned citadels
should get no reinforce
and no damage cap.
having just ground
through all the citadels
in esoteria, it was awful.
these mechanics, mostly
the loot drop, would
help, but i still think that
abandoned citadels
should be much, much
easier to remove.

i fail to see the issue
here, also maybe refrain
from meme arrows
outside of the super
secret clubhouse.
honestly i personally
advocate exponential
maintenance fees.

so your major
complaints are that you
don't think loss should
be involved on an asset
level with citadels, that
this would hurt new
players, and that
somehow punishing
multiple citadels per
system would not
punish new
players.really curious
how you justify the last
two in the same thought
process. sure this sort of
event would make
messing with little guys
more appealing, it would
also make teaming up
against larger entities
that have lived out of
one central location very
attractive to the entire
game. every keepstar,
and staging citadel
would suddenly be a
loot pinata waiting to be
plucked for potential
tens or hundreds of
billions in gained profits.
big groups would likely
spend more time picking
on actual juicy targets
rather than small entities
living in the backwaters
of eve. as for the whole
loss averse thing,
content in eve has
forever been loss driven.
possibility of loss is what
spurs people to actually
show up on both sides.
when test cleared
esoteria of the hundreds
of citadels it was a slog,
but if every citadel
dropped a few bs, a pile
of ratting materials or
modules. you can bet
that every fleet would be
swelling with members,
as this loss creates a
hunger for the line
members. on the
opposite side those who
placed the citadels were
under no real drive to
protect them, knowing
that even if the citadel
was destroyed it would
only cost them a few
dozen to hundred million
to safely get all of their
assets back in lowsec at
a later time. i believe
this is contradictory to
how eve is and has
always been. eve needs
loss, ergo citadels need
loss. i also agree with
claire that citadels
should have a fuel cost,
and that without fuel
they should outright lose
weapons and
reinforcement timers.

so you are member of

your suggestions focus
on:>better protection for

easier to curb-stomp
small entities in lowsec,
and make them suffer
more for it.let's not do
this.
if we wanted to chase
down tiny barely sov

already do that
presently. this would
make it harder for us to
do so as we couldnt just
put our staging citadel in
the home system of our

more risk involved in a

but no more so than
everyone else was
dealing with.

hi capsulers.i played at
eve since a long long
time and finaly i want to
summit a suggestion
about null sec raid
mecanics.i'm sorry if i
make some english
grammar fault but
english is not my natural
language and i don't
practice it a lot.glossary:
fight means fleet
engagement 5vs5 or
more vs more. not gank!
fight.story: long ago i
remember a 0.0 with lot
of fight. when you where
connected you often be
aggro by a fc for fighting
other playeur who come
on your 0.0 country for
killing some pveboys.
during this period some
police fleet was formed
for defend farmer and
plenty of junior fc begin
with that sort of fleet. it
was not uncommon to
fight 2 time per day for
defend your territory.but
with years and years i
have observed a 0.0
with less fighting. more
station, more blob, more
farm, more caps and lot
more bail. at this time if
you want fighting at eve
your not sure to have
fight in a week. now it's
common to come with
10 man gang in staging
point stay on system
more than 1 hours and
have 0 fight. it common
to come with 10 man
gang with normal setup
and see 20 man gang
fear you and go docking
...no one want to fight in
this game because
many people think to it's
more healthy to dock
and waiting to the gang
disappear for return
farming because they
have nothing to loose if
they not fight. some
absurd situation
appears because of
that. in some region you
can come in a staging
hub with more than 200
playeurs docked and no
one go fight 10 man
gang at prime time
period ...so for
encourage small fight
mecanic and new
strategic way to conquer
in 0.0 space i suggest
that :in each 0.0 (no
npc) system ccp add an
invulnerability structure
with a 1000km field
area. this structure is
the system radar
structure the goal of this
structure i to scan
anomaly.this structure is
named "radar structure
awesome or
whatever".to prevent
abuse:on this structure
you make a 1000km
decloack pulse each 10
minutes or less. you
can't anchor a pos or
upweel structure on the
field.you add one new
ship equipment in high
slot nammed "radar
disruptor" or a new
specialised ship.
(debate is open ).the
goal of this equipment is
to disrupt this new
structure after a long
cycle like 15 minutes
cycle at 300 or less km
of the structure. if you
finish a cycle without
cutting the cycle the
ratting anomaly on the
sytem is divided by 50%
for 2 hours. this penality
is accumulative.for
exemple if no one come
after 15 min -50%. if no
one come after 30 min -
75% if no one come -
87.5% etc.for prevent
abuse:when you use
this module your speed
is regulate(around
1500ms), this equipment
is usable only on this
structure, you can't
cloack, can't be fitted on
capital ship, you can
cycling dirupt one ship at
time, ship with this
module activate can't
cyno, your invul to
ewar.expected effect:-
more fight -new way for
big entity to disrupt
enemy and harras them
with hitting them in
wallet.- new way for
small and alive entity to
disrupt big afk entity-
more fleet commander -
undefending your space
become penalizing- this
fight can
escalateattacker
advantage:- can harras
entity.- have
fight.defender
advantage:- have fight.-
can field doctrine more
easily than atttacker.-
can easily field capitals
if needed.likes if you
think it's not a bad
mecanic
no,        :) isk.have the
     not fuel.
isk put into a 'holding' ui
element for each
structure, like fuel, and
when that isk runs out,
the same thing happens
as if regular fuel ran
out.this way you get
poopy spammed and
forgotten structures
removed easier, and
you get a huge isk sink
added to the game.2nd
edit: this should also
really be over in player
features and ideas
i don't typically use the
forums a lot, so is the
assembly hall still where
the csm brings player
suggestions to ccp?
ordoes ccp pull directly
from the "player
features and ideas?"
cross posting from
reddit:
100% behind this. i
always felt it was
ridiculous that an
unfueled pos drops it's
shield yet an unfueled
citadel keeps tethering.i
like your idea about the
index, i had mentioned
something similar a
while back but it
constellation based and
each m/l/xl citadel
contributed a different
amount to that index.
basically making two
keepstars/satiyos in the
same constellation max
out the index, where as
it would have taken 10
astrahus/raitaru.
something that effects
fuel usage is better than
my arbitrary hard cap
but can be used to
accomplish the
same.something has to
be done to stop the
citadel spam. that's for
damn sure.edit : since
you edited your original
post. i'm not really for
the isk cost as a factor,
we have that already
with sov mechanics. i
am in agreement with it
increasing fuel usage.
isk sinks are needed -
but citadels are not the
way to go about it. it's
targeting the wrong
people. this whole thing
started more as a cost to
run citadel idea to
discourage citadel
spam. the whole isk sink
idea is unrelated.
yes...larger structures,
more impact on the
index. +1
should the structures
consume a base
amount of fuel? no, no
they should not. they
should however require
an isk fee for
operating.with the
removal of poses
approaching, the cost of
fuel itself should actually
remain about the same.
think about it, with poses
gone, all the operations
that are currently still run
in a pos will need to be
moved to a citadel,
which means more
citadels consuming the
fuel. as has been
highlighted by ccp as of
late, there's a **** ton of
raw isk in the game and
getting added every
hour. we used to have
clone grades as a large
isk sink, but with their
death(good riddance)
several years ago, we
haven't had any real isk
sinks. because of this,
there's a lot more raw
money in the game
trading hands, and in
some cases just sitting
in people's wallets in
stupid high quantities.
the game needs an isk
sink, and we need one
badly. instead of
additional fuel, have
concord charge an isk
fee, call it an operating
license or something.
this fee should be based
on citadel size/class and
location; the higher the
sec status, or the bigger
the structure, then the
higher the fee. set it up
like office rentals, you
can either manually pay
it or have it set to auto
bill, with both options
payable from either
personal wallets or corp
ones. if the bill goes
unpaid, then your
license from concord
expires and all your
workers go home and
leave the citadel on
automatic. when left
running in automatic
mode, you can still dock
and refit but, you cant
repair, you cant tether,
and you have no timers.
this way, just as is with
poses, if they are left
unattended and unpaid,
then they can be easily
removed. in addition, i
put forth that any citadel
that is left in such an
abandoned state, should
follow wh mechanics
and drop all of it's
contents as loot. doing
this would give people a
reason to both pay
attention to their
citadels, as well as
provide and incentive for
people to hunt and kill
abandoned ones.
although i am 100%
behind this idea, i think
that the problem
wouldn't be to apply it,
but rather to apply it
now. people have
dropped a fuckton of
citadels making it look
problematic in my
opinion to do this now, it
should have been done
at the beginning, when
citadels were released.
plus the fact that the
real issue with citadels
in not really to
desperately find isk
sinks like ccp wants, the
real issues with citadels
is the asset safety,
perfect exemple is what
happens in whs when a
citadel dies, the loot
drops, and it should be
the same for every
citadel wherever in the
game, it would create
pvp content since it
would be profitable to
attack, creating isk sinks
via losses.

why not isk and fuel?
also, hi sec poses
require charters; why do
citadels not?
because they already
use fuel? no need to
make them use more.
and charters are just a
****** way of making you
pay some isk for the
high sec usage, might
as well drop the crap
mechanic and just
charge isk.
as stated by
clerical_terrors on
reddit:using isk would be
a terrible idea. we don't
need corporate isk
sinks, we need personal
isk sinks, and ones that
are directed specifically
at wealthy players.fuel is
a good idea, the index is
a decent idea.
i would imagine that the
isk payment would not
apply in wh space, as
there is no theoretical
npc access from k-
space which is why
asset safety doesn't
work. makes a nice
tradeoff for wh corps.
citadel didn't replace
pos, it replaced pos and
outpostoutpost never
required fuelso, if it does
require fuel and i litter hs
and put 10 years of fuel
in them, would that be
ok with you?what about
if it has online modules,
would that then no
longer require extra
fuel?have you thought
about the greater
implications of fuel
demand to keep these
citadels running?
make them consume
stront in order to
operate. with the
removal of pos there will
be a huge drop in stront
demand that should be
replaced by something.
have you thought about
why citadels were made
in the first place?to have
a home....how many
people lived out of a pos
in high sec? none - why
- cause they required
fuel and you lost your
**** when they blew
upnow, we have
citadels, although you
don't necessarily lose
your ****, if someone
forgets to fuel it one
weekend and it gets
blown up, why bother
using them, just stay in
a stationoh crap, 2-3
years of development
down the crapper cause
you can't figure out how
to fix your overview or
use the structure
browser. boo hoo hoo
the reaction jobs will
require it
outposts were also
limited to one per
system. have you
thought about the
greater implications of
allowing dozens and
hundreds of upwell
structures per system
without any way of
reducing the god-awful
method of removing
them? or, perhaps,
having to have your
meatshields pay to have
a lot of structures
around trade hubs and
drawing in billions of isk
would be a bit too much
for you.
i prefer the idea of isk
being used rather than
fuel. let's keep fuel for
services and use isk to
pay the workers and all
the other base liners
that keep the citadels
operational. as other's
have said, we need
more isk sinks and this
would be great.
wormhole space is
littered with long dead
forgotten citadels. you
think high-security space
is bad? you've never
been to wormhole
space.
i doubt it will be big
enough to replace the
amounts needed for
large pos.
i bet they are already
working on making it
close......also, pos only
needs stront when it
gets hit, it doesn't
actually "use" stront
actually, i like it littered,
makes it feel like people
are there. i mean it is
only high sec, low and
null have barely
anything
comparable.personally i
have 2 responses:1.
raise install fees, both
the floor (double) and
the ramp significantly -
that will reduce the
urban sprawl2. wardec
them and start shooting
you candy ass *****
i highly doubt it.
reactions should be
profitable enough to be
actually done, especially
on low-level moon
materials.you say it like
pos aren't being
reinforced every day,
even now with citadels
everywhere.
1) the tether mechanic
is most definitely there
to replace the pos
shield. ccp has said this
themselves and it's quiet
obvious, hell, it's the
whole reason it exists in
the first place. last i
checked when i
undocked from a
singular outpost in a null
system i was able to be
bumped and attacked
once that undock timer
wore off. i had no
magical protection like
we see now which is
mimicking, you guessed
it, a pos shield's
protection. so yes, it
needs to have an added
cost to it for the holder.
tethering is far too
powerful a mechanic to
not have a cost to
maintain, just like a pos
shield did for a blank
stick.2) sure, but if i had
a say in the matter the
fuel bays on these
citadels wouldn't be able
to hold nearly that
ridiculous of a number to
insure that the citadel
was being actively
used/fueled. even if
that's just someone
logging in once a month
to move fuel from their
hanger to the fuel bay.3)
no modules still have
their cost. just because
they are mimicking
outposts and poses
doesn't mean the
mechanics don't
change. i'm not sure
you've ever looked, but
citadels already use far
less fuel than an array of
poses ever did. and
that's before i look at the
fact that once those
refinery citadels are
released we will be able
to compact what once
took a dozen or more
reaction towers and
merge it all down into a
single refinery. that is
huge amount of fuel
which will no longer be
consumed.4) i've been
doing industry ****
involving towers for a
decade. so yes, of
course i have
considered this. read
points 1 2 and 3 maybe
you'll start to
understand. unless an
insanely high fuel usage
is placed on these moon
reaction modules (if it's
even a separate
module) there will be an
overabundance of fuel
blocks not being used.
again, you have to look
at modules fuel usage,
the vast majority of them
require very little fuel
once they are up and
running compared to the
number of towers they
have replaced.citadel
spam is not healthy
anywhere be it high,
low, or null. the
mechanics behind
taking them out as well
as the easy of anchoring
them is simply
overbearing for any
attacker to try and evict,
and far too easy and
cheap for an attacker to
abuse for the exact
same reasons. even
ye'old pos sov was less
cancerous than what we
see now. at least then
everyone was limited to
the number of moons in
system and you had to
kill one to put down your
forward staging tower.
now and attacker just
need to spam a few
systems with medium
citadels and wait for one
to anchor since it's
unlikely anyone can hit
them all at the same
time before something
finishes it's timer.
meanwhile a defender
just needs to do the
exact same to simply
make the grind so
exhaustive that the
attackers just give up.
none of which has any
meaningful cost to an
alliance of means to
challenge sov in the first
place.
here is an idea that i am
sure ccp will jump all
over.. make them plex
powered. 1 nuplex per
day i am sure that there
are loads of ejits that
couldnt be bothers going
to jita buing plex jc'ing
back to the fort and
transferrring the plex to
the citedeals vault.
massive boost in profits
for ccp and sorts out the
problem of offline city-
deals
heres my 2 cents, i think
they should use a
consumable but not
nessicarlily fuel blocks. i
think all citadels in 0.5
or higher should require
a npc seeded good.
pos's had charters for
example.so my idea is
this, make all citadels in
0.5 or higher require the
"upwell reinforcement &
invulerabilty core" its an
npc seeded good, there
will be no blueprint
released. it will be
seeded in all 4 empires
as well as concord / ded
stations.id like it to cost
about 100 to 150 mill a
month(atleast for
medium structures, i
would like 250-300 for
large ones), citadels
consume units 24 per
daycitadels with it in the
fuel bay and being
actively consumed will
work exactly like they do
now, they have
vulnerability windows,
reinforcement works and
a war dec is required to
attack the structure. but
if you don't have them in
the bay the following
happens:1. citadel
becomes permanently
vulnerable2. people
attacking your citadel
only get the suspect
timer, allowing anyone to
attack your citadel
without the use of a war
dec.3. reinforcement
systems are offline. if
the citadel gets attacked
while in this state the
fuel bay is locked until
the citadels self repair
system completes its 15
minute timer (this stops
people from waiting until
they are attacked before
putting the goods in
it)this change does a
few things 1. allows the
destruction of
abandoned citadels
without taking a week to
do so and gives other
people the ability to
attack the aggressors,
creating content. 2.
makes corporations and
players have upkeep on
the structure if they wish
to have the structure be
around long.3. put's a
decent sized isk sink
back into the game. i
think these structures
are fine currently in low
sec as they are not
spammed anywhere
near as much and are
killed very regularly. now
in 0.0 i feel some
changes could be made,
not from the fuel or the
commodities side but
from the reinforcement
timer and vulerability
window side.heres what
i propose. citadels
controlled by the
alliance who holds the
ihub work and function
like they do now. if an
ihub where to die, they
should still function like
they do now. say your
taking a region and the
enemy as citadels
placed all over, you kill
off all the ihubs and
tcu's and put your own
down and you start
holding the space and
living in it. i think that
vulnerability timers
should be increased and
reinforcement timers
decreased as the
strategic level of the
system increases. so at
strategic level 0, nothing
has changed. strategic
levels 1 - 5 increase the
vulnerability timers of all
hostile citadels by 4
hours per level. this
would mean that by level
5 pretty much every
structure would be
vulnerable 24/7.same
for rf timers, each level
of strategic would
decrease that. say 1.2
days per level with
armor, shield remains
24 hours. meaning that
in a level 5 system a
hostile citadel would
have no armor timer and
just the 24 hour shield
timer.
no such thing, fuel and
stront will be part of the
materials for reactions,
the longer the reaction
the more fuel, so it will
be proportional to your
reaction, not to the
structure
i like the index idea as
an added isk sink, but
the game still needs
personal sinks for
wealthy players.
number, not length, but i
knew what you were
trying to say at least.
however, that's part of
the problem, even idle
towers still consumed
fuel if they weren't being
actively used/reacting
(an idiot forgets to
fill/online the silos - i've
never done this ever
ever). this new plan by
ccp is basically just
consuming fuel only
when needed, which
would be akin to offlining
a stick each time your
reaction finished then
onlining as soon as
you've filled and onlined
the silos. basically
lowering waste thus
reducing fuel usage.i
digress, the problem is
we don't know what
these are likely to
actually include nor
amounts, we are all just
making assumptions
until data is released. all
we can do is base our
assumptions off what we
have seen to date.
which is that they have
been lowering the rate
at which these consume
fuel compared to their
predecessors. so while
we know they are
adding ice products, we
can predict it will likely
be under the current
consumption rate. all
this still overlooks the
fact that fuel blocks also
take pi. different pi than
what is actually used in
the manufacturing of
these structures (which
is a one off for each
structures, not a
consumed
commodity).after all is
said and done we will
very likely have excess
materials after these
changes are pushed
through when what we
need is more
consumables and isk
dumps. adding a low
fuel usage to tethering
will not be the end of the
world, but it will work
towards adding to
material consumption as
well as bring some
amount of balance to a
very powerful mechanic.
1.) why should you care
what happens in
highsec, you want to live
in null then be there.2.)
why should highsec be
your dumping ground for
content?screw you
nullseccrs, why dont you
get off your lazy bums
and go have a war or
something, a serious
war instead of crying
about stuff.most of the
high end litter of citadels
is from the first waves of
building craze with
them, followed......by
yep you guessed it
nullsec and wormhole
warlords overbuilding
the crap here.highsec
should not be more
vunerable to you just
because you cant fight
each other, stfu, htfu,
and go back out there
and stay there and do
something about your
own home instead of
trying to muck things up
just so you can
roflstomp highsec
because you are
"bored".no, we do not
need this.
reading is hard - re read
the sentence you quoted
- small amount per
runeach run takes more
time, therefore more
fuel/icedid i really need
to explain that to you?as
far as towers, you will be
able to do 100's of
towers worth of
reactions in a single
drilling platform, so that
is why they are adding
fuel/ice to each reaction
bpoi do have a very
good idea of what and
how much, i am not csm
or anything like that, but
have participated with
ccp on these discussion
for the past 2 years.
the best way to have an
isk sink and also
something that needs to
be transported at a
citadel as a fuel would
be the creation of
something like
"maintenance boxes"
sold by the npc (upwell).
also you should have a
6 month max storage
capacity for those
"maintenance boxes".
when there are no
"maintenance boxes"
present in the structure,
the citadel starts
malfunctioning.- why
sold by the npc?
because items sold like
that act like an isk sink.-
why something that
needs to be transported
at the citadel? active
play, prevent spam
trolling of structures
(especially in null-sec)
and provide a way to
determine if the
structure is abandoned
or not (and make it
easier to clean up
abandoned
structures).as a side
thought, the removal of
npc sold items required
to build stuff was not an
inspired decision, they
where a good isk sink.
apparently reading is
hard, you never said per
run. you specifically said
the longer reactions,
which is why i said i
knew you were meaning
to say (number of runs
put in) then quoted ccp
to clarify for others, not
you. the way you stated
it made it sound like it
was going to consume
fuel as you ran reactions
separate from the
normal build cost. so
again, yes, they are
adding ice products -not
fuel- to the material cost
for the reaction
blueprints.what i am
saying is this will likely
be less than what we
currently see in fuel
usage (there is no
wasted fuel being
consumed when not
reacting outside of what
minimal usage they put
on the service module)
in addition to the fact
that we have leftover pi
not being used by these
new reaction prints
which were used in the
making of fuel blocks.
you skipped over that,
so i suppose reading is
harder than either of us
thought.we all have our
sources for information,
and so far all that's been
said is ice products,
nothing about pi nor
actual numbers of ice
products or even if it's
remaining the same
ratios as current
reactions. nothing
specific at all, so if you
do know you might want
to tell ccp. it may speed
them along since you
know more than them
about these changes
apparently.
i agree. however, there
are very good game
design reasons you
don't want players to be
locked out of stations
(and thus from their
assets and a local base
of operations). i think for
that to work, you would
need to somehow
implement asset
safety/transport for npc
stations, as well as
provide "neutral"
stations for players to
operate from without
having access to npc
stations in enemy
space. otherwise,
players just would be
locked out of large
swaths of space. which
is fine, but it is a big
change and one that
might reduce players
spending time there if
you make it too difficult
to live as an enemy of
the local npcs. it could
be done, but it would
some effort and game
design resources which
seem to be in short
supply at ccp these
days. i think staying with
the status quo is the
most expedient, and
thus likely path for ccp
to take.
i love this idea for the
simple fact that there
are just way too many
structures in highsec,
and it clutters my
overview when flying
through. i think either
fuel or isk requirements
are fine. fuel
requirements are more
lore-friendly in terms of
how things work?
all discussion should
now be moved to the
new forums:
before i leave i want to
say why i do it. i don't
care why other people
leave. i'll say why i do it,
trying to keep up with
some constructive
dialogue here.1. my
eyesight is getting bad
over the years. every
time i play eve after that
i have a headache. it
doesn't happen with
other games.only with
eve. i understand its a
space game and space
is supposed to be dark.
but eve is too dark with
huge lack of lighting.
also the font is white on
a black background.
while it should be dark
font, on a bright
background. i think this
issues should be
seriously addressed to
the developers, because
its concerning people's
health. adjusting the
intensity of the stars and
local lights is a must.
also the "new" tunnel
movement between the
gates is highly irritating
my eyes.2.the code - no
comment about it, too
much has been spoken.
i don't care what
motivates the new
players. i'm a 3 years
old player and the
20000 people that are
missing from the game
are not 15 days
newbros. in the
presentation ccp says -
"we need experienced
players" - well may be
ccp should finally try to
keep them.yes, i agree
eve is not fluffy and pink
place to hang around. i
have lost more then 40b
of ships so far. no
problem with that. the
problem is when i loose
them not expecting it. if i
venture around 0.0 and
someone kills my jf. so
be it. i took the risk. but
to loose my implants ,
because i was podded
at poinen (not even
uedama), just because i
pressed autopilot, so i
can go to pee. no this is
not fun. i feel someone
rapes me. this is how
people feel when
someone makes sex
with them , unwillingly,
right? i like sex, i don't
like being raped. i think
its time ccp to get this.
while we are still on the
topic, because its sticky:
i do pay for the game
sometimes. and just like
someone here said - no,
i don't like to give my
money for feeling raped.
noone does.are you
telling me the rapists
give money for the
game? they make a plex
from people like me for
an hour. i have to dig ice
for a week with 4
accounts.3.the game is
spinning around skills
farming, plex, isk per
hour, ganking, wardec
for the sake of ganking
and such. what kept me
so long was the fiction
stories, the sci-fi
inventions and
technologies. the
unknown in eve - so
much to learn about.,
chemistry, probing, pi,
building stuff. that's why
all carebears still stay in
the game i guess. so
this is where i ended up
- between the newbros
and the oligarchs, who
own the market. more or
less like in real life. with
the difference that here i
can quit.4.i have a job.a
girlfriend. friends to hang
out with. corporation life
requires huge time
commitment.so , don't
tell me eve is a team
game. no, there is part
of eve , which is to be
played solo.i will not
sacrifice my rl for eve....i
did it once, not doing it
again. so here comes
the realization, that eve
requires too much from
me, as i cant keep
playing solo.that's why i
prefer to go.i highly
suspect big part of these
20000 people are
people like me5. no
fun.same old lvl 4 solo
missions. even if we
team up for lvl5 its still
same old boring stuff.
ratting. mining. same old
stuff. sister of eve
missions are so-so. gate
camping - ive done it ,
not my style staying like
a duck whole day.got
more important things to
do in life, rather then
measuring my d**size..
events ? mindlessly
grinding for a drop rate
1/10 for something
which costs 15mln on
the market. the only fun
for me at the moment
are the cosmos
missions. and sadly lots
of them are
bugged.generally - eve
is very, very, very boring
game. which goal is
accumulating money
and riches now? it
wasn't like that before.
and i'm not saying that
because i was young
and excited player. it
just too much stinks
commercialism at the
moment.6.no place to
live. nullsec taken by
huge alliances. low sec
is a joke - its used
primarily for gate
camping, as well as
cyno logistics. noone
mines there. noone
does missions there.
noone is even scanning
for anomalies. hisec is
more dangerous than
nullsec at the moment.
70% of my assets were
lost in hs. 7.
centralization of the
market.everything is in
jita now. impossible to
make t2 from reactions if
i don't go at least once a
day shopping to jita.
rens is almost dead.
others are dying slowly
too. i simply don't want
to warp, jump, warp,
jump all my life. and i'm
catching myself doing
this 90% of my time in
the last 3 years.
seriously games
mechanics in therms of
traveling are f* up. when
my gf asks me "are you
playing eve?", i usually
answer "no, i'm traveling
to jita"ccp, don't you
guys realize how
ridiculous and time
consuming all this
warping is? the game is
not dynamic.period.
while at same time the
pvp battles i am involved
into last no more then
30 secs.8.talking about
the security in hs. i cant
go out with a marauder-
it will be killed in no time
, just because its shiny. i
cant go mining ice,
because there is a guy
in hentogaira with 25+
skiffs , which noone
ganks.or there is a
machiarel for bumping
on every ice belt in
caldari space. almost
every 0.5 (and not only
)of the gates are
potentially ganking
camped. jita is camped
all the time. this is not
how the game is
supposed to look like,
i'm sorry. if i was a
newbie and if i knew all
that, i would never start
playing.that answers the
ultimate question why all
people still play, even
though they got ganked
- because they invested
too much time, money
and effort to quit - not
because the game is
fun! all the patience of
these people will be
depleted one day and
you ,ccp ,will never get
to know the reason for
this , using your
statistics.re-submiting?
lets face it - people do it
because there is no
other mmo game of the
sort.enough bitching. i'll
make another post ,
trying to give some
suggestions, how i see
it, so can ccp do
something about it, if
they wish. after all we
have to be constructive
here.
you spend all day
mining their asteroid
belts . depriving them of
income , taking food out
of the mouths of their
children !then you dock
in their station ??? stop
being jealous of ratters ;
embrace the fact that
you love a mind-
numbing repetitive
activity . be at peace ,
miner .




you're posting on an alt
so its hard to know what
your actual experience
in eve was beyond what
you have described for
us. but it seems like you
never embraced the pvp
aspect of the game.
your one mention of pvp
(gate camping) is one of
the most boring types
plus tends to just be
blobbing rather than
actual competition.
when you say eve is a
boring game i, like other
pvpers, know you
haven't participated in
the portion of the game
that is exciting. so
exciting in fact that the
adrenaline rush that
results is like nothing
experienced in any
other game. there is just
nothing like it and once
you have had it, you
crave it from then on.
unfortunately, after a
few thousand battles its
harder to get that feeling
but it does happen,
even then. people quit
eve because they never
figure out how to just go
out and shoot someone.
they spend too much
time acquiring assets
thinking they need better
skills, better ships,
better friends. they don't.
they just need to go find
someone and shoot
them in the face. yeah,
its better to win so you
work on perfecting your
fits, honing your tactics,
discarding what doesn't
work. but you have to
lock onto that first target,
press the damn trigger
and watch your shields
evaporate, the warnings
screech, the " the
module has run out of
charges" (i know that
b*#*@h! reload faster!)
and the explosion.
hopefully the other
guy's. gives me the
shivers just to think
about it. couldn't even
work the mouse for
minutes after in those
early days. but its a
hook like no drug you
can buy. i understand
that this isn't for
everyone. as i said, i
can't see your killboard
so i can only speculate
that your pvp
experience (except for
the gate camping which
is boring) is as a target.
if pvp is something you
only avoid, not seek,
you will burn out on this
game. without pvp as
your goal everything
else you do is pointless.
you have now realized
this. if you choose to be
a pvper you will lose
ships, you will be tricked
and trapped, you will be
ridiculed when you lose,
you will be insulted
when you win, you will
have to figure out some
way to pay for it all
without pveing for
hours... but you will
enjoy the game. this
game is fun. more fun
than any other. but no
one is going to make it
fun for you. you have to
do it yourself. go try to
kill someone. you don't
even have to have a
reason like my fellow
agents and i do.
although that helps a lot.
sorry about your eyes. i
have some of those
same issues. by
choosing to mine in new
order systems, highsec
miners have agreed to
follow the new halaima
code of conduct.
www.minerbumping.com
you've hit upon the
problem. eve online is a
very, very, very boring
game if all you do is play
it to accumulate
unneeded wealth. it was
like this before, and it
will likely stay this way
until the servers get shut
off. all that has
happened is that you
have either bored of the
current scripted content
and cannot find
anything else to engage
you, or you have
reached a greater level
of awareness and
understand now that a
greater competitive
purpose is needed to
give any point at all to
your actions. neither of
these things is
something to get upset
over. if you have tired of
the grind of eve's pve
content just move on
and find another game
you do like. if pvp and/or
competing with the other
players for things in new
eden interests you but
you haven't found a way
to experience it, i would
suggest you mix things
up and try something
new, but if you don't
want competition with
other players in your
gaming experience,
then just move along.
grinding isk will not get
anymore interesting for
you than it already is.i
do agree ccp has added
an unpleasant whiff of
commercialism with
their recent efforts at
monetizing the game.
still, so far i have been
able to tune most of that
out and ignore most of
the tawdriness. that may
not always be the case
and at some point i will
tire of my sandbox game
waging psychological
war against me in an
attempt to part me with
my money, so i
completely understand if
someone has had
enough. ccp is walking a
fine line with these
monetization tricks for a
game i pay a (hefty by
modern standards)
monthly subscription to
play. i will also say i
think you have
overestimated the risk to
yourself in highsec. it
isn't zero, but many
people operate with no
problem every day.
normal (t2) fit
marauders are rarely, if
ever exploded, as with
tanked procurer/skiffs.
only when you play eve
as a progression game
and fit more and more
expensive modules to
eek out a bit more profit
will you run into
problems when
someone calls you on
your greed. if you aren't
happy playing though,
just leave. there is no
point making yourself
miserable in your free
time. eve online isn't not
going to change for you.
not now, 15 years into
the experiment.
not the same lol.. just
proves how little you
know of eve and how
little you know of real
life...1. putting money in
401k is not the same as
putting items in your
freighter2. if someone is
stupid in real life it
doesnt give you the right
to kill them on their way
to the bank..
i said take all the money
in your 401k and put it in
one stock. that is a very
risky move vs. keeping it
in your 401k in a
diversified
portfolio.nobody is dying
irl when you get ganked.
hell nobody is really
getting "killed" in game
either if you know what
you are doing. spam
warp to whatever while
in your pod. you'll
instawarp once your
ship explodes. even if
you are terrible and sit
there and let them pod
you, you'll wake up in a
clone. even death does
not stop a capsuleer.
