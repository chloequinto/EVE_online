"supporting this also.this whole thing is just a massive fiasco - especially the mutual war side of it which is seeing rvb get into mutual wars with 1 man nobodies we never even wanted to dec in the first place.and massively increasing war costs too..."
"supporting also.with the new bounty hunting payouts, wardecs are going to be a strong mechanism for collecting bounties. this issue and the new system and pricing in general has driven out some of the good mercenary corps and alliances.a simple fix, as probably proposed already, is to lock corporations at war from joining alliances so transfer cannot occur.however the price of wars also needs to be addressed as many clients cannot afford the costs to obtain their goals, this is another aspect i see that is leading to the loss of many mercs in the market place.perhaps bounties will fix that? especially pos bounties if ever implemented, but the price has to be right; for example, when it costs more to wardec than the cost of the pos, why bother, who would pay to have this removed? imo bring back the old cost of wars; it worked fine."
"i'm surprised ccp haven't commented on this yet.it so obviously needs doing. don't think i've seen anyone disagree yet. also, this ^^.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"ok so after playing around on the test server i have seen that the new buff to t1 logi has totaly made t2 logi not needed at all why risk a 160mil ship when a 7mil ship does the same thing. you need a 1/4 of the skills and get the same ship at 1/8 of the price with the same tank with in some case better rep ok u lose like 12k on ur rep range. big dealwhat is the point in flying t2 what is the point in training logi 5. please tell me this will be adjusted to be more in line with other shipsplease dont make t1 logi the new drakes of eve!!!"
"if this is true, then it's a genuine concern.although a 12 km range difference is a pretty big deal. \"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"it is but having the same tank at the same speed with the same rep in a t1 hull. u can afford to move in 12k the real problem i have is if you ask any true logi pilot they will all tell you the same thing logi 5 is a must to be a logi pilot with these ships you need logi 0 and u can effect the fight the same way a logi 5 pilot can."
"i think they will be nerfing it, i read about it being bad and it sounds like t2 logi will be useless afterward... but who knows."
"a couple of things to be weary of: 1.) t1 logi's are not as cap resilient as t2 logies and have lower base hp, lower sensor strengths, lower targeting range, slower alignment, lower warp speeds, and most importantly, lower base resists.... being a little faster, having an extra slot, and an extra rig will make up some of that, but not as much as you'd think.... 2.) the t2 logi's will be altered in future expansions, as they haven't been rebalanced yet.... you could look at many of the rebalanced cruiser hulls and compare them to hacs or recons and complain about how t1 cruisers are \"nearly as good\" or \"better in some circumstances\" than their corresponding hac/recon, but so what.... t2 ships will get their due, enjoy the plethora of new ships to play with now... i've flown exequror's for quite a while, but very rarely for logisitics purposes (often purely for bait). now i can actually use the ship in it's intended role!!!"
"t1 logis can't fit larger remote repair mods without [almost] completely giving up their tank. thus, they will never be able to repair as much as the \"traditional\" t2 logistics cruisers."
"well i dont know about anyone else but i thought it was a good idea; im guessing thats what counts."
"\"time to ****\" its the phrase coined by ccp to measure how long will it take player to create a **** using this feature. used to asses the degree of freedom given."

"limit them to one per system. if you want to anchor another, you have to blow up the existing one first.about ttp: if they're limited, it shouldn't be bad. look at station names for example. worse cases could be petitioned for removal."
"have to agree, 1 per system would not be bad, and petition if someone does a royal screw up with naming it, or doing a \"foul\" description."
"could simply be 1 per system, it would't be bad if they made it an isk sink, it be pointles though."
"why would it be intentional?"

"i would like to see added;some suggestions: high-sec / mid-sec / low-sec each has their own sec specific news cast. plays top 40 of user submitted tunes for 30 min w/eve commercials intermixed (plex/bounties/etc.) this could incorporate flash traffic news if someone has entered the system within 5 jumps/10 jumps that is wanted (not sure about this one) the radio panel allows for station tuning which includes voting ability for the song. add a voting option using 1-10 criteria enable song genre w/user ability to select what genre they think the song is. after intial blast, 30-90 days, all songs that fit certain genre would be moved to their own radio station so that users can select channels of preference.edited for new idea: a station that incorporates aviation comms/radio chatter. all ships in system select locations to goto and an \"air traffic control\" station could play voice overs that authorize or recognize movement to/from locations. not everyone could be on at once, just input some system that enables random comms that simulate air-traffic. this could incorporate hostiles at a certain jump gate, etc."
"this would add alot of atmosphere to eve as well as being a useful media to aid noobs.each faction/region can have its own radio station with their own unique tracks and commentary. you could also have notifications about incursions, faction warfare and random rp commentaries.i know eve's story is lacking and roleplayers are ignored but it may retain alot of noobs which is always good.ps i recommend you add some formatting to your post just to make it easier to read."

"now, if you want them to fix it, have every one of those 169 corporations/alliances submit a petition to the gm staff. if a flood of \"**** you and your game mechanic for this ****\" doesn't get their attention, nothing will."
"it seems that ccp did change wardec mechanics slightly recently.now when you're at war with a corporation, it'll send you a notification the moment they get accepted into an alliance. we've gotten multiple reports of this today, and i've never seen it before. pretty sure this wasn't here a few days ago. this was one of our suggested fixes ^^see, ccp does love us"
"t1 logis are still worse, just not useless."
"the ships get a 15% boost / level to rep amounts... at level 5, 1 medium remote repper on the t1 logistics is almost worth a large remote repper on the t2 logisitcs ships. also, since the pg requirements for large shield xfer's is pretty low, you can create 3 lst / 2x met osprey's that perma outrep 5/1 basi's. you gimp your tank to do this.... especially when compared to the basi's... in the end, the t1 logi's are comparable to t2 logi's in terms of operation range and logistics ability. they just are not as durable.... meaning in larger engagements the t2 logi's are very much worth the extra price tag. in throw away gangs, the t1 logi bring a lot to the field for a nice low cost ratio. they seem well balanced to me at the moment!"
"if this is correct, then with the imminent aggression rules (not being able to dock/jump if repping an aggressor) a t1 rep would be better. unless the tank and rep amount is going to double for the t2..."
"the tank on t2 is significantly higher.... most t1 logistics cruisers have 1/2 to 2/3 the resistances (and ehp for that matter) of t2 logistics cruisers.... the loss of t2 resists is huge to logistics ships..."
"the op is exagerating, they're not better, they're just functional, if you want a survivable brawler logi you go with the traditional t2, fi your goal is just repping power where you dont care about the logi's life then you can swarm cheap t1 logi fodder."
"this actually means we can now use cheap t1 logis for those annoying to fix pos guns."
"the problem after examining ccp's new \"crimewatch\" seems to lay with looting, it is hard to understand how fixing a brokenmechanic with another broken mechanic makes any sense.to get to the point rather, it seems that the entire big fix to others looting illegal is to flag that person so he can get attacked by anyone. it sounds good at first, but what exactly is to stop this person from just dropping a jetcan then looting into it for his corp to loot. which by the way then flags the original owner back into the same situation. this kind of stupid can ownership looting can only be the dreamchild of a shortsighted person. while this is what our current system is, this new change will in term only make it so every ganking thief just has to incorporate a suicider in a rookie ship to get what they want.take it like this, if you go and steal a car, and then, you park it in a garage and a friend takes it, are the police going to stop looking for it because you gave it away? well in essence crime watch says yes, this isnt real, this is stupid.the answer and hold on, it isnt an easy on. the answer is every single item has its own individual timer. every stolen item regardless of what it is, flags the new owner since it is in essence....stolen. now these timers can easily start after it is only stolen the first time, so they dont keep resetting, but it is a much better and real solution then just saying the rookie ship absorbed all the \"crime\".thank you for your time"
"im a recent victim to the \"trade window scam\" now i understand technically its my fault for falling for such a thing then i thought about it some more and figured \"hey ill try and petition it\" only to be told that they dont consider it an exploit and that it cant be reimbursed and that they encourage ppl not to trade with ppl with the trade window but through contracts...so why have it there!!!!!!!! i lost my mind \"so im being told by the gm's not to use a function in game because it can be \"exploited\" but wait its not an exploit my apologies its a coding error it has to be right? nope apparently its not that either ...... still not able to wrap my head around it. if im trading something for say 100 mil isk and is read 100 mil isk in game ....then thats what im getting in game!...... but again apparently its not an exploit when i find only 100 isk not 100mil isk in my wallet its like me writing 2 zero's on a 100 dollar bill and calling it a 100 dallar bill .......ive read many places that dont trade with ppl you dont trust in game using the trade window it wasnt the person i was trading with i needed to trust it was the trade window stating i was getting the money i agreed to now how the in the world can i trust anything in the game if a simple trade window reads 100 mil isk and i get 100 isk......still for the love of god cant wrap my head around how this is ok in their eyes....i understand other scams i wouldnt be so angry had i fallen for those i would just be an idiot but trusting in a game mechanic only to have it \"exploited\" on me then be told its not an exploit and sorry for your loss blows my mind .......when i play a fps i have to trust that when i press a button my weapon will fire in eve when i see in a trade window the amount of money i agreed with and press accept i need to trust thats the amount im getting .....end of story dont know how this hasnt been resolved sooner"

"we all know that over the last few years, ccp has constantly buffed highsec carebears proportionally to how much they moaned on the forums. yet even after barge changes and the 25x increase in wardec costs in the last 6 months alone, they still cry out for highsec to be nerfed to the ground. even after all the bones ccp has fed them, they still whine. what does this show?it shows they cannot be satisfied, and that trying to please them without killing the game will be pointless. so, what needs to happen now? we need a reversal of the nerfs that the carebears have bought, inital wardeccing costs need to be bought down, insurance needs to be returned to concorded ships, eventually ending with an eve unspoilt by their whinging, as it was meant to be. mr. johnny ccp employee may think \"it's a good idea, but what about all the lost subscriptions\", well, do we need these people who do nothing but return to their keyboard every 40 minutes to unloaded ice into their stationary orca, who only interact with other players when they are nerf-calling on the forums or filling local with their foul language? i think not. perhaps some of them will be able to adapt to the changes, and actually fit a tank on their ship. others may choose to vent their frustration that they have the right to sit in space making isk for plex in an endless cycle, and that getting ganked will cause them to ragequit and cancel their (insert number of subsciptions here) accounts.but what is lost in their subscription fees will be gained in returning players who left because of the mistakes ccp has made in the past, and new ones that have been inspired by tales such as a burn jita event twice as large as the one in april, enabled by the restoration of common sense to highsec. of course, gankers are still ganking, but if highsec were restored to its original format, it would be more prevelant. crucible was supposed to re-ignite the fire. it did that to some extent, if it weren't the thorn in the backside that ended most maelstrom ganks. then we had inferno, the wardec fee changes and barge buffs both harmed highsec severely. let's hope that trend doesn't continue and we mend the damage before it's too late.this post was not bought to you by an npc corp alt."

"this proposal started from the idea of, \"wouldn't it be cool if you could rename your alliance's system in nullsec?\" after giving the idea a lot of thought, i eventually realized that this is the kind of vanity item that ccp has been looking to sell via microtransactions. in fact, renaming an entire system in eve would almost be the ultimate vanity item.advantages for players:- what better way to show ownership of a system than to rename it? this would give players a greater emotional attachment to their sov space, creating more attachment to the game.- tired of all the confusing codes for nullsec systems? a given name is far easier to remember. as more systems get renamed over time, nullsec systems will become easier to identify and remember. and nullsec will become correspondingly easier to navigate.advantages for ccp:- this would be a high-end microtransaction to generate revenue.so here's the proposal:- a system can only be renamed if the same alliance has continuously held sovereignity in that system for the past year. (this ensures that alliances can only rename systems they 'own'. and it effectively makes a higher sov threshold for holding a system for an entire year.)- a proposal for a system rename can only be initiated by the ceo of the executor corporation of the sovereignity-holding alliance. (this creates a clear single point of contact for communications from the sov-holding alliance to ccp.)- all renames must be approved by ccp, who can reject any suggested name for any reason. (ccp must keep the final word on what system names are allowed in the game.)- each alliance may only rename one system every x months. (this is to keep the workload for ccp manageable, especially during the initial period after the process goes live. i would suggest starting with a period of one rename every 3 months or so. the time interval can be shortened at a later date if the rename process proves to be popular.)- once an acceptable name has been submitted, there is a fee (to be determined by ccp) to rename the system. (this is an economic decision to be made by ccp. i would expect payment to be in the form of plex.)- the current system names should be preserved as a 'system code,' which is visible when you do a 'show info' on the system. (this is to preserve the accuracy of existing nullsec maps, so they can continue to refer to the current system codes without having to be updated.)notes:- system renames aren't permanent. but, under this proposal, they are pretty close. in order for someone else to change the system, they have to take sov in that system and hold sov there continuously for an entire year before it becomes eligible to be renamed again. so, in essence, the rename is permanent while your alliance continues to hold sov in that system. and if you lose the system, you have an entire year to get it back if you want to keep someone else from renaming it."

"you still have one low on that basi, often filled with an overdrive, pds, or nano... depending on preference. now, compare it to what you get out of the 4/1 osprey, which has 2x lows and 3x resist rigs to fix: the small gap in it's shield hp: 5300 on the osprey vs 5900 on the basi (which isn't too bad until you consider resists). the glaring gap in it's resists: resists are extremely important when using rr. while the osprey has equivalent em and exp, the kin/therm of 51/63 on the osprey to 87.8/81.6 on the basi is very significant. the combination of shield resists vs hp give the osprey 15000 ehp in shields, compared to 25000 ehp in shields on the basi. the glaring cap problems: the osprey is not cap stable with 1 xfer and a running mwd. with the mwd off, it's only 55% cap stable and very susceptible to neuts. it reps less base hp: osprey 269 hp/s vs basi 307 hp/s. it has significantly lower sensor strength: osprey 31.4 vs basi 43.1 you can't fix all of the above with 2 lowslots and 3x rigs: the most important thing to fix is the resists, which can be brough closer to the basi's, but not that much... play around with those 3x rig slots and 2x shield hardeners all you want, you'll have about 70% resists across the board.... decent, but the basi will still have 28% (barrage) - 63% (lasers) - 95% (hybrids) more shield ehp than the osprey (the rest shouldn't matter). additionally, repping to a basi is 16% (barrage) - 46% (lasers) - 78% (hybrids) more effective than reps to this osprey. fixing the rep amount of the osprey vs the basi can be fixed with deadspace reppers, but i really don't think small/medium deadspace modules will remain cheap, as their usage/destuction coupled with the increased demand for them will dramatically increase their price (it already has from market speculation!). fixing the energy issues could be reduced / eliminated by using pdu's / cprs in the 2x lowslots. the sensor strength could be boosted with a backup array. to the osprey's benefit: it is significantly faster: osprey 1700 m/s vs basi 1500 m/s; unless the basi fits an overdrive or nano... making them equal.. it is significantly cheaper: osprey 10-15m vs basi 150-175m. in the end, the osprey will be a good ship, but it will still rep less and it will be less survivable. the 4/2 basi outperforms it in almost every meaningful way, and the 5/1 basi significantly outperforms it in every manner except speed."

"after waiting 4 days for my petition to be answered (i know of others that were sent after mine but answered sooner) i get thishithe tactics used to generate perpetual wars using the mutual war option are at this time considered a normal use of the game mechanics and not an exploit or harassment.if you feel this is a matter that needs to be addressed, your best route is to either make a post in the features and ideas discussion section of the eve online forums, or you can bring the matter up before the csm in the assembly hall section. we realise this is not an ideal solution, however we are unfortunately not able to discuss ideas and suggestions for game improvement via the petitions system. best regards,as i responded...so disbanding my corp to get out of a war dec isnt against the rules??? thats not what ive heard ..... so to avoid a \"working\" mechanic is to break a rule? i dont need the bs response as i know that they have admitted to war decs being broken and missused....their response....while players may say they are exploiting or abusing game mechanics, ccp is the ultimate authority on what consists of an exploit or abuse of game mechanics. at this time, the mutual war declaration mechanics are not broken and using them in this manner is not an exploit.as this is the case, there is no further action we may take in this instance. you may leave the war through normal game mechanics by either offering surrender terms or, if your surrender is declined, you may unconditionally surrender by disbanding your corporation; this will end the war immediately, and afterwards you may re-form the corporation under the same name. leaving a war by this method is fully permissible by the game mechanics and is not an exploit.best regards,doing a bit of research of my own it has been stated that it is ok to disban abd reform up with the same corp name etc etc.... this is some talk about it being done too much can result in hammers dropping.... so pretty much ccp has made it undesireable to war dec anyone which in turn means if you want to fight go to low and null sec or wait for some random corp to war dec you then just join dec shield for a day... as the gm closed this petition i didnt get a chance to go into the fact that we cant join an alliance and are getting spammed by newb corps joining dec shield to catch other corps in this trap.... so please hurry up and catch goons in this trap so it can be considered an exploit...... better yet, ccp put in a damn retract war option..... how hard is it?"

"friendly bump."
"apart from the general \"add pve content\" none of this will make any difference.the biggest overhaul that will have the most effect is fixing the whole broken corporate management/roles structure.i got lucky 2 months after the game in that i got recruited by a small corp, mainly into mining/pve, and got shown the \"bigger picture\" as to what was possible with a little help.with a tow i got into industry, but now i'm at a position where i'm not going to risk recruiting new players, as much as i'd love to do because it's too easy for them to rip off all my bpo's and production, and even with an api key i have no way of knowing if they're a real noobie player or just a noobie alt of a corp thief.and yes this is an now an alt although this was my first original toon."
"fail! the customer is the \"ultimate authority\" @ccpand more and more i begin to regret for paying my accounts in the light of such answers concerning obvious exploits of one of the most importat game mechanic and denying of all what about addon inferno was annouced before.so after 6 weeks of complaining of so much ppl in various forums here i would like to have an official statement from more then bot-gm's finally. this is the assembly hall of csm, sitting on their 0-sec asses instead poking ccp to give answers here.i guess i wont pay for an upcoming bounty system, in which its to risky to declare a war, beause of getting trapped in such childish bugs and ccp-statements."
"i actually don't advise cancelling your accounts. ccp are working on the issue, and they do intend to stop me. they will fix wardecs \"soon\". they're just working hard to make sure the retribution expansion goes off without any major bugs before they start tweaking interrelated game mechanics that could interact in unexpected ways. one step at a time, and it's likely that we're the next step."
"maybe they work on this issue, maybe not - but they are unable to communicate with the community about such an important and obvious issue, ...again after incarna"
"oh cool, new exploits incoming \\//"
"more like within three days"
"any chance ccp going to fix this war system?seems like petitions get ignored, posts get deleted/edited, and seems like political answers from gm's.is this kind of thing ccp endorsed then?space cadet online - a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks - public npsi events fleet - launching 28th august"
"yes. petitions get answered \"contact the csm\" which kind of makes it a \"closed loop\" process because the csm won't even make their own comment about it. what is being asked for here is practically impossible to achieve because it would mean ccp having to admit they ballsed another mechanic up and simultaneously requiring the csm to actually prove they give a damn."
"hello guys, thanks for the mail, and i'm happy to give you an update on the situation here. essentially the issue is this - the team that was responsible for the wardec system overhaul was never allowed the room in their sprint schedule for proper through on the wardec system following inferno's release. they were assigned bounty hunting as the headline feature for winter, and the pressure on them has been to finish and deliver bounty hunting first and foremost. this leaves wardecs in a completely unacceptable state in the meantime, and this has been a major point of contention between the csm and ccp, ever since they were given their assignments this fall. we've asked time and time again when this issue was going to be addressed, and basically told the same thing each time, priority was finishing the new items (bounty hunting, salvage drones, and microjumpdrives) before wardecs would be revisited. obviously this is not the priority the csm would have preferred, as it is a poor example of ccp following through on their commitment to iteration before new features. not to mention many of us still think microjumpdrives are useless.so in otherwords, for most of the summer and fall, there really hasn't been any news to report other than \"we're aware of the issue and speaking to ccp about it\". is that the answer anyone wants to hear? of course not, as reflected by your current email. but its the truth nonetheless, we've just been up against a resource allocation issue that was beyond our ability to control. that is not to say in any way that the fight is over, recently alekseyev karrde successfully landed a 1 on 1 meeting with ccp soniclover to review this situation and once again deliver the message that wardecs are in a completely unacceptable state and that the situation continues to worsen and threaten the usefulness of even having a wardec system in the first place. aleks felt the session was productive, in terms of making sure that the development team understands exactly what needs to be done, but this doesnt resolve the short-term issue of lack of time being devoted to fixing this. since retribution is about at the \"hardening\" phase where its all about polishing finished code, it's extremely unlikely this will be addressed in the dec. 4 release. from the meeting with ccp soniclover, aleks was able to confirm that not only is wardecs #1 on the teams own backlog, but that they will attempt to work on this in point releases following retribution's initial release. we'll keep you posted as things develop, but thats about all there is to share on the news front where wardecs are concerned.i appreciate everyone's patience, this affects all of us (most of us on the csm are involved in this through one war or another) and i know how frustrating it is to not have an end in sight. just understand that we've been in the dark as much as you regarding when this will be addressed, and are continuing to hammer this as one of the most critical pieces of unfinished business from the last couple of expansions. at the upcoming summit, we'll not only bring up this issue once again, but will also be emphasizing the importance of follow-through on broken systems in the future, as this is one of the low points in the road to iterative development when compared to say, faction warfare, where proper resources have been allocated to add the needed polish for the system to function properly.don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions, email is fastest as the assembly hall is essentially a redundant version of features and ideas discussion section of the forums, and we've been long lobbying for them to remove it completely and consolidate the two so players aren't posting in a relatively inactive part of the forum. o7"
"well said :)"
"so..as long as you start no wars, there is no trappings and no issues, right?"
"yes, as long as none of the companies in your entire alliance starts a war, you're safe....."
"+1 to get rid of current system"
"well said? kidding me? do you mean his pronunciation? this is crap.my whole alliance is stuck. the \"major\" improvement of the last patch keeps us nothing else but waiting. high sec mining, industry and incursions are forbidden. billions of isk lost every day. my members became told by any gm to disband the alliance and reform a new corp. what should i say. f.uck off came in my mind. i seriously think about questioning for a reimbursement of lost playtime for every char stuck in my alliance. this is not a play for free game. i pay for everything they announce. fixing the war-dec system was the bigtime project of last summer. i extended my accounts because i was happy to read this. now i spend my money to not play the game properly.every time you point out that the problem is the copy mechanism of the wars a gm tells you that the mutual war is okay and then they close the petition. no one answers me directly about the copying. as i stated before, ccp wrangler said about the last dec shield that the multiplication of wars can end in a ban and is not accepted at all. to ccp:before you add new crap fix the old stuff!!!!p.s.: i was playing around on the test server:micro jump drive: actual crapnew camera mode: more then crapmoney and people put to work at the right part: nope"
"ok, first of all ty for an update on this issue finally.second: this all seem reflect (once again), that ccp dont understands what could happen:not only the most advertised feature of inferno addon but also a key gamemechanic of retribution is obviously a \"trap\" for everyone in this mmo who wants to use it:so fixing it not till retribution would be rediculous and cant be intended seriously.this - in combination with an completely floping \"customer support\" would even mean that ppl cant use key-properties of eve-online for more than a half year.after presenting this in our circles i heard for the first time of my 4 years eve carrer more than one thinkings about demanding back money through complaints for these months till it would be fixed finally.brib vogt seems to foretell already something like that, too.ppl will unsub if they get furtherhin suggested to reform their corps for every war which they have to declare as mercs for the next time.not the mechanics of mutual wars is the problem thereby, but the fact that there is so less to fix to get it running well combined with ccp's behavior and prioritys makes so many ppl angry and frustrated again.after 6 weeks of no information there is no patience anymore tbh - everybody is thinking hard about his next steps."
"lol as long you are not use inferno features u are (still) save... true"
"yes.however rvb's issue with this is, we are now \"trapped\" in mutual wars we actually never started in the first place - and that we have to pay the initial weeks cost for as the \"aggressor\". the wars themselves do not bother us as 90% of the 3rd parties are bears who were simply trying to hide from another war by joining ds in the first place and we have too much fun shooting ourselves to hunt them down. the rest are annoying but usually consist of epic fail groups hoping to leet pvp us to death or who leet pvp camp hubs as rvb space is scary for them.but yes this whole thing is broken."

"the team working on war decs is the same one that is charged with making bounty hunting for retribution, which is one of the highlight features for that expansion (it's looking pretty good too). no amount of posting will get that priority switched up.thankfully you do have a few members on the csm not content to just sit on their hands. as hans mentioned, i talked one on one with ccp soniclover, specifically to confront him about the lack of attention to war dec iteration and the numerous problems facing the system. to my pleasant surprise, that meeting actually went very well and has been diligently followed up on. i can confirm there will be some, probably minor, war-related items in the initial retribution release with many more to come shortly there after. i've seen the list as it stands; there's still going to be room for improvement (ie it's not everything we need imo) but several of the changes represent significant improvements over the status quo.keep your eye out for a war-related dev blog in the not too distant future with lots of details on what team super friends has in mind."
"so sry for bothering you and thx for helping ccp to keep the forums clean, dude.from the initial posting by zerg about this issue here to the first statement of you guys 44 days were gone and you want to tell us something about amounts of postings?? this isn't a sign that you r even not sitting on your hands, even every peti-reply i heard about ends with the demand to make a forumpost about it. gms may feel helpless too or just want to appease, who knows.nevertheless i guess you also do not understand how serious some ppl that issue take concerning trust in ccp's ability to care for money worth quality in the future.beyond sharing the impression csm seems to be to tame in representing player bases interests thx for the further informations, tho."
"aleks, hans, and kelduum have all been actively involved in fixing these issues from the start. just because it hasn't been public knowledge does not mean they've been sitting on their hands. what you should be asking yourself is, what are the other csm members doing? where have they been all this time?"
"the current war-dec-system has such obvious holes:it should not even be on the csms to report it to ccp. ccp should have known before they \"patched\" it. not seeing this was already sad. after people showed the issue it should have been fixed it right away and been done. not doing this is even more sad. needing 2 months to finish it and pissing off the player base in this manner just takes the cake.this is much too important and obvious to oversee and the critique has to go to ccp directly. no player-concil should be needed.i'm waiting for a fix every day.regardsdestriouth hollow"
"maybe they have not been sitting on their hands, but they haven't got their fingers on their keyboards either. as musiaba wrote: in my second answer a a gm wrote: thank you for your feedback on the war declaration system, but i am afraid we are unable to address potential changes to game systems through the petition system.he wrote feedback!!!!!and: we recommend such suggestions be posted to the features & ideas discussion part of the eve online forums, as the developers frequently read that forum section for feedback on existing systems as well as ideas for new ones.they recommend posts, many posts. i do not pay my money to the csm crew. i pay it to ccp. there should be a responsible writing something himself instead sending a negotiator with news like: they heard, they know, but they do not give a f.uck 'bout it. it is not important, but please be patient and pay your friggin money.i am a customer of a product. this product had a lot of advertisement. this advertisement was big about war dec. let me say it in capital letters: all crapcome out where ever you are, show yourself and defend your actions, or better your priorities."
"except there already are consequences you utter simp, the player you steal from - and his entire corp - are free to kill you.extending that to say every single player ever can kill you is overkill.and, as we all seem to agree, anyone being free to take \"stolen goods\" the moment a thief drops them under the new system is incredibly flawed too.claiming it's currently consequence free and comparing internet spaceship piracy to real life burglary is utterly stupid."
"the new system is far more realistic than the old system.... think about it for a moment:a much better example is burglarizing a home or store or car. if i burglarize your home, what did i take? cash, a tv, a computer, a stereo, a bunch of cds / dvds, some cash, some random jewelry.... all stuff which typically does not have a serial number that can uniquely identify it as yours... your car jacking example is terrible precisely because the government can identify a car as yours...in short, this new system is far more like rl, where the police can id the thief (fingerprints, dna), but they typically can't identify your stuff. so, when the burglar launders the good to their accomplice, even if you see it happen, unless you can't prove that what that accomplice has is yours... that accomplice gets to keep your stuff and there's nothing legal you can do about it! possession is 9/10ths of the law they say... so don't leave your stuff in space where anyone can take it!!!"
"yesterday, when i passed some ships from my main charachter to one of my alts, and other ships from my second alt, i was a little bit pissed off because of logging in with 3 accounts at the same time, so i thinked about a solution.i have 3 chars living in the same system, they can use the same ships, but not all of them have 1 of the ships, so i need to trade the ships if i want to fly a specific role with any of the 3 chars. why should i buy 3 similar ships, or why should i log in with 3 chars all the time if i want to get a ship?i don't know who else have this problem, but here is a solution i figured out: 1. shared ships and items tab:shared ships and items tab (not a corp hangar), which can be created like a mailing list, with allowed charachters.so with my main char, i can create a ships tab, or an items tab, named like \"my ships\", or \"my stuff\". i place all my ships or items into that tab, then i configure it to allow my alts to enter it, and take ships or items from it.this way i can have all my stuff in one place, and i don't need to log in just for trading ships, or items.the second thing is sortable ships tab.a few days ago i was looking at my ships, i was searching for my sabre and i swear i didn't see it (but it was there - i just have 40+ ships). missed a frigate kill...2. sortable ships tab:right clicking on the ships tab should bring up a menu, where you can sort your ships like:-show all-frigates-destroyers-cruisers-etc etc....well that's all, i think these modifications would be good, and i hope no just for me.if you like these ideas, plese support me :)o7"
"...you're describing a corp hanger..."
"no sir, in a corp hangar, all the corp members can access the ships and items.if you don't want this happen, you can make roles, and divisions and stuff like that.what's up, if i'm in a 400 men corp? will i ask for a role or division for my 3 chars?edit: also, with an inventory system like the current one... no waaay..."
"i agree with tkl, the corp hangar is confusing and hard to use for larger grp of ppl."
"so... you're basically asking for one of the bigger perks of being in a corporation without having to be in a corporation?"
"you are essentially asking for a personal form of a corp hangar. to have a corp hangar, your corp needs to purchase an office at each station (which is a hefty some of isk in some stations). these are often a limited resource. on of the primary reason people rent offices is to have a corp hangar that they can use to share materials between corp members.... and if you make these group hangars instead, you essentially remove one of the major reasons for renting offices. while your group-hangar is kind of nice, i don't think it's all that appropriate given it's impact on corp hangars. from an rp perspective, you'd think you could just toss the keys to your hangar to your buddy so they could access your ships, but i don't know how to best implement this... ."
"a good suggestion, i use pi on all three of my characters so being able to transfer materials easily without having to put them in a contract/corp hangar would be helpful.you could have it so you can rent your own private personal offices but you have to be part of a player corporation to do so.herping your derp since 19potato - [url="
"well our corp has a well built corp hangar and division system, we share lots of ships and stuff.but here is an example to make things clear:- my \"a\" alt can fly a tengu, he can use it for running missions- my \"b\" alt can fly a tengu, he can use it to rat in belts or do anoms- there is only one tengu, which is good for both tasks (costs 2b)i won't put my money maker ship in the corp hangar, even if i trust my corpmates, so i need some kind of personal \"ships\" tab which is accessible for all my chars, so even if i'm not logged in with alt \"a\", who usually flying the tengu, alt \"b\" can still reach it from the shared corp hangar.i hope my problem is clearer now :)"
"simple... set permissions on one corp hanger so high that it requires you and your alts to have high permissions to access it. give yourself and your alts high permissions.see... i get what you want... the problem is that it takes away a major reason for people to set up corps in the first place. people can instead stay in their respective npc corps and create \"shadow corps\" with trusted people... using the communal hanger to perform corp-like operations without the threat of war decs, espionage/theft, or oversight.plus... the game is not specifically designed to cater to people with multiple characters. it just allows for it. and i personally don't see the point in making it easier for people to operate multiple characters at the same time."
"think this a fantastic idea. of course it would be up to the devs along with the players to test how many hitpoints they should have, what slots they would get etc.but straight up you have my support whole heartedly! best idea i have read on here in a while.+1oh just to tag on the end here, i would not support them having jump drives. that would make them move too close to the role of carriers and i think the carrier is the most thought out capital asset currently in game.but a normal gate by gate ship? hell yes its a good idea."

"one questions no gm wants to answer directly:is the multiplication of wars, from one entity to another via an alt-char corp, and the avoiding of assists an exploit or a wanted feature.i would like to hear ccp here, but i would even start with a csm member.if it is a feature, there is no reason to fix it, but it is a reason to stop playing this game for me. is it an exploit it has to have consequences."
"to be honest aleks, unless you are commenting on refinements not available to us mere players, bounty hunting promises to be about as broken as war decs. a lot of \"we couldn't spend the time to get it anywhere near right so here's what you get\", in spite of the fact that all they have to do really is not implement the features everyone is telling them are crazy (ie: kill-rights as suspect flag). perpetual war lock-in, in this case. how hard could that possibly be to remove? would fix most of this right quick. (edit- in fact, i don't see why this should have to wait till retribution. should be much simpler than the recent fw fixes.)a bunch of other improvements are possible, true. but killing the lock-in would make this largely go away. only effect of mutual should probably be no cost for rvb style wars.its just very frustrating to watch ccp drag its heels yet again on another game-breaking bug they where told would happen but proceeded with anyway. how many times do they have to burn their fingers before they learn?and what software engineering company doesn't let engineers work on fixing bugs on their old code even as they deal with new projects? i work in the industry and that doesn't sound right to me.anyway alex, kudos to you and hans for keeping on this."
"i understand your frustation, but don't get the \"csm seems to be totally powerless and therefore has no reason to exist.\" which really translates into \"csm can't get done what i want done right now, so what good is it?\"csm is not and never will be all powerful at dictating priorities and policies to ccp. that being said, i do see a tendency to give up when faced with a stubborn ccp. lessons from incarna apparently forgotten. of course you do have to pick your battles, but when it's important -- csm needs to come together with the player base to call attention to something that is not getting fixed in a timely fashion.ps - the rest of the post i am largely in agreement with."
"seriously, this is getting beyond a joke now...ccp please for the love of anything holy fix this mess!"
"it's definitely about picking your battles. when ccp went quiet on war dec improvements for weeks, csm got concerned. i took action. when i say \"confront\" ccp soniclover i mean that, i was ready to create a thread calling out war decs as an abandoned feature. fortunately we did have a meeting and coming out of that i feel that such a step is no longer necessary. wars will never be everyone's ideas of perfect but superfriends plans to address a nice sized list of issues which is showing me real progress and commitment to making the system work. it's not as simple as \"just fix it in a few hours\" like a couple above posters seem to think it is. we're not dealing with spell checking lol, this is a complicated game mechanic which is currently and has always historically been prone to exploiting, and it has to not only be well thought out but also be properly balanced between the interests of defenders and attackers. ccp not taking the time to think things through, on wars and other things, has caused enough problems. the reason they hot fixed fw ahead of schedule was not planning out how lp distribtion worked was causing violent economic distortion that was literally forcing people to unsubscribe due to high plex costs. trust me, noir. is \"trapped\" by dec shield; it's not really that serious. i'd rather encourage ccp to take the time and get it right."
"pay my trip to island, give me from 1 to 3 days to get to get to know the current game-system and where to change what and which language is used. after that annother day to talk to everybody about all the balancing-concerns to get it right for everybody (i think the system i thought of and mentioned earlier would work just fine though).and annother day to implement the code.thats when i do it without any knowledge of the current code.i would bet all of current belongings that i could fix it to most people's liking in far below a week.i have almost no knowledge about graphics-designing but implenting complex theoretical systems is something i really enjoy (:"
"so if this is what you really mean - we don't have to wonder.encourage ccp to take time developing new stuff is in our best interest, telling em not to fix asap hot used exploits in key gamemechanics of current and upcoming addons is not. may there a \"nice sized list of issues which is showing me real progress\" what you said - isnt that the problem again: whole alliances are stucked in current gamemechanics exploits, players cant earn their plexes, corps cant join new alliances, ppl will unsub because of no progress ingame and in ccp's policys - and we shall wait for new development steps - fixing (maybe) old probs and creating new ones?yea you may have to pick your battles but the biggest issue with ccp, i guess the whole community agrees isso alekseyev, i would respectfully suggest you may even lead that battle here and not maybe somewhere in future.may (or may not) next major issues coming up then which your own entity cannot deal so well with then."

"i do not. i don't even get to go on a plane. but troll tears *are* an excellent fringe benefit...also, they are working on it (edit, as in right now while you type at them and distract them with laughter). *read* before you *type* i may not get paid at all but punkturis doesn't get paid enough to make good code and show deference to such rude behaviour. why anyone would white knight such an obvious and breathless troll against one of ccp's hardest working devs is beyond me."
"sorry dude, but about what are you talking right now. i do not know ccp punkturis. i do not know what he does and what he doesn't. and do you know why? because no one talks to me in this forum.but what ccp punktaris writes is trollin on high level. at least it looks like it to me. i wait for a fix. i wait for an official to talk to me. do you understand that i am really worried about his comment?someone gives a suggestion. from his point of view a problem can be repaired in a short time. if it can be repaired or not is not important, because it is his opinion! instead of explaining the actual situation to him a ccp official writes offensive in the first post.in my business, my customers would get all the money back, plus a bonus, if i would act like this. a one-liner is always seen as most offensive! if my daughter would answer a reply like this we had a discussion! i do not know sir. from all previous posts it never appears to me that they are working on it. it is planned to work on it. if they actual do why does no one of the officials write it.an example from the view of my companies custom support:the bug in the actual game mechanics is a bigger deal then it appears from the outside. a small group/a single programmer works on it, but the coding is more time intensive then we estimated and we will not be able to fix the obvious flaws before or within the retribution release. after this release we will be able to shift resources to help our community. until then we reimburse all stuck accounts with free playtime/a ship/ implants/sp/ anything... big apologies, ccp icareaboutyou the most important step is the communication with the customers, even without reimbursement!!!"
"1. maybe you should pay attention more to those official posts to so desperately crave? first of all, ccp punkturis is a woman. that's a good place to start. 2. no, the last 2 pages of this thread are trolling on a high level. punkturis made a little joke, and if you can't see why it's funny it's probably because the joke is on posters like you. take your own advice and wait for a fix.3. his opinion is objectively unrealistic and subjectively dumb. i already explained the actual situation, he just continued to make a fool of himself. be thankful someone in ccp got some laughs out of it. 4. punkturis isn't your daughter and you're not the boss. if you can't buy products from a company which employs highly skilled, creative people with a sense of humor willing to engage with even the most intransigent elements of their customer base then go play another game. ccp might miss the subscription, but the community will improve and become more attractive with the absence of players like you and destriouth so i wager it'll balance out in the long run."
"sry man, but from a player to you:this reply is poor and turns upside down what happens here at least."
"a new capsuleer's perspective:been playing this game for under a week. immersing myself in the forums as much as possible to assist with learning curve. read every post in this thread, and while i don't completely understand the mechanics of the problem being a new pilot, it's apparent there is enough evidence to support it being a fairly serious issue.then i came across the very first ccp post in-thread and was very disappointed. if you have the time to follow a thread and then troll a customer who is obviously passionate about this particular situation and the game itself, regardless of how he expresses that passion, then maybe you could find the additional 30min to post a proper response on exactly what ccp is doing? i expect the game company and it's employees to take the high road in these situations, because when you resort to acting in a childish manner such as this i begin to lose confidence in said company.anyway, that's my opinion.cheers."
"alekseyev karrde everything you write is very offensive. i tried to state the actual conditions.1.) i do not care about a gender. if she is a woman she still writes poor comments on the wrong place.2.) all posts here have their respective necessity. and all are welcome by any gm i contacted. and what do you mean by posters like me? from one eve player and alliance leader to maybe another: do you think you are worth more then any other \"grunt\"? you, as csm, should fight for us instead of being the defender of the poor ccp. 3.) again you trollin and you are very offensive. he stated his opinion and you are going to make a fool of yourself by criticizing him in such a rude way. and i am not thankful for the laughs. ccp members are payed by his money too.4.) do you know what examples are made for? and about which compromise are you talking? ccp never gave me anything to choose from?i talk for at least 160 accounts alone in my alliance and i know some of the alliance leaders stuck in dec shield too which feel the same. and i do all the writing here, because i want that only one guy from my alliance is answering here.i feel very offended and i hope you apologize for your arrogant behavior. you start to become pissed and it seems you are taking this very personal, instead of thinking this through in a way a selected representative of all eve players should do. i even start: if i hurt someones feeling by writing improper language i now apologize for it. but it doesn't change the fact, that i feel left alone."

"thank you so much. and i mean for your post not for the message. even if you said that you can't fix it until 4th of december i would be happy. you both, punkturis and you, are my personal heroes of the day. i still do not like punkturis way of acting and the arrogance of the csm member, but now i have something i can tell the angry mob, which is called my alliance members."
"1. kinda sounded like you felt you could talk down to ccp punkturis if she was a woman from your patriarchal comment. i'm ready to say i read it wrong, but that was my initial impression. 2. from one player to another, yes i think some contributions to the community and the forums are worth more than others. i feel every person is entitled to contribute and can do so in many ways. there's the thoughtful proposals, the interesting story, the insightful or just plain \"hi, i'm new what is this warp scrambler message\" new guy questions, and there's funny trolls which keep things lively. aaaand then there's people choosing to communicate in ways both obnoxious and uninteresting. i think the contributions of players in the former category are to be championed, and i have fought tirelessly for them. i think players choosing to do the latter should be pointed out and given some merciless honesty till they decide to make different choices, become laughably discredited through their own words, or simply get out. i've been this way for years; my voters appreciate someone willing to fight for them and not give their sincere concerns the same weight of someone shouting for attention. there's a difference, that difference is important, and filtering out the noise is one of a csm's most useful roles as a player advocate to ccp.3. life must be very hard for someone with your sensitivities. \"unrealistic,\" \"fool,\" and \"dumb\" were polite understatements. i thought my point got across without having to get really nasty and unreasonable, and it seems like it has. 4. not sure what your question is here but i'm having fun so if you can rephrase it i'd be happy to try to answer."

"so we're back to war dec's without consequences and the system itself is still inherently worthless... ok. preventing everyone who got into bed with an alliance from inheriting all of their targets and the other way around would have been step in the right direction but i guess this is way better than the current hell storm."
"10058.0"
"this only fixes half of the problem. if you declare a war on anybody they could still mutual it and leave only one unneeded char in that corp. you would still forever have an ongoing war where u are the agressor and all you can do is petition. the inactive corp would never have to pay even a single isk. this possibility is flawed by design.a good system is one that is well thought out and doesn't need constant \"special cases\" to keep working. especially in a sandbox where everything possible is wanted to be allowed."

":s and brib ended things so well, here you go make things fun again.perhaps dumb *was* a poor choice of words. willfully ignorant would have been more nuanced. as far as you appearing foolish, well it's certainly just my opinion but i think it stands quite nicely given this post.man i was sooo happy to just let it end with brib's rather tactful post. you two should really coordinate better.and you should never ever say this: \"now i at least know how long i have to live with it and when i can start recruiting again.\" when slinging mud at someone who does war decs for a living."
"cpt. picard approves"
"what is wrong is not how the current wardec mechanics work but the wording of it. \"mutual\" should be changed to \"all or nothing mode\". and it goes like this.\"aggressor corp/alliance\" wardecs \"nasty corp\". now \"nasty corp\" ticks box \"all or nothing mode\". \"aggressor corp/alliance\" now has the option to drop the wardec (24h cool down) or tick the box \"all or nothing mode\". \"aggressor corp/alliance\" ticks the box also and now both corps/alliance are in \"all or nothing mode\". at this point the only way to get out of the war is for \"surrender terms\" (in game mechanics) to be agreed or one of the crops/alliance disbandsnow \"nasty corp\" feels he needs some friends. so he goes of to \"silly bear alliance\" and joins them. now the wardec is on for \"aggressor corp/alliance\" and \"silly bear alliance\". at this point, same thing/option can happens. \"silly alliance\" ticks the box \"all or nothing mode\". \"aggressor corp/alliance\" can again drop the wardec (24h cool down) or tick the box \"all or nothing mode\". same rules as before to end the war remain. but with one exception. if \"nasty corp\" or it's ceo resigns and leaves the \"nasty corp\" and or \"silly bear alliance\", the wardecs goes with them. end result is the same. somebody has to disband or agree to \"surrender terms\" (in game mechanics).the fact that corp/alliances can wardec with out consequentness is a bitter pill to swallow for most folk. and with this up coming change. they get that back again.i must say that i do feel like some of the rest posting here.seems that if goons say jump. ccp do say how high please mr. goon ceoif the goons don't like the wardecs, then they should not make them on folks. and if they don't want to fight the wardecs, stay out of high sec. they have all that nice sov. they can make their own trade hubs in null. they can make everything they need in null sec. they don't need jita. and if they feel like they do need jita. then maybe they should do more escort run when they go there."

"how long have you been working on a fix and when did you clue in the players and/or csm?"
"the fix should have been the inability to join a new alliance while declared mutual, not let the aggressor retract the war while it is mutual. that literally makes no sense for using the mutual status unless you are rvb or a group with a similar approach to war pvp. what possible reason would a defender make a war mutual with this fix, since all it does is keep the aggressor from paying fees. this isn't a fix, this is making the mutual status practically useless.whereas, if you prevent a corporation that has the war set mutual from joining a new alliance, you stop the space herpes. in order to prevent the circumvention of this system by toggling mutual off, joining an alliance, and toggling it on again, if the war was ever set mutual, then there would need to be an inability to turn mutual on again until a new war is actually declared. (this attribute would have to carry with the war itself, not with the entity)"
"we have a backlog of war dec stories that the csm is fully aware of (and alekseyev has been super helpful with), they for example saw it at their last visit to the office. we have been aware of these war dec exploit threads since they started popping up and been concerned about them, naturally. the reason the fix was implemented now is simply because i had time to implement it (we are also working on bounties and war decs) - it doesn't really matter if things are implemented at the beginning of a release or closer to release date since it's going to be released at the same day either way.we clued in the players today with tallest's post.does this answer your questions?  eve brogrammer  team five 0  @ccp_punkturis"
"wow... thread started out on topic about a bad game mechanic, ... continued on for a while with good input and some worthy ideas and opinions.reached its apex and is rapidly approaching terminal velocity in it's fall.let me direct you here to the important part:"
"war dec iterations have been on the docket for retribution since the summer iirc. the csm spring minutes were rife with these issues brought up to ccp \"in person\" by my floating head and you can see ccp soundwave and others commit to taking action. so...a while. the frustration on the csm has been the bounty feature having to be nailed down before war dec fixes could be talked about and scheduled in detail. to the point that, like i said, i was about to take this to the players for fear it had gotten cut. but no, i met with ccp soniclover for over an hour and their user stories are strong. expect csm (and my personal) engagement on this to continue on through the csm summit and beyond till these items get finalized."
"the best post in the entire thread (save the announcement of the permadec withdrawal). it allows ceo's to over-ride a tic'd off director's over zealous snap decision, gives the ceo t a chance to say \"ooops\", keep's the option to have the permawar knowing its consequences.all encompassing, well thought out and +10 to you slutty."
"i would agree with you except that there are no consequences for the dec shield alliance to do this. the consequences for the other alliance extend outside empire space, which seems strange."
"it would not matter. if \"nasty corp\" or it's ceo leaves \"silly bear alliance\". then \"silly bear alliance\" gets removed from the wardec. the wardec stays with \"nasty corp\" and its ceo. what this means is that \"nasty corp\" and it's ceo are the key to the wardec, where they go. the wardec follows. if the ceo resigns. the \"all or nothing mode\" switches off. and i would say that the toon that was the ceo would have to have some sort of consequences. fine details to be look at latterend result is that for all members of \"nasty corp\" have 2 choices if they want out of the \"all or nothing mode\" wardec.. leave \"nasty corp\" or fight (or stay docked). now if all of \"nasty corp\" leave and only the ceo remains (one man corp). then \"aggressor corp/alliance\" is just locked into a one man corp wardec. and i would say that there would have to be a some sort of mechanic that states that if no activity happens from \"nasty corp\" then the wardec drops. but that's for fine details to be worked out at a latter point should my idea get some backing."
"yup.what are the odds of you looking at corps and alliances bloating their numbers with alts to keep war decs against them extremely high? any chance you guys could have the war dec fee only calculate based on characters currently training a skill?"
"what a smart ideaoh and on a side note. i would like to point that i was wrong before. the up coming fix for mutual wardecs is needed for the likes of rvb and so on. what i should have said is that my idea is in addition to the current wardec system. it's just way to call your bluff. \"do you really want to got to war and die. come at me bro, lets see whose standing last\""
"just like how a war dec fee includes all alliance members no matter where they are for the sake of 'plethora of targets' when a tiny fraction are only in/visit high sec. strange indeed."
"maybe the consequences would be say a negative wallet for say 1b. and the corp loses say 50% of it's corp wallet also. and banned from joining any corps for 4 months?meh, that won't work. smart folks will move the isk around to stop that. but you would still burn a toon."
"just one thing which is stuck in my head.is it possible, because now it is officially something which needs to be fixed, [permanent war decs will be fixed in retribution.], that all stuck corps and alliances could be freed? i mean we are still stuck in many wars but everyone hides.even if the system is flawed, dec shield is still online using an acknowledged exploit. so my question goes to ccp, the gms and the zerg guy: could you shut it down now? you got what you wanted - end it. the official statment should finallly show some consequences for zerg if he does not stop the crap.otherwise i have to add one more month of doing nothing to the most of my ally members, which means something about >2000<U+FFFD>."
"you guys are nuts."
"you realize that most null-sec alliances, especially one like goons are always wardecced. being in a permanent war is nothing new to them"
"while from the standpoint of someone who is damn near always the aggressor in wars, this change greatly helps me, i cannot say that this is the proper way to fix mutual decs.the problem with your 'fix' is that you're going back on the whole concept of \"consequences for aggressors\" that you touted so much in inferno. as it stands, i will have just as much (if not more) control over the dec if my target makes it mutual. in fact, you've made it so that there is literally no point to ever set a war mutual unless you are rvb. here's how you should actually fix mutual wars, so that they're still worth using as a defender, but aren't completely broken as they are now:step 1: the first step is to make mutual wars a cost burden that the defender must carry (ie someone has to pay concord for the dec). this should be implemented such that when a war is declared mutual by the defender, it is stuck that way for 7 days, without charge. the defender will receive a bill (much like a run-of-the-mill aggressive dec) to continue the mutual war into a second week, etc. the 'mutual fee' will use the same cost mechanics current dec fees use. as with current mutual mechanics, the two sides must agree to a surrender offer in order to end the mutual war prior to the end of any given 7-day mutual war period. (obviously one of the two sides can completely disband as they can now).step 2: the second step is to make it so that mutual wars count as \"aggressive decs\" for the original defenders. if the defender is a single corp, this means they cannot spread the war to others via an alliance as they cannot join it. if the defenders are originally an alliance, and the alliance declares the war mutual, the war will be considered mutual for corps that leave the alliance for 7-days. step 3: in order to maintain groups such as rvb that want a permanent forever war with each other, implement an option for the aggressor, once the defender has made the war mutual, to confirm the war being mutual. this can be made with a similar flagging system as current surrender offers. if the aggressor confirms the war to be mutual, it is free for both sides and requires a surrender offer to end.obviously, there is still room to spread wars around as long as the war is not declared mutual (and could be still used to keep an aggressor at war for a very long period of time). this process of dropping corps in and out of an alliance with proper timing is rather tedious (but can obviously be done). while it may be exploited, i doubt it will be to the extent (both in terms of time and the number of involved parties) that it is currently.i apologize for the wall of text, but would greatly appreciate both player and dev feedback.thanks.adriel"
"i think you are making it a lot more complicated than it needs to be. \"it should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\".the whole problem is the wardeck propagation up the organization tree, i think it should only propagate down. e.g. if corp a wardecks corp b and the corp b joins alliance x, the wardeck should not propagate to all of the alliance x members, it should still stay with corp b. if alliance feels like protecting corp b, then it should declare it's own war against corp a. once the wardeck ends due to it's natural timer, then corp a has an option to redeclare it against alliance, but not against the corp b.scenario: corp a declares wardeck on corp b, corp b joins alliance x, alliance x decleares war on corp acorp a will have 2 wardecks: 1 outgoing corp b will have 2 wardecks: 1 incoming and 1 outgoing inherited from alliance xalliance x will have 1 wardeck: 1 outgoing against corp ato deal with the griefing corps, the wardeck cost for the outgoing decks should exponentially increase over time, unless it's declared mutual. the number of the outgoing decks should not be part of the equation calculating the cost, what should be is the time the wardeck has been going on and the recency of the last war deck. as in the cost will not reset to 0 once the wardeck is over but rather decrease overtime, so there is no incentive to stop the wardeck and immediately redeclare it again."

"mutual wardecs are now pointless in every valid cases but rvb.are you lazy or what ? this is not a proper fix, it's \"remove this feature because we can't repair it\".seriously ?ccp punkturis is a ui designer, she probably added a button \"retract that so-called mutual war\". but where is the damn game designer ?i'm happy to see the end of a wardec exploit (mind you, a lot of them are still possible) and a reaction of ccp after months of inaction, but you're doing it just wrong.yes, because we never saw a ninja patch (anyone remembering the boomerang-suicide-tornado nerf ? it was 3 days (not 3 months) after the publication of the exploit and don't even tell me that adding a damn button is more complicated than dealing with the concord code).i'm disappointed."
"well have to admit i am a bit impressed. it's good to see some gumption.i agree about ccp not working all the way through, although they get plenty of feedback. i have a theory about this being development by strawman, releasing deliberately broken things and slowly trying to come to some working system through feedback.anyway thanks for getting in there. and keep it up (although i don't always agree with your viewpoint). this is clearly just a stop gap to fix the worst of it. needs more work."
"personally i think the whole war dec system could use a rethink from the ground up, and that's not going to happen as a quick fix.on one level you are right, but i don't think its realistic for them to really redesign the system as an add-on to a nearly baked expansion."

"now that is a good idea."
"of course we enjoy the tears and anguish of our enemies, but we also very strongly desire a functioning wardec system. i have written pages of analysis, highlighted all the flaws, made suggestions of feasible solutions, waged a massive awareness campaign, gone to vegas to talk to devs in person, and explained everything to anyone who's asked. you cannot claim we have not worked to improve the wardec system. we have enjoyed the ride, and we'll enjoy the solution.however, we will not be scammed or fooled into releasing people prematurely. you are free when the wardec mechanics are fixed and you can get free on your own, that's always been the goal. if i release you now they couldl half-ass the solution, and then we'll be back at this point in a few months. nothing is fixed, until it is fixed. and then we will celebrate together, and non-trivial wardecs can commence once again."

"first, i want to say a big thank you to ccp, punkturis especially, for listening to the players and helping to fix this. this is another great example of ccp listening to its players. something that most games companies fail to accomplish quite regularly.now, however, comes constructive criticism. i can't help but feel that the aggressors just being able to retract the war makes it a win win situation for them. it gets rid of all of the risk. if they don't like the way the war is going, they can just retract it. there should, at the very least, be a very long time for them to retract once the war has become mutual. for example, a one month timer. if they're going around greifing people (which is their choice and i wholly support it), they should at the very least have consequences. as it stands, if they find out they're not doing as well as they hoped they will be able to pull out with a days notice without giving the defender any time to fight back, even when the war has been declared mutual. i'm not just some whiner who wants the defenders to have as many perks as possible, in fact, i plan to be the aggressor quite regularly once retribution comes out, but at the least it should take the aggressor 1 week to pull out of a mutual war. at least.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"eh, should have put it off until the expansion was released if it's not to be done soon anyways. a revamp to the war dec system is entirely consistent with the theme of the expansion (retribution 1.1?), but the first public word from a dev a mere 45 minutes after an article was thrown up that mittani guy's website complaining about it, the timing of it looked quite bad.that being said, i'd hope the devs would consider a change to the multiplier for each additional ally in war decs. 2x is quite high, 1.5x would be more reasonable. at 2x, the 10th ally would pay 102bil for a war dec that started out at 100mil, whereas at 1.5x it would be about 6bil for the 10th ally.if i could get a single cent ($0.01) on the first square of a chessboard, and 2x for every square thereafter, i'd have 11.5 quadrillion dollars. 1.5x, more reasonable.and maybe throw in some other sort of calculation besides just the size of the alliance/corp to be decced, maybe some sort of point between the size of the pilot roster the deccer and the deccee and those that follow as well."

"if the original aggressors can now withdraw from a now mutual war then whats the point in declaring it mutual in the first place? how are defenders supposed to ransom their former aggressors now turned victims if they're allowed to leave any time they want?if anything there should be a set fee = to a % of the losses of the defenders required by the aggressors to withdraw from the war. you could even use the figures from the war reports to figure the maths say 1-25% adjustable by the defender. there shouldn't be a limit to the maximum pool of losses totaled in the % since the aggressors can withdraw anytime and should do so once they realize they'll be unable to pay the fees if they continue to get kills.ex: attackers end up destroying 50 billion in assets the denfenders can set the fee for them to withdraw up to 25% if they purely want to recover isk from their losses or they can set the amount lower if there is some other goal that they wish to achieve and not necc the isk. such as withdrawing from some region of space etc. if the defenders wanted to recover the full amount of their losses they can always declare a war on their attackers once they withdraw and make their demands. that way there are still consequences to the aggressors for declaring the war and to make all things mutual defenders who would like to withdraw from a war should have to surrender and meet the demands of the aggressor. to prevent people from simply war deccing someone with no intent of ending a war then provide defenders with a way to withdraw themselves from the war as well. if a defender decided to choose this route it should secure their freedom from the wardec system for a single week to prevent alt corps/alliances of the aggressors from deccing them immediately after they just withdrew this should help with griefing.the solution could be to have the defenders pay an isk ransom dependent on the number of members they had when the war started. somewhere around 2.5 million per member would be fair i think and have it scale so that a corp of 1k members wouldn't have to pay a ridiculous fee. the scale could range from a maximum of 1 billion for a smaller corp/alliance up to 10 billion for a larger corp/alliance that way the cost isn't so demanding that it simply cannot be paid.ex: a corp that started with 100 members would have to pay 250 million isk to withdraw from the war which would go to the aggressors otherwise they can defend themselves and if things go well they can declare it mutual and recover up to 25% of their losses if they can make the aggressors withdraw. other wise if the the war isn't declared mutual and the aggressors end up not continuing the war after a week then there is no isk paid either way.if anything the war declaration system should be viewed as an extension of the new bounty system allowing the aggressors the opportunity to collect isk from a corp/alliance that has had a high bounty placed on them by hunting them in high sec with the risk of consequences should they do poorly and become victims themselves. the above system should facilitate such a concept and work well in conjunction with the new bounty system that is being released."

"fair enough. i will open a new thread with the issue i raised earlier in the thread in regards to another exploit/abuse of the current war dec mechanics."
"right now it sounds like ccp have implemented our second best option to solve the wardec issue. \"we continue as is, allowing perfect copying/transfer, instead preventing mutual infinite wardecs\"however i'm no longer sure what their intended design for the wardec system is. i thought they wanted declaring wars to be some sort of commitment, such as locking the aggressor in for at least a week. now it sounds like we can declare war, kill an offline tower, retract the war, move on to next target. this is how it used to be, and i'm actually good with that.that fix would solve 95% of all the issues. which is good. but we were hoping to get lots of the smaller features fixed as well (wardec costs, wardec transfers (solved by the fix), exploits related to surprising enemies in space (semi addressed by notifications), dead corp fixes, surrender mechanic loopholes, etc). however, it is awesome that they implemented notifications to warn deccers that their targets have joined an alliance. that was very much a step in the right direction, and was one of the little things on our list of awesome that they implemented. i hope they continue along this line and continue to push little changes into the game to make the system more intuitive and balanced."

"it was heady days when these wardecs came out. we got the first assist in eve on a dec which we copped by troll-o-loling some very angry russians in their wormhole. i can't remember why we dropped it from being mutual, but it did occur to me pretty early on that when alts of moar tears were joining dec shield something was going wrong with the war dec system. it's the katamari thing, really, decs can be katamari'd into one organisation which never drops a dec ever, so it basically turned the old system on its head; the girefer became the defender except it was free and forever and sticky.creating a permadec possibility was stupid. but the idea of consequences is not. the whole problem with the wardec system is that it is a system which allows non-mutual wars, aka griefing. this isn't a defense of carebearing as a life choice or excoriating people who gain enjoyment from the tears of others (people who know me will know i find tears piquant delicacies). but it's just the way the people who play this game are: intelligent (in the main), cunning (in the minority, but thats all it takes), creative, evil and greedy. if you let an eve player loose on any system, they will find a hole and strap on a chilli-coated pineapple to exploit the hell out of it, for maximum tears. in allowing wars, it allows people's griefing to happen. you used to be griefed by 0rphans, more queers, pendulum of dumb and others declaring war on your corp when it was new, was growing (get on to to eve-who's top ten growth corps, its going to be yours), when you spammed recruitment too much, etc. if your corp was reasonably well run, people were realistic and the leadership were competent and dedicated, it meant absolutely nothing; you'd ride out a week or two and the wars would go away. month max of blueballing them and they would drop. now, the griefing is on the defensive. perma-mutual is one half the problem, the other half is the katamari problem. together, you have a giant space dungbeetle pushing a star-sized solar mass of crap into the griefer's corner. it has no doubt stopped the former predatory griefing of noob corps run by noobs, because eventually the serial griefers will get caught by dec shield and similar when they run across a ceo with their in-game browser open to the forums instead of cat photos.the problem is that when the katamari of pvp lands in your lap, leaking a deluge of tears and pvp on tap, of course you won't give it up. you can't ever be blueballed into dropping the katamari dec due to boredom. so i guess it is back to the old system of opportunistic griefing decs, but with people able to holler for a hand...which is fine, to my mind. try to gather some tears and pad your killboards with badgers, and if someone taps out for help, run away to shoot noobs."

"so, in summary here on page 12:war decs are now exactly like they were before the war changes except:they cost stupid amounts more iskyou can call for allies[of a request for change ask: who benefits?]("
"they don't. the reason that is even an issue people are complaining about is because they haven't listened the hundreds of times punkturis has stated that she's a programmer, not a game designer, and that she codes up what the game designers agree upon. the game designers being the team that interacts with the csm and the playerbase on the forums. it's perfectly normal not only for the programmer to only have spoken with one individual, its also normal for the programmers to not speak with the csm at all. just because a few angry posters here don't understand this doesn't mean that ccp is saying they only get one opinion about an issue before making a decision."
"that isn't a fix, it's removing a feature. perhaps a static payment option of oh, 200 million and then either party (the defender who made it mutual or the aggressor) could \"buy out\" of the mutual war-dec. putting it in the hands of the aggressor removes the entire reason to make a war mutual, which is to punish the aggressor for starting a war they could not handle. now there's literally no reason to make a war mutual since your fix is more amounting to swinging a bat at the feature, smashing it, and calling it done. actions should have consequences in eve, start a war that you can't handle, you should have to pay to get out of it. but i guess that's just pointless carping since the \"some people don't like features!\" cop-out is being thrown around already.lazy, ccp. just lazy."

"yes.the original incarnation of the new system was how i would advertise eve online.huge numbers of allies could join forces to fight against much larger (and in most cases null sec based) entities in empire space.even better the defenders could punish the attackers by locking them into the war through the mutual setting.then we got screwed because someone decided having huge numbers of people fighting each other in a pvp based game was a bad thing. entirely my own opinion but i suspect its because we were fighting them in empire not in null. now we get it again because someone again decided that having huge numbers of people fighting each other in a pvp based game was a bad thing. the whole thing needs looking at from the bottom up again. - - - - - -edit: this bit is all like total fantasy. like ever.my take: we got the flags system now. an added 'pvp' flag is needed. if you are part of a sov holding alliance its turned on. if you choose to, you can turn it on. anyone with this flag on can fight each other, anywhere.because 'we dont need empire anyway' amirite?[of a request for change ask: who benefits?]("
"this is what happens when you have people in charge that have zero idea what it means to live in a wormhole stop messing with wormholes the csm was made to look like idiots several months ago when they went on a rampage because worm holes have abc ore claiming that only null sec should have abc then when it was explained that worm holes are null sec they are just not their version of null sec they still threw a fit about it thank god ccp did not listen to them then stop making changes when the people who live in the wormholes are not asking for a change if high sec players demanded a change to null sec or threaten the way the large alliances play the game they would be shunned, laughed at, and there is no question that they would be completely ignored so do the same thing and ignore these people who want to bring their play style to wormholes we do not need cap ships in c1-4s we do not need 400 man fleets jumping through one worm hole that is how you play this game not us"

"now that i can finally post after the hurricane took away my internet for half a month, i'll start here.to all the people who are advocating that aggressors, post-fix, should either be locked in for a certain period of time, or have to pay a fee (or both), to get out of a mutual war, please consider the following to the best of your abilities:as long as it's possible for wars to be spread in a viral manner, neither of the above options would fix the war system from the broken and exploitable state it is in now.1. in the case of a timer, it wouldn't work because any period of time that's longer than instantaneous would mean that it will be just as possible to spread mutual wars ad infinitum as it is today. observe: corporation a declares war on corporation b. corporation b joins alliance 01, which proceeds to set the war mutual. corporation a decides to retract the war, but needs to wait a week for the process to complete. corporations b-z leave alliance 01, and join alliances 02-26 during this time frame. alliances 02-26 all set their newly-acquired wars mutual.this process will continue infinitely, since fresh wars are created for every corporation that leaves an alliance, and the infection continues to spread. dec shield would continue to function normally, albeit would need extra corporations and alliances to handle the time-limited load. the only way to avoid this is by either allowing aggressors to instantly revoke wars, or by removing the capacity for a single war to be infinitely transferred to new entities.2. in the case of a fee, it wouldn't work because as long as the aggressor doesn't immediately pay off the defender when the defender makes a demand, the defender would be able to infinitely spread the war, thus ensuring that the aggressor would have to pay off a potentially-infinite number of other defenders.observe: corporation a declares war on corporation b. corporation b sets a buyout price of 1 billion isk. corporation a declines this offer. corporation b joins alliance 01. alliance 01 sets the buyout price at fifty trillion isk. corporation a wants to retract the war, but can't, because it has to pay a fee that is virtually impossible to pay. corporations b-z then proceed to leave alliance 01, and join alliances 02-26. alliances 02-26 proceed to set set their newly-acquired wars mutual and set buyout prices at fifty trillion each.this process will continue infinitely, since fresh wars are created for every corporation that leaves an alliance, and the infinite war continues to spread, unless the aggressors agree to pay off the defenders. even if the fees have a hard-coded limit, it's still possible to create so many instances of new wars that it's virtually impossible for the aggressors to ever get out. dec shield would continue to function normally, albeit would need extra corporations and alliances to ensure that the aggressors can't pay their way out, even if the monetary limit per individual war is relatively low. the only way to avoid this is by either allowing aggressors to instantly revoke wars, or by removing the capacity for a single war to be infinitely transferred to new entities.do you guys understand this? either wars can be revoked within the period of 24 hours (the same amount of time it takes to join a new alliance), or wars shouldn't be able to spread beyond their original recipients. any other solution will allow some form of \"infinite\" dec shield to exist."
"i think they are talking about an instantly revokable wardec (aka the old system). i haven't explicitly tested this yet, but i was under the impression that when a corp is booted from the alliance it starts the wars a new war, and gives it a new 7 day timer. i'm experiencing this on a corp atm, but i'll actually measure it with my new transfer corp. if that's true, and they don't have instantly revokable wars, then all we'd have to do is bounce corps back and forth between a pair of alliances and we'd be able to keep wars permanently active even in unmutual states.there are also some mutual toggling games i have in mind to preserve wars, but we'll have to wait and see. i am of course open to suggestions on how to break whatever new system they generate. we are of course laying out our thoughts here so they can preemptively counter them if they choose."

"pretty much this.don't like the idea of a static payment though. i think that the aggressors, if wanting to drop out of a mutual war, should have a 1 week timer, so that they are stuck for at least that long. the war should not be transferable in any way during that time.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

"\"however i'm no longer sure what their intended design for the wardec system is.\"not sure they are either.small improvements are welcome, but there is still a far larger conversation to have. thank you for appropriate stick poking to bring this need to light."
"i always thought that the mutual war \"flag\" should be considered a counter-wardec, making both parties the aggressor (and simultaneously defender? i've proposed before that both parties in a mutual war should be able to call in allies). war was maintenance free while both parties are agreed. when the original attacker rescinds, he becomes just a defender and the counter-aggressor (originally the defender) needs to pay for the upkeep of the war as if he started it, if he wants it to continue (probably should get a one week cool down for free).just throwing this out there."
"you wouldn't work on the right topic if you won't get fire from both sides. if you happen to get no bad feedback you simply work on something most people don't care about. as soon as you do get that feedback, you know something is right because people care. in order to retreat from a mutual war the aggressor might simply pay concord again to drop the case. but some cost wouldn't harm since concord has to do some additional paperwork right?"
"oh well, good for the aggressors. now they'll never have the tables turned and be forced into something *they* don't want.i mean of course the infinite mutual decs were stupid, but the fix is a hamfisted one"

"just a suggestion about mutual war and consequences.corp a decs b and pays wardec fees. corp b wants to punish corp a and thinks that has abilities to do it (so want to create consequences for attacker). corp b makes war mutual with simple rules:1. each corp pays a highest of two wardec fees +50% each week (or maybe each corp pays it's own fee), but only 10-20% goes to concord. main part goes to war isk pool. 2. each week mutual war goes pool increases by fees.3. corp which wins the war (by accepting surrender or if war was retracted) gets everything from the pool.so corps involved in mutual dec will have to put isk into it. commit into the war. and defenders - have a chance to get something from it.north"

"you know, aside from announcing war decs would receive another round of iterations in retribution just like faction warfare. back in the spring. and the csm minutes. other than that though."
"i'd go with:- mutual = both agree. no 1-sided crap. declining a mutual would be no different than declining a surrender.- no joining an alliance while your corporation has a mutual wardec going. that must be resolved prior to joining a new alliance. war = ok, mutual war = not ok.- dissolving of a corporation/alliance = purged issue. \"last man standing\" = them. (the old \"reform\" avoidance gig)as for \"scraping off\" a war declared on a corporation:if that corporation joins and leaves an alliance, the war follows them - not staying on the alliance. an inheritance attributed attached to the war -- source style -- with a notice to the parties that the alliance level war with that aggressor will end in 24 hours upon that corporation leaving (a war follows the original target). \"leaves\" meaning for any reason - kicked or voluntary or dissolved. any \"not in it\" means a war enters 'cooldown' phase.that should end most scraping off issues and any concerns about someone bouncing through alliances. if you want to keep a war on a given alliance, your ceo would have to file to keep that war against said alliance. if not, 24 hours after your target leaves that alliance, the alliance level war ends but the target corp retains that war status.if you step into a trap, you stepped into it - suck it up and fix it by dissolving your organization yet such a trap needs consent. as such, both groups would need to agree to a mutual war -- you know... \"mutual\" as in more than 1 agreeing to something?turning a \"last team standing\" contest into a \"we're losing so we'll just drop it\" by those that started a fight is poor form. their actions should hold consequences, not more lulz, but this current situation is pretty lame, with the proposed \"fix\" being on par with the problem it attempts to resolve."
"other iterations? the only thing wardec i am aware of going into retribution is this quickfix, which wasn't planned.so from that i would deduce there is work planned for follow up patches?i remember talk of it i think, but it seemed to fall off the dev roadmap. is there is something still relevant around saying what they might do? (i suppose rr changes and crimewatch might qualify.)not meaning to argue with you here, but i thought you went to badger them because you saw communication fall off to near nothing on this topic. so haulus bitchus would seem to have a point even if perhaps he overstated his case.ps - not a subscriber to any bias or tinfoil hat theories in this case. it was a problem that needed to be fix that dragged on too long and effected too many people. it eventually hit goons & co, which is unsurprising considering how many people that represents. it is entirely plausible that there was no communication or bias here. and even if there was, so what? it clearly needed to be fixed, many people were lobbying hard. if cfc added their voice to the chorus at the end, is that really something to be concerned about?"
"could a dev please answer my question? i can see your all enjoying deleting posts that troll ccp but whilst your at it......if a war dec is dropped by the corp that created it in the first place is this immediate or is there a week long timer?thanks"
"nonsense. they weren't clueless. they were chaotic neutral about it. they thought the abuses were clever and insightful, and wanted me to share details with them. i did, and they were forwarded to others. they have known about this stuff for quite some time, and it's pretty obvious that they've also been working on it for quite some time. changes don't crop up overnight, they require planning and documentation. ccp have been really good sports about the whole thing. we're all on the same team about getting wardecs working properly. there's much bitterness in this thread and the main thread due to ruined gameplay for thousands. it's to be expected.but you know... if ccp accepted one of my wardec transfer corps into ccp alliance... i could catch those griefers for you... just saying..."
"that's counterproductive. now i want to post bad posts."
"citation needed."
"i'm a bit bitter not because of the \"ruined gameplay\" (i wasnt even affected, meh ) but because it was a bad display of a lack of communication for many months, excessive duration for a fix, wrong answer to the problem (i want my mutual wardecs back please) and it looks a bit like a ninja-patch (where is the devblog ? instead of a 3-lines post).we can be friends again."
"ok - pretty easy pos's flogging a dead horsea fully modular design for pos's - that's an old thread including pictures for folks to look at to visualize the design idea (yes, the discussion on this does go back to *before* 2006 -- it was a \"dead horse\" back then)next - full control capabilities on access think like a network manager assigning rights and applying them to individuals, groups and system resourcesa modular design would resolve a lot access control at such granular levels would allow for very flexible use of all the resources"

"unfortunately noone answersed to that proposal. i support this.at the moment the alliance has to give all bms manually to the ceo of new joining corporations, which seem to be ineffective. why not do similar to corp bms? by the way, thanks for this possibility ccp,. maybe just make a culumn in the bookmarks overview where ceo can make an x for \"share with alliance\" or something like that. only ceos/directors should be able to create allaince bms, to prevent spam. allaince leaders should be able to rename these bms to garantee an alliancewide identical system for bm names."
"wednesday bump"
"+100000000hire this (wo)man!"
"it seems to me that we're both in agreement, mainly about the validity of the second option i presented. however, you need to understand why preventing corporations with outgoing mutual wars from joining alliances is objectively bad game design.all the defender has to do to trap the aggressor is create a new corporation, and leave one person in the old one to make sure that the aggressor is screwed forever. why do we want to punish players for using valid game features, such as wars? this type of design could severely punish old, established corporations that declare wars.do you think it's fair to force old, well-known corporations with rich combat and alliance histories to reform, just because they can never join an alliance again? i personally don't think so. the defenders, in the case of war, have the option to leave their corporations temporarily, to try to wait out the war, for which the aggressor has to pay, and thus is unlikely to maintain forever. the aggressor, on the other hand, has no option but to disband if caught in a perpetual war, which is free for the defenders to maintain.that is not balance. how would you feel if the defenders could never leave their corporations to join new ones? i ask, because with the current movement restrictions, the aggressors are subject to a very similar experience."
"as i said when this whole party kicked off, dev blogs are released on a schedule. a war one will be coming when it's the war ones turn."
"okay starting up, alexi would you mind answering how you were able to quote from a gm deleted post 2 1/2 hours after it was deleted .. going to errr on the side of non tin foil and say it was on your screen and not updated otherwise ... well we will wait for your relpy.as for communication, yes there was a vague promise of iterating war decs back in the spring, along the lines of soon(tm). we all know that statements like that cannot be taken seriously.csm minutes, really? does anyone actually read them or just gets the tl;dr summaries from various news sites. there are only 2 official forms of communication, ccp news article or dev blog. the rest is just candy.as for the change, can we please get confirmation of the cooldown timers post withdrawl and how a withdrawn dec would afftect a character that left while the war was active? would they still be locked out of returning to the agressor corp for 1 week?"
"yes, plenty of folks who are interested in upcoming changes, ccp/csm planning, and who care enough to want to be part of the process of improvement, do actually take the time to read the summit minutes. every page of them. if someone chooses to skim them or read a summary instead, that's great, but it hardly leaves them room to complain if they missed something.keep in mind - dev blogs are usually used for items that are actively in the development pipeline, and nearing release. there are always exceptions of course, but its highly unusual for ccp to release a dev blog regarding something they might do but are unsure of. as for the vague promises in spring, of course they aren't to be taken seriously. ccp is very careful about making hard and fast commitments to feature changes until they've gone through the process of evaluating their need, the feasibility of implementatoin, and of course whether there is room in the sprint cycle to complete such changes. until you see patch notes, nothing is ever certain. back in spring, release planning for the work to be done in fall / winter hadn't even started (that takes place after summer vacation) so it was all subject to change.ccp is still looking into the state of wardecs and evaluating whether or not they can fit any other fixes into the initial dec. 4 release. i know its frustrating not knowing exactly what's coming months and months ahead of time, but that's just the reality of the development process."

"i know some of this this can be done over the usage of key bindings, but i would like a little more visual feedback:as such i would like to propose set of buttons for f1-f8 and the alt + ctrl variants.examples of utility buttons could be: launch drones - will turn green when max # of drones outside, red - drones returning to dronebay.engage drones - will be green when your drones are attackinglaunch drones (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) - customizable button allowing players to make presets for different types of combatset speed to x - will turn green when ship achieves said speed (also allows more than 1 preset)keep at distance y; orbit at z: similar to above with similar possibility of multiple presets load ammo x: reloads designated weapon modules to specified ammo; if weapon is firing - does it at the end of the firing cycle; turns green when weapons are loaded with correct ammo (or if weapons are firing blinks red to specify inability to act)they could be created via context menu when right-clicking on \"module\" slotsthis might significantly reduce amount of keybindings new people need to learn and allow them to adapt to fast paced style of combat much faster.additional feedback would also help new players not to get lost or overloaded with all the information they have to keep in check.would also makes game less forgiving to forgetfulness: a single green button would provide a lot of essential information that even older players usually spend extra seconds to acquire (all drones deployed, drones not attacking anyone etc.)"

"i think you're a bit mistaken. ccp certainly likes the cold dark universe and that is how it should be, but this isn't what the issue here is and the change doesn't prevent thefts or betrayals. even in the current game you still need to gain enough trust to gain those roles and you get them after you are trusted, but thefts still happen. the new system doesn't alter this. it just allows the corp to function better and get more players involved. the added security also helps new players to be more easily accepted in to player corps, which is something ccp certainly wants to encourage, since being part of a player corp greatly increases the likelyhood of them subbing to the game long term.i think the real reason ccp hasn't addressed this and might not do it until the whole system is redone is because the whole corporation management and corporation role system is old(poorly documented, not designed to be easily modifiable, with the original programmer propably not working at ccp anymore) and full of similar problems. this makes fixing it a large project with very serious reprecussions for the game no matter how it turns out. it's similar to the pos system in many ways. everyone knows the system needs to be upgraded, but it's a huge project, with a high likelyhood of serious problems occuring and a painful transition period even in the best of case scenario. this means ccp is reluctant to touch the system and will only do it when a total redesign is going to take place."
"you probably err correctly. but tell me your conspiracy theory anyway, we're all so invested! wasn't along the line of soon, it was along the lines of between now and winter. admittedly there's going to be a fair bit of changes that will have to be in retribution followup patches due to bounty hunting but they're close to the mark (in response to none ofthe above) and serious about iterating on it. yes, really csm minutes. if you don't read them (or at least know how to skip to the chapter you care about) that's your problem, and the rest of the community gets to call you an idiot. if you say so. guess you need to wait for an official dev blog! ;p"

(sorry if this sounds weird, id odnt know any way to put it better) so this elv is treated as if the player used plex to creat a full acoount, even though he pays cash for it. and even though it is not said beforehand, only after my friend upgraded, did i receive a note that he used an illegal way to do so. the account on the other hand is up and running!...guys what dou you think? i feel cheated! a new player is a member, an acount has been payed, i should get something for it.in any case: do not invite new players to eve! that is what i learned from this mess.oh and btw: my petition about this matter is now several days unanswered!good job freaking out a player that was willing to give eve another shot, and brought someone else along. i would like a statement of the council on this matter, since it seems that ccp itself is \"to busy\" to answer methank you for your patiencehorpi"

"a serious change needs to be made to reduce the facilitation of the player base in nul sec mostly from congealing into one large fan boi fest of pilots all singing and holding hands around campfires. the current system with the ability for a coalition to post large lists of fellow alliances that can be set to blue status, so making it simple to recognize friend from foe allows a certain amount of ease in the propagation of the current status quo. by drastically reducing the allowed limit and limiting alliances by only setting fellow alliances to a blue status makes it less simple for them to form such large mega groups and stagnate nul sec as it is now. furthermore alliances should only be able to set standings for other alliances and not for corps or individuals. similarly corps only can set a limited amount of other corps and no ability to set an alliance so as to reduce the ability to do a work around. lastly the individual player can set fellow pilots unlimited if he so chooses and a limited amount of corps to his standings allotment. this is not a definite solution to the current issue but could be a step in the right direction in breaking the current into something more like what nul used to be like and also promoting the ability of newer corps and alliances to gain sov in nul without having to homogenize with the hive."

"lore-wise the minmatar republic and thukker tribe navy ships laid waste to concord, so i think it is more just a mechanics thing. however, i am always in favor of adding more ships to the game, but i leave it to smarter people than me to figure out where to fit them in.+1 more ships"

"if warp disruptors didnt exist, 0.0 would be so much better. you could be shot at, and forced to leave, but you wouldnt be killed every time. tank would matter much more since the bigger your ship is, the more tank you need in order to stay alive while aligning and escaping. warp distruption just shouldnt be instant, and able to be done by every single ship in the game, it should be something that takes time to plan and to set up, so regions can be protected and traps can be made but also to avoid whenever you leave high-sec the danger is basically the same and you have to fear being warp scrammed every single moment."

"the reason industry isn't huge in 00 is simple you cannot have a an on going war where you never run out of supplies could you imagine the snowball as it became easier to produce ships? good luck taking space from anyone who can mount a never ending attack not that this isn't already a problem, but by taking even less time out of the equation it will only get much worsei don't live in 00 so if i am missing something here or am way off let me know but i am fairly certain that supply lines are essential"
"i think the reason there is no industry in 00 is because its not really possible industry relies on mining and logistics, and 00 is just too unsafe for this as i mentioned before the warp scramblers and warp disruptors are the main problem here if they didnt exist in the game mining operations would be safer as well as hauling etc the thing is, it doesent matter how much tank you have atm if you get tackled by someone it will most likely just be a matter of time before you are dead so people dont bother being in systems where they arent properly protected against tackles"
"it doesn't need to be safer at all as it's up to the individual pilots to take measures to mitigate risk as much as possible the industry itself needs to be more viable & self-sustaining one of the main issues at the moment is you spend 80bil or so to get a station that can refine but you can't produce anything there, so you drop another station somewhere else & gain a few manufacturing slots & a couple of research slots that are assigned to supercap research now head to highsec or lowsec & most stations have 50 manufacturing slots some constellations have more manufacturing slots than all of nullsecviable nullsec industry capabilities would also bring more conflict to nullsec & give more people a reason to live there"
"you can have a never ending amount of ships & still lose a war the old northern coalition is a perfect example of this"
"but but but all the npc corp duders keep telling me that 00 is totally safe and highsec is the dangerzone"
"the reason 00 industry doesn't take off is well known; a lack of lowend mineral availability, combined with the fact that often an entire, well-developed nullsec region (eg: deklein) still has less manufacturing capability than a single hisec system; combine that with the fact pos industry infrastructure is quantifiably worse than station industry and you end up with a situation where the only things worth building in nullsec are supercaps because they can only be built in nullsec the guy going on about warp disruptors is so hilariously wrong it hurts, btwi would love nothing more than to see a great increase in industrial output in nullsec - more sandcastles built means more to kick down (oh hey we're getting into farms and fields territory here look at this coming up yet again)"
"the csm is only interested in their own agenda ( i lol'd at the no concord in empire part) the csm program really needs to be looked at by ccp ccp wants to improve player base and retain current players, forcing one persons play style upon another will not do that and every goon and pets will say otherwise (even though they bluntly state that they want to ruin the game, and ccp listens to their every word)my suggestionsfix moon goo, have it deplete when mined, and regenerate when not that alone will force conflict and alliances have to move to the isk at the very least make it from passive to active *insert goon and friends \"that's a horrible idea because i said so!\"* (gee i wonder why?)allow carriers (only carriers) back into highsec but make a system that the pilots have to buy a permit to have it in space, and limit stargate use to regional gates onlyrelease more spaceships! ccp already has a lot of models in game already, allow us to acquire and use all pirate ships! now that we have a new destroyer, make a tech 2 version that hunts down cloaked ships! that would fix a lot of current bs that null people complain about (if anyone follows my threads/posts, i've discussed a excellent way to do the in the f&i section) i could go on, but i'm not a member of the csm, so any ideas i have (which is a lot) will more then likely be ignored"

"null industry has three problems, all of which have been screamed over and over and over1 there is zero reason for ur corp and alliance members to build there own ships, its much easier to ship everything from jita to wherever your staging systems are and get to pew pew asap my idea, tldr allow corps or alliances to locally build improved items and ships from locally mined minerals these would become regular items when they left the hands of your corp/alliance2 low end minerals in null are nearly non-existent say i want to build an aeon in the past 6 months, ive been mining everything but the spod from the grav sites (note: thats not cherry picking, thats just avoiding the dog excrement while looking for iron, gold and copper, do the math on mining everything vs skipping the spod before saying spod is more than doggie doo) this has gotten me just under half the trit, barely over half the pyrite needed, but enough zydrine and megacyte to build 37 and 32 balance? imho abc ores need put out significantly more trit and pyerite along with their current zydrine and megacyte, and low sec ores need signifcantly more mex, isogen and nocx **dons the asbestos suit** flame on3 where be the production lines? it seems to me that null industry was originally designed to all be done in poses; which is now just bad hopefully the pos revamp changes this, when we get it perhaps my \"golden\" ships and modules from point #1 could only be built in these wonderful new poses"

"to be fair the guy said he didn't live there and feel free to let him know if he was wrong, there's no need to get defensivein every interaction with high sec players i take it as an oppertunity to teach them about the 75% of eve they are missing out on in the hopes to convert them from their wayward pathto extrapolate on this rather abrupt post:yes you are rightm in theory logisitcs are super important to a null sec war if the markets aren't seeded with the ships you need then how will your pilots fight?however there are two scenarios really, the present and what people in null want:the presentyou declare war on someone and start fighting a gruelling sov battle both sides are inflicting severe losses on each other but both are backed up by large amounts of isk (due to moons, renters, etc) realistically you are never going to make it so your opponent can't \"buy ships\" both alliances import all their ships from high sec via jump frighter, so risk to losing the goods you import in is about 0% since high sec is producing all the war materials you'll never need to worry about running out of supplies the only systems worth really trying hard to take are systems that allow you to extend your captial and super capital projection (see: umi in the tribute war)the futurealliances have decicated systems that they have invested time and money in to make into production capitals of null in fact these key expensive systems easily out produce systems in high sec and easily keep the alliance well stocked with practically everything they could ever want no-one runs jump frighters to high sec and back anymore as they don't need them now two sides go to war, where do you attack? do you attack the system to help your capital production? or do you attack the system producing all their ships? by now people are used to having all their stuff made in one system and there might not even be the capability to transport stuff in from high sec (lack of talent and/or people willing to do it) you take out that system and your enemy will be suffering a loss of supplies instead of just going \"lol jf from jita to vfk anyone?\" or do you attack the system that let's you drop capital ships everywhere?as you can see even by letting null build up the abilities of a single system you're already making wars a lot more interesting and tactical, plus you're allowing the possiblity to actually fight the enemy in a different way to just \"take space, drop capitals\" imagine if you could do this with multiple types of system, so there was a really good mining system, a really good industry system, a system where you could have multiple jump bridges but nothing else etcfact is the more null can customise it's space the more dynamic, interesting and rewarding it becomes"
"from perspective of high sec industrialist, this is quite interesting discussion (especially due to fact that i believed that 00 actually produces their own goods )- personally i produce all my goods in pos - small pos can run more production lines then i bother managing and that is with tech 2 production; i could produce far more t1 modules then i would ever care to and that is with small pos; so i wonder - what is wrong with using pos for production in 00? one large pos can support how many production lines? 20-30 at least and you can easily drop 5-10 of those in a system and i guess if you put production somewhere deep inside alliance space, it should be quite safe is bringing supplies from high sec so easy there is no point in producing them locally?"
"even thinking about nullsec industry makes my head hurtto manufacture you need a pos, to keep that up you need fuel blocks if you don't import them you will need to make them at that pos for that you need pi planets a lot of different ones oh, and you will need to mine ice for those blocks too then you need the fuel block bpo or bpc, preferably a well researched one, and then you can start making the fuel for that pos oh wait a minute i will need to get fuel blocks from somwhere else to fire it up in the first placei don't even remotely consider nullsec industry because i don't want to bother with the headache-inducing circular logic you need to wrap your head around there are parts to eve online that are actually enjoyable, so why would i want to flagallate myself trying to get into nullsec industry?"

"in what way is paying real money for a sub the same as buying a plex with isk without sending real money?this was the issue. the change to the system was to stop players like myself from starting alt accounts with the buddy system. contracting the new account a plex to activate the account. and the inviting account being credited a plex for the invited account being subed. this work around allowed players to basically have a 50 day or so trial account for free without the restrictions to skills and ships normally applied to a trial account. you could then before that free account expired transfer the toon to another active account or sell it on the bazaar. i still do not see why this change was needed. i did this once but by the end of the two months didn't want to give up that third account and kept it subbed. one more paying sub that i would not have started without this option. i later started a fourth account using the special 6 month starter sub which worked out to half price, also with the intention of moving the character over to another account after getting in the 6 months training. but again i kept the account active and almost 2 years later now have 4 active accounts ranging from 45mil sp to just over 20 mil on my newest account. i still have character slots on a few accounts with no skills. if these options were still available i would possibly be up to 5-6 accounts by now. i just hate stopping training on a main character just to train up a pi, research, cyno, or hauler alt. doing this on a new account and then paying the $10 to transfer it over is always an appealing option. but now ccp has removed that option. but back to the point at hand. paying for a sub is paying for a sub. the method of payment as long as it is not a plex should matter. i pay all my subs through paypal. i would be very upset if paying to upgrade a trial account through paypal disqualified the inviting account from receiving the plex. i was under the impression not matter what the inviting account was still rewarded. there was just no longer a plex for plex exchange. if a plex was used to activate the account you would receive a 30 day game time credit. if the account was activated thru a paid sub you would receive a plex as reward. if you received nothing then you got screwed. i would raise hell. there is nothing even in the notes that accounts sharing the same i.p. would not qualify for rewards. so even using the buddy system to start an alt account should still grant the reward. have you double checked your account renewal date to see if you go the game time reward instead of a plex?"

"well, put a tick box right under load station environment to disable it. but i would agree anything over 10-15 seconds would be too long.i just though actually have a video of you entering your quarters through the locked door would be cool. it would help make the station feel bigger than your captains quarters. even if you could not interact with it."
"i am sure this topic has come under scrutiny in the past on other forum subsections, but having reviewed eve-search.com i found no proposals or past topics in the assembly hall pertaining to this subject. i did look quite thoroughly, and the only (extremely remote) topics i have seen brought up were the following (and do seem indirectly relevant):ways to stop afk game playgreifers vs ccp, hulkageddon is winning. time for ccp to code changes.these previous topics/proposals were with regards to unrelated subjects, but both contain points that relate to the subject i'm about to discuss: miner bumping.prefacethere is presently a dedicated number of players who are, in character, following a \"belief system\" called the \"new order\" (no relation to joy division, much to my disappointment), herein referred to as no, proposed and enforced by a single player (james 315), but with many independent \"followers\". activities have historically been specific to halaima, but have now expanded to abudban (which is how/where i became i aware of the practise), lasting for multiple hours multiple times a day.socially this manifests itself as multiple characters going into a single system and proceeding to bombard local chat with demands, mandating short response time limits (usually between 30 seconds and 3 minutes) before \"bumping\" a miner up to 100km in distance. demands require requestee to send 10m isk to the requester else be bumped. failure to comply can result in potentially more severe action (see code).the official \"code\" is here. please read carefully, and \"between the lines\" (if you know what i mean):"
"as enchanted as i am with this devious use of a shaky in-game mechanic, the no groupies need to shape up a little, havign gone through their \"code\" which apparently is still a wip, and therefore may require some epic retconning , a few things irk me.\"since the code is a living, breathing document, it's not possible to fully enumerate all of the rules. but here are some examples of the rules, to help everyone get a sense of its spirit:\"so you have rules, but you're not going to share them, how can a) your followers, or b) those who pay your tithe know when they do or do not break it? we're not playing poker gents and ladies.\"prejudice toward minorities is not permitted. for the sake of clarity, this cannot apply to all groups claiming minority status, but only discrete and insular minorities, which are defined as suicide gankers, goons, and others who oppose highsec mining.\"so those with nothing better to do that throw away ships and fits are fine, but non-english speakers are fair game? i do believe that constitutes racial discrimination, a simple fix is to add a page to with some copypasta in variosu languages for your ravenous horde to hurl around in local; you ever know, they might even learn some new languages in the process.moreover this could be considered an act of sociological racism too.also, from the eve site:\"a grief player, or \"griefer,\" is a player who devotes much of his time to making others<U+FFFD> lives miserable, in a large part deriving his enjoyment of the game from these activities while he does not profit from it in any way. grief tactics are the mechanics a griefer will utilize to antagonize other players. at our discretion, players who are found to be consistently maliciously interfering with the game experience for others may receive a warning, temporary suspension or permanent banning of his account. \"found herewhich can be span so many ways, but can be considered to cover the acts of the no. they try to extort isk from characters, and then proceed to bump the characters ship out of range if they do not pay.of course the mighty ccp whom have furnished us with the eve verse have also fernisshed themselves with ' at our discretion'. yay for case by case basis.by all means bump away, especially those bloody bots. although i'm not sure a few dozen people will have as big an effect on the minerals market / gold shop alts, as you would like; just make sure you cover your asses in the process.as amusing as it would be to see your empire come down around your ears because one of your enforcers inadvertently hurled a profanity at someone writing in cyrillic, eve is about emergent gameplay, and as long as the bumping mechanic is not considerd an exploit in this case, here are some counter-bumping mechanics the miners can use in retalliation.o/"
"in preparation for the coming balance changes, i want to start putting together ideas for the heavy assault cruiser class of ships that the devs can use as a rough starting line. if you have a suggestion, please let me know and i'll see if i can incorporate it. if you think the ideas are worth looking at, give this thread a thumbs-up so it can get noticed. if you have a bunch of free time, please visit my other thread(s) and take a look at them as well.for the most part, hacs function as superiority fighters when a small group of players with a lot of isk want to take on a large group of players in cheap ships. they are incredibly expensive to lose, and as a result are usually fitted with extreme care, meticulously practiced and refined by their owners to make sure they don't die very often. any time a cheaper ship will do the job, a hac tends to be left in the station. one result of having such a cautious pilot base is that we get very good feedback about which hacs are viable and which are not: you see tons of vagabonds in 0.0 but you never see a sacrilege, or an eagle. hopefully i can come up with the suble reasons why these ships aren't being used and what can be done to improve them.caldarifirst i want to look at the cerberus, the terrible missile spammer of the caldari. long overshadowed by the drake and the tengu, this ship will hopefully be able to shine a bit now that hm range is reduced and its range bonuses are no longer pointless. however i do want to stress that nobody, nobody uses the 6th high power slot in pvp. the ship simply doesn't get close enough in its heavy missile configuration, and doesn't have any spare powergrid in its ham configuration. and so i propose that the utility high be shifted into a medium power slot to produce the following layout:4 low6 medium5 high - 5 missilethis may seem like a lot of medium slots, but remember this ship has no shield bonuses so a pure shield-tank won't be too ridiculous (not like the tengu, which can get a ridiculous tank quite easily) rather, i would like to see these slots used for target painters and sensor damps, the kind of electronic superiority you would expect from a missile superiority ship.next up is the eagle. the very idea of a medium-turret sniper has some problems because with turret snipers, the signature resolution of your guns just doesn't matter very much and so large guns tend to completely outclass medium guns in the sniper role. a blaster conversion is probably best, although there are several different ways to do it. i actually like the optimal-range bonus combined with blasters and i don't think that's the problem that really holds this ship back. one thing that i do think should be changed is to increase the optimal range bonus of null t2 blaster ammo from 40% to 60%, thus allowing high-level blaster ships with optimal range bonuses to reach the same ranges as their falloff-based competition.now, i have two example solutions for the eagle and i think either would be viable.option 1: shift one high slot into a low slot, producing this layout:5 low5 medium5 high - 5 turretand keep the bonuses the same as they are now. the eagle has two big barriers to becoming a brawler, and one is the lack of low slots for nanofibers and tracking enhancers on top of the standard damage control and damage mods. if an eagle pilot wants to compete with a deimos or vagabond in speed, he will need to fit 1 more nanofiber than they do: if he wants to to compete in range or tracking he will need an extra tracking enhancer. with only 4 low slots he can do neither without giving up a lot of damage.option 2: keep the slots the same, and change the second range bonus granted by the hac skill into a hybrid turret powergrid reduction bonus. the current eagle can't fit a rack of neutrons with a mwd and lse, so obviously the utility slot goes to waste in pvp fits. this way it would still be a bit slower than other brawlers, but its options for vamps/neuts or smartbombs would give it an edge. also it would be able to fit a rack of 250mm railguns with a mwd, giving it a unique role among sniper ships.amarrthe sacrilege layout currently looks like this:5 low4 medium6 high - 5 missile, 4 turret(note that its t1 parent, the maller, has 6 low slots)it is clear from this layout that the devs were afraid of overpowering the sacrilege with any more low slots. the ship's armor resist bonus makes it incredibly tough, while its capacitor recharge bonus practically give it one armor rep for free. and at the time, this was the right decision: before quantum rise the nano-sac was a common sight and terribly hard to deal with, and any more low slots would clearly be overpowered. however that time has passed, and the current sacrilege is a fossil because, despite its awesome defense and tackling abilities, it simply can't deal damage.it is not with a small amount of bitterness that i point out a buffer drake can travel the same speed and deal the same damage with the same ehp as a buffer sacrilege. it even aligns faster since the buffer sacrilege uses a 1600mm plate. of course the sacrilege can fit a beastly active tank, but when it does this it doesn't have any low slots to spare for damage mods. the result is a ship that excels at short-range 1v1 battles but cannot contribute properly to a gang except as an oversize tackler.keeping that in mind, i propose that a high slot now be converted to produce this:6 low4 medium5 high - 5 missilethe bonuses themselves are fine, and with the new ham change i hope to see new life breathed into this forgotten ship.finally i come to the zealot, which is a pleasing combination of brawler and sniper. actually i think it is just fine as is, especially with the reduction in medium energy turret fitting costs."
"to draw an analogy then use hummer for a example. the real ones are awesome (millitary)... the ones you buy at you local car lot are for image. my not be you taste but some like it so there's prob a market for non op concord ships in game. beside would make nice bait ship if its super expensive. also could only be avail from npc seller so good sink for ccp to explore."
"options? ideas? its cool that my idea could be wrong but the problem still is. any realistic ideas in untangling the nul sec love fest? how does the above idea \"make game play experience worse\"? is it because it takes away a tool in the current mechanics that aids in making such large block possible? how would it negatively affect the average and smaller alliances, corps and individuals? not saying your wrong just trying to understand better if i am."
"i have an idea for you... change the core human psychology and you may be able to start affecting the establishment of large entities. as quickly as communication in any form developed, humans tended to form groups and band together for mutual protection and benefit. you can try and put rules around it but i would argue that players will still find ways to strike up alliances and keep a record of this outside of the limitations of the game.therefore, enforcing these rules on players would be arbitrary.my suggestion would be to focus on the sovereignty system in 0.0. changes should be considered that would make very large alliances and large space holding impractical; in turn making coalitions either smaller or far more diverse and therefore subject to cracks, subversion and dissolution."
"for eye candy!"
"i wish to stress that the point of this thread was and still is for realism. boobs should only move when walking, running, jumping...etc. a slight movement should not cause them to bounce around drastically. realism!thank you."
"why is it so expensive to war dec large alliances? i cannot believe it costs over 150mill isk a week to war dec the goons, for example. it seems counter-intuitive as larger alliances are in a better position (theoretically at least) to defend themselves against war decs due to larger numbers, better organisation (?) and potentially, presuming they have access to 0.0, avoiding them altogether.it could work (and seems more equitable) to make the cost of war-decs inverse to the number of people in an alliance/corp - though if there is any truth to the rumour that ccp wants social aggregation, it is unlikely to happen as it encourages smaller corps (ceteris parabis). rather how would it be if the cost of war-deccing was based on the number of players in the aggressing corp or alliance? to prevent single man corps deccing and then inviting the hoards to join them, the mechanic would adjust the amount of isk based on the new (changed) number of folk in the aggressing corp/alliance multiplied by the proportion of the week left and if this was not paid (could be auto-debited from wallet) the war was automatically terminated (unless mutual) with the aggressor forfeiting his isk.easy.this way, it facilitates smaller corps engaging much larger ones while disincentivizing larger ones from blobbing the bejesus out of the small. as it stands, it protects the larger corps/alliances who technically don't or shouldn't need that protection.i would like to hear any comments as to why this proposal could not or should not work. as i'm not expecting a ccp answer, please consider and reply (tools welcome)."

"yes and until ccp makes bumping an aggressive act that starts an agression timer so the bumper can be retaliated against without the bumpee getting concorded they will keep appearing.this tactic is an exploit as there is no defense against it .. even in the context of goons bumping freighters in the same way. the escorts have no recouse against the agressors as there is no act of aggression.and the undock situation can be resolved exceedingly easisly by ignoring any bumping that occurs between ships with undock timers (say that run for 30s after undock).note - there is no mention here of any concord response to bumping. it's not required. bumping is an act of agression and should be treated as such."

"the existing definition of \"bumping\", per official eve wiki, only discusses bumping as a methodology used as a combat tactic. but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt: you're completely right, mining barges are not immune from combat. but that's a straw man argument of sorts for two reasons: 1) nobody i've ever seen treats a mining barge as a combat ship -- and that isn't what the miners in these systems are doing, and 2) (more importantly) \"combat miners\" are not the demographic no is focused on. no is focused on miners who sit in mining belts mining quietly -- no act of aggression (socially or technically) are being solicited by the majority of the miners being bumped (and if they do get aggressive, it's a result of the unsolicited bumping).i'll try to explain, and end it with 2 questions for you:ccp falcon's statement explicitly states, verbatim: \"... the people that are doing this for the best part are in player corporations. if you don't like what they're doing, declare war on them so that you can punish them, or pay a merc corp to do so on your behalf if you don't want to fight.\"this solution works fine for pvp-centric operations or situations (i want to say \"low-sec or null-sec\" but that isn't completely accurate); situations where you have corporations or a few corporations going up against players of a corporation or a few corporations. so yes, in that situation, that \"punishment\" works. no argument.this isn't the situation with no. with no, there is no centralised corporation or \"pairs or sets\" of corporations endorsing it -- all no members are in separate corporations, and are acting on their own behalf. if you are a miner being repeatedly bumped by 8-10 players for (quoting no folks) \"refusing to show your mining permit\", one cannot accomplish what ccp falcon proposes as a solution. it just won't work, not on this scale anyway. it would be different if all the no members were in some centralised corporation that james 315 ran -- in that case yes, ccp falcon's recommendation would work just fine. but that isn't the case. this is a situation where multiple players are presenting themselves independently, except en masse, \"on behalf of\" (so-to-speak) a single character (james 315). hell, james 315 is in (maybe was in? i really don't care to look him up) an npc corp himself (and there was an official no faq item about that fact, but it has since been removed). all of this is why ccp falcon's recommendation isn't plausible for this situation.i guess one workaround would be to put a bounty on the individual's heads. sure, that might work, but the risks of that (for the miner) greatly outweigh the benefits (in this specific situation), would you not agree?so when you say things like \"i think the devs know the demographic better\", my response would be to smile and say \"no, i don't really think they do, at least not for a situation like this. this one is quite different.\"my question for you is this: regarding \"providing evidence of my claim\", which claim is it you'd like me to provide evidence of? the fact that all the characters involved are in separate corporations? how would i do that; a large index of screenshots of info tabs for every bumper? you can get a list of the common ones (that i've seen anyway) by looking at list of \"supporters\" on the left of the home page. or maybe chat logs with the names of every character? if not that claim, which claim? and to whichever claim that is: how would you like me to provide that evidence?"
"yup, understood completely. so then circling back to my op, would you care to explain to me how this fits into the picture?keep local clean. miners should be courteous in local and should refrain from the use of profanity."

"this.unless a corp joining the decshield alliance does not have it's own cooldown period on mutual war setting then this \"fix\" will not work. you have got to stop the wars dragging around by alliance joining dropping and timers resetting because of these moves for any of this to be effective."
"so its confirmed.if zo would just make the wars unmutual before the patch works he could further trap everybody as long as he wants because he can copy the wars between two entitys again after a week, like now i guess... .the main issue is still creating (new 7 days) outgoing wars against entiys the \"aggressor\" never has known before - just by copying wars dodging the ally-system!so has the \"fix\" just removed an inferno feature for a defender but really has nothing changed concerning the dec shield issue what it was originally made for?"
"please provide a method of fighting back that doesn't involve the miner or any supporting fleet from getting concorded..you've already acknowledged that they're hdiing behind the inability to wardec an npc corp and i can't see ccp changing that mechanic.nobody is asking to make bumping exhumers against the rules ...what we want is the bumping exploit loop hole closed so that deliberate bumping is treated as exactly what it is \"a deliberate act of agression\""
"if ccp changed the bump mechanic to take into account the mass of the ships it would help this problem.bigger ships move slower and are harder to keep bumping.small ships would bounce off a good distance due to mass difference.with no defense or counter to this action, i agree that this level and type of bumping is considered griefing and should be treated as such by ccp and other players.even have a concord tackler show up and lock you down for 5 minutes after detecting more than 3 bumps per minute. add the new suspect flag at the same time so if you want to play bump games you are stuck and suspect at the same time."

"one year ago we where asked about our ideas what is necessary to do in high sec.i wanted to re-post two ideas cause i think they really would fresh up the game or are a logical iteration. well the new tank-abilities should be taken into consideration:"
"cerberus - highslot to medslot is fine, but it also need a lot more pg.eagle - a blaster eagle will never work. it's got to be a rail platform. i don't like your null idea, blasters should not be a kiting weapon. not sure how you make rail eagle useful, but it probably involves having greater tracking and smaller sig than t3 bcs. tracking bonus, med rail fix, mwd sig bloom bonus?sac - yes.zealot - fine, apart from generic obsolescence by t3 bcs."
"so do you want to ask the mods to move it to the appropriate sub-forum or should i?ah is, contrary to popular belief, not f&i.as for content. how many slots are hacs expected to have post revision? might be worth thinking about.suggestion for hac rolebonus: half all values (except distance) as pertains to mjd (when a cruiser variant comes around). hacs are either in your face tearing you a new one or dancing around bleeding you to death variety, faster cycle/cheaper operation and fitting mjd serves both camps.cerb (caldari = guided missiles. amarr (khanid) = unguided missiles);high to mid .. mids are a lot more valuable than highs, especially on ships like caldari that has more cpu than god .. so hell no. consider that tds are likely to become godweapons and with weapon range to spare you are basically creating the ultimate coward-mobile.let the cerb have the sixth launcher slot with almost nothing further done and revisit the idea of certain ewar having options for high-slots, highslot tp was discussed a few years back for instance.eagle (caldari = rails. gallente = blasters);note: the sacrifices you mention to compete with ships specialized in other areas (range/dps/speed) all point towards a balanced ship .. that is the way all ships ought to be.give it the sixth gun slot and swap damage bonus for rof. eagle suffers from being very specialized, it should be the hac dps sniper extraordinaire .. make it devastating in that role and force hard choices if trying to go outside the box (t2 = highly specialized according to new ship design paradigm).sacrilege;meant to be bad news to go up against in web range but suffering from anaemic dps (for a brawler hac). either give it more damage by adding a launcher slot, changing damage to a second rof bonus or give it something else to use in the 0-10km bracket .. being khanid an obvious suggestion would be +20% neut/nos effectiveness (not range!) per level and moving rof bonus to cruiser skill.zealot;would be awesome to have either a 4th mid or something to handle frigs as laser tracking is kind of poo. think this hull is going to be changed the most as the omen has been morphed into a gun toting drone carrier so i am uncertain as to how/what happens here.caveat to all of above: we and ccp need to ask ourselves a rather fundamental question -=- is there any need or place for hac snipers in eve with t3 bcs having been introduced?if yes, then minor tweaks is all that is needed.if no, then a major rethink of what it means to be a hac is in order .. would personally love for them to be something that is deployed to counter massed vanilla cruisers (now with t1 logi! ), with bcs being counters to both classes."
"sensible thinking, but hacs would have to be pretty crazy to be a better counter to cruisers than bcs already are.there was talk of redoing the tracking formula to make sig res/rad more important during the blap-titan era - such a change may be necessary to make t3 bcs and sniper hacs coexist."

"i appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. some of your answers i understand (this does not mean i am in agreement with them, just that i see the logic/thought process involved), while some others are very slyly/cleverly worded (similar to how the code is written; i'm trying to keep it terse in my reply here). likewise i also appreciate james 315 dropping by (hello!).rather than continue to go back and forth with rebuttals and make this thread an endless void of arguments (i have already made my statements in my initial post and those are what i am sticking to), i'll instead let players decide via the standard method of voting, so that a csm can pick the proposal and bring it to ccp. no, i'm not stepping out of the ring or putting my tail between my legs -- i would rather let the existing assembly hall system work how it's designed. sadly most players don't know about assembly hall, and that's a problem i can't solve easily. :(i've had a couple private messages in-game, and one eve mail, from players somewhat confused by what it is i'm trying to accomplish here (and more weren't sure how to vote in favour, or abstain for that matter). so i'll rephrase/recap -- and this is for folks on both sides:the point of my proposition is to gain csm endorsement so that the matter can be brought to executive level attention at ccp. this is significantly different than a ccp developer making a remark that is interpreted by some as \"it's perfectly fine\"; this situation is different that bumping used in combat-oriented situations. in effect my proposal is to go above the heads of the devs and go straight to the executive level.i do not want mining ships or aspects involving mining \"nerfed\" in any way -- i do not think that is the right way to go about addressing this issue. this issue is a social problem, not a technical problem. i do not like solving social problems with technical methods. i will admit that some of the technical solutions i've read sound interesting (such as a bump aggression timer), but i don't think those will put a damper on this.if hilmar and crew issue a statement that what is transpiring in-game is in fact permissible per eula/tos, then that's that -- no tears, no sad panda, no whining, just pure acceptance (at least on my part). at least i gave it a shot, even if it fails. on the other hand, if hilmar and crew issue a statement that what's transpiring is a form of harassment, then the risks for new order \"agents\" and those engaging in said behaviour instantly become extremely high (and as bizarre as it may sound, i worry for the people whose accounts could be impacted by that).given that the new order insists their behaviour is permitted within eula/tos, i am surprised that key no members like james don't endorse my proposal. what have you got to lose by doing so? if you're in the right -- as you say you are -- then no has everything to gain since ccp would \"rule\" in your favour, and the miners would have everything to lose. please do not say \"because there's no need, it's already been endorsed [by ccp falcon]\" or something to the effect of \"if it were a problem, ccp would already have done something about it\" -- those are pure, classic straw man arguments."
"your problem is that, if you take away all the :words:, you're left with something like \"ccp falcon said it was fine, but i don't like that, so can we get the ceo's opinion on the matter?\"that's a pretty silly argument. we already have ccp's very clearly stated opinion on the matter;ccp falcon wrote: bumping is not considered harassment. bumping is not considered griefing. bumping is not against the rules. and no, it's not a 'straw man' argument."

"yes, with the current wording i do believe that i will still be able to keep everyone trapped. using a method i publcly outlined for them almost 2 weeks ago. i believe that i'll be able to set all the wars unmutual, and then just constantly eject corps from the alliance and rejoin with them (or bounce between two alliances). i have yet to test this, but i'm pretty sure it'll work like that. and people got all uppity when i mentioned a disbelief that ccp would fix these issues...i'm surprised they only plan to let mutual wars get retracted... because in my mind that says \"the aggressors is trapped, until the defender wants to trap them, then they go free\". once again failing to balance the system. aggressors will once again have absolute control over the system.we'll see if i have to make this thread a 3rd time."
"hey all, for a long time, combat boosters have been in need of some love. i have 2 small proposals which i believe will improve the way combat boosters operate in eve. neither are concerned with production or effects of boosters, which i believe are nicely balanced, if a little exclusive. 1. change the way that drugs are smuggled : the current has you system scanned by npc customs officers and immediately having to pay a hefty fine, in addition to being pointed and given an ultimatum to surrender your merchandise or face destruction. whilst pondering the implications of the new crimewatch system, i thought of the following: i propose that ccp removes the instant fine. the npcs would attempt to warp disrupt the pilot as before, and the following ultimatum would now be: 1 - surrender your merchandise and receive a (much reduced) fine or 2 - get an immediate suspect flag, security status penalty and be attacked by the customs officer npcs. when transporting even a modest stack of any illegal merchandise, the instant irreversible fine is a crippling blow to any profit seeking pilot. however, it makes no sense when smuggling, that even though the aggression of customs officers can be evaded in a fast ship, there is still a harsh penalty. landing the smuggler with a suspect flag and security status hit would give other players the chance to get involved in 'policing' highsec. 2. change the way that boosters are dealt : the fact that combat boosters (and indeed their components) can be bought and sold on the open market, whilst being completely illegal to trade over contracts makes no sense. i propose that combat boosters be available to trade only using direct contracts between players (i.e private contracts, instead of public) or through station trading. getting to know 'the guy' would become an interesting twist.i believe this change would encourage a more networked approach to combat booster dealing. although not one of my official proposals, i also think it would be fun if each private contract involving contraband held a security status penalty (for both contractor and contractee) in areas where the item was illegal. this would develop the 'actions have consequences' idea and also add flavour to an otherwise bland method of dealing in illicit goods by eventually outlawing those who frequently deal. for the dealers it would also mean choosing between selling to a few known pilots and having a manageable security status or dealing to everyone and being sure to go full outlaw. i also think that these two proposals would work equally as well with all types of contraband - it fits the game style, whilst at the same time making it much more feasible to smuggle in small and fast ships, which will make combat boosters a marginally more profitable enterprise and encourage networking between players.also a dedicated gas mining ship, and more pirate interaction... no, must stop now!all in favour?"

"that is a good idea not to be able to use faction towers in high sec.that would mean it will bring demand down and hopefully prices for those towers would be more competitive. therefor ultimately bringing prices down.another possible solution to this should be that towers can be conquered. in order to conquer a tower you should meet a certain or a series of qualifications. one type of qualification that springs to mind should be that you must have an active war declaration with the owner of the towers. if the war ends with you as a winner, then you meet the qualification to seize (conquer) assets in space. after all, isn't it \"veni vidi vici\" (\"i came i saw i conquered\")? of course, the proposition i made above will work a lot in favors for big corporations to pick and bully small carebearing corps. so a series of restrictions and qualifications should be implemented so that it can not be abused by bigger corporations. a restriction that pops into mind right now, should be that you have an active war (and fight) the corporation you want to seize assets from for a long period of time (and maybe that you do not have a much superior force than the target corp?).we are able to take enemy territories and their assets in null, so maybe ccp should implement a similar ideai am just speculating and putting into words what comes to mind. what does the rest of you think, my fellow demigods?"

"i already proposed this idea in features and ideas and found that i had a lot of positive feedback and most of the arguments against it were defeated, so i think it would be a good idea to post it here now.original threadsummary is this: all current gates that connect high security space empires would be shut. these would be replaced by four new regions (one for each race) that connect all the empires and are all low security. they would be designed with few choke points and many entrances. not to mention changing the map is something ccp has done in the past and would be a relatively low effort endeavor. why?1. break apart jita as a super hub and help homogenize industry all across eve.2. make trading more interesting as a profession instead of the easily botable afk fest it currently is.3. add more profits to trading for the amount of time/isk/effort put into it and remove a lot of the boring spread sheet studying.4. make low security space relevant other than a cyno route, capital bakery,pi, and faction warfare.5. bring back trade caravans for moving large amounts of goods (new freighter class with more armor/shield ehp to allow logistics support and mobility?)6. anti pirating would actually be something worth doing instead of rp'ers who die miserably7. pirating would be a real profession and not being -10 popping the occasional missioner and fighting other \"pirates\"8. missioners and ore carebears would have new extra profit opportunities by having the option to move modules/ice/cheap minerals to other hubs.9. maybe it would bring about courier contracts that actually make money?10. greater uniqueness and sense of identity attached to your area of high sec.optional additionsore distribution in the four empires would be changed along with ship mineral costs. minmatar ships will be built with ores found more commonly in minmatar space etc. not a necessity for this idea to work but it would be cool. also fix nullsec industry while your at it."
"supported on the condition that more low-sec \"entry points\" are added so there are multiple routes one can take into and through low-sec."
"definitely a no brainer. i think their are currently 23 entrances into caldari high-sec from lowsec not counting lowsec islands. another 10 should be sufficient. i have not looked into the other 3 empires number of entrances but i assume they are similar except for the amarr. of course many of those entrances lead into bottleneck constellations which need to have extra exits added or more bypass constellations."
"as high sec industrialist, i like the idea - it would certainly add to trade opportunities, production opportunities as well as making life more interesting for everyone. alternatively, leave one high sec pipe, but make it especially long and boring :) (for those who insist on safe travel, not to mention that it would create ideal place for high sec gankers )"
"fully support. low sec has something to fight over (trade routes) and perhaps hire-able protection along the route, for anyone holding the space.i would recommend a long range hyperspace gate between the empires though, but only for small ships (shuttles) and for a fee frigates so new players aren't completely locked-in into their empire. and you can move around and explore things."
"this again? well i suppose it has been a while."
"implement it and people leave. as has been said before, there are people who will never goto lowsec, no matter what anyone says. you interrupt their game by forcing lowsec travel on them, they vote with their wallet and leave."
"nopeople - especial new player - are leaving because eve isn't a \"dark, harsh world\" full of adventures and mmo pvp-challenges they ve been told (beyond 0-sec). they run lvl3-4 boring as hell.because eve is a f***ing paradise, where everybody can get everything without fighting - just grinding for.lowsec is empty and noone needs to go there (fw exepted), nothing there is unique, pirates are pirating themselves.(btw an old idea to boost lowsec"
"your not being forced to go into lowsec. most people hump the same level 4 agent for weeks to months anyway so it would not affect you at all. all the carebears still have access to the same roids, the same ice, the same missions, and the same factory slots. if you want to move somewhere else then you can use cloaky haulers, scouts, high sec-high sec wormholes, or a transportation corporation."
"that is basically the current system. their are only 4 highsec exits from caldari space and 3 of them are 1 jump from each other and go to the same system. maybe make it 100 jumps then id be happy.people who insist on safe travel will still have cloaked haulers and wormholes."

"\"the existing definition of \"bumping\", per official eve wiki, only discusses bumping as a methodology used as a combat tactic. but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt: you're completely right, mining barges are not immune from combat. but that's a straw man argument of sorts for two reasons: 1) nobody i've ever seen treats a mining barge as a combat ship -- and that isn't what the miners in these systems are doing, and 2) (more importantly) \"combat miners\" are not the demographic no is focused on. no is focused on miners who sit in mining belts mining quietly -- no act of aggression (socially or technically) are being solicited by the majority of the miners being bumped (and if they do get aggressive, it's a result of the unsolicited bumping).\"because noone ever fits combat/scout drones to their exhumers. oh, and even though i forget the corp's name, there's a youtube floating around where someone in an incursion fleet, used an exhumer. food for thought.you do however, make an interesting point. i'll quote the line i'm speaking of- no is focused on miners who sit in mining belts mining quietly -- no act of aggression (socially or technically) are being solicited by the majority of the miners being bumped (and if they do get aggressive, it's a result of the unsolicited bumping).funny thing, is if you have zero aggressors... nothing happens. no doesn't have to act solely in retaliation. you didn't pay. end of story. if you have a permit, you are given 365 days of free bump free mining unless you of course forfeit it by your own actions.since you like to quote and pull from minerbumping.com, i'm suprised you didn't touch on the point that miners, who aren't afk, have for the most part mouthed off expletives and inappropriate language. because miners quite often are socially aggressive. when they aren't afk.we can call this \"talking **** before a fight\" if you like. but as any toddler knows, just because you didn't throw the first punch doesn't mean you're right.in the end, you can't appeal to ccp to fix something they consider working as intended, since you do in fact have the tools to cope with the problem. you just choose not to. plenty of reasons listed here that i don't need to repeat.you aren't forced to mine. you also aren't forced to be in the same system as anyone else. also if you notice, non exhumer miners don't ever seem to get bumped. i guess your demographic is getting smaller and smaller.this post has been signed by murk paradox and no other accounts, alternate or otherwise. any other post claiming to be this holder's is subject to being banned at the discretion of the gm team as it would violate the tos in regards to impersonation. signed, murk paradox. in triplicate."

"fully supported i think this would be great the only reason pos refineries are not used is the 75% hard cap some wormhole corps still use them as shipping raw ore out and minerals in is more hassle than losing 25%even if nothing was done but removing the hard cap it would make a huge difference the excessively small batches would still make them a pain to use, but at least you would not be losing 25% of your minerals i have used pos refineries in the past for ice as they do refine ice at 100% i can refine at a 35% refinery with zero waste on two of my characters if i could refine at a pos even if hard capped at 95% i would a slight loss is worth it on some remote ops but 25% has made this module almost unusable you can say all you want that why should ccp spend time changing a module that is not used but in fact the need for this change is the reason it is not used i am sure it would not be a waste of time, i expect even with the new pos mechanics, if we ever see them, many existing pos modules will be incorporated with minimal changes this could be one of those modules"
"+1 to opbut i fear that it wont have a chance (see causality trailer). they want that betrayal to happen to you. so its not a flaw in ccp's eyes, its a feature."
"there is no real reason why stealth bombers cannot launch bombs in low sec. maybe a member of the csm could ask ccp why this is currently so.im sure anyone with half a brain could come up with a counter to a bomber with stabs. it would give bomber pilots something extra to do in low sec and would help counter \"blob\" warfare. i can understand no bombs in high sec possibly cos of black ops.if there is a reason why bombs cannot be used in low sec i would like to hear it, so i can debunk the theory."
"no your talking for your self not 160 other accounts your been a outright jerk and more to the point if you act like a jerk csm and gm and dev are likey to fire back. you have no clue what there working on and whats comeing.ccp punkturis has all the right to fire back and if you ask me she was down right nice about it i have seen other post were shes fired back alot hard then she has.if you as a paying for a product were i work and act like that to me my friend one i would have open fired at you alot worse the ccp and the csm have trust me on that and after i would boot you right out on your butt and told you never to return.if your a jerk and you pay for something paying for the product does not give you the right to act like a jerk to anyone."
"sry dude, ...... but thats what you wrote is ****** bs.its not the point whats coming, the point was that ccp has designed key features of last whole add on full of flaws.think about this so there is no necessity to defend ccp in that case in my opinion!and ccp punkturis didn't \"fire back\". as the first ccp employee stating after 7 weeks in this serious thread she had nothing more to write than trolling other players.for my own i m still very disapointed about this behaviour, and i fully agreed with brib vogt in that way!especially because the fix ccp tallest annouced some hours after ccp punkturis dubious \"i promise you alexeyev is giving it proper attention and we're also making plans, stuff just doesn't happen on the forums all the time\" will not work, too - as we get presented it now from ccp soniclover... .the whole thread here told em nothing else than there is an issue because of unlimited copying wars.zo writes nearly professional articles here since months till his fingers are bleeding.they ignore it ...and implemented obviously a fix which will remove a feature and will not fix the issue.and people like you give em candy for burning our money. unbelieveble... !"
"throwing my support. cheers."
"at a glance, this would have the ancillary effect of making high sec to null sec logistics significantly safer: the now-huge border with high sec, combined with the lack of choke points, would mean that nullsec alliances could use more hubs, including secondary hubs like hek and oursulaert, and transfer their goods from freighters to carriers and jump freighters from more low sec systems, with long jump-friendly routes from even deep high sec back into null.it would have a built-in tradeoff in the form of potentially higher fuel costs, but it would mean that if a null sec alliance really wanted to go shopping in high sec, fuel costs would be just about the only thing stopping them. i'm not sure exactly how much that would change, but it's something i'd want someone knowledgeable to weigh in on before i +1'd the idea."

"hello, i am replying to you just to tell you i liked your post! i wish there were more good posts like these on the forums!oh well, time to go. keep on posting emperor mtb!"
"what about the constant harassment i've suffered? no bumping but plenty of everything else ranging from death threats from readers of your blog and james attempting to force me to play how he wants.he's giving me chronic depression on a game i. until a month ago, enjoyed despite the gankers. now he's making me concider suicide. is making enemies of the new order kill themselves a mark of high standings? well?"
"from what i have witnessed, james has displayed super-human levels of patience and understanding with you, despite your violations of the code and actions against the new order. regardless, \"attempting to force\" players to do something against their will is perfectly acceptable within eve, and james is merely trying to make you into a better, happier miner.the death threats from other players are of course a bad thing<U+FFFD>, and i don't condone it personally, but you have to admit you tend to antagonise members of the new order."
"how? by asking them to leave me in peace? or do you agree with wookie sith ottig that me concidering suicide is 'awesome'?and for the 1000th ******* time...i...am not a goddamned miner!!!!"
"please don't be dishonest, capt. you've went far beyond simply asking to be left in peace. fabricated stories, contacting gms/devs, etc. you've done a lot of bad. i don't think you're beyond saving though. i never said or implied anything of the sort. this kind of attitude is why so many hate you.if the tears fit..."
"and you keep bringing up things that happened a montyh ago and were settled a fortnight ago to make attempts to make me kill myself seem justified.if you agree that someone should be driven to suicide, you are as bad as the ones doing the tormenting."
"well this escalated quickly"
"no, i brought up things you've done in the past because you were trying to claim you were being unfairly targeted for no good reason, which isn't the case. you did a lot to make a target of yourself, that's what i was saying - not justifying death threats, or attempts to make you commit suicide. nowhere have i ever condoned players attempting to drive you, or anyone else, to suicide. that is a disgusting accusation to make. do you understand the horrific accusations you just made about me, and the attitude in general, is the exact kind of behaviour that gets you so much hate (but again, i'm not saying that justifies death threats or people trying to make you kill yourself)?though, considering your history and my first hand experience of your lies and accusations in this topic, i find your statements about james trying to make you commit suicide highly suspect."
"yet, in a previous post...you said i brought it on myself...he;; .you implied it here...thats as good as saying 'you deserve to be driven insane'."
"actually he is being targeted to the point of harassment. when you make a blog dedicated to the guy (lol?) and taut it around to prevent him from joining a corp, that's a bit different then just in-game prodding. then maybe you should remind your \"order\" that this is a game and that those kinds of threats are a no-no. do you blame him? james et al have been messing with him as a target for the past few months. and not just merely \"messing,\" but really stabbing at him at every turn and corner. do you understand the amount of harassment your ilk have been throwing at him for the sake of \"tears\" and lulz when in reality, it's going too far?becauses james and the bumpettes are paragon's of truth and justice and are never hypocritical or wrong give me a break."
"what i don't understand is why ccp doesn't respond to him. they've made multiple blog posts about trolling him, harassing him, i read"
"yes, i said you bring it on yourself with your lies, horrific statements about people, etc - but i have explicitly stated multiple times that it doesn't justify some of the extremes you're saying you've fallen victim to (death threats, urging suicide, etc). the blog is dedicated to the new order and the code. capt has featured numerous times precisely because of his own extreme actions and loud outbursts. even if it gets to the point where corporations won't accept him because of what they've seen on that blog, that isn't harassment.if there are certain users who are hounding him and truly sending him death threats and urging him to suicide, that would more than likely count as harassment.i can't control what other players do, or be held accountable for them taking it too far. accusing people of attempting to drive others to suicide is also kind of a no-no too, don't you think? it's a horrible accusation to make.do i blame him for his own actions? well, yes. that's how it works. he attempted to spread terrible lies about me personally in this thread. i've never bumped him, sent him death threats, or done anything of the kind. just because some individuals may have taken it too far with him does not mean him making such horrible accusations about others is ok.i've seen james be nothing but courteous and honest with capt and the other miners. i've got first hand experience of capts lies and libel, so excuse me if i take his stories about mysterious death threats and suicide suggestions with a grain of salt"
"right, let's not be coy here the blog is dedicated to tear extraction and isk obtaining, with more than a few posts dedicated to targeting lynch. your code is hypocritical and the \"order\" are a bunch of upset gankers mad that they can't gank miners with little risk now and that they can't profit from it. it is harassment when you start sending eve mails to every single corp he tries to enter to prevent him from entering in the first place. it prevents him from doing anything at all. there is no tank for that, no war dec for that. he's simply being harassed.yet you can. they're in the \"order,\" so james should be telling them what is ok and what is over the line. they're his ilk, he is responsible for their actions. and i, much like you lot, will make the accusations as they seem far more likely, given your groups composition. please don't talk to me about \"horrible actions\" when your \"order\" is just as horrid, if not more so yet his actions are based off constant harassment from your ilk, and you wouldn't look to yourself for the cause of all this? you're so far above this that it couldn't possibly be your fault? please. as for your \"horrible accusations\" brought against you, you and the others know it takes little to prob lynch on. it's passive aggressive tactics and trolling shrouded in a cloak of \"decency\" while you continue to prod him on. so yes, i do blame you, and yes his actions are based on the no. again that \"honesty\" is simply a double edged sword of hypocrisy and trolling, so please, don't bring that silly argument here."
"i have deleted some posts that seemed to be little more than attempts at trolling and causing needless controversy."

[*] repeatedly lied and made up stories to discredit us. this is what the very first lynch post was about, and he hasn't stopped since. see above for more information."
"to get back on topic ... what was the topic again?ah right. i don't see why this is an issue that has to be raised with the csm, bumping has been around forever and is just an accepted mechanic. i don't believe it's more prevalent than it used to be or anything, there's a single blog where one guy and a few people who appreciate his hard work talk about how they do it. doesn't sound like a big deal to me."
"there are 2 possibilities:a) you are threatening to kill yourself to put pressure on other people on a video gameb) you are seriously considering killing yourself over a video gameneither of these are done by sane persons. i have reported your posts to ccp. you should seek professional help immediately and leave james alone, he is the least of your problems."
"much like you are responsible of capt lynch's actions."
"leave james alone? you kidding me? james should leave him and everyone else alone! that's bullshit that he isn't responsible for all this. he is. i've reported your post for protecting a psycho as bad the mittani at fanfest. jerk."
"can't we please stay civil in here? i hate it when fun threads get locked.as for james continually harassing lynch, i believe that it's been explained before; james makes no attempt to contact capt lynch, ever. he screenshots the amusing things that lynch does and writes about them. end of. it is not a big deal."

[*] not much to say here, but i remain with my stance that if you are harassing an individual and they react poorly, your harassment is to blame, simple."
"you lost civility when you started this crap. i hope more outcry is posted here against this so it doesn't get locked and the csm and ccp shuts you idiots down. james keeps targeting him when he could ignore him. if james was such a \"good guy,\" he'd ignore capt lynch. but he doesn't, he keeps pushing and pushing and pushing. you people need controlled. it is a big deal. if you don't see bullying as a big deal, you need to re-evaluate your life."
"if captain lynch wasn't such an attentionwhore then all of this would be moot, he actively courts the trolls by attempting to troll them and failing, he also creates situations that make for amusing press coverage by aggravating the situation further with lies, misdirection and generally being a a pain in the arse.if captain lynch wants someone to blame for his current situation in the game he need look no further than the nearest mirror. he attempted to play the metagame and failed miserably. on a side note as someone who does actually suffer from depression and has considered suicide in the past, i encourage him to seek help from a mental health specialist, it'll be a lot better for him than whining on the forums about it, which btw makes me think that he's telling another whopping great porkie, people with depression don't generally spam a game forum about it, it tends to be kept bottled up inside and if the feelings are shared at all they are shared with close friends and family."
"seeing that this capt lynch fellow is now, 5 hours later, at abudban local talking about \"space beer\" on local chat, i am inclined to think that he was using suicide threats to pressure people in a video game.i have no words.edit: and what does that make people like anslo, trying to use peoples potential mental health issues to further his political views. and the other guys are the bad guys?"
"i'll be honest, the bumping thing was funny at first. but if this is what's going on and this is how some people take it hope it stops soon..."
"how is james responsible for this at all, the only snippet we've seen is between capt and wookie.as for james postings on his blog: not harassment, simple. people copy and pasting your tears is not harassment, never has been, never will be. emailing other corporations he joins isn't harassment either, as far as i'm aware. if you've made such a name for yourself that people are willing to dec any corp you join to get you that's tough luck. if other corps find out this is a possibility and don't accept you as a result, again tough luck.if capt just dropped all this nonsense instead of making up lies, pestering ccp, etc then it'd stop pretty quickly. people threaten to dec corps he joins because they don't like him and or because tears. if he stopped doing the things that cause them to dislike him, and stopped generating tears, then it'd stop.it really isn't a matter for the csm at all."
"it's not what's going on, it's not james' fault that captain lynch insists on being a never ending source of saline droplets. he tried to troll the new order and failed in a spectacular fashion, now he's crying over his own failure and a situation he himself created."
"lets be clear to any watching ccp staff...as i said in an earlier post...i've already spoke to people in scope and i am feeling much better and am no longer a risk to my own safety...any agents will now be blocked...end of problem (thank you, thea orleans for helping me feel alot better and to de-stress before i snapped).the situation has been resolved and i concider the matter over.please do not bring it up again...you will be ignored."
"if mr. lynch really isn't stable like another poster suggested, and he showed this as he continued in the game, then you should have stopped. tears are one thing, aggravated harassment is another. at first, i found bumping rather amusing, potentially even profitable. now it just seems very unsavory, especially in lieu of this thread and its topic matter. yes, he did, laughably so i admit. but there is a time where you cease playing the game and move on. the new order continues to push the matter and attack an unstable player despite numerous signs that this should be avoided. you won the meta game, congratulations. but it's time to stop.in your situation yes, but patient reaction variability is broad in terms of depression. there is also the possibility of multiple illnesses bothering him and combining to create the current situation. depression in combination with a bi-polar disorder or others could cause this. needless to say, your assumption is incredibly sickening in attempting to project your symptoms on him as a standard and using that fake standard as an attempt to discredit him.but i can't blame you totally, you may not be knowledgeable on the subject. but i will still blame the order for the actions and reactions we are seeing here today. there is a point where fun-making becomes harassment. if the order was to really court support and show itself to still be a joke organization just out to have fun, they should be the bigger man here and cease this targeted harassment, potentially issue an apology, and adopt new policies to ensure this does not occur again."
"i still suggest going to see a person who specialises in mental health, if you were truly suffering from suicidal thoughts they can be a great help, and tbh it's probably the best thing you could do to help yourself.you do make a very good point, symptoms do vary from person to person and my personal experience may well be different from that of others.that said, it takes two to tango, if the person concerned stops trying to troll the bumpers then i pretty sure the bumpers will ignore him, as it is at the moment he is actively antagonising them and playing the depression card to make any reaction reflect badly on them."
"brb setting up victims of the new order support line. only 10m for a session."
"for the final time...i was over-stressed due to a combination of events irl and snapped briefly. it has never ahppened before and won;t happen again...please drop the subject or be blocked!"
"taking the time to repeatedly message each corp he joins and threatening to wardec them isn't harassment? do you need me to post what the definition of harassment is? i swear, talking to you people is pointless, you talk and talk ,but you don't listen. seriously, shut up a moment, close your mouth, and read. a : exhaust, fatigueb : to annoy persistently (2) : to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical conductgot it through your head yet? whether you consider it harassment or not is a moot point, the english dictionary does."
"james started it, his blog gets people to keep pushing lynch, james condones the actions. it's his fault. deal with it.you keep him from joining corps, you keep him from playing anything, you target him and 90% him. it's ******* harassment. i don't even know why i'm talking to you. you just come in and troll from an extremist point of view and fake civility to make it look like you're some superior **** head. get out.i hope this gets nerfed to hell.case in point. christ."
"all joking and trolling and new ordering aside though, if you honestly came close to doing something like that - even if it was the first time, and was only a brief moment - you might want to seek some help. we're happy to bath in tears, but we don't want anyone to actually get hurt in real life or anything."
"some serious irony right here..."
"then leave him alone, stop the harassment, stop bumping, and go back to ganking. ganking, miners can defend, bumping, they can't. then they get harassed. then we get to situations like this.griefers are the worst. nerf high sec ganking to be harder, and this is what you get. psycho undesirables."
"is that an upgrade from belligerent undesirables?"
"says the follower of the hypocritical \"order.\"this entire thread is a testament to why this issue should be addressed by the csm and ccp. at first, i just wanted to see bumpers ganked by miners in glory and honor. but if this crap is what's happening, then it needs escalated."
"wtf? how is all this not harassment?? wow dude..."
"not really, i'd take an idiotic undesirable over a malicious, arrogant, and socially awkward one any-day."
"i gladly risk getting blocked if i have a chance to help a potential suicidal schizophrenic to actually seek help. your condition is no joke. there is no telling when you will \"just snap\" the next time. it certainly will not help you with your future corp applications.if you are adamant against visiting a licensed practitioner, at least look through"
"i like how you've cut out the only bit that was even remotely indicative of wookie's condoning lynch's suicide.interesting how we're responsible for the funny things he says to us.as for harassment, i believe it's been stated before that the harassment (as carried out by james) consists of blog posts about him, aimed at an audience of which he is not a part. if he goes looking at that stuff, that's his fault."
"look, i have no ill wishes against capt but just because he had this kind of reaction over the whole new order and bumping thing doesn't mean it is an illegitimate activity, or griefing, etc. the vast vast majority of bot-aspirants and undesirable afk miners have barely reacted at all to it, maybe some comments in local telling us to sod off, maybe a little whining on the forums, whatever, but the capt's situation is hardly the norm, or something that should be used as an argument for or against anything - that just feels a bit slimy to me, taking his situation and using it for your own agenda. it also causes us all to talk about it more, which he doesn't want."
"i showed the only part that needs to be shown, he agreed, and said it was \"awesome.\" after that, it's irrelevant. you \"bumpers\" are out of control.you aren't responsible for what he says. you are responsible for what you do with it, which is harassing. are you this dense? he is not part of the audience but, as you and your kind so eagerly point out, others can interact and react to him, which you all have forged in a negative fashion to ensure his inability to play, enjoy, and ensure maximum damage to him.that is harassing. plain and simple."
"when the above posts start occurring, you're thugs and illegitimate in my book. and you continue to do so, with words like \"bot aspirants.\" at first it was just bots, and many were very supportive of it. now, you go after anyone. you're no good, period.and why can't it be an argument? how many more does this need to happen to? 5? 10? 20? please, tell us. if anything is slimy, it's your assumption that one person's reaction to this crap isn't enough to justify reanalyzing your belligerent behavior."
"the only thing slimy here is you"
"ladies and gentleman...please drop this...the main reason for my freak out was this condition"
"the bit that wookie called 'awesome' was the idea of a killboard. lynch had not said that he was considering suicide when wookie said 'awesome'.well, i hope you feel sorry for harassing disciple of james315 on your blog. i happen to know that he's very upset about it."
"the bit that wookie called 'awesome' was the idea of a killboard. lynch had not said that he was considering suicide when wookie said 'awesome'.well, i hope you feel sorry for harassing disciple of james315 on your blog. i happen to know that he's very upset about it.i'm very glad to hear it. honestly, i wish you'd just taken my advice a little sooner."

"perhaps you should drop the issue as requested? or is your politicking more important than the people you claim you are worried about?"
"i'll just break the conversation down for you.capt lynch says \"i think that james should have a killboard for players that have committed suicide due to him.\"wookie says \"i agree.\"at no point does capt lynch say that he planned to commit suicide. at no point does wookie say that capt lynch should commit suicide, or that capt lynch committing suicide would be a good thing.this is known as sarcasm. disciple of james315 does not care that anslo posts pictures of him doing silly things, and yet anslo cares that james posts pictures of lynch doing silly things. furthermore, if anslo cares about james posting pictures of lynch being stupid, it's pretty hypocritical to post pictures of disciple himself."
"so you find it more credible that wookie read, comprehended, reacted *and* typed a response to the suicide comment in just 2 seconds than the idea that he did the same to the killboard comment in 13 seconds? on a semi-related note, anslol, you would do well to stay out of this. we've read every evemail between you and lynch. we know all about how you tried to use lynch for your ridiculous anti-new order propaganda and, judging from some of his replies to you, you've done an exceptional job pushing the poor guy towards the limit. the pair of you were going on and on and on like a pair of duracell bunnies. you're so good at upsetting people that you turned a loyal ally into someone so furious with you that he was ready to use a machariel to gank you.lynch is a liar. everything he's said to us that can be verified as a lie has been verified. that means the chances are that he's lying about suicide, especially when he laughed in my face when i spoke to him not as my character, but as the player behind the character, and asked him to talk to his gp, or at least the samaritans. he's an attention whore of the highest order - were he smart enough, i'd accuse him of being a mastermind intent on causing enough bad drama to make ccp step in. fortunately, he's demonstrated he's anything but smart. his last ceo suggested he log in as an alt for a few months and enjoy the game far, far away from any miner bumping. instead, he insists on being in the one system where we have significant numbers and provokes us further by updating his bio to say he's now a merc. with that killboard? these are not the actions of someone who deserves pity, mercy or sympathy."
"agreed, moar blinky lights and shiny things..."
"wednesday bump"
"their is a good reason, its the same one as why their are no bubbles. null sec and empire low are distinct pvp environments that have different styles of pvp. massive blobs aren't really a problem in low sec either. lack of pvp is low secs problem."
"you clearly don't know how to low sec."
"blank quote."
"the answer you seek is somewhere in here."
"supported. while it makes perfect sense for allied empires to have boarders from high sec space to their allies high sec space this makes no sense for nations at war. i would expect that any boarder between waring empires would be a war zone. i.e. low sec. if amarr and minmatar empires are supposed to be allied against the caldari and gallente empires then there should be no boarder between the two sides that is not contested. sure the current low sec faction war systems are the official \"war zone\" but how could any system that shares a boarder with an empire they are at war with be high security space? there are many high sec \"islands\" in the eve universe. the primary empires should at least be divided between two high sec \"continents\" with low sec space separating them. other lesser factions should be restricted to their own high sec \"islands\" one thing i have always though would be really cool in eve would be to have it more like an actual living universe. have the sec status of systems shift depending on how the war goes. as low sec systems are captured and secured the security level of surrounding systems should shift. if one side controls every system within a 6 jump radius of a high sec entry then that entry systems security rating should go up. like wise if the opposing side captures all the low sec systems bordering your high sec systems then the security rating of those high sec systems should drop. in order to stop this from allowing a powerful militia on one side from slowly chewing away at the other sides high sec eventually making that empire smaller, you could have live events where the empire navies jump into the systems the reclaim them for the original owning empire. these could be like a faction wars version of incursions where the winning side could then battle against the empires fleet of faction ships for big rewards. offer massive rewards to the losing side if they help to reclaim lost systems. of course it would have to be done in a way that the navy eventually wins to prevent entire regions from switching empire control. but it would make eve feel like a much more alive universe if security levels of systems fluctuated depending on the outcome of the war."
"please consider this ccp!! it is worth looking into and would make the game more interesting."
"i believe that it would be more interesting if all four empires were separtated. while it is silly to think that allied empires would not try to be connected to each other i propose that the reason they are not is through the work of their enemies.here is my lore explanation for the new regions and why the current gates were severed. the caldari states new jump gate technology to explore the rest of black rise has caused stargate wormholes to be unstable that are near black rise. this new region is called \"black void\" and has caused the connecting gallente and amarr stargates that are high security space to be severed due to their proximity. the gallente have also lost connection to the minmatar due to this strange event. black void would be a narrow sparsely filled region filling the void from the serpent's coil to algintal. many suspect this new jumpgate technology was not discovered by the caldari but purposely given to them by an unknown entity. the gallente have discovered a new ancient jumpgate network near the myrdian strip, and would be named after the local landmark. the angel cartel and serpentis have began moving in because they feel that their is ancient jovian technology to be had making it very insecure. this region will connect to minmatar and ammatar space with another connection to black void. the ammatar have decided to break all ties with the amarr and destroyed all their stargates in high security space. they wish to ally with the minmatar republic but they are still a sovereign state, at the same time the ammatar have found new gravity wells in divinities edge and began settling their. divinities edge will be the minmatar's new zone (kinda). amarr are huge and don't need ****, they just will connect to black void and divinities edge.currently each faction connects to their ally and their historial enemy by high sec while having to cross their allies space in order to get to the enemy of their friends space.because i got confused myself writing that here is a simplified formdivinties edge, black void, and myridian connect to each other so the path would be.caldari -> amarr = hisec -> black void -> hisecamarr -> gallente = hisec -> black void or divinity -> myrdian -> hisecamarr -> minmatar = hisec -> divinity -> hisecgallente -> minmatar = hisec -> myridian -> hiseccaldari -> minmatar = hisec -> black void -> divinity or myrdian -> hisecalso divinities edge would be difficult to properly place, maybe snuggler underneath ammatar space?for each race to reach their main enemies area they can still cross the current fw battlegrounds.all four races can reach the enemy of their friends more quickly by way of the already existing narrow constellations.along with a simplified map showing the basic interconnections between regionsbasic mapthe letters are abbreviations for the name of the regions or represent an entire empire as a whole.i know i am missing a lot of the currently existing empire low regions but i think that map follows the general layout minus high sec connections.keep in mind their will be more than one connection between the regions shown with connecting black lines, those just represent what regions do connect with each other. i may make a map that is more accurate and shows better how the new regions would fit into the current eve map but that is for another time.updatei have added a new map that is overlaps the current eve map showing where the proposed regions could go and what the new gates may look like.new map"
"under my plan you would probably spent the same amount of fuel getting to the closest high security empire. if you were in say providence and wanted to go to jita, you would have to spend a lot more fuel to get you their safely, but amarr will still be the same distance."
"i think exactly this would happen.why dont use a different approach of giving the possibility of a faster travel by \"layers\". say the universe would be a burger. high sec would be the meat itself. now to travel alot faster from deep gallente to the outer border of minmatar you would enter another tier, the \"cheese\". this low sec tier would enable you to do say 5 jumps instead of 30.doing so you give an advantage to people so that they want to use this way, instead of forcing low sec onto highsec players. i am myself dont stay in just one area. storywise this could be a middle thing of low sec and wormhole. after the wormholes the races did try to make an arteficial wormhole, which lead to the entrance of a parallel universe or the \"hyperspace\" like in babylon 5."
"that is how it is already, everyone just uses the high sec route because its easy and you can do it afk.with this change you will still have plenty of safe travel options available like wormholes and blockade runners. those who want more isk making opportunities by trade will have them and those who still want to be safe will have more difficulty and have to invent more time into getting to another empire but the lower volumes of trade going through will equal more profits per trip. the only play style that will be destroyed by this is the one of not being their at all while your freighter goes back and forth from amarr and jita all day."

"this thread has both moved wildly off topic and become well out of line.i will offer the following advice:if you feel you have been harassed in eve online, file a petition under the \"rules & policies\" category, and the \"harassment\" subcategory. do not discuss this on the forums, it only leads to issue and threads like this which are venomously dragged off topic. bumping, as per our current policy, is not a bannable offence. verbal harassment, however, is, and will be treated as such. everyone involved here need to take a step back from their keyboard, relax, and realize the gravity of the situation they have created.if anyone wants to re-open this topic for discourse with the csm they can feel free to to so, however any further off topic discussion of harassment and venomous attacks will result in people taking long vacations.locked.ccp falcon || eve universe community manager || @ccp_falcon"
"i like the idea, not sure i like jd capable variant. i also really like taking pods of new recruits. all the fun of seeing this ship pop and out comes immobile ships and pods scattering like roaches. :)would be even cooler if the pods randomly dropped like loot as well. meaning some pods just won't survive the crash."
"introduction:margin trading allows you to not have all of the market escrow up front to make a buy order but rather only need to provide a fraction of it. at level 5 you only need 24% of the escrow to place an order. the issue:1. the scammer puts up a buy order of a certain type of officer mod @ 2 billion isk with a minimum quantity of 4 mods.(meanwhile he offers the mods on market at 999m isk each on sell order and have them offered in contracts, you may believe you can make a quick profit but that is not the case)due to the skill margin trading he only has to put up 24% of 8 billion isk on that buy order 1,92b.while i may have had 2 officer mods in stock and purchased 2 of the officer mods offered on market at 999m isk each the buy order cannot be completed.now comes the annoying part:as the scammer made sure his wallet does not cover the 8 billion in order to complete the buy order (and you purchased his officer mods way too expensive), the scammer makes a huge profit.second, as the buy order could not be completed your officer mods will be placed on market @ 2 billion isk each, causing you having paid exhorbitant broker fees over 8 billion isk (!) while the actual mods are maybe all worth together just close to 1 billion isk.5 minutes later you, ofcourse, take this sell order off market again.may i suggest, in order to fix, that:1. a message should appear first saying that the buy/sell order cannot be completed due to insufficient credits of the holder of the buy order and if i , instead, would like to put my items on market instead as a sell order.this will avoid the exhorbitant broker fees.2. do we really need marging trading?now that scammers are abusing marging trading the skill has become absolete.my suggestion is to remove this skill totally, or that only buy orders up to a maximum of 100m isk can make use of the discount of the buy order (24% at level 5) and that any buy order above 100m isk needs to be guaranteed with100% of the buy orders value."
"may i start by saying how new and exciting this topic is. you are a true visionary among mortals to bring up this issue in your thread.i don't see a problem with this assuming the implementation isn't a problem. that's something that only ccp knows. you could also use simple view when using the market. this way you won't create your own orders, but only try to fullfill existing ones. with the advanced options open you'll always create a separate market order. it's one of the best skills a trader could have and is mainly used in legitimate trading. any trader worth a dime will also spot a margin trade scam a mile away, so the scam itself is mainly a trap for the inexperienced and greedy. what i'm saying is, that it's a god damn usefull skill and you can pry it out of my cold dead hands. i certainly don't want to give it up in order to childproof the market from such an obvious scam."
"lol"
"sorry to hear your loss man.unfortunately this \"feature\" is meant not only to do margin trading, but also to grief. ccp will not act against it and you will only get flamed for suggesting it, as you might have seen here.like in the real world you wont get a security deposit from those people.for the future just stick to the saying \"if somethings looks to good to be true, its not\". fly once to jita and you see x adverts in the chat for selling cnr via contract but its just a regular raven."
"here's a duplicate post for your duplicated thread.... .btw.. you should do some forum research, this has already been posted about 1000 times.... i 100% support this option. i think it is extremely reasonable, and should be implemented asap. i personally find the margin trading skill very useful. i am not a margin trade scammer, but am a buy/trader typically with billions in buy and sell orders. the ability of a scammer to scam with it is completely irrelevant to how i use the skill: i use the skill to maximize the buying potential of my isk. if you take this skill away, you will dramatically shift the isk-balance i maintain between isk on hand, isk in goods being sold, and my isk \"on credit\". essentially, margin trades are the only form of credit in the game. and when your credit bill is due, and you can't pay, you don't get the items you purchased with that credit. no one is harmed by the margin trade skill..... now, i also want you to consider something: how does a margin trade scammer make isk? the answer is, he doesn't make isk with his margin trade buy order (he loses money there!). instead, he makes isk when you to purchase overpriced goods from him. please consider this: when you buy goods to resell, you are responsible for the risks in owning those goods. you, and only you risk not being able to sell those goods for a profit.... no-one forces you to buy goods. it is 100% your choice to spend your isk as you see fit, and you should be 100% responsible for that choice. in other words, if you buy goods above market value, and find you can't sell them for a profit, that's your own fault... now, you deserve to know that buy orders are not guaranteed. i support altering the tutorial to emphasize this point. because when you understand this, then you should never, ever fall for a margin scam again. if you see a way to make a quick buck because you can quickly buy something cheap and resell it expensive, you would step back and go, \"that buy order isn't guaranteed, so i might not be able to sell these items at that price\". and then, since you're not stupid and moderately cautious, you will look into price histories, item movement rates, and, when you do so, margin scams are blatantly easy to spot."
"in addition to explain what i meant btw:here the last quote from current thread about recent dev blog \"bounties, kill rights, new modules and war in retribution\" - concerning other issues but the same problmem with ccp's quality control! ("
"this had probably be presented before and no i didn't take the time to confirm. the idea is pretty simple; jump freighters are crazy expensive and carriers take a long time to train. why not have something a little more attainable like a tech 2 orca that can do short jumps and carried less than a carrier, nothing fitted. it shouldn't be able to compete with the carriers or j/f at all.the fact that the jump ability is so exclusive makes moving into null and some parts of low really difficult. therefore one is forced to relay on promises to move this or that. if that promise is not honored then....well you either pay the mark up or gtfo. now again, i am not suggesting a true work horse like the j/f or anything as versatile as a carrier. just something a small corp or even an individual with decent resources and sp (30m sp for example) could use. i admit i am not a cap pilot (yes, this is an alt) but looking at the numbers i guess i am proposing a half- carrier or j/f across the boardhalf-carrier(not actually a carrier really)5km3 corp hanger125km3 ship maint bay3 ly jump rangeno combat abilitieshalf-j/f175km3 hold2.5 ly jump rangethese numbers could be further reduced as to not compete with carriers and j/f. the point, from my perspective, is to offer something else other than these very high end jump vessels. it stands to reason that someone in the cluster would have come up with something else by now."
"black-ops plus as many blocade runners as your heart desires works too."
"well true, but i was looking for something that could move a packaged bc (15km3). again, nothing fitted or assembled. so not the same as a j/f or carrier. the blockade runner does do the job to an extent but i think there is a significant gap that could be filled by what i am suggesting."
"the reason jump freighters are so expensive is because they almost never die. in low-sec, it's impossible to catch them - they can be in warp before pirates even realize the cyno is up, they can jump straight out of station camps, hit the gates at 0 and jump to high-sec, etc etc.most jf's that die, do so in one of three ways: a) suicide gank or war in high-sec b) stupidly jump to a gate or pos in low-sec and get tackled before they are in warp (requires extreme stupidity to pull off) or c) get sucked into bubbles in null-sec.your proposal makes sense until you consider that what you've suggested would still be nearly impossible to catch, and thus would require an exorbinate price tag to \"balance.\" you'd still be looking at 3 or 4 billion isk.to put jf's in perspective, i had one shortly after a year of playing eve. that's about 25 million sp, most of which were actually trained in orca. mind you, they were a lot cheaper back then. you can train for a jf in a little under 4 months, without implants or remaps. the \"skill time\" is not an impediment. their price is. but jump freighters were never meant to be individual assets, despite becoming used as such. a corporation should have no problem making 8 billion isk in 4 months as one of their own trains for the ship.where i do think your proposal has merit is that large ship maintenace bay (i'd even go so far as to say it should be bigger). currently, there is no decent way to ferry rigged battleships through high-sec unless you fly them yourself. i'm not sure even giving it a jump drive would be necessary to make it useful. this idea has, in fact, been presented before but i'm too lazy to search for it :)"
"that sounds like the tug idea that is currently being discussed. i understand your counter argument and appreciate you taking the time to discuss this. i still think it would be nice to have something more attainable, but it also sounds like this would be outside of the intentions of ccp and game dynamics. i guess the good news is that i am somewhat on the right track with the need to be able to move ships...though this doesn't address the 8 billion isk hurdle and being able to move them through low/null. guess i better make more friends, rat alot more, figure a better investment plan or plex it. thanks for you time and fly safe."
"i dont think it is like this right now. there are some shortcuts, but not to bring such a huge advantage of reaching jita from everywhere in high sec within 5 jumps. it maybe brings you 14 instead of 18 jumps. the risk this is bringing is not worth it.wormholes arent safe nor are they worth the trouble (finding it first, checking the mass of it, bringing a freighter in it). blockade runners arent worth their name. you only want to fly into low sec if you can fit a cloak like with the viator.certainly you would destroy the afk freighter routes but you would also ruin normal high sec players life by forcing them through low sec when they want to get from amarr to jita. again i am not against a buff of low sec systems. the new ore frigate is exemplary for that. more people will use it and try out more dangerous regions with a t1 frigate. therefore more mining will happen in low sec, therefore the mineral market will grow out there and you probably with have more professional mineral buyer getting the stuff back to high sec.but keep in mind that \"where there is a winner, there is a looser\". that would cause people to quit who dont want to live with this kind of buff of yours for the low sec, therefore the felt and real nerf of their playstyle.if you really want to get rid of afk freighter, you need to find ways to make it worth not flying afk (and by that i dont mean you will be killed by afk - what you are right now anyway in uedama)."
"wormholes are actually extremely safe, if you only have to jump through one wormhole system then if you have a scout you can't be caught, if something bad shows up just jump back through the wormhole and it will collapse. then you also have wormholes that go from one high security space system to another that are fairly common. i think half of all high sec wormholes can fit freighters.i doubt the new mining frigate will change much, i will probably make more isk per hour in high sec.finding wormholes or flying a cloaked hauler is not hard and i'm sure a freighter pilot will easily adapt, the lower volumes of items being traded between places hopefully will be a good thing. also not being afk is not going to safe you from suicide gankers. even if you gave freighters frigate agility they would still be easily killed. secondly, if i go from hek to jita it is 18 jumps by high sec, through low sec it is 9, amarr to rens through lowsec will also safe you 9 jumps. nobody seems to use these routes or try to secure rancer because why bother if i can go watch tv for a few hours and i get their anyway."
"the removal of pos shields will not kill poses or wh corps you just won't be able to leave ships outside of ship maintainance bays any more i imagine the interface they're going to be looking at will make pos's very much like stations in that you can 'dock' with them, taking you out of combat while you're in them the difference being between a pos and a real station is number of dock able ships, and features available while docked"

"actually, i like the idea and it does seem to make mining a lot more interactive other than just watching local and dscan for potential gankers.i support this proposal and i'm not even a miner.+1 also the part about scanning blue wrecks would be great if it's done with the ships onboard system scanner instead of needing probes. that would make it much easier and faster to find them, especially for new players.dmc"

"+1 agree completely"
"you can suggest whatever you like - such is the power of the internet. you don't even have to ask for permission.snarkiness aside, no. there's no reason to fix this - people just need to learn how to stop and think for five damned minutes. instead of rushing headlong into unexplored territory (large isk value market trading) take 5 damned minutes to do a little research and realize - wow, something's fishy here.the part i find odd about all this is the heavy duty traders don't seem to fall for this scam. it's the dabblers and the get rish without any work crowd that seem to get bitten. and frankly, that's just fine with me."
"so here's how it's going to go:when a corp joins/leaves the alliance it makes a \"copy\" of that war which is \"transferred\" to the new entity. this \"copy\" isn't a copy, but a new war. it sets the start date of that war as the moment that the corp joined/left the alliance. that means all i have to do is set all the wars unmutual (so they can't instant retract them), and then cycle corps in/out of alliance constantly (thus renewing an inescapable 7 day war timer), and when the corp rejoins the alliance, the alliance's dropped wars will get restored by the new war copy. a completely inescapable non-mutual trap.dec shield non-mutual exploitthe above photo is taken from a corp that left dec shield on the 26th. it was with 250+ wars. now 4 days later not a single war has ended (when 4/7ths of the wars should have ended by now by random distribution). you'll note the two wars that \"started\" on the 30th. those are corps that dropped out of an alliance and have received fresh 7 day war timers against me as a result.the solution to this problem is pretty straight forward. set the start time of each war to the start time of the original parent war it spawned from."
"so this will still not be fixed come dec 4th?"
"no, it will not be fixed.i would like to take this moment to thank people for white knighting for ccp. but like i said. you will all go free when you can get free on your own. i am not releasing any of you early because the system is not fixed. and it is not fixed until it is. i've not been hiding any of the methods i'm using from anyone. there is no reason it shouldn't be fixable."
"that is so not tight butthole. i dislike the constant notifications, it hurts my eyes."
"i think this would be a great idea for two main reasons,1) true trade corporations could begin to crop up, not these one man 10 alt corps that all have freighters and just afk bus goods from caldari to amarr to gallente to minmatar space. we would see coordinated efforts of multiple players making convoys to make isk.2) we would see real, honest to goodness mercenary/security corps that are hired to disrupt or protect these supply routes. this gives new players somewhere to fit in, it may in fact make eve a little more new player friendly while preserving the \"eve is harsh\" attitude.overall prices will rise, but innovation and teamwork, as always, will allow for isk making opportunities.tl;dr, +1"
