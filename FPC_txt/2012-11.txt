supporting this alsothis whole thing is just a massive fiasco  especially the mutual war side of it which is seeing rvb get into mutual wars with 1 man nobodies we never even wanted to dec in the first placeand massively increasing war costs too
supporting alsowith the new bounty hunting payouts wardecs are going to be a strong mechanism for collecting bounties this issue and the new system and pricing in general has driven out some of the good mercenary corps and alliancesa simple fix as probably proposed already is to lock corporations at war from joining alliances so transfer cannot occurhowever the price of wars also needs to be addressed as many clients cannot afford the costs to obtain their goals this is another aspect i see that is leading to the loss of many mercs in the market placeperhaps bounties will fix that especially pos bounties if ever implemented but the price has to be right for example when it costs more to wardec than the cost of the pos why bother who would pay to have this removed imo bring back the old cost of wars it worked fine
im surprised ccp havent commented on this yetit so obviously needs doing dont think ive seen anyone disagree yet also this in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
ok so after playing around on the test server i have seen that the new buff to t1 logi has totaly made t2 logi not needed at all why risk a 160mil ship when a 7mil ship does the same thing you need a 14 of the skills and get the same ship at 18 of the price with the same tank with in some case better rep ok u lose like 12k on ur rep range big dealwhat is the point in flying t2 what is the point in training logi 5 please tell me this will be adjusted to be more in line with other shipsplease dont make t1 logi the new drakes of eve
if this is true then its a genuine concernalthough a 12 km range difference is a pretty big deal in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
it is but having the same tank at the same speed with the same rep in a t1 hull u can afford to move in 12k the real problem i have is if you ask any true logi pilot they will all tell you the same thing logi 5 is a must to be a logi pilot with these ships you need logi 0 and u can effect the fight the same way a logi 5 pilot can
i think they will be nerfing it i read about it being bad and it sounds like t2 logi will be useless afterward but who knows
a couple of things to be weary of 1 t1 logis are not as cap resilient as t2 logies and have lower base hp lower sensor strengths lower targeting range slower alignment lower warp speeds and most importantly lower base resists being a little faster having an extra slot and an extra rig will make up some of that but not as much as youd think 2 the t2 logis will be altered in future expansions as they havent been rebalanced yet you could look at many of the rebalanced cruiser hulls and compare them to hacs or recons and complain about how t1 cruisers are nearly as good or better in some circumstances than their corresponding hacrecon but so what t2 ships will get their due enjoy the plethora of new ships to play with now ive flown exequrors for quite a while but very rarely for logisitics purposes often purely for bait now i can actually use the ship in its intended role
t1 logis cant fit larger remote repair mods without almost completely giving up their tank thus they will never be able to repair as much as the traditional t2 logistics cruisers
well i dont know about anyone else but i thought it was a good idea im guessing thats what counts
time to  its the phrase coined by ccp to measure how long will it take player to create a  using this feature used to asses the degree of freedom given
it wouldnt be long till someone spawned these all over the place or put one up saying it was on this spot where wilks checkov first had censored with a space goat he went on to do this many more times in the surrounding areaor other forms of spam etcjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
limit them to one per system if you want to anchor another you have to blow up the existing one firstabout ttp if theyre limited it shouldnt be bad look at station names for example worse cases could be petitioned for removal
have to agree 1 per system would not be bad and petition if someone does a royal screw up with naming it or doing a foul description
could simply be 1 per system it wouldt be bad if they made it an isk sink it be pointles though
why would it be intentional
so that people move around the universeso that different regions can have different prices for thingsso that people in highlowzero security space cant bid on things in other security sectors without traveling therejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i would like to see addedsome suggestions highsec  midsec  lowsec each has their own sec specific news cast plays top 40 of user submitted tunes for 30 min weve commercials intermixed plexbountiesetc this could incorporate flash traffic news if someone has entered the system within 5 jumps10 jumps that is wanted not sure about this one the radio panel allows for station tuning which includes voting ability for the song add a voting option using 110 criteria enable song genre wuser ability to select what genre they think the song is after intial blast 3090 days all songs that fit certain genre would be moved to their own radio station so that users can select channels of preferenceedited for new idea a station that incorporates aviation commsradio chatter all ships in system select locations to goto and an air traffic control station could play voice overs that authorize or recognize movement tofrom locations not everyone could be on at once just input some system that enables random comms that simulate airtraffic this could incorporate hostiles at a certain jump gate etc
this would add alot of atmosphere to eve as well as being a useful media to aid noobseach factionregion can have its own radio station with their own unique tracks and commentary you could also have notifications about incursions faction warfare and random rp commentariesi know eves story is lacking and roleplayers are ignored but it may retain alot of noobs which is always goodps i recommend you add some formatting to your post just to make it easier to read
i shall laugh if you havent unclicked auto pay
so a new variation of exploit based on dead corporations1 get a dead corporation into alliance2 have all the wars set mutual in the alliance3 boot dead corp from alliance4 laugh maniacally as everyone is now trapped in mutual outgoing wars against a dead corporationthere is no escape there is no way to reason or talk your way out of it you are literally screwed forever and no one but gms can help you as of writing this all 169 wars were in are at war with a dead corporation you cannot be set free ever
now if you want them to fix it have every one of those 169 corporationsalliances submit a petition to the gm staff if a flood of  you and your game mechanic for this  doesnt get their attention nothing will
it seems that ccp did change wardec mechanics slightly recentlynow when youre at war with a corporation itll send you a notification the moment they get accepted into an alliance weve gotten multiple reports of this today and ive never seen it before pretty sure this wasnt here a few days ago this was one of our suggested fixes see ccp does love us
t1 logis are still worse just not useless
the ships get a 15 boost  level to rep amounts at level 5 1 medium remote repper on the t1 logistics is almost worth a large remote repper on the t2 logisitcs ships also since the pg requirements for large shield xfers is pretty low you can create 3 lst  2x met ospreys that perma outrep 51 basis you gimp your tank to do this especially when compared to the basis in the end the t1 logis are comparable to t2 logis in terms of operation range and logistics ability they just are not as durable meaning in larger engagements the t2 logis are very much worth the extra price tag in throw away gangs the t1 logi bring a lot to the field for a nice low cost ratio they seem well balanced to me at the moment
if this is correct then with the imminent aggression rules not being able to dockjump if repping an aggressor a t1 rep would be better unless the tank and rep amount is going to double for the t2
the tank on t2 is significantly higher most t1 logistics cruisers have 12 to 23 the resistances and ehp for that matter of t2 logistics cruisers the loss of t2 resists is huge to logistics ships
the op is exagerating theyre not better theyre just functional if you want a survivable brawler logi you go with the traditional t2 fi your goal is just repping power where you dont care about the logis life then you can swarm cheap t1 logi fodder
this actually means we can now use cheap t1 logis for those annoying to fix pos guns
the problem after examining ccps new crimewatch seems to lay with looting it is hard to understand how fixing a brokenmechanic with another broken mechanic makes any senseto get to the point rather it seems that the entire big fix to others looting illegal is to flag that person so he can get attacked by anyone it sounds good at first but what exactly is to stop this person from just dropping a jetcan then looting into it for his corp to loot which by the way then flags the original owner back into the same situation this kind of stupid can ownership looting can only be the dreamchild of a shortsighted person while this is what our current system is this new change will in term only make it so every ganking thief just has to incorporate a suicider in a rookie ship to get what they wanttake it like this if you go and steal a car and then you park it in a garage and a friend takes it are the police going to stop looking for it because you gave it away well in essence crime watch says yes this isnt real this is stupidthe answer and hold on it isnt an easy on the answer is every single item has its own individual timer every stolen item regardless of what it is flags the new owner since it is in essencestolen now these timers can easily start after it is only stolen the first time so they dont keep resetting but it is a much better and real solution then just saying the rookie ship absorbed all the crimethank you for your time
im a recent victim to the trade window scam now i understand technically its my fault for falling for such a thing then i thought about it some more and figured hey ill try and petition it only to be told that they dont consider it an exploit and that it cant be reimbursed and that they encourage ppl not to trade with ppl with the trade window but through contractsso why have it there i lost my mind so im being told by the gms not to use a function in game because it can be exploited but wait its not an exploit my apologies its a coding error it has to be right nope apparently its not that either  still not able to wrap my head around it if im trading something for say 100 mil isk and is read 100 mil isk in game then thats what im getting in game but again apparently its not an exploit when i find only 100 isk not 100mil isk in my wallet its like me writing 2 zeros on a 100 dollar bill and calling it a 100 dallar bill ive read many places that dont trade with ppl you dont trust in game using the trade window it wasnt the person i was trading with i needed to trust it was the trade window stating i was getting the money i agreed to now how the in the world can i trust anything in the game if a simple trade window reads 100 mil isk and i get 100 iskstill for the love of god cant wrap my head around how this is ok in their eyesi understand other scams i wouldnt be so angry had i fallen for those i would just be an idiot but trusting in a game mechanic only to have it exploited on me then be told its not an exploit and sorry for your loss blows my mind when i play a fps i have to trust that when i press a button my weapon will fire in eve when i see in a trade window the amount of money i agreed with and press accept i need to trust thats the amount im getting end of story dont know how this hasnt been resolved sooner

fix broken paragraphing walls of text are bad mmmkay
we all know that over the last few years ccp has constantly buffed highsec carebears proportionally to how much they moaned on the forums yet even after barge changes and the 25x increase in wardec costs in the last 6 months alone they still cry out for highsec to be nerfed to the ground even after all the bones ccp has fed them they still whine what does this showit shows they cannot be satisfied and that trying to please them without killing the game will be pointless so what needs to happen now we need a reversal of the nerfs that the carebears have bought inital wardeccing costs need to be bought down insurance needs to be returned to concorded ships eventually ending with an eve unspoilt by their whinging as it was meant to be mr johnny ccp employee may think its a good idea but what about all the lost subscriptions well do we need these people who do nothing but return to their keyboard every 40 minutes to unloaded ice into their stationary orca who only interact with other players when they are nerfcalling on the forums or filling local with their foul language i think not perhaps some of them will be able to adapt to the changes and actually fit a tank on their ship others may choose to vent their frustration that they have the right to sit in space making isk for plex in an endless cycle and that getting ganked will cause them to ragequit and cancel their insert number of subsciptions here accountsbut what is lost in their subscription fees will be gained in returning players who left because of the mistakes ccp has made in the past and new ones that have been inspired by tales such as a burn jita event twice as large as the one in april enabled by the restoration of common sense to highsec of course gankers are still ganking but if highsec were restored to its original format it would be more prevelant crucible was supposed to reignite the fire it did that to some extent if it werent the thorn in the backside that ended most maelstrom ganks then we had inferno the wardec fee changes and barge buffs both harmed highsec severely lets hope that trend doesnt continue and we mend the damage before its too latethis post was not bought to you by an npc corp alt

helloin the last month our corporation got 2 war declarations by 1man corps both only wanted to fill their killboard these wardecs are just disturbing and nothing more it makes poooof exactly one time and the fun is over for usokay i know i will not make many friends with my suggestion but its only a suggestion both corps must have a minimum of 10 members to declare or to recieve a warjust my two centsfly safe
workaround pile 10 alts into a corp declare war have 9 of the alts leave the war continues so long as it is paidproblem research and manufacturing poss will be used exclusively by 1 man corps since no one can declare war on them you have now effectively made highsec poss invulnerable
facepalm how about we stick to the topic at hand here
i use the trade window all the time and not once have been scammed including trades with well known scammers in amarr and jita
thank you sushi nardieu i appreciate your supportdont forget to vote 
its sad that legitimate wars are being ruind because of this group tbh
it seems more that they dont want to know anything about this i assume nowcustomer service says thats everything working like intended and forum posts where devs are maybe watching were deleted 
i think id much rather just see the ability to custom skin a ship with an aurum bought skin i want my roden shipyards skinned megathron pretty badly i would also pay for the ability to have rainbow lasers

this proposal started from the idea of wouldnt it be cool if you could rename your alliances system in nullsec after giving the idea a lot of thought i eventually realized that this is the kind of vanity item that ccp has been looking to sell via microtransactions in fact renaming an entire system in eve would almost be the ultimate vanity itemadvantages for players what better way to show ownership of a system than to rename it this would give players a greater emotional attachment to their sov space creating more attachment to the game tired of all the confusing codes for nullsec systems a given name is far easier to remember as more systems get renamed over time nullsec systems will become easier to identify and remember and nullsec will become correspondingly easier to navigateadvantages for ccp this would be a highend microtransaction to generate revenueso heres the proposal a system can only be renamed if the same alliance has continuously held sovereignity in that system for the past year this ensures that alliances can only rename systems they own and it effectively makes a higher sov threshold for holding a system for an entire year a proposal for a system rename can only be initiated by the ceo of the executor corporation of the sovereignityholding alliance this creates a clear single point of contact for communications from the sovholding alliance to ccp all renames must be approved by ccp who can reject any suggested name for any reason ccp must keep the final word on what system names are allowed in the game each alliance may only rename one system every x months this is to keep the workload for ccp manageable especially during the initial period after the process goes live i would suggest starting with a period of one rename every 3 months or so the time interval can be shortened at a later date if the rename process proves to be popular once an acceptable name has been submitted there is a fee to be determined by ccp to rename the system this is an economic decision to be made by ccp i would expect payment to be in the form of plex the current system names should be preserved as a system code which is visible when you do a show info on the system this is to preserve the accuracy of existing nullsec maps so they can continue to refer to the current system codes without having to be updatednotes system renames arent permanent but under this proposal they are pretty close in order for someone else to change the system they have to take sov in that system and hold sov there continuously for an entire year before it becomes eligible to be renamed again so in essence the rename is permanent while your alliance continues to hold sov in that system and if you lose the system you have an entire year to get it back if you want to keep someone else from renaming it

i think you mean purely symbolic rather than pointless but thats probably a distinction without a difference
people will move around regardless they will in fact move around even more when they can purcahse or bid on contracts in other regionsprices will always fluctuate at least it will be up to you to proove they will consolidate if people can bid upon or accept contracts in other regionswhy should people have to be in the same region the contract is in before being able to accept or bid on itbtw take a look at this recent chat from one of the trade channels i took the liberty of screen dumping it i will remove it if anyone wants me to
exploit of the daybuilding off the previous bug of allowing dead corporations into alliance apparently you can make identical copies of those corporations at the same timestep 1 make a corporationstep 2 apply to join alliancestep 3 alliance hits accept on your applicationstep 4 disband the corporationstep 5 reform the corporation with identical name ticker etcstep 6 repeat steps 25 as many times as desiredstep 7 enjoy your clonesthe test corp used was unstable mitosis xpltr founded by the cloner
isent the typhoon better for that than the t2 logies if you get to not care about ehp and survivability
it also means newbies can help out with logistics and be good at it
im not going to say that i dont like this exploit because i dowhat i like more is that the new bounty system is planning on letting anyone place a bounty on anyone else regardless of their sec statuscheck it outquotebounties can now be placed from anywhere in the game not just the bounty office in stations bounties on the same character go into a joint pool same as now the minimum isk amount for placing a bounty is increased from 5k to 100k also bounties can now be placed on anyone weUFFFDre removing the 1 security standing requirement currently in the bounty systempoor minershahahaha
not like that isnt going to be abused to hell and backsomehow i feel this is not the desired fix to the bounty system we have been asking for
oh please taking from a can generating a global crime flag is already massive overkill suggesting that it be taken even further so flipping the item gives even more people that global crime flag is ridiculous
its overkill to generate a flag from stealing from a can whatso stealing without consequence is real thats about as unreal as you could take this gameplease come to my house and steal something we will see how overkill my reaction is
first off here are the mechanics now i can steal a can only you and your corp can attack me then if i jetison that loot and you can take it back and then anyone in my corp can gank you essentially we currently have the if you go and steal a car and then you park it in a garage and a friend takes it are the police going to stop looking for it because you gave it away situation that you call stupid with the change i steal from a can and become a suspect where everyone can shoot me off the bat if i jetison the can it is immediately set blue because im flagged as a suspect so everyone can steal from that can without getting flagged this is a direct consequence of the devblogs statement essentially the change makes it so can flipping is pointless if you leave stuff to steal and someone steals it they shouldnt bother ejecting it and just keep it since everyone can shoot them someones bound to do it besides the old i steal from you and then if you take it back i get to shoot you was a flawed concept to begin with
i would like to see this name with the following descriptiondear paying customers and players of eve online we have decided to call the next expansion retroaction we are going to employ real coders to facilitate fixing the thousands of bugs derps fail mechanics idiotic introductions and then removals we have made you endure for a decade and stop pretending like we are forging ahead regardless when in reality we are chasing our tails around like a labrador on a mission we will also be recruiting multilingual foot removers so that we can actually have enough time without our feet in our mouth to have lunch every once in a whilei highly recommend this for approval

agree  scrap aurum altogether
not supported only because it would just get messy like renaming of stations with just ridiculous names and really would you want to say oh set destination to freddy starr ate my hamster or jimmy saville how could you not know systemyou know where i am going with this dont youhowever i do think that the whole system names needs to be looked at just like highlow sec
30 member corpcant deal with a single pilot war deccing themlmao how bad at eve are you
bump
think the point is that yes the t1 logi are sweet there rep and range are pretty close to that of the t2 and yes the tank is a little less but with that being said why train an extra 3 months or more for the t2 stuff when the differences is so small it dont make sense i think what they really should look at doing is cutting down the range of these ships and maybe gimp the tank just a little more i am a logi pilot its all i do and i will tell you i am very happy to have a buff in this area anything that brings more logi pilots into fleet i am in favor of how ever i dont want to have all the time i spent training up for that scimi or basi to be in vain cuz the t1 is so close to being just as good 1 cut down the range alot i think 35k should be max 2 gimp the ehp a little more not by much just a little3 keep the rep amount as is these things i think will still let low sp players in the fight but will also not  the old vets who have spent so much time on logi training ps love the logi frigs how ever the caldari one looks like a lego also will there be a t2 if so my sabre pilots will love u
do me a favor get on the test server and make a 41 osprey tanked like u would a standard bassi lets say 421x lse 21x invul1x em1x eccm1x mwd 1x damge control 1x say well u got some room here so do what u would likeand x2 acr t1that is a basic basi fit ok know take the new osprey and see what u can do mind u ya dont have the fitting problems cuz med reps  trust me i played and played with it you can make it have more tank and rep the samei know the t2 is always gonna be a little better but in the case of these ships the difference is sooooo small it makes t2 not worth it
you still have one low on that basi often filled with an overdrive pds or nano depending on preference now compare it to what you get out of the 41 osprey which has 2x lows and 3x resist rigs to fix the small gap in its shield hp 5300 on the osprey vs 5900 on the basi which isnt too bad until you consider resists the glaring gap in its resists resists are extremely important when using rr while the osprey has equivalent em and exp the kintherm of 5163 on the osprey to 878816 on the basi is very significant the combination of shield resists vs hp give the osprey 15000 ehp in shields compared to 25000 ehp in shields on the basi the glaring cap problems the osprey is not cap stable with 1 xfer and a running mwd with the mwd off its only 55 cap stable and very susceptible to neuts it reps less base hp osprey 269 hps vs basi 307 hps it has significantly lower sensor strength osprey 314 vs basi 431 you cant fix all of the above with 2 lowslots and 3x rigs the most important thing to fix is the resists which can be brough closer to the basis but not that much play around with those 3x rig slots and 2x shield hardeners all you want youll have about 70 resists across the board decent but the basi will still have 28 barrage  63 lasers  95 hybrids more shield ehp than the osprey the rest shouldnt matter additionally repping to a basi is 16 barrage  46 lasers  78 hybrids more effective than reps to this osprey fixing the rep amount of the osprey vs the basi can be fixed with deadspace reppers but i really dont think smallmedium deadspace modules will remain cheap as their usagedestuction coupled with the increased demand for them will dramatically increase their price it already has from market speculation fixing the energy issues could be reduced  eliminated by using pdus  cprs in the 2x lowslots the sensor strength could be boosted with a backup array to the ospreys benefit it is significantly faster osprey 1700 ms vs basi 1500 ms unless the basi fits an overdrive or nano making them equal it is significantly cheaper osprey 1015m vs basi 150175m in the end the osprey will be a good ship but it will still rep less and it will be less survivable the 42 basi outperforms it in almost every meaningful way and the 51 basi significantly outperforms it in every manner except speed
this isnt simply someone dying this is someone who was murdered doing something they believed in defending the rights and liberties of an entire peoplewhilst those who commited the heinous act may themselves have held a similar set of beliefs themselves is something that few seem to think abouthowever as a community i think that for those who can and who want to an opportunity to give a donation towards the wellbeing of his family as a sign of respect solidarity and compassion is the least we can offer
after waiting 4 days for my petition to be answered i know of others that were sent after mine but answered sooner i get thishithe tactics used to generate perpetual wars using the mutual war option are at this time considered a normal use of the game mechanics and not an exploit or harassmentif you feel this is a matter that needs to be addressed your best route is to either make a post in the features and ideas discussion section of the eve online forums or you can bring the matter up before the csm in the assembly hall section we realise this is not an ideal solution however we are unfortunately not able to discuss ideas and suggestions for game improvement via the petitions system best regardsas i respondedso disbanding my corp to get out of a war dec isnt against the rules thats not what ive heard  so to avoid a working mechanic is to break a rule i dont need the bs response as i know that they have admitted to war decs being broken and missusedtheir responsewhile players may say they are exploiting or abusing game mechanics ccp is the ultimate authority on what consists of an exploit or abuse of game mechanics at this time the mutual war declaration mechanics are not broken and using them in this manner is not an exploitas this is the case there is no further action we may take in this instance you may leave the war through normal game mechanics by either offering surrender terms or if your surrender is declined you may unconditionally surrender by disbanding your corporation this will end the war immediately and afterwards you may reform the corporation under the same name leaving a war by this method is fully permissible by the game mechanics and is not an exploitbest regardsdoing a bit of research of my own it has been stated that it is ok to disban abd reform up with the same corp name etc etc this is some talk about it being done too much can result in hammers dropping so pretty much ccp has made it undesireable to war dec anyone which in turn means if you want to fight go to low and null sec or wait for some random corp to war dec you then just join dec shield for a day as the gm closed this petition i didnt get a chance to go into the fact that we cant join an alliance and are getting spammed by newb corps joining dec shield to catch other corps in this trap so please hurry up and catch goons in this trap so it can be considered an exploit better yet ccp put in a damn retract war option how hard is it

apart from the general add pve content none of this will make any differencethe biggest overhaul that will have the most effect is fixing the whole broken corporate managementroles structurei got lucky 2 months after the game in that i got recruited by a small corp mainly into miningpve and got shown the bigger picture as to what was possible with a little helpwith a tow i got into industry but now im at a position where im not going to risk recruiting new players as much as id love to do because its too easy for them to rip off all my bpos and production and even with an api key i have no way of knowing if theyre a real noobie player or just a noobie alt of a corp thiefand yes this is an now an alt although this was my first original toon
fail the customer is the ultimate authority ccpand more and more i begin to regret for paying my accounts in the light of such answers concerning obvious exploits of one of the most importat game mechanic and denying of all what about addon inferno was annouced beforeso after 6 weeks of complaining of so much ppl in various forums here i would like to have an official statement from more then botgms finally this is the assembly hall of csm sitting on their 0sec asses instead poking ccp to give answers herei guess i wont pay for an upcoming bounty system in which its to risky to declare a war beause of getting trapped in such childish bugs and ccpstatements
i actually dont advise cancelling your accounts ccp are working on the issue and they do intend to stop me they will fix wardecs soon theyre just working hard to make sure the retribution expansion goes off without any major bugs before they start tweaking interrelated game mechanics that could interact in unexpected ways one step at a time and its likely that were the next step
maybe they work on this issue maybe not  but they are unable to communicate with the community about such an important and obvious issue again after incarna
oh cool new exploits incoming 
more like within three days
any chance ccp going to fix this war systemseems like petitions get ignored posts get deletededited and seems like political answers from gmsis this kind of thing ccp endorsed thenspace cadet online  a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks  public npsi events fleet  launching 28th august
yes petitions get answered contact the csm which kind of makes it a closed loop process because the csm wont even make their own comment about it what is being asked for here is practically impossible to achieve because it would mean ccp having to admit they ballsed another mechanic up and simultaneously requiring the csm to actually prove they give a damn
hello guys thanks for the mail and im happy to give you an update on the situation here essentially the issue is this  the team that was responsible for the wardec system overhaul was never allowed the room in their sprint schedule for proper through on the wardec system following infernos release they were assigned bounty hunting as the headline feature for winter and the pressure on them has been to finish and deliver bounty hunting first and foremost this leaves wardecs in a completely unacceptable state in the meantime and this has been a major point of contention between the csm and ccp ever since they were given their assignments this fall weve asked time and time again when this issue was going to be addressed and basically told the same thing each time priority was finishing the new items bounty hunting salvage drones and microjumpdrives before wardecs would be revisited obviously this is not the priority the csm would have preferred as it is a poor example of ccp following through on their commitment to iteration before new features not to mention many of us still think microjumpdrives are uselessso in otherwords for most of the summer and fall there really hasnt been any news to report other than were aware of the issue and speaking to ccp about it is that the answer anyone wants to hear of course not as reflected by your current email but its the truth nonetheless weve just been up against a resource allocation issue that was beyond our ability to control that is not to say in any way that the fight is over recently alekseyev karrde successfully landed a 1 on 1 meeting with ccp soniclover to review this situation and once again deliver the message that wardecs are in a completely unacceptable state and that the situation continues to worsen and threaten the usefulness of even having a wardec system in the first place aleks felt the session was productive in terms of making sure that the development team understands exactly what needs to be done but this doesnt resolve the shortterm issue of lack of time being devoted to fixing this since retribution is about at the hardening phase where its all about polishing finished code its extremely unlikely this will be addressed in the dec 4 release from the meeting with ccp soniclover aleks was able to confirm that not only is wardecs 1 on the teams own backlog but that they will attempt to work on this in point releases following retributions initial release well keep you posted as things develop but thats about all there is to share on the news front where wardecs are concernedi appreciate everyones patience this affects all of us most of us on the csm are involved in this through one war or another and i know how frustrating it is to not have an end in sight just understand that weve been in the dark as much as you regarding when this will be addressed and are continuing to hammer this as one of the most critical pieces of unfinished business from the last couple of expansions at the upcoming summit well not only bring up this issue once again but will also be emphasizing the importance of followthrough on broken systems in the future as this is one of the low points in the road to iterative development when compared to say faction warfare where proper resources have been allocated to add the needed polish for the system to function properlydont hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions email is fastest as the assembly hall is essentially a redundant version of features and ideas discussion section of the forums and weve been long lobbying for them to remove it completely and consolidate the two so players arent posting in a relatively inactive part of the forum o7
well said 
soas long as you start no wars there is no trappings and no issues right
yes as long as none of the companies in your entire alliance starts a war youre safe
1 to get rid of current system
well said kidding me do you mean his pronunciation this is crapmy whole alliance is stuck the major improvement of the last patch keeps us nothing else but waiting high sec mining industry and incursions are forbidden billions of isk lost every day my members became told by any gm to disband the alliance and reform a new corp what should i say fuck off came in my mind i seriously think about questioning for a reimbursement of lost playtime for every char stuck in my alliance this is not a play for free game i pay for everything they announce fixing the wardec system was the bigtime project of last summer i extended my accounts because i was happy to read this now i spend my money to not play the game properlyevery time you point out that the problem is the copy mechanism of the wars a gm tells you that the mutual war is okay and then they close the petition no one answers me directly about the copying as i stated before ccp wrangler said about the last dec shield that the multiplication of wars can end in a ban and is not accepted at all to ccpbefore you add new crap fix the old stuffps i was playing around on the test servermicro jump drive actual crapnew camera mode more then crapmoney and people put to work at the right part nope
ok first of all ty for an update on this issue finallysecond this all seem reflect once again that ccp dont understands what could happennot only the most advertised feature of inferno addon but also a key gamemechanic of retribution is obviously a trap for everyone in this mmo who wants to use itso fixing it not till retribution would be rediculous and cant be intended seriouslythis  in combination with an completely floping customer support would even mean that ppl cant use keyproperties of eveonline for more than a half yearafter presenting this in our circles i heard for the first time of my 4 years eve carrer more than one thinkings about demanding back money through complaints for these months till it would be fixed finallybrib vogt seems to foretell already something like that tooppl will unsub if they get furtherhin suggested to reform their corps for every war which they have to declare as mercs for the next timenot the mechanics of mutual wars is the problem thereby but the fact that there is so less to fix to get it running well combined with ccps behavior and prioritys makes so many ppl angry and frustrated againafter 6 weeks of no information there is no patience anymore tbh  everybody is thinking hard about his next steps
lol as long you are not use inferno features u are still save true
yeshowever rvbs issue with this is we are now trapped in mutual wars we actually never started in the first place  and that we have to pay the initial weeks cost for as the aggressor the wars themselves do not bother us as 90 of the 3rd parties are bears who were simply trying to hide from another war by joining ds in the first place and we have too much fun shooting ourselves to hunt them down the rest are annoying but usually consist of epic fail groups hoping to leet pvp us to death or who leet pvp camp hubs as rvb space is scary for thembut yes this whole thing is broken
hans jagerblitzenyour text is informative and well writtenbut what i really read out of it is thiscsm seems to be totally powerless and therefore has no reason to existall you can do is talk to ccp and ccp on the other hand just ignores it and use th
the team working on war decs is the same one that is charged with making bounty hunting for retribution which is one of the highlight features for that expansion its looking pretty good too no amount of posting will get that priority switched upthankfully you do have a few members on the csm not content to just sit on their hands as hans mentioned i talked one on one with ccp soniclover specifically to confront him about the lack of attention to war dec iteration and the numerous problems facing the system to my pleasant surprise that meeting actually went very well and has been diligently followed up on i can confirm there will be some probably minor warrelated items in the initial retribution release with many more to come shortly there after ive seen the list as it stands theres still going to be room for improvement ie its not everything we need imo but several of the changes represent significant improvements over the status quokeep your eye out for a warrelated dev blog in the not too distant future with lots of details on what team super friends has in mind
so sry for bothering you and thx for helping ccp to keep the forums clean dudefrom the initial posting by zerg about this issue here to the first statement of you guys 44 days were gone and you want to tell us something about amounts of postings this isnt a sign that you r even not sitting on your hands even every petireply i heard about ends with the demand to make a forumpost about it gms may feel helpless too or just want to appease who knowsnevertheless i guess you also do not understand how serious some ppl that issue take concerning trust in ccps ability to care for money worth quality in the futurebeyond sharing the impression csm seems to be to tame in representing player bases interests thx for the further informations tho
aleks hans and kelduum have all been actively involved in fixing these issues from the start just because it hasnt been public knowledge does not mean theyve been sitting on their hands what you should be asking yourself is what are the other csm members doing where have they been all this time
the current wardecsystem has such obvious holesit should not even be on the csms to report it to ccp ccp should have known before they patched it not seeing this was already sad after people showed the issue it should have been fixed it right away and been done not doing this is even more sad needing 2 months to finish it and pissing off the player base in this manner just takes the cakethis is much too important and obvious to oversee and the critique has to go to ccp directly no playerconcil should be neededim waiting for a fix every dayregardsdestriouth hollow
maybe they have not been sitting on their hands but they havent got their fingers on their keyboards either as musiaba wrote in my second answer a a gm wrote thank you for your feedback on the war declaration system but i am afraid we are unable to address potential changes to game systems through the petition systemhe wrote feedbackand we recommend such suggestions be posted to the features  ideas discussion part of the eve online forums as the developers frequently read that forum section for feedback on existing systems as well as ideas for new onesthey recommend posts many posts i do not pay my money to the csm crew i pay it to ccp there should be a responsible writing something himself instead sending a negotiator with news like they heard they know but they do not give a fuck bout it it is not important but please be patient and pay your friggin moneyi am a customer of a product this product had a lot of advertisement this advertisement was big about war dec let me say it in capital letters all crapcome out where ever you are show yourself and defend your actions or better your priorities
except there already are consequences you utter simp the player you steal from  and his entire corp  are free to kill youextending that to say every single player ever can kill you is overkilland as we all seem to agree anyone being free to take stolen goods the moment a thief drops them under the new system is incredibly flawed tooclaiming its currently consequence free and comparing internet spaceship piracy to real life burglary is utterly stupid
the new system is far more realistic than the old system think about it for a momenta much better example is burglarizing a home or store or car if i burglarize your home what did i take cash a tv a computer a stereo a bunch of cds  dvds some cash some random jewelry all stuff which typically does not have a serial number that can uniquely identify it as yours your car jacking example is terrible precisely because the government can identify a car as yoursin short this new system is far more like rl where the police can id the thief fingerprints dna but they typically cant identify your stuff so when the burglar launders the good to their accomplice even if you see it happen unless you cant prove that what that accomplice has is yours that accomplice gets to keep your stuff and theres nothing legal you can do about it possession is 910ths of the law they say so dont leave your stuff in space where anyone can take it
yesterday when i passed some ships from my main charachter to one of my alts and other ships from my second alt i was a little bit pissed off because of logging in with 3 accounts at the same time so i thinked about a solutioni have 3 chars living in the same system they can use the same ships but not all of them have 1 of the ships so i need to trade the ships if i want to fly a specific role with any of the 3 chars why should i buy 3 similar ships or why should i log in with 3 chars all the time if i want to get a shipi dont know who else have this problem but here is a solution i figured out 1 shared ships and items tabshared ships and items tab not a corp hangar which can be created like a mailing list with allowed charachtersso with my main char i can create a ships tab or an items tab named like my ships or my stuff i place all my ships or items into that tab then i configure it to allow my alts to enter it and take ships or items from itthis way i can have all my stuff in one place and i dont need to log in just for trading ships or itemsthe second thing is sortable ships taba few days ago i was looking at my ships i was searching for my sabre and i swear i didnt see it but it was there  i just have 40 ships missed a frigate kill2 sortable ships tabright clicking on the ships tab should bring up a menu where you can sort your ships likeshow allfrigatesdestroyerscruisersetc etcwell thats all i think these modifications would be good and i hope no just for meif you like these ideas plese support me o7
youre describing a corp hanger
no sir in a corp hangar all the corp members can access the ships and itemsif you dont want this happen you can make roles and divisions and stuff like thatwhats up if im in a 400 men corp will i ask for a role or division for my 3 charsedit also with an inventory system like the current one no waaay
i agree with tkl the corp hangar is confusing and hard to use for larger grp of ppl
so youre basically asking for one of the bigger perks of being in a corporation without having to be in a corporation
you are essentially asking for a personal form of a corp hangar to have a corp hangar your corp needs to purchase an office at each station which is a hefty some of isk in some stations these are often a limited resource on of the primary reason people rent offices is to have a corp hangar that they can use to share materials between corp members and if you make these group hangars instead you essentially remove one of the major reasons for renting offices while your grouphangar is kind of nice i dont think its all that appropriate given its impact on corp hangars from an rp perspective youd think you could just toss the keys to your hangar to your buddy so they could access your ships but i dont know how to best implement this 
a good suggestion i use pi on all three of my characters so being able to transfer materials easily without having to put them in a contractcorp hangar would be helpfulyou could have it so you can rent your own private personal offices but you have to be part of a player corporation to do soherping your derp since 19potato  url
well our corp has a well built corp hangar and division system we share lots of ships and stuffbut here is an example to make things clear my a alt can fly a tengu he can use it for running missions my b alt can fly a tengu he can use it to rat in belts or do anoms there is only one tengu which is good for both tasks costs 2bi wont put my money maker ship in the corp hangar even if i trust my corpmates so i need some kind of personal ships tab which is accessible for all my chars so even if im not logged in with alt a who usually flying the tengu alt b can still reach it from the shared corp hangari hope my problem is clearer now 
simple set permissions on one corp hanger so high that it requires you and your alts to have high permissions to access it give yourself and your alts high permissionssee i get what you want the problem is that it takes away a major reason for people to set up corps in the first place people can instead stay in their respective npc corps and create shadow corps with trusted people using the communal hanger to perform corplike operations without the threat of war decs espionagetheft or oversightplus the game is not specifically designed to cater to people with multiple characters it just allows for it and i personally dont see the point in making it easier for people to operate multiple characters at the same time
think this a fantastic idea of course it would be up to the devs along with the players to test how many hitpoints they should have what slots they would get etcbut straight up you have my support whole heartedly best idea i have read on here in a while1oh just to tag on the end here i would not support them having jump drives that would make them move too close to the role of carriers and i think the carrier is the most thought out capital asset currently in gamebut a normal gate by gate ship hell yes its a good idea
10 variation in games always needed in eve even more so this is a useful ship that will be used produced traded reaserched and ganked so it fits perfect in the game concept and adds to the marketso why havent it been implemented yet i support bo
one questions no gm wants to answer directlyis the multiplication of wars from one entity to another via an altchar corp and the avoiding of assists an exploit or a wanted featurei would like to hear ccp here but i would even start with a csm memberif it is a feature there is no reason to fix it but it is a reason to stop playing this game for me is it an exploit it has to have consequences
to be honest aleks unless you are commenting on refinements not available to us mere players bounty hunting promises to be about as broken as war decs a lot of we couldnt spend the time to get it anywhere near right so heres what you get in spite of the fact that all they have to do really is not implement the features everyone is telling them are crazy ie killrights as suspect flag perpetual war lockin in this case how hard could that possibly be to remove would fix most of this right quick edit in fact i dont see why this should have to wait till retribution should be much simpler than the recent fw fixesa bunch of other improvements are possible true but killing the lockin would make this largely go away only effect of mutual should probably be no cost for rvb style warsits just very frustrating to watch ccp drag its heels yet again on another gamebreaking bug they where told would happen but proceeded with anyway how many times do they have to burn their fingers before they learnand what software engineering company doesnt let engineers work on fixing bugs on their old code even as they deal with new projects i work in the industry and that doesnt sound right to meanyway alex kudos to you and hans for keeping on this
i understand your frustation but dont get the csm seems to be totally powerless and therefore has no reason to exist which really translates into csm cant get done what i want done right now so what good is itcsm is not and never will be all powerful at dictating priorities and policies to ccp that being said i do see a tendency to give up when faced with a stubborn ccp lessons from incarna apparently forgotten of course you do have to pick your battles but when its important  csm needs to come together with the player base to call attention to something that is not getting fixed in a timely fashionps  the rest of the post i am largely in agreement with
seriously this is getting beyond a joke nowccp please for the love of anything holy fix this mess
its definitely about picking your battles when ccp went quiet on war dec improvements for weeks csm got concerned i took action when i say confront ccp soniclover i mean that i was ready to create a thread calling out war decs as an abandoned feature fortunately we did have a meeting and coming out of that i feel that such a step is no longer necessary wars will never be everyones ideas of perfect but superfriends plans to address a nice sized list of issues which is showing me real progress and commitment to making the system work its not as simple as just fix it in a few hours like a couple above posters seem to think it is were not dealing with spell checking lol this is a complicated game mechanic which is currently and has always historically been prone to exploiting and it has to not only be well thought out but also be properly balanced between the interests of defenders and attackers ccp not taking the time to think things through on wars and other things has caused enough problems the reason they hot fixed fw ahead of schedule was not planning out how lp distribtion worked was causing violent economic distortion that was literally forcing people to unsubscribe due to high plex costs trust me noir is trapped by dec shield its not really that serious id rather encourage ccp to take the time and get it right
pay my trip to island give me from 1 to 3 days to get to get to know the current gamesystem and where to change what and which language is used after that annother day to talk to everybody about all the balancingconcerns to get it right for everybody i think the system i thought of and mentioned earlier would work just fine thoughand annother day to implement the codethats when i do it without any knowledge of the current codei would bet all of current belongings that i could fix it to most peoples liking in far below a weeki have almost no knowledge about graphicsdesigning but implenting complex theoretical systems is something i really enjoy 
so if this is what you really mean  we dont have to wonderencourage ccp to take time developing new stuff is in our best interest telling em not to fix asap hot used exploits in key gamemechanics of current and upcoming addons is not may there a nice sized list of issues which is showing me real progress what you said  isnt that the problem again whole alliances are stucked in current gamemechanics exploits players cant earn their plexes corps cant join new alliances ppl will unsub because of no progress ingame and in ccps policys  and we shall wait for new development steps  fixing maybe old probs and creating new onesyea you may have to pick your battles but the biggest issue with ccp i guess the whole community agrees isso alekseyev i would respectfully suggest you may even lead that battle here and not maybe somewhere in futuremay or may not next major issues coming up then which your own entity cannot deal so well with then
since you cant spell iceland ill take that bet
i wish i was as smart as you  eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis
if things were so simple id vote this dude for world presidentalso island is the proper spelling of iceland in at least a few countries
nice to see the war dec mechanics are seeing some ccp and csm attentioni are satisfied me happy facein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
first ccp state in this threat i cant get it really wtf7 weeks after posting an exploit here came csm and dev finally  to barrack a player who is more committed than other in that gamewhat is that here  election campaign and local smack during drink timehere he posted his suggustions you dev
i promise you alexeyev is giving it proper attention and were also making plans stuff just doesnt happen on the forums all the time eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis
mutual war dec should have the bill split in 5050supercap nerf  change ewar immunity
i follow this channel  i see ccp at the left side  i think awesome finally someone from the most wanted crew in this forum  i read his post my reactionare you kiddin me wtf i pay for your product sir and you come at me like this if you would work in my company and you would write something so offensive in our internet forum it would end up in harsh consequences for you alekseyev karrde is csm and a player of eve i do not know if he gets payed for what he is doing his comment makes me angry but i can understand it what you sir ccp punkturis write here in this forum speaks for itself first you  off people waiting to solve a problem within a product they buy from you then you tell us that a guy who cant change anything gm ccp is the ultimate authority gives it the proper attention rather then ccp is doing it and at last you tell us you make planswow now i am so relieved i love it when a plan comes together as much as the next guy get on you arses and fix the damn problems if i would react in my customer support like you do my company becomes sued work on it dammit do not plan on working on itby the way i tested your new user interface on the test server i do not like it
lolin other words you heard of it the first time
i do not i dont even get to go on a plane but troll tears are an excellent fringe benefitalso they are working on it edit as in right now while you type at them and distract them with laughter read before you type i may not get paid at all but punkturis doesnt get paid enough to make good code and show deference to such rude behaviour why anyone would white knight such an obvious and breathless troll against one of ccps hardest working devs is beyond me
sorry dude but about what are you talking right now i do not know ccp punkturis i do not know what he does and what he doesnt and do you know why because no one talks to me in this forumbut what ccp punktaris writes is trollin on high level at least it looks like it to me i wait for a fix i wait for an official to talk to me do you understand that i am really worried about his commentsomeone gives a suggestion from his point of view a problem can be repaired in a short time if it can be repaired or not is not important because it is his opinion instead of explaining the actual situation to him a ccp official writes offensive in the first postin my business my customers would get all the money back plus a bonus if i would act like this a oneliner is always seen as most offensive if my daughter would answer a reply like this we had a discussion i do not know sir from all previous posts it never appears to me that they are working on it it is planned to work on it if they actual do why does no one of the officials write itan example from the view of my companies custom supportthe bug in the actual game mechanics is a bigger deal then it appears from the outside a small groupa single programmer works on it but the coding is more time intensive then we estimated and we will not be able to fix the obvious flaws before or within the retribution release after this release we will be able to shift resources to help our community until then we reimburse all stuck accounts with free playtimea ship implantssp anything big apologies ccp icareaboutyou the most important step is the communication with the customers even without reimbursement
1 maybe you should pay attention more to those official posts to so desperately crave first of all ccp punkturis is a woman thats a good place to start 2 no the last 2 pages of this thread are trolling on a high level punkturis made a little joke and if you cant see why its funny its probably because the joke is on posters like you take your own advice and wait for a fix3 his opinion is objectively unrealistic and subjectively dumb i already explained the actual situation he just continued to make a fool of himself be thankful someone in ccp got some laughs out of it 4 punkturis isnt your daughter and youre not the boss if you cant buy products from a company which employs highly skilled creative people with a sense of humor willing to engage with even the most intransigent elements of their customer base then go play another game ccp might miss the subscription but the community will improve and become more attractive with the absence of players like you and destriouth so i wager itll balance out in the long run
sry man but from a player to youthis reply is poor and turns upside down what happens here at least
a new capsuleers perspectivebeen playing this game for under a week immersing myself in the forums as much as possible to assist with learning curve read every post in this thread and while i dont completely understand the mechanics of the problem being a new pilot its apparent there is enough evidence to support it being a fairly serious issuethen i came across the very first ccp post inthread and was very disappointed if you have the time to follow a thread and then troll a customer who is obviously passionate about this particular situation and the game itself regardless of how he expresses that passion then maybe you could find the additional 30min to post a proper response on exactly what ccp is doing i expect the game company and its employees to take the high road in these situations because when you resort to acting in a childish manner such as this i begin to lose confidence in said companyanyway thats my opinioncheers
alekseyev karrde everything you write is very offensive i tried to state the actual conditions1 i do not care about a gender if she is a woman she still writes poor comments on the wrong place2 all posts here have their respective necessity and all are welcome by any gm i contacted and what do you mean by posters like me from one eve player and alliance leader to maybe another do you think you are worth more then any other grunt you as csm should fight for us instead of being the defender of the poor ccp 3 again you trollin and you are very offensive he stated his opinion and you are going to make a fool of yourself by criticizing him in such a rude way and i am not thankful for the laughs ccp members are payed by his money too4 do you know what examples are made for and about which compromise are you talking ccp never gave me anything to choose fromi talk for at least 160 accounts alone in my alliance and i know some of the alliance leaders stuck in dec shield too which feel the same and i do all the writing here because i want that only one guy from my alliance is answering herei feel very offended and i hope you apologize for your arrogant behavior you start to become pissed and it seems you are taking this very personal instead of thinking this through in a way a selected representative of all eve players should do i even start if i hurt someones feeling by writing improper language i now apologize for it but it doesnt change the fact that i feel left alone
permanent war decs will be fixed in retributionwe have made it so that in a mutual war the original aggressor has the option of retracting the warand by we have made it so i mean punkturis has made it sob eve game designer   team super friends b
thank you so much and i mean for your post not for the message even if you said that you cant fix it until 4th of december i would be happy you both punkturis and you are my personal heroes of the day i still do not like punkturis way of acting and the arrogance of the csm member but now i have something i can tell the angry mob which is called my alliance members
1 kinda sounded like you felt you could talk down to ccp punkturis if she was a woman from your patriarchal comment im ready to say i read it wrong but that was my initial impression 2 from one player to another yes i think some contributions to the community and the forums are worth more than others i feel every person is entitled to contribute and can do so in many ways theres the thoughtful proposals the interesting story the insightful or just plain hi im new what is this warp scrambler message new guy questions and theres funny trolls which keep things lively aaaand then theres people choosing to communicate in ways both obnoxious and uninteresting i think the contributions of players in the former category are to be championed and i have fought tirelessly for them i think players choosing to do the latter should be pointed out and given some merciless honesty till they decide to make different choices become laughably discredited through their own words or simply get out ive been this way for years my voters appreciate someone willing to fight for them and not give their sincere concerns the same weight of someone shouting for attention theres a difference that difference is important and filtering out the noise is one of a csms most useful roles as a player advocate to ccp3 life must be very hard for someone with your sensitivities unrealistic fool and dumb were polite understatements i thought my point got across without having to get really nasty and unreasonable and it seems like it has 4 not sure what your question is here but im having fun so if you can rephrase it id be happy to try to answer
learn to swallow your pride man jeez
alekseyev karrde i think we both should end it here maybe we do not understand each other or we dont want to dont feed the troll could be me could be you
they are now getting fixed because goons are in a permanent war seems ccp responds everytime the goons have a problem it takes them now to actually do say something
dont believe that and do not want to
thanks a lot for this it happens to be the same way of fixing it as i suggested which i think is a good thing
so were back to war decs without consequences and the system itself is still inherently worthless ok preventing everyone who got into bed with an alliance from inheriting all of their targets and the other way around would have been step in the right direction but i guess this is way better than the current hell storm
100580
this only fixes half of the problem if you declare a war on anybody they could still mutual it and leave only one unneeded char in that corp you would still forever have an ongoing war where u are the agressor and all you can do is petition the inactive corp would never have to pay even a single isk this possibility is flawed by designa good system is one that is well thought out and doesnt need constant special cases to keep working especially in a sandbox where everything possible is wanted to be allowed
didnt read that link yet but i agree completely with the final sentence before it one draw back is that eve players are notorious for figuring out how to make a special case 
me puts on tinfoil hat
thank you for the first clear state of ccp after 7 weeks seriouslyi liked the new wardec  mutual mechanic and would really appreciate an further development in that direction ofc without the exploit in the futurebut as i wrote before i guess its better to have an older but well working gamemechanic than a new and more attractive but broken oneso i m thankful for your decision finally and thx for telling us here
s and brib ended things so well here you go make things fun againperhaps dumb was a poor choice of words willfully ignorant would have been more nuanced as far as you appearing foolish well its certainly just my opinion but i think it stands quite nicely given this postman i was sooo happy to just let it end with bribs rather tactful post you two should really coordinate betterand you should never ever say this now i at least know how long i have to live with it and when i can start recruiting again when slinging mud at someone who does war decs for a living
cpt picard approves
what is wrong is not how the current wardec mechanics work but the wording of it mutual should be changed to all or nothing mode and it goes like thisaggressor corpalliance wardecs nasty corp now nasty corp ticks box all or nothing mode aggressor corpalliance now has the option to drop the wardec 24h cool down or tick the box all or nothing mode aggressor corpalliance ticks the box also and now both corpsalliance are in all or nothing mode at this point the only way to get out of the war is for surrender terms in game mechanics to be agreed or one of the cropsalliance disbandsnow nasty corp feels he needs some friends so he goes of to silly bear alliance and joins them now the wardec is on for aggressor corpalliance and silly bear alliance at this point same thingoption can happens silly alliance ticks the box all or nothing mode aggressor corpalliance can again drop the wardec 24h cool down or tick the box all or nothing mode same rules as before to end the war remain but with one exception if nasty corp or its ceo resigns and leaves the nasty corp and or silly bear alliance the wardecs goes with them end result is the same somebody has to disband or agree to surrender terms in game mechanicsthe fact that corpalliances can wardec with out consequentness is a bitter pill to swallow for most folk and with this up coming change they get that back againi must say that i do feel like some of the rest posting hereseems that if goons say jump ccp do say how high please mr goon ceoif the goons dont like the wardecs then they should not make them on folks and if they dont want to fight the wardecs stay out of high sec they have all that nice sov they can make their own trade hubs in null they can make everything they need in null sec they dont need jita and if they feel like they do need jita then maybe they should do more escort run when they go there
slutty underwearjust my point but you gave me an idea the faction that sends out the all or nothing mode they could name an amount of isk the war can now only end if both parties agree to it or the looser pays the winner that amount of isk the ag
it is a sad day then inb4 more annoying highsec wars with no consequence you should make it so they have to wait 1month to end it or something or pay an amount equal to 2 more weeks of the wardec or something
he is a corp ceo and therefore has to talk for his people if you are happy to end it then just end it stop being personal if you want to dec us you can dec us but please not because you feel that my real me or destris real himself stepped on your foot we had some wars we lost a lot in the early years we got better but as long as you really come for us it would be a change very welcoming compared to our current situationyou have a csm next to your name here in the forum which has nothing to do with your ingame character please consider it an official position here in the forum i respect you as long as you talk to me as you are supposed to nobody is slinging mud here i think we all want this game to be a better one it looks like it is pushed in the right direction so end all personal disputes
but it does as long as nasty corp and its ceo stay in silly bear alliance then its fine somebody has to disband
now see if you wanted real tinfoilgoons prompted ccp to make the original mechanic to force all other alliances to dissolve and reform making everyone elses life complicated breaking sov hold all across new eden and giving them an easy path to the open and public domination of the universetinfoil
no you couldnt seriously you either have no experience of software or are deluded
emrys apmorgravainegoonswarm is not even stuck in dec shield frankster ijoneni have programed enough in my life to know what takes time to implement and what does notand if eve is programmed in an anyway usefull way and i strongly beleave it is th
as if that somehow matters eve isnt eve without the tinfoil
nailed it
i usually do
bye bye player based consequences on your actions
hmm why are there no consequences for trolls
remove wardecs and remove concord war dec mechanics solved
as the person who implemented this fix i must admit i had no idea the goons were war decced or had any problems with it the only person ive been talking to about war decs is alekseyev karrde v0vmaybe i should spend less time working on the expansion and more time getting involved in corpalliance politics in eve  eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis
perhaps somebody in ccp told you to do it
eve is real
if the shoe fits
a while ago i would have read this and laughed not too long ago i would have posted that you are crazy but i think you have a point it is some coincidence then again ccp arent squaky clean with this sort of thing are they
how long have you been working on a fix and when did you clue in the players andor csm
the fix should have been the inability to join a new alliance while declared mutual not let the aggressor retract the war while it is mutual that literally makes no sense for using the mutual status unless you are rvb or a group with a similar approach to war pvp what possible reason would a defender make a war mutual with this fix since all it does is keep the aggressor from paying fees this isnt a fix this is making the mutual status practically uselesswhereas if you prevent a corporation that has the war set mutual from joining a new alliance you stop the space herpes in order to prevent the circumvention of this system by toggling mutual off joining an alliance and toggling it on again if the war was ever set mutual then there would need to be an inability to turn mutual on again until a new war is actually declared this attribute would have to carry with the war itself not with the entity
we have a backlog of war dec stories that the csm is fully aware of and alekseyev has been super helpful with they for example saw it at their last visit to the office we have been aware of these war dec exploit threads since they started popping up and been concerned about them naturally the reason the fix was implemented now is simply because i had time to implement it we are also working on bounties and war decs  it doesnt really matter if things are implemented at the beginning of a release or closer to release date since its going to be released at the same day either waywe clued in the players today with tallests postdoes this answer your questions  eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis
wow thread started out on topic about a bad game mechanic  continued on for a while with good input and some worthy ideas and opinionsreached its apex and is rapidly approaching terminal velocity in its falllet me direct you here to the important part
war dec iterations have been on the docket for retribution since the summer iirc the csm spring minutes were rife with these issues brought up to ccp in person by my floating head and you can see ccp soundwave and others commit to taking action soa while the frustration on the csm has been the bounty feature having to be nailed down before war dec fixes could be talked about and scheduled in detail to the point that like i said i was about to take this to the players for fear it had gotten cut but no i met with ccp soniclover for over an hour and their user stories are strong expect csm and my personal engagement on this to continue on through the csm summit and beyond till these items get finalized
the best post in the entire thread save the announcement of the permadec withdrawal it allows ceos to override a ticd off directors over zealous snap decision gives the ceo t a chance to say ooops keeps the option to have the permawar knowing its consequencesall encompassing well thought out and 10 to you slutty
i would agree with you except that there are no consequences for the dec shield alliance to do this the consequences for the other alliance extend outside empire space which seems strange
it would not matter if nasty corp or its ceo leaves silly bear alliance then silly bear alliance gets removed from the wardec the wardec stays with nasty corp and its ceo what this means is that nasty corp and its ceo are the key to the wardec where they go the wardec follows if the ceo resigns the all or nothing mode switches off and i would say that the toon that was the ceo would have to have some sort of consequences fine details to be look at latterend result is that for all members of nasty corp have 2 choices if they want out of the all or nothing mode wardec leave nasty corp or fight or stay docked now if all of nasty corp leave and only the ceo remains one man corp then aggressor corpalliance is just locked into a one man corp wardec and i would say that there would have to be a some sort of mechanic that states that if no activity happens from nasty corp then the wardec drops but thats for fine details to be worked out at a latter point should my idea get some backing
yupwhat are the odds of you looking at corps and alliances bloating their numbers with alts to keep war decs against them extremely high any chance you guys could have the war dec fee only calculate based on characters currently training a skill
what a smart ideaoh and on a side note i would like to point that i was wrong before the up coming fix for mutual wardecs is needed for the likes of rvb and so on what i should have said is that my idea is in addition to the current wardec system its just way to call your bluff do you really want to got to war and die come at me bro lets see whose standing last
just like how a war dec fee includes all alliance members no matter where they are for the sake of plethora of targets when a tiny fraction are only invisit high sec strange indeed
maybe the consequences would be say a negative wallet for say 1b and the corp loses say 50 of its corp wallet also and banned from joining any corps for 4 monthsmeh that wont work smart folks will move the isk around to stop that but you would still burn a toon
just one thing which is stuck in my headis it possible because now it is officially something which needs to be fixed permanent war decs will be fixed in retribution that all stuck corps and alliances could be freed i mean we are still stuck in many wars but everyone hideseven if the system is flawed dec shield is still online using an acknowledged exploit so my question goes to ccp the gms and the zerg guy could you shut it down now you got what you wanted  end it the official statment should finallly show some consequences for zerg if he does not stop the crapotherwise i have to add one more month of doing nothing to the most of my ally members which means something about 2000UFFFD
you guys are nuts
you realize that most nullsec alliances especially one like goons are always wardecced being in a permanent war is nothing new to them
while from the standpoint of someone who is damn near always the aggressor in wars this change greatly helps me i cannot say that this is the proper way to fix mutual decsthe problem with your fix is that youre going back on the whole concept of consequences for aggressors that you touted so much in inferno as it stands i will have just as much if not more control over the dec if my target makes it mutual in fact youve made it so that there is literally no point to ever set a war mutual unless you are rvb heres how you should actually fix mutual wars so that theyre still worth using as a defender but arent completely broken as they are nowstep 1 the first step is to make mutual wars a cost burden that the defender must carry ie someone has to pay concord for the dec this should be implemented such that when a war is declared mutual by the defender it is stuck that way for 7 days without charge the defender will receive a bill much like a runofthemill aggressive dec to continue the mutual war into a second week etc the mutual fee will use the same cost mechanics current dec fees use as with current mutual mechanics the two sides must agree to a surrender offer in order to end the mutual war prior to the end of any given 7day mutual war period obviously one of the two sides can completely disband as they can nowstep 2 the second step is to make it so that mutual wars count as aggressive decs for the original defenders if the defender is a single corp this means they cannot spread the war to others via an alliance as they cannot join it if the defenders are originally an alliance and the alliance declares the war mutual the war will be considered mutual for corps that leave the alliance for 7days step 3 in order to maintain groups such as rvb that want a permanent forever war with each other implement an option for the aggressor once the defender has made the war mutual to confirm the war being mutual this can be made with a similar flagging system as current surrender offers if the aggressor confirms the war to be mutual it is free for both sides and requires a surrender offer to endobviously there is still room to spread wars around as long as the war is not declared mutual and could be still used to keep an aggressor at war for a very long period of time this process of dropping corps in and out of an alliance with proper timing is rather tedious but can obviously be done while it may be exploited i doubt it will be to the extent both in terms of time and the number of involved parties that it is currentlyi apologize for the wall of text but would greatly appreciate both player and dev feedbackthanksadriel
i think you are making it a lot more complicated than it needs to be it should be made as simple as possible but not simplerthe whole problem is the wardeck propagation up the organization tree i think it should only propagate down eg if corp a wardecks corp b and the corp b joins alliance x the wardeck should not propagate to all of the alliance x members it should still stay with corp b if alliance feels like protecting corp b then it should declare its own war against corp a once the wardeck ends due to its natural timer then corp a has an option to redeclare it against alliance but not against the corp bscenario corp a declares wardeck on corp b corp b joins alliance x alliance x decleares war on corp acorp a will have 2 wardecks 1 outgoing corp b will have 2 wardecks 1 incoming and 1 outgoing inherited from alliance xalliance x will have 1 wardeck 1 outgoing against corp ato deal with the griefing corps the wardeck cost for the outgoing decks should exponentially increase over time unless its declared mutual the number of the outgoing decks should not be part of the equation calculating the cost what should be is the time the wardeck has been going on and the recency of the last war deck as in the cost will not reset to 0 once the wardeck is over but rather decrease overtime so there is no incentive to stop the wardeck and immediately redeclare it again

ccp could you fix the bug that stops anyone not from the cfc from logging on now thanks xxx
looks like we dont even need a seat in the csm to fix this game youre welcome
just out of interest any other potential war dec changes that might make it for retribution or is this a special snowflake hotfix
what software have you written which projects have you worked on where you were able to divine the function of the code within 3 daysthose of us who are actually programmers are looking at your post and wondering whether you have actually ever touched someone elses code in your lifethen theres your claim that you can nut out all the issues inside the three day window while youre still reviewing code and determining which piece of spaghetti connects to which other piecehave you actually ever talked to another person in your life outside of the do you want fries with that upsell question

for triage
sneaky bump for this you know you dont want it to end up as dasher despite what ccp say about it not being the final name be heard
this and the new bounty system can only result in chaos and it will take away some of the safety in high sec but is that good well maybe si maybe no
this would also give some minimal meaning to your captains quarters have a shelf  screen with all of your acheievments and trophies on itits small things like this the whole way over eve that will really come together to form something better
would be a good solution only problem is that in our corp every division that can be created 7 i believe are in use so we cant make a new one so im still stuck

saturday bump
it saddens me that from 4th december my mains will not be able to shoot goons as ccp have finally decided that goons in a mutual war is not allowed to happenits a shame that it took this to fix a very  up war dec system and as for goons complaining that it makes it a pain atm for their sov changeswell im afraid i lmao at this
are you so riskaverse that you cant come to nullsec
thanks for the publicity zerg sure you helped get this raised up the prioritiesccp punkturis best punkturis 3kitchen sink seriousy get your ship together  fleetupcom
first aleks is csm a player representative to ccp and that wasnt the first csm responsesecondly punkturis trolls are considered an icelandic national treasurewhile it might seem a bit rude andor shocking its only recently that weve had the devs been able to post as much as theyve had and that is a good thingi swear once you get used to it youll feel honored when punkturis trolls youadded to that she does get things done shell laugh at you one minute and fulfill your wildest coding dreams the nextso can understand why someone might be upset about her comment take it in stride part of the uncommon culture eve has and there are far worse things you can get properly upset aboutanyway thanks punkturis
mutual wardecs are now pointless in every valid cases but rvbare you lazy or what  this is not a proper fix its remove this feature because we cant repair itseriously ccp punkturis is a ui designer she probably added a button retract that socalled mutual war but where is the damn game designer im happy to see the end of a wardec exploit mind you a lot of them are still possible and a reaction of ccp after months of inaction but youre doing it just wrongyes because we never saw a ninja patch anyone remembering the boomerangsuicidetornado nerf  it was 3 days not 3 months after the publication of the exploit and dont even tell me that adding a damn button is more complicated than dealing with the concord codeim disappointed
well have to admit i am a bit impressed its good to see some gumptioni agree about ccp not working all the way through although they get plenty of feedback i have a theory about this being development by strawman releasing deliberately broken things and slowly trying to come to some working system through feedbackanyway thanks for getting in there and keep it up although i dont always agree with your viewpoint this is clearly just a stop gap to fix the worst of it needs more work
personally i think the whole war dec system could use a rethink from the ground up and thats not going to happen as a quick fixon one level you are right but i dont think its realistic for them to really redesign the system as an addon to a nearly baked expansion
omg  your toon  talk to me goose
not that i would care about war dec sys but loltundragon is recruiting also your boobs o  ccp eterne 2012 when in doubtmake a diU023Ck joke robin williams  rip
but wasnt the last expansion all about wardecs  they planned it for months they worked on it for months they had 4 months after the release to fix it a bit and nothingmost of the exploits were found very shortly after inferno but nobody had the idea to use them at zos scale and the mutual wardecs are trapping the agressors meeeeeeh tears has been around for the last two years maybe more i wasnt playing before thathow can they miss that badly the main goal of an expansion dominion  about sov mechanism wait its as worst as it was shooting sbus instead of posesincarna  about walking in station it didnt happeninferno  about wardecs which are so exploitable that nobody but a throwable alt would start a wardecwhats in retribution  bounties claimable by my own alts and a rupture with 14 turret slots and enough pwg to fit a 9000mm plate 
the real question now is is zerg having proven his point and gotten the devs to post a fix in writing that he will have a chance to work out the exploits on now going to release the current permadecsthat gesture only will prove either it was a genuine attempt to help players by generating the fuss and hubbub needed or if it was just a clown looking to grief and soak up tearsmy money is seriously on the latter
what if dec shield was a cfc op
im a programmer not a designer eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis
now that is a good idea
of course we enjoy the tears and anguish of our enemies but we also very strongly desire a functioning wardec system i have written pages of analysis highlighted all the flaws made suggestions of feasible solutions waged a massive awareness campaign gone to vegas to talk to devs in person and explained everything to anyone whos asked you cannot claim we have not worked to improve the wardec system we have enjoyed the ride and well enjoy the solutionhowever we will not be scammed or fooled into releasing people prematurely you are free when the wardec mechanics are fixed and you can get free on your own thats always been the goal if i release you now they couldl halfass the solution and then well be back at this point in a few months nothing is fixed until it is fixed and then we will celebrate together and nontrivial wardecs can commence once again

first i want to say a big thank you to ccp punkturis especially for listening to the players and helping to fix this this is another great example of ccp listening to its players something that most games companies fail to accomplish quite regularlynow however comes constructive criticism i cant help but feel that the aggressors just being able to retract the war makes it a win win situation for them it gets rid of all of the risk if they dont like the way the war is going they can just retract it there should at the very least be a very long time for them to retract once the war has become mutual for example a one month timer if theyre going around greifing people which is their choice and i wholly support it they should at the very least have consequences as it stands if they find out theyre not doing as well as they hoped they will be able to pull out with a days notice without giving the defender any time to fight back even when the war has been declared mutual im not just some whiner who wants the defenders to have as many perks as possible in fact i plan to be the aggressor quite regularly once retribution comes out but at the least it should take the aggressor 1 week to pull out of a mutual war at leastin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
eh should have put it off until the expansion was released if its not to be done soon anyways a revamp to the war dec system is entirely consistent with the theme of the expansion retribution 11 but the first public word from a dev a mere 45 minutes after an article was thrown up that mittani guys website complaining about it the timing of it looked quite badthat being said id hope the devs would consider a change to the multiplier for each additional ally in war decs 2x is quite high 15x would be more reasonable at 2x the 10th ally would pay 102bil for a war dec that started out at 100mil whereas at 15x it would be about 6bil for the 10th allyif i could get a single cent 001 on the first square of a chessboard and 2x for every square thereafter id have 115 quadrillion dollars 15x more reasonableand maybe throw in some other sort of calculation besides just the size of the alliancecorp to be decced maybe some sort of point between the size of the pilot roster the deccer and the deccee and those that follow as well

noticeably absent is any time allocated for testing and fixing the inevitable issuesas the chances of it working correctly first time given unfamiliarity with the codebase are so close to zero that i would bet all of destrouths current belongings
well test the new system together live pi bet there will still be bugs and loopholes i would bet all of destroths current belongings 
if the original aggressors can now withdraw from a now mutual war then whats the point in declaring it mutual in the first place how are defenders supposed to ransom their former aggressors now turned victims if theyre allowed to leave any time they wantif anything there should be a set fee  to a  of the losses of the defenders required by the aggressors to withdraw from the war you could even use the figures from the war reports to figure the maths say 125 adjustable by the defender there shouldnt be a limit to the maximum pool of losses totaled in the  since the aggressors can withdraw anytime and should do so once they realize theyll be unable to pay the fees if they continue to get killsex attackers end up destroying 50 billion in assets the denfenders can set the fee for them to withdraw up to 25 if they purely want to recover isk from their losses or they can set the amount lower if there is some other goal that they wish to achieve and not necc the isk such as withdrawing from some region of space etc if the defenders wanted to recover the full amount of their losses they can always declare a war on their attackers once they withdraw and make their demands that way there are still consequences to the aggressors for declaring the war and to make all things mutual defenders who would like to withdraw from a war should have to surrender and meet the demands of the aggressor to prevent people from simply war deccing someone with no intent of ending a war then provide defenders with a way to withdraw themselves from the war as well if a defender decided to choose this route it should secure their freedom from the wardec system for a single week to prevent alt corpsalliances of the aggressors from deccing them immediately after they just withdrew this should help with griefingthe solution could be to have the defenders pay an isk ransom dependent on the number of members they had when the war started somewhere around 25 million per member would be fair i think and have it scale so that a corp of 1k members wouldnt have to pay a ridiculous fee the scale could range from a maximum of 1 billion for a smaller corpalliance up to 10 billion for a larger corpalliance that way the cost isnt so demanding that it simply cannot be paidex a corp that started with 100 members would have to pay 250 million isk to withdraw from the war which would go to the aggressors otherwise they can defend themselves and if things go well they can declare it mutual and recover up to 25 of their losses if they can make the aggressors withdraw other wise if the the war isnt declared mutual and the aggressors end up not continuing the war after a week then there is no isk paid either wayif anything the war declaration system should be viewed as an extension of the new bounty system allowing the aggressors the opportunity to collect isk from a corpalliance that has had a high bounty placed on them by hunting them in high sec with the risk of consequences should they do poorly and become victims themselves the above system should facilitate such a concept and work well in conjunction with the new bounty system that is being released
if only the icelandic treasure would bless my post with a response on this subject just trying to help point out other loop holes and exploits if they are going to be trying to fix the war dec mechanic
so once the wardec is withdrawn is the war ended immediately or is there a cool down  1 week timerlikely this is already posted somewhere apologies if already askedanswered
let me get this straight you implemented a fix without examining all the current problems with the system and the only person you ever discussed it with is alekseyev karrde no second opinion or anything no research on your part thats some quality effort on your part that is i know that alekseyev karrde is smart wellinformed etc but theres a reason the csm is more than one person  to get several opinions before acting
proving once again that the only way to get things fixed by ccp is to gash a gaping wound in game mechanicsgood job zerg or goons or whoever the

lol you can read that out of it if you like but no thats not how it works if you want me to be clearer on what i said ill say alekseyev was the only person outside of ccp that i talked to on how to fix war decs and he of course is the csms main war dec guy but i talk all of them sort of every day i dont implement game design fixes without the game designers at ccp telling me what to do and they read the forums and talk to each other blablabla so now thats gotten straight eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis
i think ill just stop posting in this thread too many people just like to be angry and take what i say and twist my words the initial problem in this thread has been solved for retribution some people like the solution and some people dont thats how it is with all our changes anywaysfly safe o7 eve brogrammer  team five 0  ccppunkturis

beat me to it clearly people are angry and misdirecting it at you punkturisthere is a larger discussion to be had about the design of the system while i am sure punkturis could contribute some valuable insight to that that discussion needs to be had with soniclover and perhaps soundwave nothing personal guys just not happy with some of these designs you pushed out forum warriors please stop venting at the person implementing the fixes and save it or preferably rational well constructed discussions for the people designing the broken systems cause we dont want her to stop posting aside from missing her sparkling personality this communication is invaluable to both partiesi dont always white knight but when i do i white knight for ccp punkturis i realize i seem to be whiteknighting hard here but really we do need to get to the heart of the matter and get this back on track these attacks are deeply misplacedps  also a side note while i am very glad aleks is involved i am afraid that although hes really good at representing the piratemercs point of view hes not very good at dealing with the others he can sympathize with them just enough to represent what keeps them being good targetsi hope you all at ccp dont restrict yourself to just aleks
just ignore them haters gona hate read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
are you suggesting that punkturis is lying to you for the purpose of getting you to drop war decsyou proved your point you got the fix done deal drop the decsor you can admit that you were just getting in on some high quality griefing which is exactly what you were doing
he wasnt i wasbut as has been noted on many previous occasions everyone at war with dec shield started a warthese are no innocentshe already said he was gonna drop them once this is implemented you sound like you have a personal axe to grind tbhof a request for change ask who benefits
having spent a very long time debating about how the bounty system and the new crimewatch system should work i can whole heartedly say that i am satisfied with the proposed changesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
first off id like to point out that can flipping is already dead no one jetcan mines anymore which kinda makes your whole argument moot secondly i think the removal of the  1 sec standing requirement for a bounty might be to much to soon but until we see how the system actually plays out in game there is no one that can say either way
agree on everything atleast i dont like afk mining  not good you want to play the game then play it
true mate but than ccp needs to make mining lot more involving like this is just a plain pain d
i was just thinking today gods i wish i knew what boosts i was getting and yesterday and the day before that too1
thanks for the input and support we need to expand on the variety of ships and roles hell when wis goes live yachts may even have a role lets keep the ideas rollingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i apologise in advance if i am just repeating what has already been said i dont fancy reading the entirety of this threadnaughtas it stands you can put unpackaged ships into a freighter all it requires is that it is contracted to you under a courier contract something that annoys the hell out of me i move home system relatively frequently instead of creating an entire new ship class just get rid of the restriction on unpackaged ships it can already be circumvented as a minor inconveniencefreighters could use a little iteration as it is maybe a few carefully calculated slots no high slots of coursei really love the idea of being able to transport other capsuleers newer players would be able to get down to nullsec or deap into low by being taken there by a trusted pilotps you bump this thread far too frequently its not good taste to bump it twice without someone else posting between bumpsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

weak just weak very very very weak tbh im smart enough not to get caught up in bullshit like this hes stated his goal as getting a fix the fix has been announced end of discussionor did you mean to post as zerg i know it can be hard to keep your story straight with so many alts
plainlysee here is your problemgoal getting a fixoutcome fix announced but not implementedi said that really loud just in case you are reading impairedergo its not the end of the discussion but im sure you would be bang to rights calling him once the fix is actually implemented if it ever is poor zerg until about a week ago he never heard of me ive been playing since 2005 and what i mostly like doing in 2012 is logging in and shooting people in empire its quick its easy and i dont need one of the ms in mmoyou should check these things before you make yourself look like a tooloh waitof a request for change ask who benefits
fair enough i will open a new thread with the issue i raised earlier in the thread in regards to another exploitabuse of the current war dec mechanics
right now it sounds like ccp have implemented our second best option to solve the wardec issue we continue as is allowing perfect copyingtransfer instead preventing mutual infinite wardecshowever im no longer sure what their intended design for the wardec system is i thought they wanted declaring wars to be some sort of commitment such as locking the aggressor in for at least a week now it sounds like we can declare war kill an offline tower retract the war move on to next target this is how it used to be and im actually good with thatthat fix would solve 95 of all the issues which is good but we were hoping to get lots of the smaller features fixed as well wardec costs wardec transfers solved by the fix exploits related to surprising enemies in space semi addressed by notifications dead corp fixes surrender mechanic loopholes etc however it is awesome that they implemented notifications to warn deccers that their targets have joined an alliance that was very much a step in the right direction and was one of the little things on our list of awesome that they implemented i hope they continue along this line and continue to push little changes into the game to make the system more intuitive and balanced
so why didnt you reply to my post do you think punkturis is lying to you if not then you accomplished your goal time to drop the decs just admit what we all know you like the griefing aspect
edit snipped personal attack isd suvetarwhen you can get free on your own means then the system will be fixed what part of this is difficult to comprehend
1folks are clearly unhappy ccp really dropped the ball on this infinite wardec thing and now theyre being forced to patch it with a mechanism that significantly diminishes the original spirit of the dec overhaul kudos to the op for forcing the issue
isnt one of the csms a member of goons they pull a knife you pull a gun he sends one of yours to the hospital you send one of his to the morgue thats the chicago way did i mention i used to live in chicago
recruitment for my corp is currently closed for you however we may consider an exception dual pane idea click
after considerable thought on this subject of the wardec mechanics ive come to the inevitable conclusion its totally fubar even after the fix coming in retributionthe idea that corps belonging to an alliance that gets wardecced have to take the wardec with them when they leave is just dumbas it currently stands im either gonna kick everyone out of my alliance and run it as a one man operation or im gonna just drop out to an npc corp and call it a day until ccp fixes this thing the right waythey pull a knife you pull a gun he sends one of yours to the hospital you send one of his to the morgue thats the chicago way did i mention i used to live in chicago
it was heady days when these wardecs came out we got the first assist in eve on a dec which we copped by trollololing some very angry russians in their wormhole i cant remember why we dropped it from being mutual but it did occur to me pretty early on that when alts of moar tears were joining dec shield something was going wrong with the war dec system its the katamari thing really decs can be katamarid into one organisation which never drops a dec ever so it basically turned the old system on its head the girefer became the defender except it was free and forever and stickycreating a permadec possibility was stupid but the idea of consequences is not the whole problem with the wardec system is that it is a system which allows nonmutual wars aka griefing this isnt a defense of carebearing as a life choice or excoriating people who gain enjoyment from the tears of others people who know me will know i find tears piquant delicacies but its just the way the people who play this game are intelligent in the main cunning in the minority but thats all it takes creative evil and greedy if you let an eve player loose on any system they will find a hole and strap on a chillicoated pineapple to exploit the hell out of it for maximum tears in allowing wars it allows peoples griefing to happen you used to be griefed by 0rphans more queers pendulum of dumb and others declaring war on your corp when it was new was growing get on to to evewhos top ten growth corps its going to be yours when you spammed recruitment too much etc if your corp was reasonably well run people were realistic and the leadership were competent and dedicated it meant absolutely nothing youd ride out a week or two and the wars would go away month max of blueballing them and they would drop now the griefing is on the defensive permamutual is one half the problem the other half is the katamari problem together you have a giant space dungbeetle pushing a starsized solar mass of crap into the griefers corner it has no doubt stopped the former predatory griefing of noob corps run by noobs because eventually the serial griefers will get caught by dec shield and similar when they run across a ceo with their ingame browser open to the forums instead of cat photosthe problem is that when the katamari of pvp lands in your lap leaking a deluge of tears and pvp on tap of course you wont give it up you cant ever be blueballed into dropping the katamari dec due to boredom so i guess it is back to the old system of opportunistic griefing decs but with people able to holler for a handwhich is fine to my mind try to gather some tears and pad your killboards with badgers and if someone taps out for help run away to shoot noobs
thanks for the offer but im happy where i amp
so in summary here on page 12war decs are now exactly like they were before the war changes exceptthey cost stupid amounts more iskyou can call for alliesof a request for change ask who benefits
they dont the reason that is even an issue people are complaining about is because they havent listened the hundreds of times punkturis has stated that shes a programmer not a game designer and that she codes up what the game designers agree upon the game designers being the team that interacts with the csm and the playerbase on the forums its perfectly normal not only for the programmer to only have spoken with one individual its also normal for the programmers to not speak with the csm at all just because a few angry posters here dont understand this doesnt mean that ccp is saying they only get one opinion about an issue before making a decision
that isnt a fix its removing a feature perhaps a static payment option of oh 200 million and then either party the defender who made it mutual or the aggressor could buy out of the mutual wardec putting it in the hands of the aggressor removes the entire reason to make a war mutual which is to punish the aggressor for starting a war they could not handle now theres literally no reason to make a war mutual since your fix is more amounting to swinging a bat at the feature smashing it and calling it done actions should have consequences in eve start a war that you cant handle you should have to pay to get out of it but i guess thats just pointless carping since the some people dont like features copout is being thrown around alreadylazy ccp just lazy
and yet what happened to the ideals of transparency and consultation that you advocated in your white paper and csm7 were meant to be championingthis all appears to have been handled behind closed doors and only involving those that it would benefit mostfirst the ally nerf now this  it smells of something and it isnt roses
yesthe original incarnation of the new system was how i would advertise eve onlinehuge numbers of allies could join forces to fight against much larger and in most cases null sec based entities in empire spaceeven better the defenders could punish the attackers by locking them into the war through the mutual settingthen we got screwed because someone decided having huge numbers of people fighting each other in a pvp based game was a bad thing entirely my own opinion but i suspect its because we were fighting them in empire not in null now we get it again because someone again decided that having huge numbers of people fighting each other in a pvp based game was a bad thing the whole thing needs looking at from the bottom up again      edit this bit is all like total fantasy like evermy take we got the flags system now an added pvp flag is needed if you are part of a sov holding alliance its turned on if you choose to you can turn it on anyone with this flag on can fight each other anywherebecause we dont need empire anyway amiriteof a request for change ask who benefits
this is what happens when you have people in charge that have zero idea what it means to live in a wormhole stop messing with wormholes the csm was made to look like idiots several months ago when they went on a rampage because worm holes have abc ore claiming that only null sec should have abc then when it was explained that worm holes are null sec they are just not their version of null sec they still threw a fit about it thank god ccp did not listen to them then stop making changes when the people who live in the wormholes are not asking for a change if high sec players demanded a change to null sec or threaten the way the large alliances play the game they would be shunned laughed at and there is no question that they would be completely ignored so do the same thing and ignore these people who want to bring their play style to wormholes we do not need cap ships in c14s we do not need 400 man fleets jumping through one worm hole that is how you play this game not us

yes to everything
currently there are high sec low sec and null sec filters in the courier contract window the problem is that they do not filter out routes which travel through hilownull only the end points are filteredif the filters applied to the whole route lots all of the scam contracts would be hidden
currently the war deceleration fee is based on member count which is fine the issue lies in the calculation being based on all members even if they are no longer subscribed to the game or an alt not training a skill a rising trend is using this to bloat a corporation and or alliance in order to raise the war deceleration fee to help keep it out of warmy proposal is the fee should calculate based on only members currently training a skillwith this change it will ensure that players will be able to declare war based on a more realistic number of potential targets feed back is appreciated and i would love to hear some input and or comments from ccp and the csm

yeah man big war dec and their buying ccp development priorities when will the corruption endoh wait
sorry  but whati brought up the alex issue as a side note it has nothing to do with punkturis just responding to how all war dec talk seems to be deferred to aleksbut i strongly disagree that he has a grip on all angles of the issue he is a smart guy and really understands the merc side and perhaps to a lessor extent the pirate side but many of his ideas are just as  odd to me and many others as ccpsgranted i think hes right about war decs being one of those things is never going to make everyone happy
now that i can finally post after the hurricane took away my internet for half a month ill start hereto all the people who are advocating that aggressors postfix should either be locked in for a certain period of time or have to pay a fee or both to get out of a mutual war please consider the following to the best of your abilitiesas long as its possible for wars to be spread in a viral manner neither of the above options would fix the war system from the broken and exploitable state it is in now1 in the case of a timer it wouldnt work because any period of time thats longer than instantaneous would mean that it will be just as possible to spread mutual wars ad infinitum as it is today observe corporation a declares war on corporation b corporation b joins alliance 01 which proceeds to set the war mutual corporation a decides to retract the war but needs to wait a week for the process to complete corporations bz leave alliance 01 and join alliances 0226 during this time frame alliances 0226 all set their newlyacquired wars mutualthis process will continue infinitely since fresh wars are created for every corporation that leaves an alliance and the infection continues to spread dec shield would continue to function normally albeit would need extra corporations and alliances to handle the timelimited load the only way to avoid this is by either allowing aggressors to instantly revoke wars or by removing the capacity for a single war to be infinitely transferred to new entities2 in the case of a fee it wouldnt work because as long as the aggressor doesnt immediately pay off the defender when the defender makes a demand the defender would be able to infinitely spread the war thus ensuring that the aggressor would have to pay off a potentiallyinfinite number of other defendersobserve corporation a declares war on corporation b corporation b sets a buyout price of 1 billion isk corporation a declines this offer corporation b joins alliance 01 alliance 01 sets the buyout price at fifty trillion isk corporation a wants to retract the war but cant because it has to pay a fee that is virtually impossible to pay corporations bz then proceed to leave alliance 01 and join alliances 0226 alliances 0226 proceed to set set their newlyacquired wars mutual and set buyout prices at fifty trillion eachthis process will continue infinitely since fresh wars are created for every corporation that leaves an alliance and the infinite war continues to spread unless the aggressors agree to pay off the defenders even if the fees have a hardcoded limit its still possible to create so many instances of new wars that its virtually impossible for the aggressors to ever get out dec shield would continue to function normally albeit would need extra corporations and alliances to ensure that the aggressors cant pay their way out even if the monetary limit per individual war is relatively low the only way to avoid this is by either allowing aggressors to instantly revoke wars or by removing the capacity for a single war to be infinitely transferred to new entitiesdo you guys understand this either wars can be revoked within the period of 24 hours the same amount of time it takes to join a new alliance or wars shouldnt be able to spread beyond their original recipients any other solution will allow some form of infinite dec shield to exist
i think they are talking about an instantly revokable wardec aka the old system i havent explicitly tested this yet but i was under the impression that when a corp is booted from the alliance it starts the wars a new war and gives it a new 7 day timer im experiencing this on a corp atm but ill actually measure it with my new transfer corp if thats true and they dont have instantly revokable wars then all wed have to do is bounce corps back and forth between a pair of alliances and wed be able to keep wars permanently active even in unmutual statesthere are also some mutual toggling games i have in mind to preserve wars but well have to wait and see i am of course open to suggestions on how to break whatever new system they generate we are of course laying out our thoughts here so they can preemptively counter them if they choose
thread cleaned somewhatcut the discussion of ccp bias the forums are not the place for itif you have genuine concerns about ccp favouritism then you need to contact internal affairsthis thread will stay open for now any more posting of this nature and it gets lockedhave funccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
pretty much thisdont like the idea of a static payment though i think that the aggressors if wanting to drop out of a mutual war should have a 1 week timer so that they are stuck for at least that long the war should not be transferable in any way during that timein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
mutual wars having a 1 week cooldown would be a decent compromise id think it keeps the element of at least a little consequence for declaring war when you shouldnt while fixing the core issuealso i pity whoevers monitoring the internal affairs reports this week  well unless theyre just relegating anything referencing the wardec mechanics to the trash which is entirely likely at this point
faction tower bpc drops have been removed from the gamei want them back along with faction module bpcs i am sure many other people do as well they were taken out because of their longevity in the face of high sec poss and the unbalance inherent in that they will supposedly be put back in pending a solution to the problemhere is a solution to the problemfaction poss cannot be anchored where anchoring them would require the use of starbase chartersbump with i also want to see faction tower and module bpcs returned if you agree and want this thread to gain the attention it needsin case anyone already didnt know here is proof a print screen of said proof

i know several of the csm have commented on the state of corp management in the past id love to hear them weight in on this hinthintwinkwinksaynomoresaynomore
however im no longer sure what their intended design for the wardec system isnot sure they are eithersmall improvements are welcome but there is still a far larger conversation to have thank you for appropriate stick poking to bring this need to light
i always thought that the mutual war flag should be considered a counterwardec making both parties the aggressor and simultaneously defender ive proposed before that both parties in a mutual war should be able to call in allies war was maintenance free while both parties are agreed when the original attacker rescinds he becomes just a defender and the counteraggressor originally the defender needs to pay for the upkeep of the war as if he started it if he wants it to continue probably should get a one week cool down for freejust throwing this out there
you wouldnt work on the right topic if you wont get fire from both sides if you happen to get no bad feedback you simply work on something most people dont care about as soon as you do get that feedback you know something is right because people care in order to retreat from a mutual war the aggressor might simply pay concord again to drop the case but some cost wouldnt harm since concord has to do some additional paperwork right
oh well good for the aggressors now theyll never have the tables turned and be forced into something they dont wanti mean of course the infinite mutual decs were stupid but the fix is a hamfisted one
1  aggressor can withdraw wars at any timeor2  wars are nontransferable aggressor corporations can join alliances while having active outgoing warspick either option one or option two in order to fix the system
deleted more ccp bias trolling seriously people we work on these changes weeks or months in advance before announcing them
just a suggestion about mutual war and consequencescorp a decs b and pays wardec fees corp b wants to punish corp a and thinks that has abilities to do it so want to create consequences for attacker corp b makes war mutual with simple rules1 each corp pays a highest of two wardec fees 50 each week or maybe each corp pays its own fee but only 1020 goes to concord main part goes to war isk pool 2 each week mutual war goes pool increases by fees3 corp which wins the war by accepting surrender or if war was retracted gets everything from the poolso corps involved in mutual dec will have to put isk into it commit into the war and defenders  have a chance to get something from itnorth

your not helping try saying something constructive about war decsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
you know aside from announcing war decs would receive another round of iterations in retribution just like faction warfare back in the spring and the csm minutes other than that though
id go with mutual  both agree no 1sided crap declining a mutual would be no different than declining a surrender no joining an alliance while your corporation has a mutual wardec going that must be resolved prior to joining a new alliance war  ok mutual war  not ok dissolving of a corporationalliance  purged issue last man standing  them the old reform avoidance gigas for scraping off a war declared on a corporationif that corporation joins and leaves an alliance the war follows them  not staying on the alliance an inheritance attributed attached to the war  source style  with a notice to the parties that the alliance level war with that aggressor will end in 24 hours upon that corporation leaving a war follows the original target leaves meaning for any reason  kicked or voluntary or dissolved any not in it means a war enters cooldown phasethat should end most scraping off issues and any concerns about someone bouncing through alliances if you want to keep a war on a given alliance your ceo would have to file to keep that war against said alliance if not 24 hours after your target leaves that alliance the alliance level war ends but the target corp retains that war statusif you step into a trap you stepped into it  suck it up and fix it by dissolving your organization yet such a trap needs consent as such both groups would need to agree to a mutual war  you know mutual as in more than 1 agreeing to somethingturning a last team standing contest into a were losing so well just drop it by those that started a fight is poor form their actions should hold consequences not more lulz but this current situation is pretty lame with the proposed fix being on par with the problem it attempts to resolve
other iterations the only thing wardec i am aware of going into retribution is this quickfix which wasnt plannedso from that i would deduce there is work planned for follow up patchesi remember talk of it i think but it seemed to fall off the dev roadmap is there is something still relevant around saying what they might do i suppose rr changes and crimewatch might qualifynot meaning to argue with you here but i thought you went to badger them because you saw communication fall off to near nothing on this topic so haulus bitchus would seem to have a point even if perhaps he overstated his caseps  not a subscriber to any bias or tinfoil hat theories in this case it was a problem that needed to be fix that dragged on too long and effected too many people it eventually hit goons  co which is unsurprising considering how many people that represents it is entirely plausible that there was no communication or bias here and even if there was so what it clearly needed to be fixed many people were lobbying hard if cfc added their voice to the chorus at the end is that really something to be concerned about
could a dev please answer my question i can see your all enjoying deleting posts that troll ccp but whilst your at itif a war dec is dropped by the corp that created it in the first place is this immediate or is there a week long timerthanks
nonsense they werent clueless they were chaotic neutral about it they thought the abuses were clever and insightful and wanted me to share details with them i did and they were forwarded to others they have known about this stuff for quite some time and its pretty obvious that theyve also been working on it for quite some time changes dont crop up overnight they require planning and documentation ccp have been really good sports about the whole thing were all on the same team about getting wardecs working properly theres much bitterness in this thread and the main thread due to ruined gameplay for thousands its to be expectedbut you know if ccp accepted one of my wardec transfer corps into ccp alliance i could catch those griefers for you just saying
thats counterproductive now i want to post bad posts

im a bit bitter not because of the ruined gameplay i wasnt even affected meh  but because it was a bad display of a lack of communication for many months excessive duration for a fix wrong answer to the problem i want my mutual wardecs back please and it looks a bit like a ninjapatch where is the devblog  instead of a 3lines postwe can be friends again
ok  pretty easy poss flogging a dead horsea fully modular design for poss  thats an old thread including pictures for folks to look at to visualize the design idea yes the discussion on this does go back to before 2006  it was a dead horse back thennext  full control capabilities on access think like a network manager assigning rights and applying them to individuals groups and system resourcesa modular design would resolve a lot access control at such granular levels would allow for very flexible use of all the resources

it seems to me that were both in agreement mainly about the validity of the second option i presented however you need to understand why preventing corporations with outgoing mutual wars from joining alliances is objectively bad game designall the defender has to do to trap the aggressor is create a new corporation and leave one person in the old one to make sure that the aggressor is screwed forever why do we want to punish players for using valid game features such as wars this type of design could severely punish old established corporations that declare warsdo you think its fair to force old wellknown corporations with rich combat and alliance histories to reform just because they can never join an alliance again i personally dont think so the defenders in the case of war have the option to leave their corporations temporarily to try to wait out the war for which the aggressor has to pay and thus is unlikely to maintain forever the aggressor on the other hand has no option but to disband if caught in a perpetual war which is free for the defenders to maintainthat is not balance how would you feel if the defenders could never leave their corporations to join new ones i ask because with the current movement restrictions the aggressors are subject to a very similar experience
as i said when this whole party kicked off dev blogs are released on a schedule a war one will be coming when its the war ones turn
okay starting up alexi would you mind answering how you were able to quote from a gm deleted post 2 12 hours after it was deleted  going to errr on the side of non tin foil and say it was on your screen and not updated otherwise  well we will wait for your relpyas for communication yes there was a vague promise of iterating war decs back in the spring along the lines of soontm we all know that statements like that cannot be taken seriouslycsm minutes really does anyone actually read them or just gets the tldr summaries from various news sites there are only 2 official forms of communication ccp news article or dev blog the rest is just candyas for the change can we please get confirmation of the cooldown timers post withdrawl and how a withdrawn dec would afftect a character that left while the war was active would they still be locked out of returning to the agressor corp for 1 week
yes plenty of folks who are interested in upcoming changes ccpcsm planning and who care enough to want to be part of the process of improvement do actually take the time to read the summit minutes every page of them if someone chooses to skim them or read a summary instead thats great but it hardly leaves them room to complain if they missed somethingkeep in mind  dev blogs are usually used for items that are actively in the development pipeline and nearing release there are always exceptions of course but its highly unusual for ccp to release a dev blog regarding something they might do but are unsure of as for the vague promises in spring of course they arent to be taken seriously ccp is very careful about making hard and fast commitments to feature changes until theyve gone through the process of evaluating their need the feasibility of implementatoin and of course whether there is room in the sprint cycle to complete such changes until you see patch notes nothing is ever certain back in spring release planning for the work to be done in fall  winter hadnt even started that takes place after summer vacation so it was all subject to changeccp is still looking into the state of wardecs and evaluating whether or not they can fit any other fixes into the initial dec 4 release i know its frustrating not knowing exactly whats coming months and months ahead of time but thats just the reality of the development process

i think youre a bit mistaken ccp certainly likes the cold dark universe and that is how it should be but this isnt what the issue here is and the change doesnt prevent thefts or betrayals even in the current game you still need to gain enough trust to gain those roles and you get them after you are trusted but thefts still happen the new system doesnt alter this it just allows the corp to function better and get more players involved the added security also helps new players to be more easily accepted in to player corps which is something ccp certainly wants to encourage since being part of a player corp greatly increases the likelyhood of them subbing to the game long termi think the real reason ccp hasnt addressed this and might not do it until the whole system is redone is because the whole corporation management and corporation role system is oldpoorly documented not designed to be easily modifiable with the original programmer propably not working at ccp anymore and full of similar problems this makes fixing it a large project with very serious reprecussions for the game no matter how it turns out its similar to the pos system in many ways everyone knows the system needs to be upgraded but its a huge project with a high likelyhood of serious problems occuring and a painful transition period even in the best of case scenario this means ccp is reluctant to touch the system and will only do it when a total redesign is going to take place
you probably err correctly but tell me your conspiracy theory anyway were all so invested wasnt along the line of soon it was along the lines of between now and winter admittedly theres going to be a fair bit of changes that will have to be in retribution followup patches due to bounty hunting but theyre close to the mark in response to none ofthe above and serious about iterating on it yes really csm minutes if you dont read them or at least know how to skip to the chapter you care about thats your problem and the rest of the community gets to call you an idiot if you say so guess you need to wait for an official dev blog p

frankly i dont know probably has something to do with the cost of decorations which is a bit extortionate at the moment however despite costs i still like rewarding people for a job well done with something they can actually display so that others can see sure theres always the old method of isk bonuses but that doesnt really leave them with anything they can show off im not opposed to isk bonuses either as i have given isk to people for stuff theyve done i mean the purpose of an award is to publicly recognize one for their good works not just handing off an envelope and saying good job besides medals also granted for certain things can help people remember fun  that theyve gotten into which earned them the medal in the first placei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

csm members i have collected my thought and ideas regarding how smallholding could fit into the suggested pos changes in 2013 and how it would carve out its own unique and different playstyle for smaller entitiesi would like you to take a look at it and give us feedback and if you approve promote the ideas to ccp for summer expansionyou can find the thread hereeveoforums 2013 pos changes  csm minutes  ideas  smallholding

that was a defect they thankfully fixed before it hit tranquilitysign me up for the plex for boobs thing though
in all sincerity i do think ccp should keep constant plex drives going for several good causes breast cancer is one i would fully endorse as well as cancer and aids cures if they kept a few persistent donation drives going and then maybe had a couple that rotated in and out depending on need or whateveryou knowit just seems like the right thing to do
hey fellow capsuleers as the title says this one is about the friendship invitation for evei invited a new player to the game did everything right btw and started showing the world of eve to him he was a lil overwhelmed in the beginning but quickly decided that the game was fun so he did what we all hope our invited friends would do he upgraded his trial to full account here i was thinking bam and that a nice lil present for meyou may ask yourself why am i writing here about that well sure as hell ccp found a way to cheat me out of my presentwe both knew that he wasnt allowed to use plex to upgrade to full acc so we didnt instead we used an option available to german customers such as us to pay by bank account itUFFFDs called elv and ccp gets the cash within 3 days there is no sign nor any warning that this payment method is inferior or  like plex not eligible for the present to be handed out sorry if this sounds weird id odnt know any way to put it better so this elv is treated as if the player used plex to creat a full acoount even though he pays cash for it and even though it is not said beforehand only after my friend upgraded did i receive a note that he used an illegal way to do so the account on the other hand is up and runningguys what dou you think i feel cheated a new player is a member an acount has been payed i should get something for itin any case do not invite new players to eve that is what i learned from this messoh and btw my petition about this matter is now several days unansweredgood job freaking out a player that was willing to give eve another shot and brought someone else along i would like a statement of the council on this matter since it seems that ccp itself is to busy to answer methank you for your patiencehorpi
bearing in mind that i know little to nothing about this payment methodit does sound unfairin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
a serious change needs to be made to reduce the facilitation of the player base in nul sec mostly from congealing into one large fan boi fest of pilots all singing and holding hands around campfires the current system with the ability for a coalition to post large lists of fellow alliances that can be set to blue status so making it simple to recognize friend from foe allows a certain amount of ease in the propagation of the current status quo by drastically reducing the allowed limit and limiting alliances by only setting fellow alliances to a blue status makes it less simple for them to form such large mega groups and stagnate nul sec as it is now furthermore alliances should only be able to set standings for other alliances and not for corps or individuals similarly corps only can set a limited amount of other corps and no ability to set an alliance so as to reduce the ability to do a work around lastly the individual player can set fellow pilots unlimited if he so chooses and a limited amount of corps to his standings allotment this is not a definite solution to the current issue but could be a step in the right direction in breaking the current into something more like what nul used to be like and also promoting the ability of newer corps and alliances to gain sov in nul without having to homogenize with the hive
since java and vlc are completely opensource when it comes to licensing
everything that you can do with javavlc can be done with web languages that awesomium can already render some of which is not in the current build mind you why go through the headache of integrating javavlc into the igb besides considering oracles amazing track record with security flaws do you really want that close to your clientbesides that awesomium only supports flash and silverlight plugins
the current coding that ccp uses for the role interface  corp interface is limited by its original coding because of this it is very difficult for them to add more to the interface i am pretty sure there are plans in order to deal with this and when they tackle updating the corporation interface and completely reworking it  you will be able to do this ccp doesnt get off on making it hard for you to do industry
but there is a hidden slidersi will understand if itll be possible to pick any area of the avatar and change it any way i like but theyre only a few of those areas with not so many options as its should be for sliderless
thank you for your opinion especially since it supports mebut what about any officials yet another day with no answer on the petitionis there any other place in the forums where i should put this to get more attention especially from officials
petition and escalate it it does sound unfair
yeah this sounds extremely unfair if paying from a bank account is to be considered the same as upgrading with plex then ccp really needs to make this more clear as it clearly defies logic this seems like classic small print interpretation business douchebaggery cmon ccp you guys are at the very least above these types of scams
ok im sure that the first thing you will think of when reading it is no concord is op well i agree there ps its only the battleship that can alpha a titan nothing else what im suggesting is flying the concord battleshipcruiserfrigate hull without their dev hacks and insta kill abilityits more of an awesome look then anything else its not meant to replace anythingstats will be something like thishigh slots will be either 7 or 8mid slots will be probably 56low slots will be either 56 as wellpg 10000 mw cpu 700800 250 m3 drone bay with a 125mbs bandwidth1 bonus to armor resistance per amarr battleshipcruiserfrigate level or cap recharge instead1 bonus to agility per minmatar battleshipcruiserfrigate level 1 bonus to weapon range per caldari battleshipcruiserfrigate level meaning missileslasershybridsprojectiles 1 bonus to drone rangehealth per gallente battleshipcruiserfrigate levelmin requirement will probably be something like level 4 of all racial battleships and the support skillsas of this moment i dont feel that it needs a damage bonus to anything but yeahas for aquisition method i am guessing well concord store using loyalty points
so you want it because you like the look thats nice but its not a good reason to make them playable
what is with all these people and their need for uber awesome looksships
no
dont agree with your attempt to put in god ships but i am curious as to whether lore wise concord ships are actually outright superior or whether this is just gameplay mechanics if they ever did implement concord ships i would rather them be weaker in brawling and have minijump drives shrug
lorewise the minmatar republic and thukker tribe navy ships laid waste to concord so i think it is more just a mechanics thing however i am always in favor of adding more ships to the game but i leave it to smarter people than me to figure out where to fit them in1 more ships
horrible idea since it intentionally aims to make the gameplay experience worse for the players and it actually wont do anything to fix the problem it tries to solve
for great justice
never implied there was i just dont think for this particular case they quite understand the negative impact i understand the limitations based on the original coding pretty much 9year old code for this stuff but if they could jerryrig a change that you dont need factory manager in order to install jobs and rent factory slotrent laboratory slot would only allow you to deliver your own jobs then it would be a hugely significant change that would allow industrial corporations to actually exist
cms summeyso reading this i do not see how nerfing commpression rates can increase incentive 00 industry the market dictates incentive not more nerfs and what about the wormhole alliances and corps that export ore using rorq what have it csm
better to remember this is a csm thing not a ccp thing that the best place to discuss this would be the thread in jita park and finally that mineral compression as discussed has nothing to do with rorquals
people still do compression with rorquals man are you way behind the timesthe compression theyre refering to is mineral compression making a whole bunch of t1 large guns to make transporting them take less trips then refining them later to build your giant space willy
this is pretty much how compression is done these days which gives you a nice idea on the sad state of affairs in eve online
i think they should stop looking at game design that way trying to fix things from a macro perspective you will only end up failing and creating untended consequences just like the politicans do every day you need to get down on a micro level in order to fix the problem who says its even a problem that there is little industry in 00 it just seems like a silly goal to have more industry exist there instead of having this grandiose vision of how people should play the game and in turn force them to do it get down and dirty and try to improve on the various ways they already do
the problem is that for all the time effort  isk you put in to nullsec the one thing you cant do is make it great for industry we want ccp to give us the tools to make it great if we so choose as you can with literally everything else what is the point of having your own space empire when your industry is completely dependent on highsec
00 bittervets too scared to produce and move freight through high and lowsec cause they might die  professional forum alt 
i see your point however you seem to be the expert what do you think is missing
feel free to abandon your space anytime if there is no point to it professional forum alt 
if warp disruptors didnt exist 00 would be so much better you could be shot at and forced to leave but you wouldnt be killed every time tank would matter much more since the bigger your ship is the more tank you need in order to stay alive while aligning and escaping warp distruption just shouldnt be instant and able to be done by every single ship in the game it should be something that takes time to plan and to set up so regions can be protected and traps can be made but also to avoid whenever you leave highsec the danger is basically the same and you have to fear being warp scrammed every single moment
yeah we totally dont have hisec production altstell us another one npc alt guy its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i kinda agree with you there but we need new fresh ideas from ccp no sarcasim applied not more nerfs as a solver moon goo and sov mechanics is linked to industry in 00
this
cause i totally cant gank your hisec alts moving nice things to nullsec  professional forum alt 
this is the dumbest thing ive ever heard let me introduce you to the jump freighter and let me tell you how our primary carrier has been operating for two years without losing even one
well you havent its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
ok so whats the problem then complaining just to complainstill waiting on people to abandon useless nullsec btw professional forum alt 
this has to be a troll post if so ive biten if not wow just wow are there realy players that gutless and to scard to lose a few pixelsi dont live in 00 anymore but there are ways to avoide beeing cought there if you use your head
this sums up what 00 needs pretty well it would also add in another conflict driver as opposed to fighting for moons all the time
that whole csm document was kindof crapmaking null sec more lucrative it already has moon mining monopolies deadspaces the best pi and the higest bounties what is the csm talking aboutmaking poss more modular i think the csm needs to look up the word modular modular is what the current pos system is already it needs to be more aesthetic and user friendlymaking mining more cooperative the best ores in null sec and wh absolutely demand cooperativesocial gameplay in order to function succesfully protection hauling etcabout the only thing in that document worth agreeing with is the sovereignty overhaul and the empire pocossyk
the reason industry isnt huge in 00 is simple you cannot have a an on going war where you never run out of supplies could you imagine the snowball as it became easier to produce ships good luck taking space from anyone who can mount a never ending attack not that this isnt already a problem but by taking even less time out of the equation it will only get much worsei dont live in 00 so if i am missing something here or am way off let me know but i am fairly certain that supply lines are essential
i think the reason there is no industry in 00 is because its not really possible industry relies on mining and logistics and 00 is just too unsafe for this as i mentioned before the warp scramblers and warp disruptors are the main problem here if they didnt exist in the game mining operations would be safer as well as hauling etc the thing is it doesent matter how much tank you have atm if you get tackled by someone it will most likely just be a matter of time before you are dead so people dont bother being in systems where they arent properly protected against tackles
it doesnt need to be safer at all as its up to the individual pilots to take measures to mitigate risk as much as possible the industry itself needs to be more viable  selfsustaining one of the main issues at the moment is you spend 80bil or so to get a station that can refine but you cant produce anything there so you drop another station somewhere else  gain a few manufacturing slots  a couple of research slots that are assigned to supercap research now head to highsec or lowsec  most stations have 50 manufacturing slots some constellations have more manufacturing slots than all of nullsecviable nullsec industry capabilities would also bring more conflict to nullsec  give more people a reason to live there
you can have a never ending amount of ships  still lose a war the old northern coalition is a perfect example of this
but but but all the npc corp duders keep telling me that 00 is totally safe and highsec is the dangerzone
the reason 00 industry doesnt take off is well known a lack of lowend mineral availability combined with the fact that often an entire welldeveloped nullsec region eg deklein still has less manufacturing capability than a single hisec system combine that with the fact pos industry infrastructure is quantifiably worse than station industry and you end up with a situation where the only things worth building in nullsec are supercaps because they can only be built in nullsec the guy going on about warp disruptors is so hilariously wrong it hurts btwi would love nothing more than to see a great increase in industrial output in nullsec  more sandcastles built means more to kick down oh hey were getting into farms and fields territory here look at this coming up yet again
the csm is only interested in their own agenda  i lold at the no concord in empire part the csm program really needs to be looked at by ccp ccp wants to improve player base and retain current players forcing one persons play style upon another will not do that and every goon and pets will say otherwise even though they bluntly state that they want to ruin the game and ccp listens to their every wordmy suggestionsfix moon goo have it deplete when mined and regenerate when not that alone will force conflict and alliances have to move to the isk at the very least make it from passive to active insert goon and friends thats a horrible idea because i said so gee i wonder whyallow carriers only carriers back into highsec but make a system that the pilots have to buy a permit to have it in space and limit stargate use to regional gates onlyrelease more spaceships ccp already has a lot of models in game already allow us to acquire and use all pirate ships now that we have a new destroyer make a tech 2 version that hunts down cloaked ships that would fix a lot of current bs that null people complain about if anyone follows my threadsposts ive discussed a excellent way to do the in the fi section i could go on but im not a member of the csm so any ideas i have which is a lot will more then likely be ignored
someone confusing ore compression and mineral compression i see
i removed some unconstructive semitrolling posts as well as a few that were responses to that keep things civil people
noted
null industry has three problems all of which have been screamed over and over and over1 there is zero reason for ur corp and alliance members to build there own ships its much easier to ship everything from jita to wherever your staging systems are and get to pew pew asap my idea tldr allow corps or alliances to locally build improved items and ships from locally mined minerals these would become regular items when they left the hands of your corpalliance2 low end minerals in null are nearly nonexistent say i want to build an aeon in the past 6 months ive been mining everything but the spod from the grav sites note thats not cherry picking thats just avoiding the dog excrement while looking for iron gold and copper do the math on mining everything vs skipping the spod before saying spod is more than doggie doo this has gotten me just under half the trit barely over half the pyrite needed but enough zydrine and megacyte to build 37 and 32 balance imho abc ores need put out significantly more trit and pyerite along with their current zydrine and megacyte and low sec ores need signifcantly more mex isogen and nocx dons the asbestos suit flame on3 where be the production lines it seems to me that null industry was originally designed to all be done in poses which is now just bad hopefully the pos revamp changes this when we get it perhaps my golden ships and modules from point 1 could only be built in these wonderful new poses
you dont live in 00 yet you feel comfortable making sweeping assertions about itwell ill lay it out for you 00 never runs out of supplies because apart from supercaps its 95 supplied from hisec thats kind of what wed like to see change
to be fair the guy said he didnt live there and feel free to let him know if he was wrong theres no need to get defensivein every interaction with high sec players i take it as an oppertunity to teach them about the 75 of eve they are missing out on in the hopes to convert them from their wayward pathto extrapolate on this rather abrupt postyes you are rightm in theory logisitcs are super important to a null sec war if the markets arent seeded with the ships you need then how will your pilots fighthowever there are two scenarios really the present and what people in null wantthe presentyou declare war on someone and start fighting a gruelling sov battle both sides are inflicting severe losses on each other but both are backed up by large amounts of isk due to moons renters etc realistically you are never going to make it so your opponent cant buy ships both alliances import all their ships from high sec via jump frighter so risk to losing the goods you import in is about 0 since high sec is producing all the war materials youll never need to worry about running out of supplies the only systems worth really trying hard to take are systems that allow you to extend your captial and super capital projection see umi in the tribute warthe futurealliances have decicated systems that they have invested time and money in to make into production capitals of null in fact these key expensive systems easily out produce systems in high sec and easily keep the alliance well stocked with practically everything they could ever want noone runs jump frighters to high sec and back anymore as they dont need them now two sides go to war where do you attack do you attack the system to help your capital production or do you attack the system producing all their ships by now people are used to having all their stuff made in one system and there might not even be the capability to transport stuff in from high sec lack of talent andor people willing to do it you take out that system and your enemy will be suffering a loss of supplies instead of just going lol jf from jita to vfk anyone or do you attack the system that lets you drop capital ships everywhereas you can see even by letting null build up the abilities of a single system youre already making wars a lot more interesting and tactical plus youre allowing the possiblity to actually fight the enemy in a different way to just take space drop capitals imagine if you could do this with multiple types of system so there was a really good mining system a really good industry system a system where you could have multiple jump bridges but nothing else etcfact is the more null can customise its space the more dynamic interesting and rewarding it becomes
from perspective of high sec industrialist this is quite interesting discussion especially due to fact that i believed that 00 actually produces their own goods  personally i produce all my goods in pos  small pos can run more production lines then i bother managing and that is with tech 2 production i could produce far more t1 modules then i would ever care to and that is with small pos so i wonder  what is wrong with using pos for production in 00 one large pos can support how many production lines 2030 at least and you can easily drop 510 of those in a system and i guess if you put production somewhere deep inside alliance space it should be quite safe is bringing supplies from high sec so easy there is no point in producing them locally
even thinking about nullsec industry makes my head hurtto manufacture you need a pos to keep that up you need fuel blocks if you dont import them you will need to make them at that pos for that you need pi planets a lot of different ones oh and you will need to mine ice for those blocks too then you need the fuel block bpo or bpc preferably a well researched one and then you can start making the fuel for that pos oh wait a minute i will need to get fuel blocks from somwhere else to fire it up in the first placei dont even remotely consider nullsec industry because i dont want to bother with the headacheinducing circular logic you need to wrap your head around there are parts to eve online that are actually enjoyable so why would i want to flagallate myself trying to get into nullsec industry
big yawn
heres the thing though why the obsessive need to do every single step from a to z by yourselfeither do pi or produce a shipmodule with materials that you buy in and have transported by someone or any one step in between and just focus on thatand maybe have a friend or two help out last time i checked this was a mmo after all
that begs the question why dont you live in 00 industry doesent bode well there because miners manufacturers haulers customers etc have to fear being warp scrammed every single moment

i think lots of people are interested in the avatar system me for example but they want things like the old gallente transparent clothing and headgear more varieties for skin color some of the colors we had with the first gen cc are gone with the new skins remember the old amarr robes with the massive high collars or blue and green hair or even a few more hairstyles that actually look goodrather than a slider it might be nice to mouse over a morph target hold down shift and use the mouse wheel to move it by tiny increments
in what way is paying real money for a sub the same as buying a plex with isk without sending real moneythis was the issue the change to the system was to stop players like myself from starting alt accounts with the buddy system contracting the new account a plex to activate the account and the inviting account being credited a plex for the invited account being subed this work around allowed players to basically have a 50 day or so trial account for free without the restrictions to skills and ships normally applied to a trial account you could then before that free account expired transfer the toon to another active account or sell it on the bazaar i still do not see why this change was needed i did this once but by the end of the two months didnt want to give up that third account and kept it subbed one more paying sub that i would not have started without this option i later started a fourth account using the special 6 month starter sub which worked out to half price also with the intention of moving the character over to another account after getting in the 6 months training but again i kept the account active and almost 2 years later now have 4 active accounts ranging from 45mil sp to just over 20 mil on my newest account i still have character slots on a few accounts with no skills if these options were still available i would possibly be up to 56 accounts by now i just hate stopping training on a main character just to train up a pi research cyno or hauler alt doing this on a new account and then paying the 10 to transfer it over is always an appealing option but now ccp has removed that option but back to the point at hand paying for a sub is paying for a sub the method of payment as long as it is not a plex should matter i pay all my subs through paypal i would be very upset if paying to upgrade a trial account through paypal disqualified the inviting account from receiving the plex i was under the impression not matter what the inviting account was still rewarded there was just no longer a plex for plex exchange if a plex was used to activate the account you would receive a 30 day game time credit if the account was activated thru a paid sub you would receive a plex as reward if you received nothing then you got screwed i would raise hell there is nothing even in the notes that accounts sharing the same ip would not qualify for rewards so even using the buddy system to start an alt account should still grant the reward have you double checked your account renewal date to see if you go the game time reward instead of a plex
i got nothing i checked again after i read this post still nothing
oo i know add a cut scene of you waking up in the cloning station getting dressed and leaving then cut to a scene of you entering your captains quarters through the mysterious locked door completely a video cut scene that could be disabled in the menuwould be really good for immersion
yeah i could go for a neat lil video maybe the first time you get podded for the noobs but im as concerned about refitting and redeploying quickly as the next guy gotta keep the regular everyday clipeffectwhatever shorthighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
well put a tick box right under load station environment to disable it but i would agree anything over 1015 seconds would be too longi just though actually have a video of you entering your quarters through the locked door would be cool it would help make the station feel bigger than your captains quarters even if you could not interact with it
i am sure this topic has come under scrutiny in the past on other forum subsections but having reviewed evesearchcom i found no proposals or past topics in the assembly hall pertaining to this subject i did look quite thoroughly and the only extremely remote topics i have seen brought up were the following and do seem indirectly relevantways to stop afk game playgreifers vs ccp hulkageddon is winning time for ccp to code changesthese previous topicsproposals were with regards to unrelated subjects but both contain points that relate to the subject im about to discuss miner bumpingprefacethere is presently a dedicated number of players who are in character following a belief system called the new order no relation to joy division much to my disappointment herein referred to as no proposed and enforced by a single player james 315 but with many independent followers activities have historically been specific to halaima but have now expanded to abudban which is howwhere i became i aware of the practise lasting for multiple hours multiple times a daysocially this manifests itself as multiple characters going into a single system and proceeding to bombard local chat with demands mandating short response time limits usually between 30 seconds and 3 minutes before bumping a miner up to 100km in distance demands require requestee to send 10m isk to the requester else be bumped failure to comply can result in potentially more severe action see codethe official code is here please read carefully and between the lines if you know what i mean
as enchanted as i am with this devious use of a shaky ingame mechanic the no groupies need to shape up a little havign gone through their code which apparently is still a wip and therefore may require some epic retconning  a few things irk mesince the code is a living breathing document its not possible to fully enumerate all of the rules but here are some examples of the rules to help everyone get a sense of its spiritso you have rules but youre not going to share them how can a your followers or b those who pay your tithe know when they do or do not break it were not playing poker gents and ladiesprejudice toward minorities is not permitted for the sake of clarity this cannot apply to all groups claiming minority status but only discrete and insular minorities which are defined as suicide gankers goons and others who oppose highsec miningso those with nothing better to do that throw away ships and fits are fine but nonenglish speakers are fair game i do believe that constitutes racial discrimination a simple fix is to add a page to with some copypasta in variosu languages for your ravenous horde to hurl around in local you ever know they might even learn some new languages in the processmoreover this could be considered an act of sociological racism tooalso from the eve sitea grief player or griefer is a player who devotes much of his time to making othersUFFFD lives miserable in a large part deriving his enjoyment of the game from these activities while he does not profit from it in any way grief tactics are the mechanics a griefer will utilize to antagonize other players at our discretion players who are found to be consistently maliciously interfering with the game experience for others may receive a warning temporary suspension or permanent banning of his account found herewhich can be span so many ways but can be considered to cover the acts of the no they try to extort isk from characters and then proceed to bump the characters ship out of range if they do not payof course the mighty ccp whom have furnished us with the eve verse have also fernisshed themselves with  at our discretion yay for case by case basisby all means bump away especially those bloody bots although im not sure a few dozen people will have as big an effect on the minerals market  gold shop alts as you would like just make sure you cover your asses in the processas amusing as it would be to see your empire come down around your ears because one of your enforcers inadvertently hurled a profanity at someone writing in cyrillic eve is about emergent gameplay and as long as the bumping mechanic is not considerd an exploit in this case here are some counterbumping mechanics the miners can use in retalliationo
in preparation for the coming balance changes i want to start putting together ideas for the heavy assault cruiser class of ships that the devs can use as a rough starting line if you have a suggestion please let me know and ill see if i can incorporate it if you think the ideas are worth looking at give this thread a thumbsup so it can get noticed if you have a bunch of free time please visit my other threads and take a look at them as wellfor the most part hacs function as superiority fighters when a small group of players with a lot of isk want to take on a large group of players in cheap ships they are incredibly expensive to lose and as a result are usually fitted with extreme care meticulously practiced and refined by their owners to make sure they dont die very often any time a cheaper ship will do the job a hac tends to be left in the station one result of having such a cautious pilot base is that we get very good feedback about which hacs are viable and which are not you see tons of vagabonds in 00 but you never see a sacrilege or an eagle hopefully i can come up with the suble reasons why these ships arent being used and what can be done to improve themcaldarifirst i want to look at the cerberus the terrible missile spammer of the caldari long overshadowed by the drake and the tengu this ship will hopefully be able to shine a bit now that hm range is reduced and its range bonuses are no longer pointless however i do want to stress that nobody nobody uses the 6th high power slot in pvp the ship simply doesnt get close enough in its heavy missile configuration and doesnt have any spare powergrid in its ham configuration and so i propose that the utility high be shifted into a medium power slot to produce the following layout4 low6 medium5 high  5 missilethis may seem like a lot of medium slots but remember this ship has no shield bonuses so a pure shieldtank wont be too ridiculous not like the tengu which can get a ridiculous tank quite easily rather i would like to see these slots used for target painters and sensor damps the kind of electronic superiority you would expect from a missile superiority shipnext up is the eagle the very idea of a mediumturret sniper has some problems because with turret snipers the signature resolution of your guns just doesnt matter very much and so large guns tend to completely outclass medium guns in the sniper role a blaster conversion is probably best although there are several different ways to do it i actually like the optimalrange bonus combined with blasters and i dont think thats the problem that really holds this ship back one thing that i do think should be changed is to increase the optimal range bonus of null t2 blaster ammo from 40 to 60 thus allowing highlevel blaster ships with optimal range bonuses to reach the same ranges as their falloffbased competitionnow i have two example solutions for the eagle and i think either would be viableoption 1 shift one high slot into a low slot producing this layout5 low5 medium5 high  5 turretand keep the bonuses the same as they are now the eagle has two big barriers to becoming a brawler and one is the lack of low slots for nanofibers and tracking enhancers on top of the standard damage control and damage mods if an eagle pilot wants to compete with a deimos or vagabond in speed he will need to fit 1 more nanofiber than they do if he wants to to compete in range or tracking he will need an extra tracking enhancer with only 4 low slots he can do neither without giving up a lot of damageoption 2 keep the slots the same and change the second range bonus granted by the hac skill into a hybrid turret powergrid reduction bonus the current eagle cant fit a rack of neutrons with a mwd and lse so obviously the utility slot goes to waste in pvp fits this way it would still be a bit slower than other brawlers but its options for vampsneuts or smartbombs would give it an edge also it would be able to fit a rack of 250mm railguns with a mwd giving it a unique role among sniper shipsamarrthe sacrilege layout currently looks like this5 low4 medium6 high  5 missile 4 turretnote that its t1 parent the maller has 6 low slotsit is clear from this layout that the devs were afraid of overpowering the sacrilege with any more low slots the ships armor resist bonus makes it incredibly tough while its capacitor recharge bonus practically give it one armor rep for free and at the time this was the right decision before quantum rise the nanosac was a common sight and terribly hard to deal with and any more low slots would clearly be overpowered however that time has passed and the current sacrilege is a fossil because despite its awesome defense and tackling abilities it simply cant deal damageit is not with a small amount of bitterness that i point out a buffer drake can travel the same speed and deal the same damage with the same ehp as a buffer sacrilege it even aligns faster since the buffer sacrilege uses a 1600mm plate of course the sacrilege can fit a beastly active tank but when it does this it doesnt have any low slots to spare for damage mods the result is a ship that excels at shortrange 1v1 battles but cannot contribute properly to a gang except as an oversize tacklerkeeping that in mind i propose that a high slot now be converted to produce this6 low4 medium5 high  5 missilethe bonuses themselves are fine and with the new ham change i hope to see new life breathed into this forgotten shipfinally i come to the zealot which is a pleasing combination of brawler and sniper actually i think it is just fine as is especially with the reduction in medium energy turret fitting costs
to draw an analogy then use hummer for a example the real ones are awesome millitary the ones you buy at you local car lot are for image my not be you taste but some like it so theres prob a market for non op concord ships in game beside would make nice bait ship if its super expensive also could only be avail from npc seller so good sink for ccp to explore
options ideas its cool that my idea could be wrong but the problem still is any realistic ideas in untangling the nul sec love fest how does the above idea make game play experience worse is it because it takes away a tool in the current mechanics that aids in making such large block possible how would it negatively affect the average and smaller alliances corps and individuals not saying your wrong just trying to understand better if i am
i have an idea for you change the core human psychology and you may be able to start affecting the establishment of large entities as quickly as communication in any form developed humans tended to form groups and band together for mutual protection and benefit you can try and put rules around it but i would argue that players will still find ways to strike up alliances and keep a record of this outside of the limitations of the gametherefore enforcing these rules on players would be arbitrarymy suggestion would be to focus on the sovereignty system in 00 changes should be considered that would make very large alliances and large space holding impractical in turn making coalitions either smaller or far more diverse and therefore subject to cracks subversion and dissolution
for eye candy
i wish to stress that the point of this thread was and still is for realism boobs should only move when walking running jumpingetc a slight movement should not cause them to bounce around drastically realismthank you
why is it so expensive to war dec large alliances i cannot believe it costs over 150mill isk a week to war dec the goons for example it seems counterintuitive as larger alliances are in a better position theoretically at least to defend themselves against war decs due to larger numbers better organisation  and potentially presuming they have access to 00 avoiding them altogetherit could work and seems more equitable to make the cost of wardecs inverse to the number of people in an alliancecorp  though if there is any truth to the rumour that ccp wants social aggregation it is unlikely to happen as it encourages smaller corps ceteris parabis rather how would it be if the cost of wardeccing was based on the number of players in the aggressing corp or alliance to prevent single man corps deccing and then inviting the hoards to join them the mechanic would adjust the amount of isk based on the new changed number of folk in the aggressing corpalliance multiplied by the proportion of the week left and if this was not paid could be autodebited from wallet the war was automatically terminated unless mutual with the aggressor forfeiting his iskeasythis way it facilitates smaller corps engaging much larger ones while disincentivizing larger ones from blobbing the bejesus out of the small as it stands it protects the larger corpsalliances who technically dont or shouldnt need that protectioni would like to hear any comments as to why this proposal could not or should not work as im not expecting a ccp answer please consider and reply tools welcome

did you miss the posts where ccp employees explicitly stated the new order is absolutely in the right is not considered griefing and petitions and the like complaining about it are invalidedit sorry missed the bit where you actually did mention those postshowever you seem to misrepresent a few things you state that ccp only gave legitimacy to bumping in the context of combat not mining last time i checked mining barges were not immune from combat they like any other ship may be involved in combat additionally there are many ways to engage in playervsplayer activities  all of which are valid employing bumping in these activities and not just in shooty shooty combat is also validsecondly you state that ccps statements about the vast majority of bumpers being in player corps is incorrect i think the devs know the statistics on this better than you and since you didnt provide any evidence at all to even attempt to support your claim

yes and until ccp makes bumping an aggressive act that starts an agression timer so the bumper can be retaliated against without the bumpee getting concorded they will keep appearingthis tactic is an exploit as there is no defense against it  even in the context of goons bumping freighters in the same way the escorts have no recouse against the agressors as there is no act of aggressionand the undock situation can be resolved exceedingly easisly by ignoring any bumping that occurs between ships with undock timers say that run for 30s after undocknote  there is no mention here of any concord response to bumping its not required bumping is an act of agression and should be treated as such

nice analysis youve laid out your argument rather well and i agree with you on all points sadly though it seems ccp wont be doing anything until there more outcry against bumping than there is for if you really want to get this looked at by ccp youd need to get any affected miner looking at this thread and commenting on it otherwise youll just have an influx of goonspro bumpers coming in and saying deal with it and tossing around broad accusations that all miners are afk all the time while touting around miner hate like a new form of racismps thanks for the shout out to proveldtariatwordpresscom

the existing definition of bumping per official eve wiki only discusses bumping as a methodology used as a combat tactic but ill give you the benefit of the doubt youre completely right mining barges are not immune from combat but thats a straw man argument of sorts for two reasons 1 nobody ive ever seen treats a mining barge as a combat ship  and that isnt what the miners in these systems are doing and 2 more importantly combat miners are not the demographic no is focused on no is focused on miners who sit in mining belts mining quietly  no act of aggression socially or technically are being solicited by the majority of the miners being bumped and if they do get aggressive its a result of the unsolicited bumpingill try to explain and end it with 2 questions for youccp falcons statement explicitly states verbatim  the people that are doing this for the best part are in player corporations if you dont like what theyre doing declare war on them so that you can punish them or pay a merc corp to do so on your behalf if you dont want to fightthis solution works fine for pvpcentric operations or situations i want to say lowsec or nullsec but that isnt completely accurate situations where you have corporations or a few corporations going up against players of a corporation or a few corporations so yes in that situation that punishment works no argumentthis isnt the situation with no with no there is no centralised corporation or pairs or sets of corporations endorsing it  all no members are in separate corporations and are acting on their own behalf if you are a miner being repeatedly bumped by 810 players for quoting no folks refusing to show your mining permit one cannot accomplish what ccp falcon proposes as a solution it just wont work not on this scale anyway it would be different if all the no members were in some centralised corporation that james 315 ran  in that case yes ccp falcons recommendation would work just fine but that isnt the case this is a situation where multiple players are presenting themselves independently except en masse on behalf of sotospeak a single character james 315 hell james 315 is in maybe was in i really dont care to look him up an npc corp himself and there was an official no faq item about that fact but it has since been removed all of this is why ccp falcons recommendation isnt plausible for this situationi guess one workaround would be to put a bounty on the individuals heads sure that might work but the risks of that for the miner greatly outweigh the benefits in this specific situation would you not agreeso when you say things like i think the devs know the demographic better my response would be to smile and say no i dont really think they do at least not for a situation like this this one is quite differentmy question for you is this regarding providing evidence of my claim which claim is it youd like me to provide evidence of the fact that all the characters involved are in separate corporations how would i do that a large index of screenshots of info tabs for every bumper you can get a list of the common ones that ive seen anyway by looking at list of supporters on the left of the home page or maybe chat logs with the names of every character if not that claim which claim and to whichever claim that is how would you like me to provide that evidence
yup understood completely so then circling back to my op would you care to explain to me how this fits into the picturekeep local clean miners should be courteous in local and should refrain from the use of profanity

mhhh following ccps latest dev blog 
thisunless a corp joining the decshield alliance does not have its own cooldown period on mutual war setting then this fix will not work you have got to stop the wars dragging around by alliance joining dropping and timers resetting because of these moves for any of this to be effective
so its confirmedif zo would just make the wars unmutual before the patch works he could further trap everybody as long as he wants because he can copy the wars between two entitys again after a week like now i guess the main issue is still creating new 7 days outgoing wars against entiys the aggressor never has known before  just by copying wars dodging the allysystemso has the fix just removed an inferno feature for a defender but really has nothing changed concerning the dec shield issue what it was originally made for
please provide a method of fighting back that doesnt involve the miner or any supporting fleet from getting concordedyouve already acknowledged that theyre hdiing behind the inability to wardec an npc corp and i cant see ccp changing that mechanicnobody is asking to make bumping exhumers against the rules what we want is the bumping exploit loop hole closed so that deliberate bumping is treated as exactly what it is a deliberate act of agression
if ccp changed the bump mechanic to take into account the mass of the ships it would help this problembigger ships move slower and are harder to keep bumpingsmall ships would bounce off a good distance due to mass differencewith no defense or counter to this action i agree that this level and type of bumping is considered griefing and should be treated as such by ccp and other playerseven have a concord tackler show up and lock you down for 5 minutes after detecting more than 3 bumps per minute add the new suspect flag at the same time so if you want to play bump games you are stuck and suspect at the same time

ill attempt to answer some of your questions on the matter sure they can deal with it in exactly the same way wardecs it just costs more for them if they want to wardec us all in one go sorry for not lining up like cardboard ducks on a shooting range but thats a perfectly legitimate way of playing we forgo the benefits of all being in the same corp in exchange for the benefits of all being in different corps871026 wrote socially and through conduct is portrayed as affecting only afk miners or bots however in practice this is not the case ie players are bumped regardless if afk or not amount of time given to respond in local chat makes assumptions that every player is watching local chat at all times which is an unreasonable demand does not take into consideration that some players have health issues such as myself or physical disabilities that do often require them to step away from the keyboard for 510 minutes at a time ed op i will admit i tend to dock if this is needed but given my health condition sometimes i do not have time to do that edit  rule 24  off topic posting prohibited  isd tyrozan871026 wrote enforcement method assumes all players speak english followers enforcing no regulations from what i have seen only speak english common languages in eve which i have seen are english russian norwegian swedish japanese and korean thus i worry such acts could convey harassment edit  rule 24  off topic posting prohibited  isd tyrozan871026 wrote no code demands miners not use vulgarity while allowing their own followers to do so vulgarity is both permitted to some degree per ccp eula section 2d while simultaneously not permitted per section 6a5 i answered this above871026 wrote driving force behind movement so far appears to be unknownunstated terms such as profit are socially used which is bizarre behaviour for a dogeatdog game such as eve ie why would multiple characters give 10m isk to another single character ed op i am left with the impression there is no profit and that this is done purely for entertainment  for teh lulz yeah but again this doesnt concern ccp or the csm or whatever why were doing it is up to us except for the slightly wobbly provision in the eula that griefing constitutes repeatedly targeting someone without a profit motive  which we do have
one year ago we where asked about our ideas what is necessary to do in high seci wanted to repost two ideas cause i think they really would fresh up the game or are a logical iteration well the new tankabilities should be taken into consideration

sensible thinking but hacs would have to be pretty crazy to be a better counter to cruisers than bcs already arethere was talk of redoing the tracking formula to make sig resrad more important during the blaptitan era  such a change may be necessary to make t3 bcs and sniper hacs coexist

i appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions some of your answers i understand this does not mean i am in agreement with them just that i see the logicthought process involved while some others are very slylycleverly worded similar to how the code is written im trying to keep it terse in my reply here likewise i also appreciate james 315 dropping by hellorather than continue to go back and forth with rebuttals and make this thread an endless void of arguments i have already made my statements in my initial post and those are what i am sticking to ill instead let players decide via the standard method of voting so that a csm can pick the proposal and bring it to ccp no im not stepping out of the ring or putting my tail between my legs  i would rather let the existing assembly hall system work how its designed sadly most players dont know about assembly hall and thats a problem i cant solve easily ive had a couple private messages ingame and one eve mail from players somewhat confused by what it is im trying to accomplish here and more werent sure how to vote in favour or abstain for that matter so ill rephraserecap  and this is for folks on both sidesthe point of my proposition is to gain csm endorsement so that the matter can be brought to executive level attention at ccp this is significantly different than a ccp developer making a remark that is interpreted by some as its perfectly fine this situation is different that bumping used in combatoriented situations in effect my proposal is to go above the heads of the devs and go straight to the executive leveli do not want mining ships or aspects involving mining nerfed in any way  i do not think that is the right way to go about addressing this issue this issue is a social problem not a technical problem i do not like solving social problems with technical methods i will admit that some of the technical solutions ive read sound interesting such as a bump aggression timer but i dont think those will put a damper on thisif hilmar and crew issue a statement that what is transpiring ingame is in fact permissible per eulatos then thats that  no tears no sad panda no whining just pure acceptance at least on my part at least i gave it a shot even if it fails on the other hand if hilmar and crew issue a statement that whats transpiring is a form of harassment then the risks for new order agents and those engaging in said behaviour instantly become extremely high and as bizarre as it may sound i worry for the people whose accounts could be impacted by thatgiven that the new order insists their behaviour is permitted within eulatos i am surprised that key no members like james dont endorse my proposal what have you got to lose by doing so if youre in the right  as you say you are  then no has everything to gain since ccp would rule in your favour and the miners would have everything to lose please do not say because theres no need its already been endorsed by ccp falcon or something to the effect of if it were a problem ccp would already have done something about it  those are pure classic straw man arguments
your problem is that if you take away all the words youre left with something like ccp falcon said it was fine but i dont like that so can we get the ceos opinion on the matterthats a pretty silly argument we already have ccps very clearly stated opinion on the matterccp falcon wrote bumping is not considered harassment bumping is not considered griefing bumping is not against the rules and no its not a straw man argument

yes with the current wording i do believe that i will still be able to keep everyone trapped using a method i publcly outlined for them almost 2 weeks ago i believe that ill be able to set all the wars unmutual and then just constantly eject corps from the alliance and rejoin with them or bounce between two alliances i have yet to test this but im pretty sure itll work like that and people got all uppity when i mentioned a disbelief that ccp would fix these issuesim surprised they only plan to let mutual wars get retracted because in my mind that says the aggressors is trapped until the defender wants to trap them then they go free once again failing to balance the system aggressors will once again have absolute control over the systemwell see if i have to make this thread a 3rd time
hey all for a long time combat boosters have been in need of some love i have 2 small proposals which i believe will improve the way combat boosters operate in eve neither are concerned with production or effects of boosters which i believe are nicely balanced if a little exclusive 1 change the way that drugs are smuggled  the current has you system scanned by npc customs officers and immediately having to pay a hefty fine in addition to being pointed and given an ultimatum to surrender your merchandise or face destruction whilst pondering the implications of the new crimewatch system i thought of the following i propose that ccp removes the instant fine the npcs would attempt to warp disrupt the pilot as before and the following ultimatum would now be 1  surrender your merchandise and receive a much reduced fine or 2  get an immediate suspect flag security status penalty and be attacked by the customs officer npcs when transporting even a modest stack of any illegal merchandise the instant irreversible fine is a crippling blow to any profit seeking pilot however it makes no sense when smuggling that even though the aggression of customs officers can be evaded in a fast ship there is still a harsh penalty landing the smuggler with a suspect flag and security status hit would give other players the chance to get involved in policing highsec 2 change the way that boosters are dealt  the fact that combat boosters and indeed their components can be bought and sold on the open market whilst being completely illegal to trade over contracts makes no sense i propose that combat boosters be available to trade only using direct contracts between players ie private contracts instead of public or through station trading getting to know the guy would become an interesting twisti believe this change would encourage a more networked approach to combat booster dealing although not one of my official proposals i also think it would be fun if each private contract involving contraband held a security status penalty for both contractor and contractee in areas where the item was illegal this would develop the actions have consequences idea and also add flavour to an otherwise bland method of dealing in illicit goods by eventually outlawing those who frequently deal for the dealers it would also mean choosing between selling to a few known pilots and having a manageable security status or dealing to everyone and being sure to go full outlaw i also think that these two proposals would work equally as well with all types of contraband  it fits the game style whilst at the same time making it much more feasible to smuggle in small and fast ships which will make combat boosters a marginally more profitable enterprise and encourage networking between playersalso a dedicated gas mining ship and more pirate interaction no must stop nowall in favour

hi zerg i doubt the wardec changes will see the light of day anytime soon may i join your alliance with my one man corp to partake in yummy mutal wardec goodnesssummary of eves last four expansions
so the question is are ccp and the csm listening since the dev blog came out and the expected exploits to be exposed have been published herealekseyev karrde  who has taken so much time to ridicule big up his role in all of this and tell everyone that this is not the place to contact the csm are you out there do you agree with these changes is this the product of your summits was it all that you hoped foryou spend so much time telling people to shut up and stop being idiots give us a progress report man or have you even looked at it yet
the op is free to hire mercs or wardec any bumper most of us are in non npc corpsof course if the op and other miners are convinced that what we do is dubious with reference to the eula and someone at ccp in a moment of madness supports them we could always switch to suicide ganking miners on a full time basis that is an explicitly allowed activity with many years of ccp support and considerably more expensive for the miner not to mention considerably more profitable than bumping because after 9 years of dying many miners still refuse to fit a tank at the expense of yieldas for mining vessels being noncombat this person would like to disagree admittedly the pilot had flagged targets to attack but it does show that mining barges are indeed combat effective
the point of my proposition is to gain csm endorsement so that the matter can be brought to executive level attention at ccp this is significantly different than a ccp developer making a remark that is interpreted by some as its perfectly fine this situation is different that bumping used in combatoriented situations in effect my proposal is to go above the heads of the devs and go straight to the executive levelall i know is that you are attempting to circumvent the word of the great falcon who was speaking on behalf of the judgement of the entire gm team by going above their heads to appeal to their boss with a think carefully youll lose money scaretactic and if i was any of these people i would be quite annoyedhighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
i think all the new order agents should be in one player corp for easy wardecking as long as all miners will be in one player corp for the exact same reason make it so ccp
if you posted these a year ago and nobody found them interesting nor functional back then what makes you think anything has changed since theyre not fresh ideas if everyone thinks theyre rotten ideassummary of eves last four expansions
thanksgiving bump
that is a good idea not to be able to use faction towers in high secthat would mean it will bring demand down and hopefully prices for those towers would be more competitive therefor ultimately bringing prices downanother possible solution to this should be that towers can be conquered in order to conquer a tower you should meet a certain or a series of qualifications one type of qualification that springs to mind should be that you must have an active war declaration with the owner of the towers if the war ends with you as a winner then you meet the qualification to seize conquer assets in space after all isnt it veni vidi vici i came i saw i conquered of course the proposition i made above will work a lot in favors for big corporations to pick and bully small carebearing corps so a series of restrictions and qualifications should be implemented so that it can not be abused by bigger corporations a restriction that pops into mind right now should be that you have an active war and fight the corporation you want to seize assets from for a long period of time and maybe that you do not have a much superior force than the target corpwe are able to take enemy territories and their assets in null so maybe ccp should implement a similar ideai am just speculating and putting into words what comes to mind what does the rest of you think my fellow demigods
id wait too see what the pos revamp brings before requesting possibly obsolete bpcs
i already proposed this idea in features and ideas and found that i had a lot of positive feedback and most of the arguments against it were defeated so i think it would be a good idea to post it here noworiginal threadsummary is this all current gates that connect high security space empires would be shut these would be replaced by four new regions one for each race that connect all the empires and are all low security they would be designed with few choke points and many entrances not to mention changing the map is something ccp has done in the past and would be a relatively low effort endeavor why1 break apart jita as a super hub and help homogenize industry all across eve2 make trading more interesting as a profession instead of the easily botable afk fest it currently is3 add more profits to trading for the amount of timeiskeffort put into it and remove a lot of the boring spread sheet studying4 make low security space relevant other than a cyno route capital bakerypi and faction warfare5 bring back trade caravans for moving large amounts of goods new freighter class with more armorshield ehp to allow logistics support and mobility6 anti pirating would actually be something worth doing instead of rpers who die miserably7 pirating would be a real profession and not being 10 popping the occasional missioner and fighting other pirates8 missioners and ore carebears would have new extra profit opportunities by having the option to move modulesicecheap minerals to other hubs9 maybe it would bring about courier contracts that actually make money10 greater uniqueness and sense of identity attached to your area of high secoptional additionsore distribution in the four empires would be changed along with ship mineral costs minmatar ships will be built with ores found more commonly in minmatar space etc not a necessity for this idea to work but it would be cool also fix nullsec industry while your at it
supported on the condition that more lowsec entry points are added so there are multiple routes one can take into and through lowsec
definitely a no brainer i think their are currently 23 entrances into caldari highsec from lowsec not counting lowsec islands another 10 should be sufficient i have not looked into the other 3 empires number of entrances but i assume they are similar except for the amarr of course many of those entrances lead into bottleneck constellations which need to have extra exits added or more bypass constellations
as high sec industrialist i like the idea  it would certainly add to trade opportunities production opportunities as well as making life more interesting for everyone alternatively leave one high sec pipe but make it especially long and boring  for those who insist on safe travel not to mention that it would create ideal place for high sec gankers 
fully support low sec has something to fight over trade routes and perhaps hireable protection along the route for anyone holding the spacei would recommend a long range hyperspace gate between the empires though but only for small ships shuttles and for a fee frigates so new players arent completely lockedin into their empire and you can move around and explore things
this again well i suppose it has been a while
implement it and people leave as has been said before there are people who will never goto lowsec no matter what anyone says you interrupt their game by forcing lowsec travel on them they vote with their wallet and leave
nopeople  especial new player  are leaving because eve isnt a dark harsh world full of adventures and mmo pvpchallenges they ve been told beyond 0sec they run lvl34 boring as hellbecause eve is a fing paradise where everybody can get everything without fighting  just grinding forlowsec is empty and noone needs to go there fw exepted nothing there is unique pirates are pirating themselvesbtw an old idea to boost lowsec
your not being forced to go into lowsec most people hump the same level 4 agent for weeks to months anyway so it would not affect you at all all the carebears still have access to the same roids the same ice the same missions and the same factory slots if you want to move somewhere else then you can use cloaky haulers scouts high sechigh sec wormholes or a transportation corporation
that is basically the current system their are only 4 highsec exits from caldari space and 3 of them are 1 jump from each other and go to the same system maybe make it 100 jumps then id be happypeople who insist on safe travel will still have cloaked haulers and wormholes
not to hard to cross low sec in a shuttlefrigatepod just make sure their are no smartbomb camps and hope to god their are no sensor boosting legions or anything and you will be fine
now they are not just bumping but suicide ganking too ccp shoud put an and our at least some limits in no actions this james  something cant continue thinking that here he can do what he whats and has no punishiment to him and his follows if this keep going on i will abandon eve and will be back to wow our some other game that has some limits for abuses like this
ccp will not fight your battles for you or hold your hand while you do things youre free to retaliate however you like so why not war dec them or suicide gank them whatever suits you hreatening to go back to wow is hilarious i dont think ccp would miss youedit rule 6  personal attacks are prohibited  isd tyrozan

the existing definition of bumping per official eve wiki only discusses bumping as a methodology used as a combat tactic but ill give you the benefit of the doubt youre completely right mining barges are not immune from combat but thats a straw man argument of sorts for two reasons 1 nobody ive ever seen treats a mining barge as a combat ship  and that isnt what the miners in these systems are doing and 2 more importantly combat miners are not the demographic no is focused on no is focused on miners who sit in mining belts mining quietly  no act of aggression socially or technically are being solicited by the majority of the miners being bumped and if they do get aggressive its a result of the unsolicited bumpingbecause noone ever fits combatscout drones to their exhumers oh and even though i forget the corps name theres a youtube floating around where someone in an incursion fleet used an exhumer food for thoughtyou do however make an interesting point ill quote the line im speaking of no is focused on miners who sit in mining belts mining quietly  no act of aggression socially or technically are being solicited by the majority of the miners being bumped and if they do get aggressive its a result of the unsolicited bumpingfunny thing is if you have zero aggressors nothing happens no doesnt have to act solely in retaliation you didnt pay end of story if you have a permit you are given 365 days of free bump free mining unless you of course forfeit it by your own actionssince you like to quote and pull from minerbumpingcom im suprised you didnt touch on the point that miners who arent afk have for the most part mouthed off expletives and inappropriate language because miners quite often are socially aggressive when they arent afkwe can call this talking  before a fight if you like but as any toddler knows just because you didnt throw the first punch doesnt mean youre rightin the end you cant appeal to ccp to fix something they consider working as intended since you do in fact have the tools to cope with the problem you just choose not to plenty of reasons listed here that i dont need to repeatyou arent forced to mine you also arent forced to be in the same system as anyone else also if you notice non exhumer miners dont ever seem to get bumped i guess your demographic is getting smaller and smallerthis post has been signed by murk paradox and no other accounts alternate or otherwise any other post claiming to be this holders is subject to being banned at the discretion of the gm team as it would violate the tos in regards to impersonation signed murk paradox in triplicate

i think either option would help 1
ronan connor thank you for the supportnow if only a few csm members would look at thisdmc

fully supported i think this would be great the only reason pos refineries are not used is the 75 hard cap some wormhole corps still use them as shipping raw ore out and minerals in is more hassle than losing 25even if nothing was done but removing the hard cap it would make a huge difference the excessively small batches would still make them a pain to use but at least you would not be losing 25 of your minerals i have used pos refineries in the past for ice as they do refine ice at 100 i can refine at a 35 refinery with zero waste on two of my characters if i could refine at a pos even if hard capped at 95 i would a slight loss is worth it on some remote ops but 25 has made this module almost unusable you can say all you want that why should ccp spend time changing a module that is not used but in fact the need for this change is the reason it is not used i am sure it would not be a waste of time i expect even with the new pos mechanics if we ever see them many existing pos modules will be incorporated with minimal changes this could be one of those modules
1 to opbut i fear that it wont have a chance see causality trailer they want that betrayal to happen to you so its not a flaw in ccps eyes its a feature
there is no real reason why stealth bombers cannot launch bombs in low sec maybe a member of the csm could ask ccp why this is currently soim sure anyone with half a brain could come up with a counter to a bomber with stabs it would give bomber pilots something extra to do in low sec and would help counter blob warfare i can understand no bombs in high sec possibly cos of black opsif there is a reason why bombs cannot be used in low sec i would like to hear it so i can debunk the theory
no your talking for your self not 160 other accounts your been a outright jerk and more to the point if you act like a jerk csm and gm and dev are likey to fire back you have no clue what there working on and whats comeingccp punkturis has all the right to fire back and if you ask me she was down right nice about it i have seen other post were shes fired back alot hard then she hasif you as a paying for a product were i work and act like that to me my friend one i would have open fired at you alot worse the ccp and the csm have trust me on that and after i would boot you right out on your butt and told you never to returnif your a jerk and you pay for something paying for the product does not give you the right to act like a jerk to anyone
sry dude  but thats what you wrote is  bsits not the point whats coming the point was that ccp has designed key features of last whole add on full of flawsthink about this so there is no necessity to defend ccp in that case in my opinionand ccp punkturis didnt fire back as the first ccp employee stating after 7 weeks in this serious thread she had nothing more to write than trolling other playersfor my own i m still very disapointed about this behaviour and i fully agreed with brib vogt in that wayespecially because the fix ccp tallest annouced some hours after ccp punkturis dubious i promise you alexeyev is giving it proper attention and were also making plans stuff just doesnt happen on the forums all the time will not work too  as we get presented it now from ccp soniclover the whole thread here told em nothing else than there is an issue because of unlimited copying warszo writes nearly professional articles here since months till his fingers are bleedingthey ignore it and implemented obviously a fix which will remove a feature and will not fix the issueand people like you give em candy for burning our money unbelieveble 
throwing my support cheers
at a glance this would have the ancillary effect of making high sec to null sec logistics significantly safer the nowhuge border with high sec combined with the lack of choke points would mean that nullsec alliances could use more hubs including secondary hubs like hek and oursulaert and transfer their goods from freighters to carriers and jump freighters from more low sec systems with long jumpfriendly routes from even deep high sec back into nullit would have a builtin tradeoff in the form of potentially higher fuel costs but it would mean that if a null sec alliance really wanted to go shopping in high sec fuel costs would be just about the only thing stopping them im not sure exactly how much that would change but its something id want someone knowledgeable to weigh in on before i 1d the idea
i can see a sort of modular pos that has a shield but then will not have enough fittings to attach guns or anything else to it
hello i am replying to you just to tell you i liked your post i wish there were more good posts like these on the forumsoh well time to go keep on posting emperor mtb
what about the constant harassment ive suffered no bumping but plenty of everything else ranging from death threats from readers of your blog and james attempting to force me to play how he wantshes giving me chronic depression on a game i until a month ago enjoyed despite the gankers now hes making me concider suicide is making enemies of the new order kill themselves a mark of high standings well
from what i have witnessed james has displayed superhuman levels of patience and understanding with you despite your violations of the code and actions against the new order regardless attempting to force players to do something against their will is perfectly acceptable within eve and james is merely trying to make you into a better happier minerthe death threats from other players are of course a bad thingUFFFD and i dont condone it personally but you have to admit you tend to antagonise members of the new order
how by asking them to leave me in peace or do you agree with wookie sith ottig that me concidering suicide is awesomeand for the 1000th  timeiam not a goddamned miner
please dont be dishonest capt youve went far beyond simply asking to be left in peace fabricated stories contacting gmsdevs etc youve done a lot of bad i dont think youre beyond saving though i never said or implied anything of the sort this kind of attitude is why so many hate youif the tears fit
and you keep bringing up things that happened a montyh ago and were settled a fortnight ago to make attempts to make me kill myself seem justifiedif you agree that someone should be driven to suicide you are as bad as the ones doing the tormenting
well this escalated quickly
no i brought up things youve done in the past because you were trying to claim you were being unfairly targeted for no good reason which isnt the case you did a lot to make a target of yourself thats what i was saying  not justifying death threats or attempts to make you commit suicide nowhere have i ever condoned players attempting to drive you or anyone else to suicide that is a disgusting accusation to make do you understand the horrific accusations you just made about me and the attitude in general is the exact kind of behaviour that gets you so much hate but again im not saying that justifies death threats or people trying to make you kill yourselfthough considering your history and my first hand experience of your lies and accusations in this topic i find your statements about james trying to make you commit suicide highly suspect
yet in a previous postyou said i brought it on myselfhe you implied it herethats as good as saying you deserve to be driven insane
actually he is being targeted to the point of harassment when you make a blog dedicated to the guy lol and taut it around to prevent him from joining a corp thats a bit different then just ingame prodding then maybe you should remind your order that this is a game and that those kinds of threats are a nono do you blame him james et al have been messing with him as a target for the past few months and not just merely messing but really stabbing at him at every turn and corner do you understand the amount of harassment your ilk have been throwing at him for the sake of tears and lulz when in reality its going too farbecauses james and the bumpettes are paragons of truth and justice and are never hypocritical or wrong give me a break
what i dont understand is why ccp doesnt respond to him theyve made multiple blog posts about trolling him harassing him i read
yes i said you bring it on yourself with your lies horrific statements about people etc  but i have explicitly stated multiple times that it doesnt justify some of the extremes youre saying youve fallen victim to death threats urging suicide etc the blog is dedicated to the new order and the code capt has featured numerous times precisely because of his own extreme actions and loud outbursts even if it gets to the point where corporations wont accept him because of what theyve seen on that blog that isnt harassmentif there are certain users who are hounding him and truly sending him death threats and urging him to suicide that would more than likely count as harassmenti cant control what other players do or be held accountable for them taking it too far accusing people of attempting to drive others to suicide is also kind of a nono too dont you think its a horrible accusation to makedo i blame him for his own actions well yes thats how it works he attempted to spread terrible lies about me personally in this thread ive never bumped him sent him death threats or done anything of the kind just because some individuals may have taken it too far with him does not mean him making such horrible accusations about others is okive seen james be nothing but courteous and honest with capt and the other miners ive got first hand experience of capts lies and libel so excuse me if i take his stories about mysterious death threats and suicide suggestions with a grain of salt
right lets not be coy here the blog is dedicated to tear extraction and isk obtaining with more than a few posts dedicated to targeting lynch your code is hypocritical and the order are a bunch of upset gankers mad that they cant gank miners with little risk now and that they cant profit from it it is harassment when you start sending eve mails to every single corp he tries to enter to prevent him from entering in the first place it prevents him from doing anything at all there is no tank for that no war dec for that hes simply being harassedyet you can theyre in the order so james should be telling them what is ok and what is over the line theyre his ilk he is responsible for their actions and i much like you lot will make the accusations as they seem far more likely given your groups composition please dont talk to me about horrible actions when your order is just as horrid if not more so yet his actions are based off constant harassment from your ilk and you wouldnt look to yourself for the cause of all this youre so far above this that it couldnt possibly be your fault please as for your horrible accusations brought against you you and the others know it takes little to prob lynch on its passive aggressive tactics and trolling shrouded in a cloak of decency while you continue to prod him on so yes i do blame you and yes his actions are based on the no again that honesty is simply a double edged sword of hypocrisy and trolling so please dont bring that silly argument here
i have deleted some posts that seemed to be little more than attempts at trolling and causing needless controversy

to get back on topic  what was the topic againah right i dont see why this is an issue that has to be raised with the csm bumping has been around forever and is just an accepted mechanic i dont believe its more prevalent than it used to be or anything theres a single blog where one guy and a few people who appreciate his hard work talk about how they do it doesnt sound like a big deal to me
there are 2 possibilitiesa you are threatening to kill yourself to put pressure on other people on a video gameb you are seriously considering killing yourself over a video gameneither of these are done by sane persons i have reported your posts to ccp you should seek professional help immediately and leave james alone he is the least of your problems
much like you are responsible of capt lynchs actions
leave james alone you kidding me james should leave him and everyone else alone thats bullshit that he isnt responsible for all this he is ive reported your post for protecting a psycho as bad the mittani at fanfest jerk
cant we please stay civil in here i hate it when fun threads get lockedas for james continually harassing lynch i believe that its been explained before james makes no attempt to contact capt lynch ever he screenshots the amusing things that lynch does and writes about them end of it is not a big deal

you lost civility when you started this crap i hope more outcry is posted here against this so it doesnt get locked and the csm and ccp shuts you idiots down james keeps targeting him when he could ignore him if james was such a good guy hed ignore capt lynch but he doesnt he keeps pushing and pushing and pushing you people need controlled it is a big deal if you dont see bullying as a big deal you need to reevaluate your life
if captain lynch wasnt such an attentionwhore then all of this would be moot he actively courts the trolls by attempting to troll them and failing he also creates situations that make for amusing press coverage by aggravating the situation further with lies misdirection and generally being a a pain in the arseif captain lynch wants someone to blame for his current situation in the game he need look no further than the nearest mirror he attempted to play the metagame and failed miserably on a side note as someone who does actually suffer from depression and has considered suicide in the past i encourage him to seek help from a mental health specialist itll be a lot better for him than whining on the forums about it which btw makes me think that hes telling another whopping great porkie people with depression dont generally spam a game forum about it it tends to be kept bottled up inside and if the feelings are shared at all they are shared with close friends and family
seeing that this capt lynch fellow is now 5 hours later at abudban local talking about space beer on local chat i am inclined to think that he was using suicide threats to pressure people in a video gamei have no wordsedit and what does that make people like anslo trying to use peoples potential mental health issues to further his political views and the other guys are the bad guys
ill be honest the bumping thing was funny at first but if this is whats going on and this is how some people take it hope it stops soon
how is james responsible for this at all the only snippet weve seen is between capt and wookieas for james postings on his blog not harassment simple people copy and pasting your tears is not harassment never has been never will be emailing other corporations he joins isnt harassment either as far as im aware if youve made such a name for yourself that people are willing to dec any corp you join to get you thats tough luck if other corps find out this is a possibility and dont accept you as a result again tough luckif capt just dropped all this nonsense instead of making up lies pestering ccp etc then itd stop pretty quickly people threaten to dec corps he joins because they dont like him and or because tears if he stopped doing the things that cause them to dislike him and stopped generating tears then itd stopit really isnt a matter for the csm at all
its not whats going on its not james fault that captain lynch insists on being a never ending source of saline droplets he tried to troll the new order and failed in a spectacular fashion now hes crying over his own failure and a situation he himself created
lets be clear to any watching ccp staffas i said in an earlier postive already spoke to people in scope and i am feeling much better and am no longer a risk to my own safetyany agents will now be blockedend of problem thank you thea orleans for helping me feel alot better and to destress before i snappedthe situation has been resolved and i concider the matter overplease do not bring it up againyou will be ignored
if mr lynch really isnt stable like another poster suggested and he showed this as he continued in the game then you should have stopped tears are one thing aggravated harassment is another at first i found bumping rather amusing potentially even profitable now it just seems very unsavory especially in lieu of this thread and its topic matter yes he did laughably so i admit but there is a time where you cease playing the game and move on the new order continues to push the matter and attack an unstable player despite numerous signs that this should be avoided you won the meta game congratulations but its time to stopin your situation yes but patient reaction variability is broad in terms of depression there is also the possibility of multiple illnesses bothering him and combining to create the current situation depression in combination with a bipolar disorder or others could cause this needless to say your assumption is incredibly sickening in attempting to project your symptoms on him as a standard and using that fake standard as an attempt to discredit himbut i cant blame you totally you may not be knowledgeable on the subject but i will still blame the order for the actions and reactions we are seeing here today there is a point where funmaking becomes harassment if the order was to really court support and show itself to still be a joke organization just out to have fun they should be the bigger man here and cease this targeted harassment potentially issue an apology and adopt new policies to ensure this does not occur again
i still suggest going to see a person who specialises in mental health if you were truly suffering from suicidal thoughts they can be a great help and tbh its probably the best thing you could do to help yourselfyou do make a very good point symptoms do vary from person to person and my personal experience may well be different from that of othersthat said it takes two to tango if the person concerned stops trying to troll the bumpers then i pretty sure the bumpers will ignore him as it is at the moment he is actively antagonising them and playing the depression card to make any reaction reflect badly on them
brb setting up victims of the new order support line only 10m for a session
for the final timei was overstressed due to a combination of events irl and snapped briefly it has never ahppened before and wont happen againplease drop the subject or be blocked
taking the time to repeatedly message each corp he joins and threatening to wardec them isnt harassment do you need me to post what the definition of harassment is i swear talking to you people is pointless you talk and talk but you dont listen seriously shut up a moment close your mouth and read a  exhaust fatigueb  to annoy persistently 2  to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical conductgot it through your head yet whether you consider it harassment or not is a moot point the english dictionary does
james started it his blog gets people to keep pushing lynch james condones the actions its his fault deal with ityou keep him from joining corps you keep him from playing anything you target him and 90 him its  harassment i dont even know why im talking to you you just come in and troll from an extremist point of view and fake civility to make it look like youre some superior  head get outi hope this gets nerfed to hellcase in point christ
all joking and trolling and new ordering aside though if you honestly came close to doing something like that  even if it was the first time and was only a brief moment  you might want to seek some help were happy to bath in tears but we dont want anyone to actually get hurt in real life or anything
some serious irony right here
then leave him alone stop the harassment stop bumping and go back to ganking ganking miners can defend bumping they cant then they get harassed then we get to situations like thisgriefers are the worst nerf high sec ganking to be harder and this is what you get psycho undesirables
is that an upgrade from belligerent undesirables
says the follower of the hypocritical orderthis entire thread is a testament to why this issue should be addressed by the csm and ccp at first i just wanted to see bumpers ganked by miners in glory and honor but if this crap is whats happening then it needs escalated
wtf how is all this not harassment wow dude
not really id take an idiotic undesirable over a malicious arrogant and socially awkward one anyday
i gladly risk getting blocked if i have a chance to help a potential suicidal schizophrenic to actually seek help your condition is no joke there is no telling when you will just snap the next time it certainly will not help you with your future corp applicationsif you are adamant against visiting a licensed practitioner at least look through
i like how youve cut out the only bit that was even remotely indicative of wookies condoning lynchs suicideinteresting how were responsible for the funny things he says to usas for harassment i believe its been stated before that the harassment as carried out by james consists of blog posts about him aimed at an audience of which he is not a part if he goes looking at that stuff thats his fault
look i have no ill wishes against capt but just because he had this kind of reaction over the whole new order and bumping thing doesnt mean it is an illegitimate activity or griefing etc the vast vast majority of botaspirants and undesirable afk miners have barely reacted at all to it maybe some comments in local telling us to sod off maybe a little whining on the forums whatever but the capts situation is hardly the norm or something that should be used as an argument for or against anything  that just feels a bit slimy to me taking his situation and using it for your own agenda it also causes us all to talk about it more which he doesnt want
i showed the only part that needs to be shown he agreed and said it was awesome after that its irrelevant you bumpers are out of controlyou arent responsible for what he says you are responsible for what you do with it which is harassing are you this dense he is not part of the audience but as you and your kind so eagerly point out others can interact and react to him which you all have forged in a negative fashion to ensure his inability to play enjoy and ensure maximum damage to himthat is harassing plain and simple
when the above posts start occurring youre thugs and illegitimate in my book and you continue to do so with words like bot aspirants at first it was just bots and many were very supportive of it now you go after anyone youre no good periodand why cant it be an argument how many more does this need to happen to 5 10 20 please tell us if anything is slimy its your assumption that one persons reaction to this crap isnt enough to justify reanalyzing your belligerent behavior
the only thing slimy here is you
ladies and gentlemanplease drop thisthe main reason for my freak out was this condition
the bit that wookie called awesome was the idea of a killboard lynch had not said that he was considering suicide when wookie said awesomewell i hope you feel sorry for harassing disciple of james315 on your blog i happen to know that hes very upset about it

are you blind 20121127 122340  capt lynch  tell james he gets needs to ad a special killboardUFEFF 20121127 122351  capt lynch  players hes driven to chronic depression and suicideUFEFF 20121127 122353  wookie sith ottig  lol defiantelyUFEFF 20121127 122408  wookie sith ottig  will next i see him onbolded it in case you actually are jeeshcant stomach your own medicine pleaseget outanyway im done with this since lynch is done with it good luck dude let me know if you want help or anything we could totally use more pilots jerk bumpers or not
perhaps you should drop the issue as requested or is your politicking more important than the people you claim you are worried about
ill just break the conversation down for youcapt lynch says i think that james should have a killboard for players that have committed suicide due to himwookie says i agreeat no point does capt lynch say that he planned to commit suicide at no point does wookie say that capt lynch should commit suicide or that capt lynch committing suicide would be a good thingthis is known as sarcasm disciple of james315 does not care that anslo posts pictures of him doing silly things and yet anslo cares that james posts pictures of lynch doing silly things furthermore if anslo cares about james posting pictures of lynch being stupid its pretty hypocritical to post pictures of disciple himself
so you find it more credible that wookie read comprehended reacted and typed a response to the suicide comment in just 2 seconds than the idea that he did the same to the killboard comment in 13 seconds on a semirelated note anslol you would do well to stay out of this weve read every evemail between you and lynch we know all about how you tried to use lynch for your ridiculous antinew order propaganda and judging from some of his replies to you youve done an exceptional job pushing the poor guy towards the limit the pair of you were going on and on and on like a pair of duracell bunnies youre so good at upsetting people that you turned a loyal ally into someone so furious with you that he was ready to use a machariel to gank youlynch is a liar everything hes said to us that can be verified as a lie has been verified that means the chances are that hes lying about suicide especially when he laughed in my face when i spoke to him not as my character but as the player behind the character and asked him to talk to his gp or at least the samaritans hes an attention whore of the highest order  were he smart enough id accuse him of being a mastermind intent on causing enough bad drama to make ccp step in fortunately hes demonstrated hes anything but smart his last ceo suggested he log in as an alt for a few months and enjoy the game far far away from any miner bumping instead he insists on being in the one system where we have significant numbers and provokes us further by updating his bio to say hes now a merc with that killboard these are not the actions of someone who deserves pity mercy or sympathy

their is a good reason its the same one as why their are no bubbles null sec and empire low are distinct pvp environments that have different styles of pvp massive blobs arent really a problem in low sec either lack of pvp is low secs problem
you clearly dont know how to low sec
blank quote
the answer you seek is somewhere in here
supported while it makes perfect sense for allied empires to have boarders from high sec space to their allies high sec space this makes no sense for nations at war i would expect that any boarder between waring empires would be a war zone ie low sec if amarr and minmatar empires are supposed to be allied against the caldari and gallente empires then there should be no boarder between the two sides that is not contested sure the current low sec faction war systems are the official war zone but how could any system that shares a boarder with an empire they are at war with be high security space there are many high sec islands in the eve universe the primary empires should at least be divided between two high sec continents with low sec space separating them other lesser factions should be restricted to their own high sec islands one thing i have always though would be really cool in eve would be to have it more like an actual living universe have the sec status of systems shift depending on how the war goes as low sec systems are captured and secured the security level of surrounding systems should shift if one side controls every system within a 6 jump radius of a high sec entry then that entry systems security rating should go up like wise if the opposing side captures all the low sec systems bordering your high sec systems then the security rating of those high sec systems should drop in order to stop this from allowing a powerful militia on one side from slowly chewing away at the other sides high sec eventually making that empire smaller you could have live events where the empire navies jump into the systems the reclaim them for the original owning empire these could be like a faction wars version of incursions where the winning side could then battle against the empires fleet of faction ships for big rewards offer massive rewards to the losing side if they help to reclaim lost systems of course it would have to be done in a way that the navy eventually wins to prevent entire regions from switching empire control but it would make eve feel like a much more alive universe if security levels of systems fluctuated depending on the outcome of the war
please consider this ccp it is worth looking into and would make the game more interesting
i believe that it would be more interesting if all four empires were separtated while it is silly to think that allied empires would not try to be connected to each other i propose that the reason they are not is through the work of their enemieshere is my lore explanation for the new regions and why the current gates were severed the caldari states new jump gate technology to explore the rest of black rise has caused stargate wormholes to be unstable that are near black rise this new region is called black void and has caused the connecting gallente and amarr stargates that are high security space to be severed due to their proximity the gallente have also lost connection to the minmatar due to this strange event black void would be a narrow sparsely filled region filling the void from the serpents coil to algintal many suspect this new jumpgate technology was not discovered by the caldari but purposely given to them by an unknown entity the gallente have discovered a new ancient jumpgate network near the myrdian strip and would be named after the local landmark the angel cartel and serpentis have began moving in because they feel that their is ancient jovian technology to be had making it very insecure this region will connect to minmatar and ammatar space with another connection to black void the ammatar have decided to break all ties with the amarr and destroyed all their stargates in high security space they wish to ally with the minmatar republic but they are still a sovereign state at the same time the ammatar have found new gravity wells in divinities edge and began settling their divinities edge will be the minmatars new zone kinda amarr are huge and dont need  they just will connect to black void and divinities edgecurrently each faction connects to their ally and their historial enemy by high sec while having to cross their allies space in order to get to the enemy of their friends spacebecause i got confused myself writing that here is a simplified formdivinties edge black void and myridian connect to each other so the path would becaldari  amarr  hisec  black void  hisecamarr  gallente  hisec  black void or divinity  myrdian  hisecamarr  minmatar  hisec  divinity  hisecgallente  minmatar  hisec  myridian  hiseccaldari  minmatar  hisec  black void  divinity or myrdian  hisecalso divinities edge would be difficult to properly place maybe snuggler underneath ammatar spacefor each race to reach their main enemies area they can still cross the current fw battlegroundsall four races can reach the enemy of their friends more quickly by way of the already existing narrow constellationsalong with a simplified map showing the basic interconnections between regionsbasic mapthe letters are abbreviations for the name of the regions or represent an entire empire as a wholei know i am missing a lot of the currently existing empire low regions but i think that map follows the general layout minus high sec connectionskeep in mind their will be more than one connection between the regions shown with connecting black lines those just represent what regions do connect with each other i may make a map that is more accurate and shows better how the new regions would fit into the current eve map but that is for another timeupdatei have added a new map that is overlaps the current eve map showing where the proposed regions could go and what the new gates may look likenew map
under my plan you would probably spent the same amount of fuel getting to the closest high security empire if you were in say providence and wanted to go to jita you would have to spend a lot more fuel to get you their safely but amarr will still be the same distance
i think exactly this would happenwhy dont use a different approach of giving the possibility of a faster travel by layers say the universe would be a burger high sec would be the meat itself now to travel alot faster from deep gallente to the outer border of minmatar you would enter another tier the cheese this low sec tier would enable you to do say 5 jumps instead of 30doing so you give an advantage to people so that they want to use this way instead of forcing low sec onto highsec players i am myself dont stay in just one area storywise this could be a middle thing of low sec and wormhole after the wormholes the races did try to make an arteficial wormhole which lead to the entrance of a parallel universe or the hyperspace like in babylon 5
that is how it is already everyone just uses the high sec route because its easy and you can do it afkwith this change you will still have plenty of safe travel options available like wormholes and blockade runners those who want more isk making opportunities by trade will have them and those who still want to be safe will have more difficulty and have to invent more time into getting to another empire but the lower volumes of trade going through will equal more profits per trip the only play style that will be destroyed by this is the one of not being their at all while your freighter goes back and forth from amarr and jita all day

this thread has both moved wildly off topic and become well out of linei will offer the following adviceif you feel you have been harassed in eve online file a petition under the rules  policies category and the harassment subcategory do not discuss this on the forums it only leads to issue and threads like this which are venomously dragged off topic bumping as per our current policy is not a bannable offence verbal harassment however is and will be treated as such everyone involved here need to take a step back from their keyboard relax and realize the gravity of the situation they have createdif anyone wants to reopen this topic for discourse with the csm they can feel free to to so however any further off topic discussion of harassment and venomous attacks will result in people taking long vacationslockedccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
i like the idea not sure i like jd capable variant i also really like taking pods of new recruits all the fun of seeing this ship pop and out comes immobile ships and pods scattering like roaches would be even cooler if the pods randomly dropped like loot as well meaning some pods just wont survive the crash
introductionmargin trading allows you to not have all of the market escrow up front to make a buy order but rather only need to provide a fraction of it at level 5 you only need 24 of the escrow to place an order the issue1 the scammer puts up a buy order of a certain type of officer mod  2 billion isk with a minimum quantity of 4 modsmeanwhile he offers the mods on market at 999m isk each on sell order and have them offered in contracts you may believe you can make a quick profit but that is not the casedue to the skill margin trading he only has to put up 24 of 8 billion isk on that buy order 192bwhile i may have had 2 officer mods in stock and purchased 2 of the officer mods offered on market at 999m isk each the buy order cannot be completednow comes the annoying partas the scammer made sure his wallet does not cover the 8 billion in order to complete the buy order and you purchased his officer mods way too expensive the scammer makes a huge profitsecond as the buy order could not be completed your officer mods will be placed on market  2 billion isk each causing you having paid exhorbitant broker fees over 8 billion isk  while the actual mods are maybe all worth together just close to 1 billion isk5 minutes later you ofcourse take this sell order off market againmay i suggest in order to fix that1 a message should appear first saying that the buysell order cannot be completed due to insufficient credits of the holder of the buy order and if i  instead would like to put my items on market instead as a sell orderthis will avoid the exhorbitant broker fees2 do we really need marging tradingnow that scammers are abusing marging trading the skill has become absoletemy suggestion is to remove this skill totally or that only buy orders up to a maximum of 100m isk can make use of the discount of the buy order 24 at level 5 and that any buy order above 100m isk needs to be guaranteed with100 of the buy orders value
may i start by saying how new and exciting this topic is you are a true visionary among mortals to bring up this issue in your threadi dont see a problem with this assuming the implementation isnt a problem thats something that only ccp knows you could also use simple view when using the market this way you wont create your own orders but only try to fullfill existing ones with the advanced options open youll always create a separate market order its one of the best skills a trader could have and is mainly used in legitimate trading any trader worth a dime will also spot a margin trade scam a mile away so the scam itself is mainly a trap for the inexperienced and greedy what im saying is that its a god damn usefull skill and you can pry it out of my cold dead hands i certainly dont want to give it up in order to childproof the market from such an obvious scam
lol
sorry to hear your loss manunfortunately this feature is meant not only to do margin trading but also to grief ccp will not act against it and you will only get flamed for suggesting it as you might have seen herelike in the real world you wont get a security deposit from those peoplefor the future just stick to the saying if somethings looks to good to be true its not fly once to jita and you see x adverts in the chat for selling cnr via contract but its just a regular raven
heres a duplicate post for your duplicated thread btw you should do some forum research this has already been posted about 1000 times i 100 support this option i think it is extremely reasonable and should be implemented asap i personally find the margin trading skill very useful i am not a margin trade scammer but am a buytrader typically with billions in buy and sell orders the ability of a scammer to scam with it is completely irrelevant to how i use the skill i use the skill to maximize the buying potential of my isk if you take this skill away you will dramatically shift the iskbalance i maintain between isk on hand isk in goods being sold and my isk on credit essentially margin trades are the only form of credit in the game and when your credit bill is due and you cant pay you dont get the items you purchased with that credit no one is harmed by the margin trade skill now i also want you to consider something how does a margin trade scammer make isk the answer is he doesnt make isk with his margin trade buy order he loses money there instead he makes isk when you to purchase overpriced goods from him please consider this when you buy goods to resell you are responsible for the risks in owning those goods you and only you risk not being able to sell those goods for a profit noone forces you to buy goods it is 100 your choice to spend your isk as you see fit and you should be 100 responsible for that choice in other words if you buy goods above market value and find you cant sell them for a profit thats your own fault now you deserve to know that buy orders are not guaranteed i support altering the tutorial to emphasize this point because when you understand this then you should never ever fall for a margin scam again if you see a way to make a quick buck because you can quickly buy something cheap and resell it expensive you would step back and go that buy order isnt guaranteed so i might not be able to sell these items at that price and then since youre not stupid and moderately cautious you will look into price histories item movement rates and when you do so margin scams are blatantly easy to spot
in addition to explain what i meant btwhere the last quote from current thread about recent dev blog bounties kill rights new modules and war in retribution  concerning other issues but the same problmem with ccps quality control 
this had probably be presented before and no i didnt take the time to confirm the idea is pretty simple jump freighters are crazy expensive and carriers take a long time to train why not have something a little more attainable like a tech 2 orca that can do short jumps and carried less than a carrier nothing fitted it shouldnt be able to compete with the carriers or jf at allthe fact that the jump ability is so exclusive makes moving into null and some parts of low really difficult therefore one is forced to relay on promises to move this or that if that promise is not honored thenwell you either pay the mark up or gtfo now again i am not suggesting a true work horse like the jf or anything as versatile as a carrier just something a small corp or even an individual with decent resources and sp 30m sp for example could use i admit i am not a cap pilot yes this is an alt but looking at the numbers i guess i am proposing a half carrier or jf across the boardhalfcarriernot actually a carrier really5km3 corp hanger125km3 ship maint bay3 ly jump rangeno combat abilitieshalfjf175km3 hold25 ly jump rangethese numbers could be further reduced as to not compete with carriers and jf the point from my perspective is to offer something else other than these very high end jump vessels it stands to reason that someone in the cluster would have come up with something else by now
blackops plus as many blocade runners as your heart desires works too
well true but i was looking for something that could move a packaged bc 15km3 again nothing fitted or assembled so not the same as a jf or carrier the blockade runner does do the job to an extent but i think there is a significant gap that could be filled by what i am suggesting
the reason jump freighters are so expensive is because they almost never die in lowsec its impossible to catch them  they can be in warp before pirates even realize the cyno is up they can jump straight out of station camps hit the gates at 0 and jump to highsec etc etcmost jfs that die do so in one of three ways a suicide gank or war in highsec b stupidly jump to a gate or pos in lowsec and get tackled before they are in warp requires extreme stupidity to pull off or c get sucked into bubbles in nullsecyour proposal makes sense until you consider that what youve suggested would still be nearly impossible to catch and thus would require an exorbinate price tag to balance youd still be looking at 3 or 4 billion iskto put jfs in perspective i had one shortly after a year of playing eve thats about 25 million sp most of which were actually trained in orca mind you they were a lot cheaper back then you can train for a jf in a little under 4 months without implants or remaps the skill time is not an impediment their price is but jump freighters were never meant to be individual assets despite becoming used as such a corporation should have no problem making 8 billion isk in 4 months as one of their own trains for the shipwhere i do think your proposal has merit is that large ship maintenace bay id even go so far as to say it should be bigger currently there is no decent way to ferry rigged battleships through highsec unless you fly them yourself im not sure even giving it a jump drive would be necessary to make it useful this idea has in fact been presented before but im too lazy to search for it 
that sounds like the tug idea that is currently being discussed i understand your counter argument and appreciate you taking the time to discuss this i still think it would be nice to have something more attainable but it also sounds like this would be outside of the intentions of ccp and game dynamics i guess the good news is that i am somewhat on the right track with the need to be able to move shipsthough this doesnt address the 8 billion isk hurdle and being able to move them through lownull guess i better make more friends rat alot more figure a better investment plan or plex it thanks for you time and fly safe
i dont think it is like this right now there are some shortcuts but not to bring such a huge advantage of reaching jita from everywhere in high sec within 5 jumps it maybe brings you 14 instead of 18 jumps the risk this is bringing is not worth itwormholes arent safe nor are they worth the trouble finding it first checking the mass of it bringing a freighter in it blockade runners arent worth their name you only want to fly into low sec if you can fit a cloak like with the viatorcertainly you would destroy the afk freighter routes but you would also ruin normal high sec players life by forcing them through low sec when they want to get from amarr to jita again i am not against a buff of low sec systems the new ore frigate is exemplary for that more people will use it and try out more dangerous regions with a t1 frigate therefore more mining will happen in low sec therefore the mineral market will grow out there and you probably with have more professional mineral buyer getting the stuff back to high secbut keep in mind that where there is a winner there is a looser that would cause people to quit who dont want to live with this kind of buff of yours for the low sec therefore the felt and real nerf of their playstyleif you really want to get rid of afk freighter you need to find ways to make it worth not flying afk and by that i dont mean you will be killed by afk  what you are right now anyway in uedama
wormholes are actually extremely safe if you only have to jump through one wormhole system then if you have a scout you cant be caught if something bad shows up just jump back through the wormhole and it will collapse then you also have wormholes that go from one high security space system to another that are fairly common i think half of all high sec wormholes can fit freightersi doubt the new mining frigate will change much i will probably make more isk per hour in high secfinding wormholes or flying a cloaked hauler is not hard and im sure a freighter pilot will easily adapt the lower volumes of items being traded between places hopefully will be a good thing also not being afk is not going to safe you from suicide gankers even if you gave freighters frigate agility they would still be easily killed secondly if i go from hek to jita it is 18 jumps by high sec through low sec it is 9 amarr to rens through lowsec will also safe you 9 jumps nobody seems to use these routes or try to secure rancer because why bother if i can go watch tv for a few hours and i get their anyway
the removal of pos shields will not kill poses or wh corps you just wont be able to leave ships outside of ship maintainance bays any more i imagine the interface theyre going to be looking at will make poss very much like stations in that you can dock with them taking you out of combat while youre in them the difference being between a pos and a real station is number of dock able ships and features available while docked

actually i like the idea and it does seem to make mining a lot more interactive other than just watching local and dscan for potential gankersi support this proposal and im not even a miner1 also the part about scanning blue wrecks would be great if its done with the ships onboard system scanner instead of needing probes that would make it much easier and faster to find them especially for new playersdmc
i hope ccp sharq and the beautiful ccp punkturis will consider working on this ideai am a bit sad that no filtering options have been planned for the overview window in retribution

1 agree completely
you can suggest whatever you like  such is the power of the internet you dont even have to ask for permissionsnarkiness aside no theres no reason to fix this  people just need to learn how to stop and think for five damned minutes instead of rushing headlong into unexplored territory large isk value market trading take 5 damned minutes to do a little research and realize  wow somethings fishy herethe part i find odd about all this is the heavy duty traders dont seem to fall for this scam its the dabblers and the get rish without any work crowd that seem to get bitten and frankly thats just fine with me
so heres how its going to gowhen a corp joinsleaves the alliance it makes a copy of that war which is transferred to the new entity this copy isnt a copy but a new war it sets the start date of that war as the moment that the corp joinedleft the alliance that means all i have to do is set all the wars unmutual so they cant instant retract them and then cycle corps inout of alliance constantly thus renewing an inescapable 7 day war timer and when the corp rejoins the alliance the alliances dropped wars will get restored by the new war copy a completely inescapable nonmutual trapdec shield nonmutual exploitthe above photo is taken from a corp that left dec shield on the 26th it was with 250 wars now 4 days later not a single war has ended when 47ths of the wars should have ended by now by random distribution youll note the two wars that started on the 30th those are corps that dropped out of an alliance and have received fresh 7 day war timers against me as a resultthe solution to this problem is pretty straight forward set the start time of each war to the start time of the original parent war it spawned from
so this will still not be fixed come dec 4th
no it will not be fixedi would like to take this moment to thank people for white knighting for ccp but like i said you will all go free when you can get free on your own i am not releasing any of you early because the system is not fixed and it is not fixed until it is ive not been hiding any of the methods im using from anyone there is no reason it shouldnt be fixable
that is so not tight butthole i dislike the constant notifications it hurts my eyes
i think this would be a great idea for two main reasons1 true trade corporations could begin to crop up not these one man 10 alt corps that all have freighters and just afk bus goods from caldari to amarr to gallente to minmatar space we would see coordinated efforts of multiple players making convoys to make isk2 we would see real honest to goodness mercenarysecurity corps that are hired to disrupt or protect these supply routes this gives new players somewhere to fit in it may in fact make eve a little more new player friendly while preserving the eve is harsh attitudeoverall prices will rise but innovation and teamwork as always will allow for isk making opportunitiestldr 1
to those who have had their post edited on this thread i apologize for working the wrong thread the was a mistake on my part for which i accept the blame while most of the edits may have been technically correct a more rational approach should have been usedagain my personal apologies
