no thx not need more hotdrop for cloaky sht
no way
panther and sin need some major love still speed bonus lame covops cloaks i think yes jump range thats a tough one to make a call onthe ability to scan down cloakers would be a nice counter but would have to be evaluated carefully personally i would like to see a covops style t2 battlecruiser maybe that would be a good role for such a ship t2 hurricane pure sexedit nevermind i reevaluated my edit and edited it out
not at t2 bc a t2 destroyer but anywaya covops cloak is a must have to the bobs sure its powerful but also super expensive and skillintensiveas to jump range 2ly is horrible with jdc iv i can jump 13ly with a carrier
just make them worth to be used for their price tagsp need
ffs balance blasters better already
1 at the ideas in generalthe only ideas i dont like are ilegal items shouldnt be restricted to the black market or at least a market that is restriced to a certain area of space whats the point of smuggling items from a legal system to another legal

im sure that the recording tool would add some extra load to a cpu but for most systems able to run eve now i believe it will be a barely noticeable feature to be honest it does depend entirely on how much information really needs to be processed and isnt all this information already cached or loaded somewhere shouldnt be any major task to get this into a data file for later retrieval but i could be biased and seeing it from one angle only one way to know for sure get one of the developers to talk to the code monkeys about it and give us that feedback they would know more than anyone else how much extra strain on the client this would place if any at all
ccp recently posted a tweet asking if people recorded their eve battles im sure im not the only person who would if they couldhopefully a battle recorder would be far less demanding on cpu than running a capture utility like fraps additionally i hope you would be able to play eve in low detail important for fleet fights and then later playback the battle with the battleplayer in awesome high detail

a form of industry decing actually isnt a bad idea
it is actually but dont let that stop you
a war dec doesnt actually stop you mining it just makes it very risky without combat support it also doesnt force you to fly only combat shipsso the idea of an industry dec to force players into industrial ships is nothing like the same thing i cant see how forcing people to bring industrial support could be added either unless you have roaming asteroids that attack the pvpers and can only be taken down by hulk supportbut now we are getting silly
yet another thread in dire need of a check here if you dont support box

citing that invention scales as argument for keeping t2 bpos is kinda meh since you have to scale in volume to achieve similar profits gained from a smaller number of items produced by t2 bpo it means the markets become saturated with less people doing invention  more competition  lower margins while people with bpos are largely unaffectedi would refrain from voting for the abolishment of t2 bpos if invented bpc mes could be brought to levels  5 there are enough proposals for this if that was done bpos would still have an advantage but at least the disparity of the production costs is reduced and this would ofc bring t2 ship prices down which i would welcome
as already pointed out in page 1 1 bpo is approximately the equivalent of 25 pe4 bpc for production ie 1 bpo do the same work of 25 production lines of bpc so the 40 bpo that were seeded for each ship if they are all still in game are the equivalent of 100 production lines for that ship ie 909 inventors with 11 production slotsprobably banned and inactive accounts hold a large percentage of the best bpoduring the second seeding of t2 bpo there was a blog about them where it was said that a rtm cartel holding several bpo was banned en masse at least some of those bpo were reseeded with the second wave but the bpo that were on banned accounts after that date have been removed from the game the banning after the pos exploit probably had several good bpo banned as the people using the pos cheat to produce moon minerals were producing directly t2 stuff to reduce traceability
well the only reason t2 bpos are being kept asis to not screw the owners apart from that there is no argument for not fixing bad gamedesignso to protect the holy cows somewhat just let the t2 bpos be but make invention more competitive by allowing for improved me yeah invention is fine yadda yadda but i want to see t2 ship prices drop
let me tell you  just because my costs drop it doesnt mean i lower my prices it just means i will make more profit business 101 works irl works in eve
its great isnt it thank you for supporting my cause
id dispute this  with direct competition for sales in a free market margins get squeezed  you might decide not to drop your prices but your competitor will in order to nick sales off yousomeone else will do the same in order to nick sales off him and you will at some stage be forced to do the same or your invesment in building materials will become tied up in stock you cannot shift and you will therefore have no liquidity to invest in more materials for your next batches of productionits these market forces that are keeping profit margins on t2 production tight not t2 bposthis is why you make no higher percentage margins prodicing hic  black op etc than you do items that have a t2 bpo equivalent a lot of people seem convinced that removal of t2 bpos will somehow allow them to realise greater profit with their invented gear  it wont  if anything having everyone building using invented neg me bpc will result in increased demand for materials to build the same number of finished products  if anything your costs would most likely go upthe way to make money in t2 production right now is pile em high and sell em cheap  this is why invention  bpo because you can produce in volumes that dwarf what a bpo can produce  im not saying its easy especially if you build your own components you need to be committed  but speak to anyone who owns a t2 bpo or more that is not exactly a logistical walk in the park either
it works 
you didnt propose replacing them with cash you proposed shafting the people who own them theyre currently priced at something like 5 years profits at 0 waste you propose giving them 2 years production at 20 waste thats not compensation thats a calculated insult there is exactly one way to compensate them that wouldnt simply be a screwjob and thats with cashor goods i suppose but thatd be even more problematic
probably not doable i would also add the ability to fit a ship without being in it no fun to be fitting 100 ships andget in shipfit shiprename shipload ammowaitwaitrepeat step one

oh come on  what harm is there in letting us contract damaged crystals rrrraaaaagggeeeeeliang
i support myself naturally ability to contract damaged items gief nao rrrrraaaaaaaagggggeeeeeeeliang
damaged crystals only or damaged items alsoi would personally be most displeased of buying a bs on contracts only to later find out that it has 99 hull and armor damageso no thanks until you decide what you really want and how to stop it from being abused
whee because its hard to add a x damaged field to go with itliang
well thats something you did not have in your proposal any chance you could add all the other aspects you left out in there tooplus its still just another way to scam or at least try
yes because people are going to go to all the trouble of burning out the mods on their ships and getting them shot into low hull in order to scam people out of a couple of minutes or a few million isk which they wont even recieve eve players are twisted but only the most chromosonally challenged griefer would find the motivation to do this sort of thingsupported
this has to be a troll coming from you off the top of my head goons come to mind this isnt even counting the kiddies that abound this game with the specific intent to annoy and make miserable as many players as possible simply for lulzwithout safeguards this would just become another useless tool to propogate epeen extensions in cp haha i jest sold sum idi0t a ravven with 99 damage haha1 i r s0 awsumand this is just what we need more of
butthurt goon victim detectedwhile buying a 5 hull hp implant and loading up a ship with reinforced bulkheads before shooting it to within an inch of its life before stripping it and contracting it from a station with no repair facility is somewhat appealing its simply too much effort for such a limited tear harvest especially when dealing with the problem is simple this is actually quite an irritation for those of us wanting to contract ships with damaged modsdronescrystals in far off lands to altsfriendsbuyers if some sort of damage indicater were included or added it may help to calm your carebear nerves matrixskye what happened to mk1 anyway
no not really but your comment proves my point quite wellyour type ie the griefing type go to great lengths to harvest tears you above many others know thismy carebear nerves are quite calm actually thanks for your genuine concern though and yes if safeguards were added id be willing to support the issue after years and years of playing eve ive come to the realization that many kiddies will take whatever opportunity and exploits they can get for cheap giggles and bragging rights and too many giggles give me headaches and in reference to mk1 i retired him biomassed only to later realize that these forums need me 
id hardly say im the griefing type i do agree with you that safeguards need to be in place for this sort of thing but even without them i must say that the potential efforttear ratio is looking to be in favour of the griefed rather than the griefer considering that once your contract is up it may be hours or days before it is accepted with no guarentee of being online when it is accepted and whatnot as always one is left reminded of the old saying of buyer beware
one thing i have noticed in eve has been the recent large increase in account hacking on eve security is a big concern with players and there are a number of ideas floating about on how to make accounts more securethis idea is not meant to really protect an account but rather hanger assets and possibly isknow a few years ago back in my runescape playing days jagex introduced a new feature into their mmorpg in response to increasing security breaches their system was an optional ingame pin code keypadbasically in order to access your bank which in runescape meant all of your items and money world wide a player would have to insert an xnumber passcode to be allowed access to their bank when accessing a bank a keypad would display on the game and the players would click the appropriate code too many failures i believe locked you out for a bitdue to this the number accounts with their items stolen before the account could be properly repossessed decreased dramatically in runescapeobviously there are a few fundamental differences between runescape and eve considering bankshangers in eve items can only be accessed at the hanger you left them in and unlike runescape isk is a digital credit rather then an itemhowever implementing this sort of option could stop account hackers from being able to get to your hanger since they would need the pin the program is also insusceptible to keyloggers and possibly could be implemented to player donationsother wallet featurescant be typed done with mouse onlyruns in clientpin doesnt appear in any account information if account is stolenoptional thoughts supportedit this is what the runescape version of a security pin looks likelook at the fn link
from my impression from those presentations and dust trailer dust wont start out as having an influence on 00 but instead on factional warfare if this intention remains on the part of ccp then it only makes sense that factional warfare be repaired to ensure a smooth integration of the two gamesit may be appropriate for the guys at ccp icelandeve team to talk to the dust team about about these interaction points and ensuring that the dust players dont get stuck fighting in the same 5 or 6 systems because no one wants to play fw in eve

bump with glue requested
just thought of this maybe an anticloaking bubble you cant cloak inside the bubble just a thought and cant be overlapped with any type of warp disruption bubble one or other not both
an active module that when activated provide a cloak disruptor on a 15 or 30UFFFD angle in front of your ship with something like 5km range that can help to uncloak ships when they jump on a gate without being to much uber and create a new t2 destroyer who will be the only one able to fit that module can be fun tothat can be fun to play that and give a more easier way to uncloak but keep need some piloting skills to use
i would be opposed to any area effect that uncloaks everybody on the grid or anything else of the sort this negates the point of the cloaki do however have sympathy for wanting to get rid of afk cloaking it would be good if you posted a little bit more about what you wanted to achieve i guessthings i would consent tocovert probe launcher on black ops ships scans down cloaked vesselsmodule activation time on covert ops 30 minutes cycle after that pilot has to reactivate
maybe cloaks need to use more capacitor or have a shorter cycle time so afk cloakers have a harder time fitting their ship to permacloak or like the guy said a 30 minute cyle and cant auto re activate
the buff where cloaked ships now decloak each other that was supposed to be a bug that was going to be fixed and so far nothing has changedimo covert ops cloaks should remain unprobable and be operational for as long as you want to run them afk or not the ships are designed around a covert cloak and thus shouldnt need to burn cap etc to keep them runninghowever i would be interested in hearing ideas for changes to the prototype and t2 improved cloakspersonally i think they should be sized so that for example a battleship needs a battleship sized cloak and a capital needs a capital cloak with higher fitting requirements another idea would be for noncovert cloaked ships to show up on directional though masked from overviewvisual so if you are on grid you could locate them given enough time and skill this wouldnt stop people warping to a safe to cloak but would mean only covert ships can lurk at a gate to feed intel to the rest of the gang
i always wanted to see t2 destroyers able to dumbfire like bombs depth charges of sorts that fires a burst to decloak a ship within the aoe radiusorable to probe to the grid that a cloaked ship is on that means you can probe within a 250km radius from the ship hardly a nerf to cloaking
in homeworld 2 you had a sensors ping thingy on tiny little scout frigs that would unveil cloaked ships within a certain radiusi could see that working for eve as long as it was a specialised role that required an expensive ship and lots of skilling
new t2 destroyer tbh like some sort of anti submarine hunter but in space make it consume some sort of ammo or something with a decent cooldown and short to medium range 1020km maybe only problem is that it would spell the death knell for cov ops and recons jumping into 00 bubble camps
if it was an ongrid ping it should be based upon sensor strength in which most recons already have an advantageid suggest bosting whatever counter there is for blockade runners thoughedit however im moe in love with a gridwide probing than a local grid detection toolcov ops are supposed to be the spy ship first a combat ship seconda proto cloak should not be able to cover a capship in a hostil system for hours at a time or someone going afk to work in a vaga only to decloak and strike whenever its risk freealso on the other side of the coin i hate seeing ratters who safecloak the minute local goes 1its more the noncovops cloaks that are being abused
i am really in favour of such things however you indeed need to make sure it does not affect people who jump in gatecamp and want to get away by cloaking a suficiently long warm up period would do that
thats easily fixed by giving it a 30s activation time
and disallow activation inside warp bubbles
for exampletheres many ways to prevent it from being overpowered
decloaking a covops jumping into a system is already a test of player skills the skill of the tackler getting a line on the cloaker vs the skill of the cloaker in evading the tackler imo no change is needed to the proximity distance as it can already be skewed in the tacklers favour by assigning a drone cloud with the corresponding countermeasure of drone vulnerability to bombs furthermore there is already a sufficient module reactivation delay even on a cocd to prevent someone so decloaked from being able to recloak before being locked and subsequently tackleda cloaked ship cant activate modules reload charges interact with celestial objects or target other ships  it has an effective dps of exactly zero even after decloaking its ability to engage a target is penalized by the sensor recalibration delay nonnative cloakers incur further significant penalties to their scan resolution and their maximum cloaked velocitiesi support the idea of shipclass sized cloaking devices  it seems reasonable to me that cloaking a capital should require more effort than cloaking a bs with respect to nonnative cloakers i would consider supporting a very modest fuel consumption or the ability to probe out their general location strongly dependent on the mechanism if and only if that was balanced by a tradeoff against the existing drawbacks however in my mind such changes to native cloakers would completely invalidate their role and im am completely opposed to them fundamentally at least in my opinion there isnt a problem with cloaked ships  the problem is when they uncloak and for that there are already effective solutions that dont require changes to game mechanics with a very decided risk of borking an entire type of game play
i agree that there is a need in many cases for a cloak for supercaps and the likehowever its turned into a catch all and risk free with the mwdcloak trick it has become a way to bypass mechanics that people are saying probing would invalidatea 30s module delay for the probe ie delayed like an armor repper and the inability to use the probe in a bubble are two excellent ideas to offset and allow the advantage of cloaking to remainfuel consumption is a good idea in itself but that addresses afk cloakers only this would address many things such as farmers and macros in 00 which are impossible to catch
this topic seems to keep rearing its ugly and useless head over and over add nauseumthere is nothing wrong with the mechanicsthousands of eve players agreeleave cloaking alone
if you are a mercenary corporation i would assume you would like to brag about successful contracts not how much isk youve killed is a merc corp fail if they were contracted to shut down a region against a certain corpalliance and succeeded so well that the alliance never undocked to get killed in a measurable quantitynone what so ever but kill mails for ships are already in game however irrelevant i hold them the only reason i pay attention to my killboard is to check off things on my killboard bingo need a black ops and an orca and i win of course i laugh at fail fits just like everyone else however its the team organization planning and execution that i hold in higher regard also a well executed gank is partial to my hearti wont be upset at all if pod mails show up however that does not change the fact that i see no good use for it other than another way to haha at someone you killed
well ok lets analyze this argumentpro we want more fluffcon fluff yourselfits really just that simple any more words typed than that is just keyboard diarrhea
not supported its not neededfurthermore while it makes some sense that your ships scanners can pick up or figure out what a ship had on board or fitted it makes very little sense that they could figure out such finery as is installed in some ones blown up headpersonally i think killmails themselves are kind of ridiculous it really makes no sense that just because you kill someone you immediately know all sorts of informations about their ship without even exploring it or looking at it or scanning it or anything itd be similar to if i used an rpg and blew up someone in a car and then immediately knew everything that was in it what is salvageable and what kind of tires he was using
not needed  not supported the killmail system already encourages killmailwhoring and discourages engaging when the outcome is not certain this is bad enough the last thing we need is yet more epeen fodder reinforcing this behaviour of which i have been just as guilty of in the past mostly due to concern over kb efficiency and other meaningless crap
i dont support it primarily because this additional information would have only 1 effect more hate speech in locali get enough snide remarks just because i like to fly expensive shipstheres not a single situation where seeing someones implants wouldnt cause more negativity either itll be lol noob doesnt even have cheap implantsorlol noob just lost his implantsthe best thing is not to feed the trolls
supportits a good thing but id like this feature implemented along with neutral scanner that has been proposed about a week ago
not supportedhere how about this reasonit would increase pod killing for no other reason than to find out what implants someone hadi believe ccp and as such concord doesnt support pod killing which is why you get a huge status hit for doing it when in low sec high sec all this would do is promote pod killing anyone who happens by for no other reason than to see what they had in their headi would hazard a guess as this is why it isnt included already
exactly my thoughts
i hate the fact that when i undock into a busy mining system or a tradehub i look around to see at least 5 other people with the exact same ship as me with a little uncomplicated editor you could instantly introduce the feeling of uniqueness i dont want custom skins or anything else that would represent a need for speed type customisations just a little something to make me stand out from the crowd thats all1

the idea is to make tactical shield manipulation actually do something usefull right now the only application is as prerequisite for modules skill is bad for both shield and armor tankers for shield tankers its bad because without the skill shield stay longer on the peak recharge rate for armor tankers its bad because damage which bleeds through shield to armor can be repaired anyway and again it reduces shield effective hp because shield stays less time on the peak recharge rate why not give it some useful meaningful role  for example give 10 to recharge rate at 5 or increase point of peak recharge rate to 4045 at 5 it is tactical shield manipulation after all do something meaningful with it we do not want any drastic alterations because changing skill mechanics to big degree is bad people train something for long time and then all of a sudden they realize that skills is useless for them or doesnt work like they expected anymore like happened to cruise missiles when sb mechanics was changed so do some minor adjustment to make it really useful for tanking and keep it in line with concept of active tanking

no blatant and unneeded buff to shields
go back under your bridge
theyre right though that was no troll post could do with something more useful yes but not that
you too go back under your bridgei never asserted that this is exactly what should be done if trolls would ve actually read the posts they are trolling which never happens unfortenantly then you would ve read part of it which says for example
tactical shield manipulation is fine as is the extra resists for passive hardeners or without cap are actually useful
omg
derp 
should i have written active hardeners without capcontinues neuting sokratesz wyvern
nah you should have looked up the skill if you dont know what it doesbut there are enough other skills that are mainlyonly used to unlock stuff like jury rigging
the idea is to read the skill clearly and carefully and understand that its premise is to reduce the amount of damage that pierces shields through to armor when they are at 25 other than it being a required skill for invun fields and othernot to act like an asshat nooblet who knows nothing of what he speaksohi meant to say not supported
i really should have went to bed instead of posting on the forums but here i am stay tuned for more postings where i am too tired
thats the problem with the proposal you ask for change but leave the actual solution completely open how can we support thattempted to call op a troll
tsm is the only skill in the game that actively harms you as you train it higher its absurd and needs changing that said i have no really good idea what ought to be done with it the only things that come to mind that dont step on the toes of existing skills or have silly power levels are either to reduce the cap needs of shield hardenerssay 10level and up their base need 25 or so or maybe some kind of fiddling with the shape of the shield recharge curve i think the first of those is decent and the second is likely to be a terrible idea
why does it harm you
i agree with making the skill usefulll maybe we could increase the width of the max recharge point of shield by a bit with each level meaning peak recharge rate will be achieved in a grater range of values for shield percentage either way it should be come useful now it can only have minor aesthetic value to armor tankers
i believe what theyre getting at is that because damage can pierce the shields it removes damage from the shields and puts it on the armor thus lowering the actual damage the shield takes keeping its level higher for better rechargebut from what i can remember shields only get pierced below 25 so that argument is kinda dumb as the amount of difference is so marginal i would say that a good change to this would be to reduce the capacitor needs for shield hardeners and invuls as they tend to use quite a lot of cap and remove the shield piercing effect all together from the skill invuls are like 33 caps for t2 and i think regular hardeners are like 225 off the top of my heador another option instead would be to reduce cpu for shield hardening mods which i think most people would agree is a needed change especially for capital ships
the myth that tsm hurts shield tankers is laughable it has been debunked over and over againfirst if your tank is 25 then your tank is broken passively speaking actively possible second a shield tanker that lets damage bleed into his shields will die faster then a tanker that doesnt tsm actually helps a shield tanker by stopping attacks from getting to the armor if a shield tanker is taking armor damage even if his shields can cope with the damage at lets say the 15 mark eventually he will die since he is taking armor damagein short tsm is actually good and you can go look up the super detailed posts that make mine look like a kids understanding as to why youre wrongnotsupportedbtw your suggestion would make passive tanking overpowered and nobody would active tank anymore

while there may be more people in 00 the changes dominion brought make it even harder to farm ratters which is annoying as  its like they dont want anyone to die unless its organized combat this paired with the long ago addition of jump bridges make 00 a virtual dead zone for anything other than organized combat groups fighting each other or boring ass campinghot dropping on bridgesid strongly suggest a lot of warp scrambling rats in any signiture spawns to prevent the overwhelming protection these things give ratters there is just far too little opportunity to scan down ratters in time before they can safe up at least when people were rattingmining in belts you had a slim chance to catch competent people if you were solid at scanning 00 is far to populated these days to be such a barren waste land for roamingganking quit protecting the care bears so much
all rats in 00 should scramble rewards should be boosted respectively however
i want to see better npc design across the board yes proper tackle seems like a natural part of that to me the effect it would have on roaming pvp is a nice benefit as well

if you cant get a better payout in 00 than you can in empire youre doing something wrong laziness is not the answer to wealthas for the guy who said 00 is a void there are probably 5x as many people in 00 now as there were 2 years ago but with all the crazy stupid changes theyve made its very hard to locate any of them because they dont gate travel and now dont belt farmmine sure you can probe down a signature sometimes fast most times not it still takes infinitely longer than scanning belts properly and with local chat still a joke and standings showing in channels now its damn near impossible not to be noticed immediately unless the system houses more than 15 people

some good discussion altho i must admit im starting to get somewhat disappointed about the csm its not the fault of only current represantives tho mainly as i have impression growing in me that csm is not taking overly seriously idea of representing community and seem to be more lobbyng for their own personal playstyles the roots of this feeling reach back to the time of previous csm though for example thinking that inability to dock while scrambled is reasonable idea rubs me in the wrong way to a degree so far only some rather populist real politicans have managed so far so far i had impression that people in that board are somewhat intelligent just mostly ignored by ccp and no  being able to get overview data before undocking does not make that idea good docking games are lame but there is far better options to cure that without screwing over anyone who has to move capital ship thru low sec i have ofc not written the csm off just yet and plan to vote again in the next elections also with all my accounts as i have done so far i like to believe that nodding in agreement to that bad idea by ccp was result of serious hangover not some disability in the thinking process of our representatives most of the ideas discussed were relatively reasonable i do not agree to several of them but that is life  cant please everyone but seriously  inability to dock while scrammed 
the csm would like to be utilized more and would like ccp to be more proactive in bringing issues to themtranslation the csm would like to feel more important the csm does not see a need for a term limit um hell yes the do stupid ideathe csm would like ccp to investigate the feasibility of improving access to nullsecdo something that gets rid of or discourages power blocks and the smaller alliances will feel its worth going into 00 and staking a claim right now it is either you are part of the power block or a renter which is the same thing except you are paying to be part of the power block  it is virtually impossible to go into 00 otherwise seriously change standings to have fees like war decs the more blues you make the more you paythe meeting discussed possible changes to the mechanics of the undocking gameability to see overview before you undock sure as long as i get to see who and what they are undocking with before they undock look guys they are flying this and there is those so fit specific undock gank redockcorrect me if i am wrong but if your whole alliancewhatever blue list is camped in and dont have one guy in cov ops to relay intel on what is outside station then thats your own fault is summary horrible idea the idea of the bigger the ship the longer it takes to dock is far better also remote whatever should count as aggression already this whole i want to be part of the fight without risk thing is crapthe issue of the use of titans and doomsday devices in lowsec was discussed csm believes that lowsec use of titans and doomsdays should be reinstatedtranslation we were having tons of fun doing the driveby dds in low sec with little to no risk after you took away our driveby dds in 00 with little to no risk please bring that back horrible ideathe csm would like to have a budget of development time dedicated to going through a backlog of projects that they prioritizetranslation we would like to have control of how you spend some of your budget directlyif you really want that then perhaps you should get a job at ccp and work you way up to managementthe csm calls for far more dialogue with ccp regarding game design as it is happening rather than after its releaseagain csm wanting to be recognized as game designers without actually working at ccp drop off an application while you are there at the summit also maybe ccp is hesitant about providing you guys with inside info just for it to be larksonedthe csm would like warfare links and information warfare looked at ccp will consider whether they need to be changed but is concerned about making them overpoweredthe only set that needs looked at is the information ones they are worthless to bother fitting not to mention the eos is a pointless waste of space right now with every aspect of it being lol from lol gang bonuses to lol blasters to lol drones to lol tank astarte too for that matterthe csm was unhappy about a recently installed 5 minute cool down timer on forum posting ccp announced that the timer will be reducedif the people that hate the timer are too lazy to log out and log back in to post something else then the post must not have been worthy enough the 5 minute timer is finethe csm expressed concern over heavy handed forum moderationorly you should see the boards on other games out there the rest is not bad i guess definetly the best csm so far sadly that is not saying much keep things scandal free and the players will take the csm more seriously thus ccp will take the csm more seriously and you will finally get to feel like egods
no we want to be able to give more adequate feedback about the things ccp is working onxhagen proposed this along with the 1year term and we all agreed that it would be for the betterment of the csm and the relations with ccpso basically you agree we were talking about access in its most basic form btwread the rest this ties in with the scramunable to dock thing fail both csm and ccp felt that lowsec dds were conflict drivers not sure if you were aware of it but back in december we as a corp and tri as alliance were getting ready to bait and gank a titan  but it got nerfed before it could be executed lowsec dds require people to be more careful with what they do and may lead to epic battles once people get the hang of itagain this was proposed by ccp and we said wowok cool and then proceeded to discuss a ton of details about it
no we just want to be able to give more adequate feedbackndano its not if you must relog just to circumvent it that just shows how wrong it is sorry marlona that was a pretty poor attempt at criticism
just out of curiousityi am assuming that you dont include any of the beam weapons as a gun since they are still vastly more powerful than any other weapon system in the game best range band best tracking best damage virtually no ammo instant ammo switchingoh and they use a little cap on ships designed specifically to have higher cap recharge than all the other ships of the same classjust curious ya know
the discussion came up because a couple of csm members have issues with hybrids at no point was there any discussion on nerfing the other guns just talk about possible boosts to hybrids andor gallente ships in general
and i agree with that notion but the minutes are what i quoted which is why i am curious are the minutes wrong were they comparing arty to rails and blasters to acs or did someone seriously think projectiles were the best weapon system overalli mean projectiles use no cap but minmatar ships almost universally have the lowest cap size and recharge in return while the opposite is true of lasers and yet look at all the measurables and unmeasurables that lasers get over all the other systems which results in their superiority and is reflected statisticallyanyways just was curious about that one statement was all glad to hear you are fighting for the treaty system i really want to see that one take place i mean a treaty that allows mission runners to run lvl 5s in low sec for a cut of the profits to their guardians and so on just seems like a win win for all involved
how about the players give ccp feedback about what they are working oni for one welcome our new csm dictatorsnerf power blocks or you will wind up with the same scenario of what current pirates in lowsec nonstop complain abouthow come care bears dont want to do missions in low secit has already been stated that even if level 4 missions were all moved to low sec the majority of the eve population would still prefer to do level 3 missions in empire its the gank factor same principle can be applied to your question of why wont small alliances move into 00true you have to pay for sov now but that does not stop the well we like this space over here but lets not pay for it now if someone tries to claim sov we will just blob the crap out of them with our power block and kill their tcu if we cant have it no one canso in closing on this section yes i agress something has got to be done to get rid of the 2025k man blue listi read everything before posting anything all it will do is encourage docking to happen more often so everyone can have eyes with no risk scraming to prevent docking i have mixed feelings abouttitans should not be allowed to fire their dd if they have initiated warp drivefixedim teasing seriously its csm wanting more power and then get themselves into a position where to avoid players questions they throw out the nda statement the majority of the csm represents a minorty of eveoh well who could have predicted thisno it is if players are not being subjected to massive spam and accounts hacked and such just shows how well it is working reducing the timer is not the solution you are looking fori thought this is where you throw up the nda thing
the 25 quote is from the devblog as linked in my post which was sent to us in our welcome to the csm emailsthus i assume the wiki is incorrect however i will try to get this clarified this week
the inability to see or interact with a character is one of the most cited shortfalls of eve online by new players and game journalists it is the first thing every new player notices to not dedicate development time to the project would be a poor business decisioneven so saying there is a fair portion of the player base that would like to see this added as can be seen in this thread i look forward to seeing the finished product
i think the issues as theyre presented have been pretty well thrashed out so ill spare you my views  they arent uniquewhat concerns me though is that all of these decisions seems to ignore a couple of fundamentals of gaming most notably the ongoing development of new players calculating how much an ingame miner affects the ingame economy is interesting but lets also look at how those accounts affect the overall eve picture in terms of long term existencehistorically roughly 5 years in and an mmo starts to be at risk around this time most mmos have run up on the rocks and in most cases it has to do with diminishing player community and recruitment if the game changes in such a way that a class of character becomes extinct that can start to decay the entire game lets face it  eve needs miners and mission runners and especially noobs wipe out any class and you put the game at risk anyone want to take a look at that
one other thing its interesting to note that removing ceilings and floors on various commodities does in fact affect the economy here note however that when all prices fall youre not correcting youre in a deflationary spiral and eve most definitely is in deflation reduction in the price of tritanium for instance is utterly meaningless unless you consider it in terms of the overall economy minerals are down and so are ships and components undsovetter be careful what major economic cogs you recommend changing now unless theyre considered in terms of the overall economy the results may be both surprising  and grisly

add the advanced ai rats to lowsec and 00 which would encourage ship fits closer to pvp fit and make it so those ratting have a competent pvp setup as well
lowsec is needing a boost some good ideas listed
not signed trying to turn lowsec into 00 and allow piratepvp corps to build mini empires isnt going to fix lowsec in anyway apart from 1 6 and 9 the rest of the ops points sound good as for making lowsec dangerous it is dangerous enough in fact so dangerous that people dont want to venture into lowsec as much as possible the problem is just that people dont have a good enough incentive to come to lowsecas for cynojammers in lowsec i think capwarfare should be strictly restricted to 00 caps have no place in lowsec especially now that there are jump freighters
ok first off ill support the idea of a low sec expansion or upgrade but not the ideas presented sorry but we dont need sov warfare in low secim not a fan of any sort of system upgrades done by players that to me is too much like sov warfare and next thing you know all the hoards or null sec blobs coming into low sec stealing everything example look the current situation with low sec moonswe already see many null sec alliances making moves on the moons all across low sec which cuts out income possibilities for many low sec groups no one in low sec can really compete when any of the major power blocs decide they want moons in low sec if you allow for system upgrades or the ability to control systems for some sort of benefit it would turn into boring sov warfare that many of us have no interest inas far as capitols i think something needs to be done about them as there are far too many floating around low sec when a fw militia can drop 9 carriers into a fight and have dreads on stand by its easy to see things arent what they should be in low sec i do agree something needs to be done to curve the usage of capitols in low sec but i dont think it would be right to be able to cyno jam them out of systems if you let pirates upgrade systems to that extent certain groups would just grab up high traffic boarder systems and never leave we already see this to some extent imo low sec needs to be opened up a bit we need newly found systems or new gates added to make roaming a bit more enticing to various areas i also think high sec cearbears have it far too easy and the risk vs reward just is not there to get them to want to adventure out into low seci wont say that all level 4s should be moved to low sec but i do think all high ranking agents should be moved to low sec i say any agent that is quality 10 and down should be in high sec any agent that is quality 11 and up should be in low sec this means any agent from level 1 through 4 that is above quality 10 should be in low sec the reason for this is it would add more risk for the reward and it would entice younger players to take a stab a pvp sooner than they might generally do risk vs reward remember that folksminers should also get more reward from low sec but im not sure how to do it with out affecting the whole eve mineral basket possibly give them faster laser cycle times because of such and such reason that could be worked into a story this would give miners a reason to come into low sec to mine they would earn more because they are mining more with the faster cycle times in low sec something like this likely wouldnt affect the mineral basket much but would give the reward that is needed to get them into low sec once again risk vs rewardif you notice none of my ideas are about things for pirates because having more targets in low sec is reward enough for real pirates we dont need systems or upgrades we need people in spacecontinued
continuedthe one area i would like to see changed is how pirates react with fw members lets face it most pirates are at a very big disadvantage to the blobs the militias can muster up at the drop of a hat much less we have to fight them under gate guns causing us to have to fly heavy or with lots of logistics i dont think gate guns should go away as there should be risk to us pirate types however i do think ccp should think about no gate guns if we the target is in fw we have fw guys whom fight each other day in and out on gates and stations they fight on gates and stations that are owned by their various empires yet the gates dont attack the guys from the other side so why should they attack piratesi completely agree with having gate guns there to hinder attacks on civilian non militia members however militia members are in low sec in most cases to pvp they accept the risks of low sec and come there for the action why not allow us pirate types the ability to fight them unmolested from gate guns for a short amount of time it would be nice to be able to not have to fly a bc and above or have logistics in every gang because we cant fight on gates with out itagain im not saying no gate guns but rather let us get involved in fights on gates with militia members with out having to fly bss  bcs or hacs all the timeto add to this i will say i really do not like gate extended gate camps it think its a lame form of lazy pvp when you do nothing but sit on a high traffic gate ganking peopleperhaps having the gate guns do more dps if the same ships are on the gates for an extended amount of time im not sure how this would work though because most likely certain groups would just blob up even more to tank the gunsi do think it would be nice to fight the fw guys in small faster ships but also do something to hinder the 237 gate camping types
agree with everything you are saying m8 the main issue with lowsec is the lack of people in it and ccp should try to find solutions to the lowsec problem from that vantage pointbs rats were a good start did it change much probably not but i am certain it had a little impact on trying to get new players into lowsec eg a new player will do a lvl 1 mission and get about lets say 50k isk reward for it if he goes to lowsec and kills a 500k bs rat he will save a lot of time in terms of gaining capital initially however for more advanced players ratting in lowsec is not viable atm i am not saying lowsec should have 00 spawns but spawns that are closer to 00 qualitylowsec is supposed to be a stepping stone for 00 as well as a place to live and make some kind of a living for people if they choose to do so at the moment it isnt doing either of those things in a good way either risks are too low eg fw missions where you only have to kill 1 npc in most missions or the risk vs reward is just not worth it in the first place
i like a lot of the ideas and i would love to fight more pirates pirate wars sounds hell interesting
those who whine about gatecamping obviously have absolutely no idea how inherently risky it is as the united lol demonstrate on a daily basiscamping a gate 237 only makes you a big fat target 237as for the rest of the ideas some are meh but im supporting just because lowsec needs some real boost
supported idea
i think that the idea that it is a stepping stone to 00 is a perception that has lead low sec into its current state regardless of their original intentions or of how it is commonly viewed lowsec has moved beyond that and needs to be analyzed with what is actually happening there rather then what they thought would happen first off the reality is it doesnUFFFDt work that way the stepping stone into 00 is to go to 00 second as it stands there are three distinct areas of space with a quasi fourth high sec low sec 00 and maybe wormholes they share similarities but for the most part are distinct in and of themselves and dont follow a progressively graduated curve in other words there is no curve players can climb going up from high sec at the low to 00 at the climax each area of space needs to be treated on its own unless ccp manages to shoehorn in some sort of progressive mechanic ramping up to 00 i doubt they could manage it and even if it were possible the game resultant would probably not be the game we all know and love itd be like wow insteadall this is to say that lowsec requires its own treatments and focus regardless of 00 or highsec from its current state of being it would seem to me that ccp hasnUFFFDt arrived there yet they will though i think as the game evolves further i just wish it was sooner rather then later
actually due to gate guns lowsec requires far more sp than 00
indeed and there are the security hits and the timers and the lack of bubbles and the lack of bombs and whatever else im missing they really are two very distinct and separate areas as much as high sec is different from either of them
why not
would be really helpful
really annoying to have a station bookmarked and you cant align to the bm
i wholeheartedly support it so tired of the ambient sounds drowning out everything else or just never ending station ambient sounds while in space etc or my artillery falling silent in the middle of a fight its sad but a very common statement from my friends who play eve is eve has sound because they play with it off rather than deal with it
i support this dg
boooo nay sayers
suppoarted good idea
i support this threadit is made out of pure win
it depends on how the hdr shaders were programmed and which card you have older nvidia cards actually have better support for hdr antialiasing than older ati cards possibly as nvidia used to have better drivers for all their cardstamber

pleeease
being a big pc shooter fan i fully support this
the basic battle recorder doesnt need muchjust recording the script what allows to edit that with a camera tool and client playbackexport to avi uncompressed or as a pic sequence with a separate audio file periodthe top future feature could be a postrenderer for movies in breathtaking cinematics quality with advanced shader effects and visual effects superhires textures and incredible model detailsthe usual ccp promovideos show that there must still existing some kind of a recorder tool
yup they have a similar dev tool alreadyread the csm4 minutes for more infomation this thread and others of the same similar topic were put forward recently for ccp to have a look attamber
grwat idea
from
edit already posted and supported tbh this would save me about a year worth  render time making the video im working on id just need to figure out how to manually script the ships and battles tamber
on one hand i love watching eve movies and a battle recorder would allow much improved presentationon the other i cant help thinking that this would have the potential to be seriously exploited in the same way that bacon used the logserver information
cash shouldnt really be an option they should leave the same way they came in look at it like anything else in this game investing in anything is a gamble did the people who originally recieved them pay anything for them i honestly dont know because i dont think i was around then eve is a game of chances just like undocking when the time comes devblog the time and date itll happen then at that time they become max run bpcs problem solved if you bought em from someone else that person made a hefty profit and the buyer made a bad investment im sure they made a nice profit while they had it anyway if the person who received them never sold them it never really benefitted anyone but that person anyway and no harm done
1 they were brought with rp everything you had with the agent the moment you accepted the offer at the time of the first seeding datacores were not an option they were introduced 2 year later so training those skill was a hit or miss proposition2 can i turn all your bpo to max run bpc can i turn your ships to a version that will last 100 undocking that is what you are suggesting
1 then pay the owner in rp as repayment paying out what people pay for the item isnt solid value if someone paid an amount more than it was worth to have it that shouldnt give them the right to claim what they paid 2 can i turn all your bpo to max run bpc sure go ahead lol the undocking part of your post is nonsense tbh these itemsfor isk value though and though there isnt one i used the armageddon and redeemer for an example 596250000 isk for a geddon bpo geddons go for around 45mil or so well say the avg is 45mil 59625000045000000 13251325x695000000is random current price of a redeemer 9208750000bpo owner can be awarded just over 9bil if they owned the redeemer bpo this is an example so dont get your panties in a wad about a redeemer bpo people who invested in more valuable items will get a substantial payback but not near what they did pay for it will people get screwed sure its eve get over it it will not break the bank of those who own them if they paid a huge sum already if investors get ed talk to those people who invested in enron and borrow a tissue these bpos shouldnt be in the game unless everyone can be able to get their own for the trolls to come kleenex fly safe
who cares about their loss  come on every change in eve affects people and many of us lost isk due to changes many times why should they be exceptioned from this why should keep items in for some privileged elit who were lucky when these bpos were shared also bpos effect markets maybe not the modulesbut shipsammos definitely is that right  i dont think so  if they want to make money they should be join the inventors ranks or something else like the rest of us
do you have any clue about how much value you are speaking offjust as an example cap recharger ii bpos sell for 7080bn for easier math lets say plexes are 250m for 15 we are talking about 42004800sabre bpo was 50bn hulk over 100bnwhen ccp wanted to reduce the cost of motherships to like 6bn they were already thinking on how to reimburse the owners for the loss in value and that was just a price reduction of 910bnsome people worked really hard to actually buy their bposand the hulk bpo is actually funny only 11 of the hulks come from bpos so 89 are build by happy inventor seems like the market is finebut of course whining about i dont have a t2 bpo so others shouldnt have either is so much easier than actually doing research and producing the right things
maybe that 7080bill is overpriced  but still who cares i dont they made their choices when bought the bpojust like that bad investment so they should get special treatment just because they are t2 bpo ownersalso this math about isk is against eula you cant trade isk to realmoney legallyso for hulk it is 11 then what does it somehow proove that t2 bpos are fine then no absolutly nott2 bpos are a bad game design they should gone just like the seed of themthere are these items which are unavailable for newcommers to eve just because they werent playing when bpos were seeded only possible way to get them is to buy them from their current owners willing to sell them at a very overpriced rateoh if ccp thinks they should get reimbuse then do so but still they should remove them from game
how is a t2 bpo unavailable to you you can buy them will it cost you lots of money sureyou think it is too much money you dont want it enough it is easy enough to earn 50100bn with invention in a year and buy yourself a t2 bpohell there are some nice t2 missile bpos for sale atm that go below 5bn buyoutwas the idea bad to introduce them through a lottery style mostlikely even without the t20 thingie do we need more t2 bpos no but all that doesnt mean you should rip them out of the game either they are not game breaking eitheri just wonder naomi  do you actually do t2 production
both thing have exactly the same sense or better lack of it of your proposal turning a permanent item into a limited use one i would prefer to see my bpo turned to an unusable but collection worthy framed t2 bpo to hung in my room when incarna become active that have it turned to a consumable with a limited number of uses you find turning your ship to a item with a finite number of uses nonsense but it is exactly what you are suggesting for the bpo
venkul you truly do not know what you mean according to you if you undock you automatically lose a ship not just the chance thereof everyone undocks not just me and a select fewdarius all t2 bpos arent available for sale so how are all of them available for me to buy any one of them i want i have no chance to buy a particular one i may want which makes the t2 bpo control monopolizing and unfair
the broken part is not that they exist and give advantage over invention the broken part is they cant be taken by force  assuming owner has half brain and farms it at station 
leaving out bpos that werent seeded marauders eaf i am sure if you wave with enough money you will find someone who will sell you that seeded bpo
im a bit bored so will join inactually wasnt invention was brought in to circumvent bpo holders who were being pilloried for price fixing re sellers and critical supply shortages  were not to blame at all of course so what you are implying there is that the lowest priced t2 item in any station is made from a bpo and is not invented wow never knew that  care to back it up with some dataand i would say your tens of hundreds of would be inventors would blame lack of lab slot availability than prices at this point in timeagree with you on the inconsistency part however were not the t2 bpos especially ships material requirements significantly changed recently due to the failure of alchemy and rare moon shortagehere are some approximate figures for a well researched hac bpo no its not mine wish it was thoughbasing purely on buy order prices  after all you want it to sell immediatelynot going anywhere near data core prices etc how you get them  value them is up to youaverage buy order price 100mcost to build  not including base ship 65m 27m on plates 17m on microprocessors profit around 30m  taxes and ship taken into accounttime it takes in station to build 125 days approx so lets say 6 a weekthus 67 of 30m  25m a day not reallythus at a me 4 bpc 50 waste 975m yes at that me you are not going to compete  however you would not build a battleship at me0 either and expect to be profitable hence the use of decryptors smaller items sell very well  as long as you dont do the hub routesmost older players are lazy and dont want to travel 10 jumps to save a few k iski myself invent  lab slots permitting and where the average is around 600k i sell mine for 900k easily allowing decryptors to become more readily available would be nice thoughim sorry i cannot support the motion0bi
no not at allleave the choice to everyone they dont do any harm at all buy a t2 bpo and compete with inventors if you want to or buy and research its t1 equivalent do the copies and the research jobs if you want tobut please do us a favour and use only npc facilities when inventing 
bumping back to the first page
are you guys honestly complaining that you might get scammed over damaged items are you freaking kidding me as long as there is a thing that lets you know damaged status of the items before accepting the contract you would have no one to blame but yourself all you are doing at this point is arguing that amarr pilots should have much harder logistical lives than everyone elseoh look you had scorch l in your battleship whooops cant contract it to your carrier alt oh look you had in mf in your crusader whoops cant contract it to your carrier alt oh look your hauler had some ammo in it whoops cant contract it to your hauler alt give me a ing break  my job in this isnt to point out and do all the design work for ccp my job in this thread is to point out an issue you should be able to contract damaged items if that means that there has to be some popup warning you about the items that are damaged or that theres some sort of column in the contract screen simply isnt my problem ccp is more than capable of handling the particulars of fixing the problemliang
yes can be most annoying
this has needed a fix for so bloody long
yeah nothing more annoying than having a used set of crystals in the cargo of a amarr ship in 00 even more so if the said ship is in lost station as you cant contract it without repackaging and destroying rigs to get rid of the damaged crystals another option would be to have an option when creating the contract to remove the damaged items from the shipcontainer be it crystals drones or mods
i second this guys ideayour contract for armageddon contains 1 unit of scorch l and 2 hammerhead i that has been damaged this item has been removed to your hangar
actually local is very much an intel toolin addition to sorting an option to switch profile icon off should be added to reduce the vertical space taken by 50
as long as local exists it should have a sensible interface so sure if ccp intends to remove local or change it in some way this wouldnt be needed but as it stands theres no reason that ccp should specifically avoid giving it a sensible interface local as it stands is an intel tool whether you like it or not until that changes this has my support
while this will not completely stop the hackers it should dramatically decrease the number of cases and the severity of the loss
added some more details to the original proposalhope this is still in time with regards to the next csm meeting
abyss wyrm i absolutely agree i actually have sent them a letter the quality of russian translation is absolutely terrible i am a native speaking russian and i play the game in english and imao we should translate the names of items for those that do not know english but give original names in english in brackets same probably should be applied to every language
edit to support opwhat would be nice is an interface that pops up when trying to create a new thread that is similar to the knowledge base petition or bug submission tool it should force you to search for your topic prior to allowing you to post a new topic then there would be about 10 threads started a day at best and those wouldnt be a continuous rehash of the same old beaten to death crap from every lazy noob to find the assembly hall
rewritten posti believe the problem people are having here is a problem with the agile scrum process itselfthe system isnt perfect and there are tradeoffs in any methodology with rebalancing finishing of existing expansions and factionwar in general coming well behind 00 and bug chasing and with no permanent product owner of factionwar the priorities combine to leave users of fw left out in the cold without a scrum and to our best reckoning without any staff at all assignedis it possible that each expansion needs its own product owner that then stays with it and communicates with the publicit is meant to be user driven right
ccp need to either fix fw or end itits as simple as that
decided to support this after all
rentable event arena systemsthe ability to rent out a single dedicated systems for events with no security status and thus no security standing loss for pvp events with functions to restrict people able to enter depending on user preset choices and toggles ie their name corp ships type and ship fittings skill level whether theyve paid a fee whether theyve supplied an item etcthis may sound like a lot of work but the some of the mechanics are already ingame think of acceleration gates and wormhole restrictions and the alliance tournament  entrances to these areas would need to have multiple entrances and exits either using wormholes or multiple acceleration gates to enable different sec statusd pilots entry other stuffnew prize contract systemsystem data exportcharge for the systems isk sinkive never play wow and i dont caremoar tournamentsif youve ever run a tournament deathrace mass melee or whatever with pilots from multiple alliances and corps youll know how much of a headache it can be having a system in place such as this could only enable moar fun getting more than 10 people to flip cans is a logistical nightmare even with veteran playerstamber

arenas are dumb and go against eve ideology
this
not supportedi think things like this should be left in the hands of players if you want an arena claim a wormhole for a day and bring enough back up to run an event or do it with referee and can fishing in highsec same thing if you want to run races set up a course with cans and have monitors and judges or whateverthe point is the mechanics exist that would allow players to mange this sort of thing for themselves already and i think it ought to be left with them what to do with the sandbox
now that poses are not longer used to determine sovereignty it would be nice to allow players to maintain ownership of their pos if they change corps rather than having to disassemble and then reanchor it after joining the new corpone possible option would be to allow the lauch for corp option to make the pos function as it currently does and allow the launch for self option to allow the launching player to maintain ownership of the pos even if they change corps
noplayers in npc corps do not need to be able to own pos facilities  this would render them untouchable even by wardec in high security space
hell noposs require a player owned corporation to be deployedno exceptionsno i dont give a crap what you said i know what your going after and your not going to get it
this plus a bonus to the cpu usage of armor repair modules on ships that are meant to be active tanked would be great currently these ships are inferior to buffer tanked ships for everything except mission running
yes please

good idea
well wormholes work at 5km so perhaps its a non issueme hopes
i suggest making the distance be 5km the same as the jump range for wormholes
good idea
as amusing as the bumping chain reactions are it is unpleasant for the titan to get bumped and equally annoying to be bumped by the bumped titan especially when it happens just before the bridge goes up support for this
cannot allow to disapear
if it were an outright whine youd have a point but it isnt so you dont
i have over 400 kills in the last few months alone from a stealth bomber im not bragging but i love covops ships i love everything cloakythat being said youre right thousands say theyre fine yet tens of thousands say they need a counternobody is looking to nerf cloaks people just want those that are cloaking to remain active or be huntedtheres a huge difference
thats a nice summary indeed
and thats what im opposed to in deep space deep 00 or wspace the cloak is often the only dock available pilots who fly far often dont have the luxury of being able to dock up when its time to go make lunch or somethingsafe spot  cloak  explorers dock im absolutely willing to accept afk cloakers to keep this functionality in the game remember one of the prime advantages of eve over other games for players with familiesjobsbusy lives is the ability to walk away from the game and deal with life cloaking up just like docking is a part of that
ctrlqwhen rl calls log offthe cloak is not the games please hold button
what buffi dont agree they need a nerf though
do you know about the aggression mechanicsyou cant simply ctrlq if you have been in a fight within the last 15 mins because you will emergency warp and stay visible in space until the end of those 15 mins during which time anyone fitted with a combat probes will find you and kill youhardly fairas to probing out ships exclude covert ops cloaked ships and i might agree the issue with being able to probe out covert ops is that it would make it far too safe to sit gangs at snipe spots on gates etc how op is it to be able to ping a covert ops ship trying to get a drop on your gang yes you can probe and warp a gang to result but without a covert ops on grid getting the correct alignment to avoid bubbles etc you will fail hardit is not a simple matter
nope never pvpd in my life well on this character its truebut seriously i know my point was that the cloak isnt for that otherwise every ship should have one i mean its only far to have something to avoid the point of a gcc or agression timeri agree completely
did anyone not use predomi dd as a decloaking device bomber campin yo outpost warp titans on grid and double dd cloaker wakes up in a pod if a modified superweapon was given to titans second module but just like now cant fit both at once for gridwide and only gridwide it would be fair dominion got rid of the only truly viable decloaking mechanicedit 11 yes this was done and yes it often killed friendlies
in older dumps at least one could find decloaking devices that looked pretty similar to a traditional sb but their description told the purpose of these modules would be to decloak ships within the range of these modules i never saw them becoming 0ed state published but as i started with cold war these might have been in existance earlierid prefer a combination of both ideas  reintroducing such decloaking modules that would also decloak a covert cloaked ship  maybe chance based  plus sized regular cloak modules that would allow to survive the agression time but not for hours of afking eating cap sounds nice to meadditionally i never understood why cloaks are high slot modules they dont require that much cap but loads of cpu instead compared to other modules i would have expected cloaaks to be midslot ones
its not a major problem but it would be much easier if i could strip the modules from a ship that i am not onboard instead of swapping ships and waiting for session timer to finish just to change back it would save time and annoyances of swapping to rigged ships just to remove the modulesi can see it being useful in getting the modules from a rigged ship that i cant fly let say i get a rigged megathron from a contract coming equipped with armor repair modules and hardeners problem is that i fly amarr ships and i cant fly a megathron for a while not to mention its rigged therefore i cant get the modules off the ship that i want to use for my armageddon without repackaging the ships and destroying the rigs or waiting a for a while just to board the shipbasically all you would have to do is right click on the ship in your hangar and select the new option to strip modules from ship the modules would be removed from the ship and be put into your item hangar allowing you to refit your current ship with the modules you needi think this would save a lot of hassle for all eve players
and of course i support my idea
there is a way to do this repackage a fitted ship but it also means losing any rigs or insurance it has not a bad idea tbh
why not take this a step further and allow us to refit ships while not being in the ship as well but regardless supported
supported
yeah i wouldnt mind having this
supported on low priority to me itd be a matter of convenience  scotty is annoying enough 
the best reasoning ive seen  by order of the sheepleplus we could spend hours pointlessly tweaking our color schemes when were too chikken to leave our comfy zones in hisec stationsbut excellent reasoning with a hint of sage
although not an original thread the 4th rig idea is and i like excpt the bonusesmost of the lahg created from something like this would be client side so if you or your pc counldnt handle the lahg you could always turn it off  and to lower the chances of coming across a whole fleet of custom colours you could make them bloody expensive to buy so that only the elite could afford them tamber
i can actually recall a couple mmos that failed in part because everyone looked pretty much the sameits kinda boring to go out in a fleet and see 50 frigates all alike sue me i used to be in eve uniit would be kinda interesting to have simple decals tooin a fleet  all ddred ecmblue tacklegreensls have 1 stripewcs have 2 stripesfcs are white with 3 stripesactually your uuber tank is white the real fc is in an inconspicuous blackasnight shuttle
thread cleaned up a bit
good idea
supported
lag i dont give a  for large fleet combat it really sucksthis idea rocks
what about creating launch drone group x shortcuts that way you define your groups the way you want and bind the launching of those groups separately there would need to be a way to assign your groups to one of idk five group numbers so they could be bound it wouldnt be perfect but it would be better than being forced to use the drone window
my domi got different sets than my raven or my sacri
yeah i thought about that too lets say that instead of having arbitrary groups we have a set number like 5 or 10 and make binds for those maybe drone groups could be saved with a fitting so that you could have different groups for each ship but the binds would still work then its to the pilot to make sure that their group 1 drones are all combat group 2 are all ecm etc again not perfect but better than nothing
keep in mind that ccp did not mention anywhere that they made this change to reduce lag  or if the change even affects lag at all
problemthe prices of mins are heavily influenced by mission runners so that mining ist going to be nonsense for the relation of isk per hour proposalremove reprocessing or nerv reprocessing so that the total output of minerals from mission runners is lower then 10 of the total marked
gives said poster the idiot of the day awardif your going to request removal of reprocessing then i request that anyone who attacks anyone in high sec without wardec be forced to buy there ships and products in low secits only fair  o pand if you believe that i got a bridge for sale
reprocessing is ok i believe the problem might be that huge amount of tech 1 loot from those missions
yes but if you remove most parts of the t1 loot then the t2 prices will be going exponentially upwards
how UFFFDbout make it cost money to reprocesses instead how much sense does it make that a station will break down module into its component parts strip the unsalvageable material away and then melt or process the rest into base materials which one assumes must cost something all for basically free  i believe they tax some materials but thatUFFFDs kind of dumb and its really minor in comparisonanyways nerfing the reprocessing amount or nerfing the drop rate is a band aid solution at best ubalancing at worst and ultimately pointless its a problem that needs to be approached with far more care then just omg eww hit with a hammer and burn it in holy firenot supported
yes lets get everyone to raise the prices of goods to make up for the cost of reprocessing real smart reaaaaly smart
i wish i could remove your posting
right cuase i was really trying to fix the whole problem with one line rather then just tossing in an idea perhaps you missed the part where i said that the problem requires a little more care and thought then that maybe you should take the sunglasses off next timeit would also lead to an increase in the price of minerals too making it good for miners you might note that the stuff bought for reprocessing schemes would have to raise their prices but that the modules actually used by players would remain only marginally affected because the price for them is set by drop rate and demand but then again your one line argument is fairly pointless so theres not much point in going into it

cons  turning an interesting concept like smugling in to npc courier missions not saying it doesnt make for a nice addition to the current mission selection but i hope smuggling doesnt get reduced to this im not too happy about an idea to make new sets lol blueprints to make one small feature in the game less likely to ruin existing item balance and make it less overpowered way to get faction itemspros  a new mission type is always welcome and making it lowsec only is a nice idea and it doesnt feel forced like many other boost lowsec ideas you know how to bumb a thread in style
your actually falling for this tripe hersch oosurely you jesti remember my maelstroms tank improving as i trained up tsm tsm helps i dont get where peopel are getting the idea it hurtsand who the hell gives a crap at 25 shields if your shield tanking its a waste of time to fret as your likely dead anywayarmor tankers whoop ti doo your an armor tankerwho cares about shields
please continue to argue that taking armourstructure damage improves your tanking ability in fact i recommend that all you shield tankers leave it at level 1
you mean 4 we love our invul ii p
5 even 8o
after warhead upgrades 5 is done
well it sounds plausible that if instead of your shields taking damage your armour does in that way not lowering your shield and keeping your recharge up
change it to cpu reduction for shield modules even if only for hardeners or boostersboost amps
scimis rep my hacs shield even at 15 no reason to require for it to add armor rep or hull rep to keep me alivenot supported
right now the only useful application of this skill is a prerequisite for shield hardeners the skills bonus is pointless because by the time your shields are under 25 your tank is broken active tanks could make iti like the idea of it increasing the max recharge window
that is exactly the point it does not make any difference wether the skill hurts your ship or actually improve it does not matter difference is probably so minisque it is not noticeable which is not right as it should be making a difference so lets make it usefull the fact is armor tanker does not give a crap about shields and for shield tanker if you are below 20 shield youre are probably already dead it wount make more then half a percent difference
reread what the skill book saysyou people are making me shake my head is this really our generation people who make assumptions and conclude before thinking things throughyes it might be a bit weak for a skill that doesnt achieve much guess what there are tons that do thatbut its not useless thats for sureim done with this farce of a thread oey do what you will buff it but dont bloody nerf it
i think it is sort of silly for it to be at 25 and below i mean at that point a shield tank is dead anyway either youve capped out or you cant active tank to keep up or your passive tank just failed anyway you look at it if your shield tank has fallen to under 25 shields youre going to die in the next few secondsso i would suggest making the magic number start at 4050 or something unless there was some other boost to shield tanking the came along with it it would just become a required skill in a different wayi will support that there has to be a better use for the skill though but the ops suggestion is fairly crazy i have max shield skills and have enjoyed the wonder than is a passive tank throwing a 50 recharge bonus as suggested by the op would make heavy passive shield tanks truly invincible rather than just a hard tank to break vultures roll with around 600700 hps at peak recharge 677 hps for mine the ops suggestion would bring that to over 1000 hps as amusing as that might be it would also be horribly unbalanced
the 25 are well worth ita friend of mine got below 20 in his drake and could happily continue tanking with keeping range and he didnt get armor dmg thanks to the skill

just a quick onescan probes are not an overview filter optionthis creates a situation where people scanning specifically for scan probes are instead getting a large resultset of all objects when all they want is a few itemsadding the scan probe option should slightly reduce server load in this area
id never thought about it before but that would be a really neat effectalso missiles still play an explosion effect on their target ship even after theyve burned out
ccp wont do it as anyone who uses blasters would start seeing how much the damn things miss p200 supported though  it cheapens the game visuals enormously and since thats just about the only thing done right
as mr spaz out over there forgot to mention to the crowd with pitchforks1 each shot has to be rendereddrawnand graphically displayed2 so for every miss you must have the aboveconclusion your asking ccp to put alot of effort into a miss shot where its just too easy to have it do the same ol shot even if its not needing to be drawn the calculations invovled in 3d space are likely going to cause a migraine who would thunk it a miss harder to calculate than a hit x o  chaos theory anyonehonestly i really fail to see the importance yes its cool yes it would make things nicebut i can think of about 100 other items far more earth shattering then thisid sooner ask ccp to fix open shelled errors on various ships such as the maelstrom and the typhoon and otherslike thats gonna happenso yes you may resume your emorant atwilllota good it will do

players can thru sisi testing and feedback threads the csm is just another layer in that systema lot can change in one year let alone 2 and if a candidate gets elected more than twice in a row it would be unlikely to be because of a powerblock and more likely to be simply because he was a competent representativewe discussed this at length and its difficult to come up with solutions there as its simply human nature to clutter up in groups rather than fight outnumbered game mechanics like treaties could however support a more dynamic systemthey cant anyway firing dd interrupts warp and disallows it for 30sno were not all that stupid to get caught the point is that that may be achieved while causing less grief to players with a lower timer there is nothing magical about 5 minutes that scares of spammers 12 mins might well have the exact same effects
excellent hybrids need some love not a huge boost just a little tweaking so blasters can more reliably engage in their size class and rails can more usefully leverage their range
yeah i wasnt really happy how this was worded in the minutes it happened as td said
sorry if i am not jumping for joy over treaties as a solution to power block issue in 00 i remember before dominion was released being excited about the idea of power blocks being done for and there be massive battles all over 00 that were not the whole ultra mega team a vs ultra mega team b and those two teams being the only teams in 00what did we get same damn thing if not worse csm was heavily involved in dominion too as was totted by both csm and ccp is this the part where we get to thank csm for dominionthe only time one of these power blocks goes down is when someone pulls the plug and they are just replaced by yet another power blockso good luck with your treaties as a solution looks like you will have plenty of time do work on that now totalitarian sokrateszme salutes
the third csm pointed out some very clear things to ccp regarding what they wanted to see in domionion the fact that many of the features intended to address their concerns never made it into the release was one of if not the most hot button issue of the weekend treaties were identified as probably the most meaningful widesweeping change that would actually do most of what dominion was supposed to do but as the minutes mention other things were discussed such as the size of ihubs access points to 00 the presence of undersized rats in 00 and a reductionincrease in station services hpresists with the aim at making them more attackable and repairable by small groups
as a mission runner the only thing that will get me to 0 is missions and i was hoping the new infrastructure upgrades would allow a mission mechanic to be developed therenull sec ratting just doesnt interest me at all but being able to do what i like and support a 0 alliance would have me down there before the end of the week if my corp wouldnt sign a treaty to get access then i wouldnt be in my corp much longer i imagine a lot of mission runners would go as well but as it sits now we either get ganked in low sec trying or stay in high secone can hope for changes in the future
i must say im rather happy with the summits results although there where some things i disagree with there where major strides made in terms of csms political weight and ccp and csm communication back and forth and to the playerbase thats something ive been hoping to see
and what did you discuss that would allow alliances to realistically go into 00 and claim sov without having to blue one of the power blocks
you need to vote someone into the csm that thinks about these things right now unless your part of one of the major power blocks your voice will never be heard better luck next time
not everyone on the csm is from a major power bloc in fact i think when the voting ended only four of the nine full councillors were since then goons have fallen whilst another csm member has put an alt into a sov holding allianceyou would have a point if you were talking about pvp vs carebear but the bogeyman large power bloc taking over the csm claims are a bit overblown
you enjoy your treaties feature that is nothing more than a tool to manage pets and does jack for opening the door for alliances to be part of 00 without being part of a power block
yes a lot can change in a year note that the second term will start after 1 year not 2 that is exactly why it is not a good idea to have you pople locked in the seat for a yearhaving no industrial representative for 6 month is bad for lacking it for a year is several order of magnitude worse having a bunch of people that say it is not in my election program i dont care for this stuff dont get me full of hope for the future months even less if you guys get a change in rules for this csm and get to stay for a year so far i have seen 2 threads about industrial stuff by csm members and it was pretty evident they dont know how the industrial part of eve workgems like this one moving datacore production to nullsec was identified as a possible means to give players incentives to operate there show that you guys have no idea of the effects of a change like this would have on invention tossing a suggestion like that in the middle of the meeting without any discussion in the assembly hall the market forum or the science and industry forum show a total disregard for the opinions of the players and a lack of comprehension of the probable consequences
that was not ours that was ccps and they had put quite a bit of thought in itand if you want more industrial reps on the csm run yourself and mobilise your peers
i read the meeting minutes from iceland and found this statementthe csm would not like to see very large fleet fights discouraged through game designbut you acknowledge and experience all day the lag that affects those large fleet engagements i see a bit of contraddiction between these two thingsobvious thingswhile it is right that when people learn about eve they are usually very impressed by the size of engagements its true as well that many of us were disappointed when we doscovered how bad our game experience can be made because of lag and connected issue such as grid loading issues desync and so on but its obvious that if you and ccp dont put in place a gameplay mechanic that encourages smaller fights over bigger ones people will always pack themselves in the smallest area possible whyi think you know that focus fire is the best tactic to use in eve everybody uses it when they call primaries it gives you the fastest way to kill enemy forces and thus to take out enemy dps this is the mother of all the issues with server performance if you improve server performance you just push forward the soft limit on local population that is posed by lag that is this limit will be always reached and we will always have lagged fights just more bigger ones that is more epic onesso if you dont put in place a gameplay mechanic that help the server in splitting the load of a fight on different another statement of yours actually the completion of the phrase abovebut feels there is a need for a fair distribution of lag caused by grids not loadingpersonally i dont like it i dont want lag at all but i want epic fights ad youmy considerationshow many people must be in a fight for it to be considered epic 500 people are enoughand do you think they must be in the same systemif your answers to the two question above were both yes you will never have lagless engagements with current server tecnology but think of how many 500 ships are with all their drones i bet you cannot distinguish between 500 and 5000 if you are between them i have been on many demonstrations and i can guarantee you that wheter you are between 500 or 5000 people you cannot tell the difference that is to say that the epicness of a fight will not be ruined if a fight only of 500 ships while server performance willso i ask you why dont you encourage ccp to create a conquest mechanic that encourages people to split their forces on many solarsistemthis will solve lag in fleet fights once for allif you dont discourage bigger monolithic fights lag will always be back these are my thoughts please tell me if and why you disagree

i have had a clarification from ccp xhagen and he has updated the wikiit is 25 of the participants in the last election not 5 of the total eligible voters as was left on the wiki this was changed by csm1 because 5 of the total eligible voters would be around 16000 while 25 of the actual voters is more like 5300we can debate on the likelyhood of a single issue gaining that level of support which is why the best route and most likely to get supported during the meetings is to speak to the most relevant csm rep or any that supported the idea in the assembly hall and get them to raise iti hope that clarifies things even if it probably isnt the answer you were looking for

i like the concept of attrition warfare but this really doesnt support small gang warfare so much as gank the carebearsedit unless people actually defend their carebearsor the bears reship and fight the insurgentsidea has potential
yeah the implicit idea was that the alliance would have to protect its industrialists to keep their high indices a they can defend themselves stance wouldnt be positive for them as it directly influences the security of the system if all the industrialists just pack up and leave for a safer area
sounds like a good idea
link the hub index strength to the reinforce timers the weaker the index the more variable the timeredit could also vary the ihub hitbpoints as well
i like this idea
yeah i like it
the ones worth deccing are the 8 month to 15 year people who think they know how to pvp and fly really nice ships or deccing a 300 man alliance that has a nice pos and wont come to defend itdeccing people who can only fly frigates and cruisers is just a waste of ammo still war decs are fine the way they are
argumentum ad populumindustrialist corps do war dec competitors industrialist corps do put contracts out on competitors when an industrial corp gets large enough requiring the ability to stave off attacks from competitors and high sec pvp corps they attract the attention of allianceswhat you fail to realize is the biggest industrial corps are in null sec alliances where do you think they get all the minerals to build outposts titans super caps and replace all those capital ships they lose they dont buy them from dinky high sec industrial corps thats for sureshort of a few months when i joined two consecutive pirate corps after getting my first industrial corp bulldozed ive been in industrial corps the entire 4 years ive played evethe current corp cranks out a few dozen bssbcs a day and caps are built on a regular basis why can we do this we also have a group of rabid pvpers in the corp who keep systems we mine clear and keep our freighters safeas to ganking freighters straw man argument i was showing you why pvp corps would attack an industrial corp without a contract from another industrial when you kill a loaded freighter you pull in a mountain of isk you can make money with pvp that is the pointand i do know how much it takes to gank a freighter in high sec the last time i was in on one we attacked it with 19 bss tier 12 fully fit each lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 1030m each from the difference between insurance payout and fittings each person received about 110m isk from the loot that was dropped and sold that is a healthy profit for a few hours of grinding sec status and about an hour spent hunting a worthwhile target not including the income from grinding sec status belts are less static than they used to be as are plexes you really dont have the systems that are endallbeall sources for industrialists as such a high sec industrialist corp should easily be able to pick up and move where the war dec becomes pointless you have 24 hours notice for crying out loudi will ignore your ad hominem arguments
invention was the fix to the t2 bpo problem and its heavily impacted the profitability of most of the old big profit bpos it also killed a significant portion of the cartels that used to existremember 10mill cap recharger 2s anyonet2 bpos are not anywhere near as damaging as they sued to be now that anyone and everyone can invent and the sheer number of rd jobs going on in empire is an indication that a lot of people are either inventing or getting ready toin short the situation isnt broken so no fix is really needed
yes they should of been removed when they stopped the lotterly this clearly gives older players a huge advantage over other players only the people reaping the benefits of this will not support it
half the people i know with t2 bpos are about as old as me 2 years playing and bought their bpos after farming lots and lots of iskthis sort of assumption makes you look stupid i and many others do not have any t2 bpos nor have i partook in invention for quite some time and i still think removing these items is stupid

if you have used factiont2 crystals in your cargo bay such as for example if you have been using scorchin mf you cannot contract that ship because it contains damaged items this is easy to replicate by training small lasers 1 no prerequisites and buying a few imperial navy multifreqs shoot something with them try to contract the ship watch it tell you to  off imagine that its half way across the galaxy and rrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeliang
this is the price you pay for having scorch no but really supportedeand cripes liang could you unbreak the page
this is absolutely essential an drones please i seriously would not give a crap i just need to slap on a hull and armor repper and go afk for 10 minutes nothing more then a minor nuisance
come on now
i had the pleasure of hearing that rant on ventsupported but you should fix that forum breaking rraaagggeee
yes you did then siigari got an earful of it once you went to bedfixed in revision 55382liang
drones too you cant contract that ship because that one hobgoblin is at 95 armor

mag sites need serious boosting in terms of how much isk they drop in 00 and possibly to have more rewarding itemssuch as pirate ships bpcs and faction tower mods bpcs
people often cite this post as a reason to changeremove meta 0 modules drop rate in missions and some of them whant them removed from belt rats tooif you look closely to the data you will notice that loot include morphite so the loot table include t2 items it include reprocessed ships and compression modules too so the data were heavily contaminated even then now time as passed and we had wormholes unholy rage the velspater buff and the 00 upgradesthere are plenty of discussions in the market forum and the science and industry forum about the value of minerals and turning them to isk by self destructing ship that we have just produced and mission running and ratting are often indicated as the culprit of the low value of minerals it can be true or the problem can be another so i vould like to see ccp give some up to date information something like1 a table like the one above for a recent period one cleared of spurious data as much as possible2 how much minerals are mined in high seclow sec00wh or at least the different percentages if ccp feel that knowing the actual quantities could affect the markets 3 some data about the number of ships self destructing to collect insurance i think all those data are needed if we want to help ccp analyze the problem and i really hope ccp has them as they need them to see what is happening in eve
supporting myself
i would like to see this data as well basically id like to see how much of each mineral type is created from each activity as a percentage of the total of mineral production from all activitiesedit for thumb
now with pyerite as only 30 from miners no wonder the miners cant keep upalso insurance is broken also hired economist has no clue about eve economyalso 20 of noxcium and isogen is from miners no wonder losec ores are brokenccp wake up 
i thought eve would support more security features due to the rise of account hacksshameless bumpingsupport for my own idea

you all have good points but nobody has a problem with the alliance tournament and wouldnt everyone like moar events like that it may be run by ccp but its still part of the gametamber
no make ccp do the work for us  we are paying them after all 
go back to wow eve doesnt have instancesplus having one belligerent flip a can isnt that hard
i certainly agree that players in npc corps should never be allowed to have a pos in space obviously the devs would never allow this to happen anyway so that particular point is mooti am suggesting that if a player moves from one player corp to another there should be a way for them to take their pos with them without having to unanchor it and then reanchor it
a pos is and should be a corporate asset why should an individual player be allowed to move them with him
stop making the assumption that poss belong to players and youll get the pictureposs are owned by the corporation whether it be 1 or 1000 member corporation
supported having titan pilots threaten to dd you isnt fun
good idea
ive always been irked by the fact that all turret effects hit their mark graphically even while missing wildly better turret effects that actually include a missed shot effect would be very nice engine trails would be a nice edition as well i especially like the idea of different effects for abmwd
supported  railguns and artillery in particular look terrible blasters look less bad but still crap some of the missile explosion effects are starting to look very datedyou know that way the artillery trail tracks a ship after its fired and follows it around like a laser this also ties in with the other thread requesting missed and glancing shots be rendered correctly
1000please visit your user settings to reenable imagestamber
supporting everything except the explosions on missiles idea because as of now they are accurate dont speak out of your ass about things because contrary to what youve seen in hollywood videos there are no fireballs in space as it is a vacuum and therefor no fire can be made smaller explosions from the air of the ship yes but as big fireballs no

update missles too while you at itthey were the only thing missed by your bloody update 
supported not necessary completely but id like to see it keep a drone bay and bandwidth for a flight of ecm drones
as it stands damage controls take one unit of capacitor every thirty seconds this means that even if one is neuted dry one is likely to still have enough passive regen to run the dc as such theres no real point having it an active module as it cant be overloaded either so i propose that damage controls become a passive mod which might even have the salutary effect of reducing lag
im down though may change game play for those passive tanked drakes sporting the damage controls snicker
i dont see why notalso in before the elite pvpers who think it takes a  ton of skill to press one button before you engage the enemy
i dont see why or why notall of this over 1 unit of capnah not worth the time investmentand there is likely a reason for it
afk hull tank travel fits ftw jk
i like it
not supported for this reason
you just killed the proposal congratulationnot supported for exactly that reason
because if you go afk your armor tank spontaneously combusts what about shield tanks i mean sure why not
not supported if it was a passive module its resistances would be increased by the shieldarmor hardening skills
it isnt done for technical reasons if i recall something to do with how stacking penalties are appliedplus i wont get a laugh when someone i know loses a fight because they forget to flick it on
because making it an exclusion just isnt possible right
so what you are saying is you have no idea what goes into programming those bonuss into the game and how much server load it would cause name one system in that game that is excluded by a skill it would otherwise be directly effected bygoodluck
people die every day because they misclick or forget to click it after a jump if it was made passive then we might as well remove a lowslot from all ships and increase all resistances appropriatelyincrease cap drain by a lot allow it to be overheated and increase benefits like a perpetual creeping repair of hull of it while applying stacking which is currently not the case
nobecause making damage controls a separate group is not possible either right you do realise that shield resistance amplifiers are not affected by this skill because they are a different mod group no making damage control excluded from effect of a singe skill wount skyrocket cpu usage and crash the server
a i never said it would crash the server only increase load by creating its own special group everytime anything new is added it increases load and this change is so tiny and pointless is it worth added load dramatize muchb passive shield hardeners are affected by shield compensation skills by 5 per level and active hardeners are also affected when they are not online by 3 per level the same goes for armor compensation skills
from some old dev and players comments it apparently was meant to be a passive module but there were programming problems i vaguely recall something about it being stackable if passive but i can be wrong a suggestion like this was made a couple of year ago and a dev stated i the thread that the programming hurdle had been resolved to introduce some other module so apparently the use of energy to use the damage control is only a legacy thing something left over from old problems note that the dc is in a category of its own as it is not stacking nerfed and stack with other modules but dont stack with other dc so even if it is not something critical supported
its stacking nerfs are applied to its resistance bonuss when i use it so i am not sure what you are talking about there though you may be right that its already in a catagory of its own since when it isnt on it doesnt seem to get any bonus from the compensation skillsstill stupidly small but saves one click here and there so why not
you running missions increases load on the node you should stop doing that no by the armor skills what you where trying to argue which means they are in a different group which means that creating groups isnt a problem when we whant to which renders your whole talk about extra server load irrelevant quoteyou have no ideahow much server load it would causeas neihter you nor me know wether it is in a group of its own at the moment arguing about it is pointless as less click less server requests  sell lag that benefit would heavylly outweight any load that could appear for extra one database entry please can we stop commenting on how much lag it would cause as only ccp knows and in some cases even they dont how much lag certain features mean especially if you are far from being an expert in that area and damage controls do not suffer from any sort of stacking penalties by the way
as neihter you nor me know wether it is in a group of its own at the moment arguing about it is pointless as less click less server requests  sell lag that benefit would heavylly outweight any load that could appear for extra one database entry please can we stop commenting on how much lag it would cause as only ccp knows and in some cases even they dont how much lag certain features mean especially if you are far from being an expert in that area and damage controls do not suffer from any sort of stacking penalties by the wayit took you 32 minutes after i supported the topic and had already figured out that it probably is a group by itself to broken english your way into a completely illogical argument that i cant even followcongratsone day when you actually work you will understand the importance of fixing the big things in lieu of the little things like this that no one has cared about for all these years until you have made it your personal crusade to have a good idea pushed through the assembly regardless of how small and insignificant it is in the greater scheme of making the game betteri can stop supporting it though if it makes you happy and according to eft they do suffer from stacking penalties

signed pirates need affection too give us some love ccp 
signedgreat idea can be nice to ransom pods at a good price instead of not really knowing you got my vote 
ccp please allow to build on planets in whatm the ihubs give a boost to 00 space but no to wh in wh there is no moonminingso please give the wh citizens the possibilty to build on planetsthanks
nothere is a reason that is not allowedand i suspect such things would require an ihub as thats the reason they where made
same reason as for no wh sovereignty impossible to bring enough firepower in to contestdestroy such structuresperhaps some super fragile versions that do not require hubs but then any roamer with a gun can set you back weeksmonths and that no fun eitheryou chose to live in the wilderness you choes to live without running water
well i have a nice waterplanet  so why i cant use the resource  and now lets talk not about game mechanics
i have just a idea ok if it is planned from ccp that wh citizens cannot build on planets why not include a ship wich can go to the orbit and harvest some resources from the planet  like a rorqual or something like that
what part of ccp says no do you people not understandcant read english
actually drake according to the devblog we will be able to interact with all planets whether that really means all remains to be seen on sisi i suppose
yeah all planets in known space whs isnt included in that to be sure due to the obvious 00 implicationsotherwise its obvious that they will have to open up moon mining and a plethora of other things in whs and that is a can of worms in itself
no you just dont understand actually we had 2 tower in wh of which the distance was only 10ly which is jumpable easly enough but it seems you cna light cyno but just cant jump and about those station we could have them but you could always get but the wh system a cyno to be link and then you can jump a whole fleet with a titan or a cyno a hotdrop on a wh and you get to the next one thats it try to be optimiste and not pessimiste
i think this quote applies to your question ccp whisper  therefore the answer is nobrechan
no no and a thrice time nono hot dropping titans into a wh simple as that its what makes them unique is that excact ability for only the owners of said hole to have capital capabillities so stop being so damn lazy and get an assembly array in there like the rest of us
no you reaslly dont understand what wh space is if you lived there for since it first started then you would know that some the stuf ccp made is great but why you think they keep improving stuff it is because it need to be improved to suit better what it is employed for and if people stop thinking of only 00 and 00 and 00 you would stop having a narrow vision of what is wh and then you would see other stuff than 00
listen well and clear kiddo i lived in wormhole space long enough to know that what your asking for would be great and all but it would screw the balance so far out of wack that it would be a living nightmarein whs we have a level playing field there are rules and guidelines even super alliances are forced to comply with by changing those rules you lose your advantageand as ive said already ccp says no therefore the answer is noquit while your ahead before you embarrass yourselfps the only reason i stopped is i found that 00 was more profitable and easier to cope with in spite of the dangers of hot drops and other 00esqe things
i expect if you keep ignoring what were saying and repeating that we dont understand well probably start supporting your thread
i dont understand
as a long time wh dweller i dont wantneed jump bridges or cynos i dont wantneed the subspace beacons and data network the lack of these are what makes wh space differenthowever there is a pos mod that requires system sov that does not make any sense to me i can build all the carriers dreads and rorquals that i want but i cant online a capital ship maintenance array to hold them what is so special about this mod that it cant be online in wh space isnt it just a big hanger even in 00 why does this mod require sov what am i missing
thats a rational questionrequest to be surethe other complaint is the weakness of reprocessing arrayspersonally id rather see the damn timer go away and leave them at the weak processing power they have now to make up for the timing
wh sovereignty was intentionally left out since it was and still is impossible to contest there is no way to bring needed firepower inwhat do you want it for anyway jumpranges tofrom wh are too long and cynos dont work there as far as i know  something to do with concord beacons or some such come up with some ideas as to how to expand on pos structures or mobile baseship type things instead the audience is far larger down that route
lets say that its modified so you can have sov in wh mine moongoo and all other things that require sov and put jump bridge there time three months they would be all taken by the big megaalliancesdo you really want to lose your wh
the only sov like feature i could see wanting in wh space would be the ability to set up market hubs of some type i could see this simplifying logistics in a way ccp would not like thoughpersonally i rather like the idea of setting up a oh you screwed up and ran out of probes missiles or space to drop your loot stop by one of my convenient market hubs where i will charge exorbitant prices for common goods
so yeah im just getting to the point where i can afford to use these nice little toys and i see they dont behave like i would expect them to behave when it comes to crystalsmining crystals eventually expire and shut down and autoreload a new crystal in its placei assumed that the same would be the case for a rack of beampulse cannonsgranted maybe having them in group mode is not helping either but i was willing to accept the entire rack going off line to reload one crystal and then start firing them againbut instead the whole damn thing shuts down and you cant resume firing because of one cannon not loaded with a crystal in a groupinstead of breaking them out of the group i would have to cycle crystals out to a different group then cycle backfor those who dont know how potentially painful that is switching from gleam to aurora is a bit hazardous solution  when a crystal shatters have the reload mech grab a spare crystal from the cargo bay and allow the pilot to start firing away without cycling out and or breaking the group uppros  less frustration and shouldnt effect balance and allows group firing pew pew sweet actioncons  your frakked if you dont have a spare
bekase improving gameplay is not what ccp pays attention to
proposing the idea of selling multiple goods via shift click and having the option to sell each good individually without having to create a contract or right click and sell item on multiple goods for instance i have 150 things in my items i can select all goods right click and select sell all goodsand i can sell them according to buyers on the market rather then having to right click and sell all 150 things or make a contract
very much it would be desirable to know that my enemy has wasted while i pod him
so anyone who doesnt support changing the hype basically says go away and roll an amarr characterhow about you just stop posting and try to find a reasonable way to fix this shipi dont feel altering the slot layout is such a good plan but i do think the hyperion badly needs fixing i think those fixes are more likely to come from gameplay mechanic changes blaster tracking something to make active armor tanking less crap than altering the ship itself thoughit is however a shining example of how ineffective the whole gallente design philosophy is  whichever moron thought that active tankmwdshort range bad tracking high damage guns was a good idea should be outside washing car windows
sighs k you guys are making this far too complicated will support when you change to this  make new tabs for launchable drones just like folders you can already make i have mine setup as hammers hobs heavys reppers shields and ecm exactly like that have ccp implement launch group alpha or a or one idc then put drones in these folders and have hotkeys for these premade folders put whatever drones you plan on useing in these folders problem solved
supported with the ability to add shortcut keys to certain drone groups as an ishkur pilot its very annoying to have to quit manually flying so that i can recall my warriors and launch my ecm dronesmaybe one could right click a drone group inflight and select an option that says assign shortcut or something like that
1 with a catch right now you only can put a drone in one of your groups so if you want to adapt to your enemy and want to launch eg 2 light 1 med and 2 ecm drones you have to manually select them and launch there should be an extra tab in drone interf

i got my damsel nabbed today in my mission so i had to fail it could this be made illegal or at least let me shoot anyone who enters my mission who isnt in my fleet of course theyd be able to fight back so id have to be careful but the pve crowd is getting tired of our playstyle being ruined by quest item thieves

raising issuesproposals on topics that are still being worked on is rather pointlessadd your concerns in the relevant thread and suggest alternatives the devblog was a courtesycall by ccp to give us a chance to influence the outcome and help with the revamp not a setinstone type of thingnot supporting objection to issue that does not yet exist
not supportedonly on the basis on why would you want to make things more detailed standings wise is silly at the momentmost people set at 1050510 very rarely even in 00 alliances anything in between is used and this is shown graphically in the new ui which i think is the step in the right directionto be honest im not sure why we even need 5 options your either a friendly a neutral or an enemy there really is no in between and to be honest when it comes to it the only things your hear is  are they blue are they red are they neut that is itok perhaps theres the posstation access point but what elsei mean please explain why you would even want more detailed standings
we dont want more detailed standings  we just want the same ones we have now station access fleet access and service tax all tie into standings and as such more standings than just 10 5 5 and 10 are used you may not need them but many others doas for bringing up a proposal to a future issue it is easier to get ccp to change their mind now and not implement a bad change than it is to let them implement a bad change and then get them to change it back i was a csm member for two terms and know that just because something is in the backlog it does not mean it will get done any time soon getting the point accross through the csm as well as the comments thread will show ccp how important it is that they do not screw this up
dont toss ideas around me i tend to tear im up like a rabbid dog i dont got a problem with selling high and buying low but then you get these asshats who suicide gank in the name of a perverse ideology of helping the economy outeither way no foul no harm done just dont touch reprocessing  o p
agreed i tend to think that the problem is more based on the miningindustry side then it is the missioning side in any case
1 buy a new airbus2 put it in a furnace3 collect reclaimed metals4 sell the raw materials for more then the plane the labour the processes the costsi know that in rare situations this is a reality buteve sets it up as a game the amount reclaimed is deliberately high to create a reprocessor career pathignore that it ruins the market often and is completely ridiculousif its going to be a career path then at least make it something that cant be done on a low sp alt
eve is a sandbox played by many that have the claim the economy has to be more than the one in wow i know the whining will be earth shaking if ccp nerfs refining but the game mechanics for economics are now horrible the low price level is not caused by competition of miners on the market
explain why the price of high end minerals only plunged after ccp introduced unlimited high ends in wormhole space and any 00 the price of veld only plunged after ccp introduced the new veld roids in highsec the price of minerals was fairly stable for years  with mission runners collecting loots the magical 46 of minerals post has morphite in the reprocessed column oh wait ccp specifically said it was for all modules  even those used for mineral compressionyeah you want to know why the mineral market is ed up because of you stop miningliang
op is attacking the problem from the wrong end fix the minerals available from rat loot not the ability to reprocess
what the hell
i would suggest that rats only drops meta 2 and higher items that cant be produced in other ways that way it wouldnt interfere with the normal mineral market due to these modules being so valuable unreprocessedbut this would probably just crash the higher meta market instead
nope people will just start building them the cost of the t1 originals compared to final t2 product cost is minimal
not if the drop rate forthe meta 2 items and above remaind the same
true but that would have to mean that all meta 1 items are removed from the loot tables with no other changes this in turn means less overall income for the mission runners which would make them go berserk
too many miners  too much minerals supply  demand is more like is the same prices drop thats all if you want higher prices there should be less miners or more buyers
problems areabundance of bpsabundance of farmersabundance of hisec minerstoo much morphitetoo many loot dropstoo much iskinsurance is static and needs to be dynamicetc etc
if you remove reprocessing you cant get minerals from your ore eitheralso if you seriously believe that mission runners are getting better mineral hauls from running their missions than you are miningthen durrr run missions instead of mining and get the benefit yourself  its still locking objects up pressing buttons and moving items into your hold at the end of the day
you must prove the problem is real so far we have a old post from a dev saying that in the period between mid august and mid september 2008 the reprocessing of modules and ships and t2 stuff and compression items was producing approximately 40 of the minerals to be specific the number weretritanium 43pyerite 68mexallon 59isogen 56nocxium 32zydrine 18megacyte 39morphite 1 i would add that in that timeframe i had a friend buying as many eos as possible from the market and reprocessing them to sell the components for a gain after that we had wormholes unholy rage the velspater buff and the 00 upgrades i doubt those data have any value today if you can get ccp to release more up to date informations and possibly clear them of spurious data removing at least reprocessed t2 ships and capital items from the total we will have a better idea of where the problem lie and what could be done
remove base t1 loot replace meta drops with wrecked modules that function as bpcs
i believe this message sums up my stance on this issuea sammich without bread isnt a sammichits meat with mustard on your handsyes wed all prefer some sort of system where players smuggled stuff from players to other players and are pulled over by a third set of players for naughtiness but that isnt going to happen because the vast majority of players just cant be bothered to give a pair of numby nuts about what other players have in their holds the booster system was intended to be all yay smuggling but guess how well that went nowhere exceedingly well demand for boosters is near nil outside of the pvp community and to be quite honest the people who have the most need for them tend not to hang out in hisec where the smuggling would happenso using npcs to drive smuggling but providing all the real rewards and supply through players while acting as a net isk sink works to the benefit of all humanity in at least eleventy billion ways plus heyo smuggling in conclusion i demand that all and sundry support the peter potamus home for hot unwed mothers by approving this proposal failure to do so will result in something quite unpleasant  in your pantsharvey birdman attorney at law
supported in princaple i belive that this would be a valuble step to incressing the intrests and profitability of low sec i would also add that there should be a small bounty placed on the smugglers when they are flaged by customs for the duration of there contract encouraging pvp do you take a small ship and skip through the gates fast only to instapop or somethign hevey with an increased chance of the faction police ariving and proceeding to chew on your behindsmall issue with the stealthy ships making these sorts of runs relitivly easy though  blockade runner springs to mind

and dont forget the buffer tankers 25 can be a huge amount of hpalso remebr the damage to the armor is in addition to the normal damge recived to the shielding  its not transfered its bonus damage to my knowlege
i think people are missing the real issue here see the bonus isnt completely uselss but is it really worth a rank 4 intmem skill for combat players armour tankers dont have a skill like this to make things more balanced id say introduce tactical armour reinforcement again a rank four intmem skill that prevents armour damage from bleeding through to structureeither that or make the skill do something thats worth a rank four skill and to have lvl 5 as requirement for capital shield tanks is even dumber than making it a rank 4a useful bonus without making it op pass but how about we just say wed like a review of this skill ask ccp to look in to it and leave it at thatid be happy with that

up up and away
translation stop complaining about our ineptitude its your fault that you didnt elect more capable and wellrounded players its not our fault that were an inept csm its your fault
shut up because you have no idea what youre talking about
keep in mind that its ccp who set out to get more people into 00 a design philosophy i am quite aprehensive about the csm could have opposed it but i doubt itd have changed ccps mind on that particular issue im not against the csm going for features like treaties but i cannot honestly say that the issues brought forth by the csm looked like an even devide between pvp issues and pve issues this may however not be entirely the csms fault as they only support issues brought up and voted on in the assembly hall which brings out only a section of the playerbasewhen i ran for csm i did a survey that showed exploration to be the most popular candidate for potential upcoming additions to the game this was however not reflected by the issues brought forth in the assembly hall and therefor nor was it reflected by the issues the csm brought forth at the summit so its not all on the csms shoulders
a vast majority of players do not read the forums if ccpcsm hope to truly hear the voices of the many along with the few then they need to explore ideas on how to allow easier access to such things as assembly hall and suchhow come there is no in game polls and such i am not talking about the in game browser but something more intuitivewe get like maybe at best a hundred or so replies on thumbs up or thumbs down wish that was an option on ideas when the player base is like 350k not sure if that is accurate but you get the ideamy one sincere question i have for the csmccp is thiswhat is being planed to better connect the player communitys ideas and opinions with the csmccp via easy access within the game and when will this be
come next elections vote that way and get everyone else to do the same
i dont follow you mean thru the in game browser or something better
what i mean is to vote for a person who wants these things you summed up there
why cant the current csm get something like this done every csm member should want things put into the game that would better connect with the majority of the eve population unless they dont want the majority to have a voice in thingscsm members wouldnt you like a way to better connect with the community
we complained about this during csm 3 hopefully well see a lot of tools when spacebook or mygate or whatever it is called is implemented
answering shut up every time you get a reply you dont like it not the way to get meaningful debates on a topicagain yours current csm lack of interest in the industrial part of the game and in pve show exactly why a 1 year term is too long the whole csm seem to have a very unbalanced view of the game favouring only one facet of it you are there to represent all the players not only those that voted for you you can have a primary area of expertise and interest but you should not refuse to look all the other problems because they werent on your election program
a csm voted in by only a fraction of the playerbase is bound to be a warped representation of the playerbase as a whole if that representation has a pvp oriented agenda then its only logical that they dont want to be overshadowed by a larger group of politically inactive pve gamers unfortunately there is no way around this exept voting if you can get the pve gamers to vote enmasse youll see a radical shift in the political climate of eve
hes not looking for meaningful debate hes just being an idiot i dont refuse to look at any particular area of gameplay but there are other csm reps who know much more about that sort of stuff if someone wants something changed about a piece of game that i know little about they will have a lot of explaining to do
both z0d and song li are extremely capable industrialists  pve players and as youll note from my campaign im definitely a pvper but supported some industrial concerns on principle such as being able to build more stuff that is currently provided by npcs lo and behold planetary interaction looks like it might address some industrialist concerns and we talked with ccp about some of the details to see if it was going to go a direction we liked it wasif you have a specific concern voice it if you dont like the candidate spread do more work to get people who agree with you elected talking about how industrial issues arnt addressed without yourself mentioning what those issues are is pointless whining talking about how there are no industrialists or pveers on the csm when one of the richest industrialists in the game and a prolific missionpos runner are currently sitting belies either your ignorance or intent to start an argument no matter the factsi can hardly blame sok for losing patience in the face of such implacable uselessness player dialogue like that is the reason ccp needs a group of players like csm thanks for keeping us relevant 
so people on the csm know little about the game interesting i wouldve guessed that from reading the minutes but i didnt expect to see someone on the csm admit to it kudos on noting that youre not a complete eve player but rather a onedimensional nub csm is so pointless well except for leaked information for market manipulation i suppose they should really just shut it down completely
if you believe somebody who tells you they know in detail every single aspect of the game then you are a gullible fool and for 500 mil i can get you into a sov holding alliance with docking rights in 5 regions dont delay transfer isk todaythe game is so complex that people specialise in one or more areas and that is the point here no one person on the csm would claim to be a complete expert in every area for example whilst primarily a pvper and pvp trainer i do limited industrial stuff reactions and the like i wouldnt claim to know in detail about invention or supercapital construction and so if topics like that come up it is the job of the csm reps with skills in those areas to do the initial investigation and proposalsbut if i need to know about running a single person corp with a 2 week old char ill be sure to ask your advice
so you are saying the csm does not want an easy way for the entire eve community to voice their opinion with better in game tools interesting
im sure some current and past csm members would have wanted it but you need more in order to make it likely itll be put anywhere near a meaningfull place on the priority list without the votes i think itll take several years
so you are saying the csm does not want an easy way for the entire eve community to voice their opinion with better in game tools interesting long drawnout sigh id tell you to stop twisting words into the most negative light possible but i suspect you enjoy it unfortunately not everyone prefers intellectual discourse some prefer to go full in with an indiscriminate smear jobnow now csm remember the central room of eve forums dont feed the troll  it only encourages them pi think csm 3 has done good work presenting and getting across a number of issues to ccp keeping the player base up to date on their actions and overall doing a bangup jobmy only 1 complaint just 1 is the capital jump graphic is still unresolved 
the results  is something that you get after the job is done you can see the results of the previous 3 csm by comparing the meeting minutes and the game changes in the expansions following after itas for csm4 i have a strong feeling that we are had allready achieved something but its too early to see the whole picture
not sure if i can be there friends have a dinner party scheduled that evening p
ohgod nogo back to wow
not supported in the least mechanic working as intended we have a good economy for a reason and it isnt because eve is a safe game the bears do not see the big picture
dohohohohocan we put this issue to bed now
yes anyone who disagrees should read the fine print in their car insurance policy its like using your car to smash the front door of a banks so you can rob it and then asking insurance to pay for the dent and can we maybe look in to buffing hulks for how much they are worth they sure as hell are not able to withstand the dangers off deep space anybody other then me think its idiotic that you can muck a 150 mil ship with 15 mil worth of gank in less then a few minutes suicide ganking is as silly as the name implies you attack a ship get blown up and then concord does nothing to your pod as if it was your ship that committed the crime and not you i say once ure ship is popped concord should be able to catch you and arrest you then you either make bail or your char sits in the can for a few days get caught again and this time you sit for a week or two and so on
duh that is so dumb so they rather have newbies getting blown up by suicide gankers hmm if they are scared that newbies leave the game they should fix the sound engine

i so agree that it would be really nice to have a nicer effect for a jumping ship

yes
yes omg i was thinking the exact same thing a few hours ago alligning to fleet members would be nice too
supported
very useful
think this had already been thrown in but no hurt in supporting it again till it actually gets implemented
just logic do do thatfully support 
10
it was in a more vague less descriptive part of a much larger suggestion so chances of it getting singled out were lower and started around same time as mine but if theres an earlier one with more support link me so i can support p
i like ityoud think the few thousand posts on caod about all the lag would be an incentive as well lol
this is a good idea not perfect and needs tweaking but good enough for ccp to think about stuff like this and try it out i would like a small gang objective that didnt involve taking over sov but still hurts the enemy killing ratters dont count as that is zzzz pvp ccp has been promising small gang objectives for years and we havent gotten any my new theory is that ccp thinks a 200 man bs fleet is a small gangsmall gangs hooray big blobs booo more people in 00 heck ya support
supportedif regen rate stays the same then i think this is one of the most needed fixes in eve also could be applied to pos ship arrays when you get in a shield ship from a pos ur shield skills are not applied until you are already in the ship giving you a large in shield hp
yes
this thread delivershmmm caps i guess ill leave it there
yet another 1 not supported
yeah wardecs are abused to the max by griefers and lamers and they need fixingi just dont think you have the solutionwardecs  mutual or otherwise  are a valid way for corps who have a beef against each other to sort stuff outwhat id like to see is a wardec fee that gets exponentially more expensive the greater the difference in combat sp between the two corpswardec fee  1000000 x 10   deccing corp combat sp    decced corp combat sp or something similarso big groups of experianced pvp players would have to pay a small fortune to dec a noobie indi corp etcto stop large fee avoidance player cannot join a deccing corp until any wars they have declared have expiredoh and neutral remote reppers should get concordokkened for interfering in a legalised war

no
i think a system like this should be implemented to some degree
absolutely

would make eve  life easier its a waste of playing time the way how it is nowfully support 
would be nice i hate the damb session change timer

utterly supported i think its a stupid distinction
oh god yes
supported
supported because stupid people use this as an excuse for the weapon imbalance
rwaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
also annoying that mining crystals t2 cant be stacked in your hangar after using them once repack item and stackplease fix this ccp
the damaged items cant be contracted problem has been a problem from the very startjust throw up a popup and tell us it is damaged and then give us an ignore button so we never see said popup again
in real life when there is a massive demand for something companies tend to pursue creation of that thing one of the most common and wellloved ships in the universe of pod pilots is an ancient droneboat that looks like poop and what does creodron spend their time pursuing the helios which can field one tech1 imicus gets three drone the eos a ship that has twice its bandwidth in drone space to begin with and only gains moer as a bonus yeah adaptability i know not my point and the sin a travesty of a droneship mostly because that isnt its rolethese ships all have their roles their greatest successes the ishtar a durable mediumsized drone carrier and the ishkur a minidrone carrier take the hint creodron pod pilots want more drone carriers and will make you filthy rich if you bother to make themthis is half a rant about the purest drone carrier in the game being mediumsized and half a plea for more dronebased design from the company founded by this badasswhat i want creodron to do to revamp their ships1 3 light drones on the helios remove its turret hardpoints or dont make it a creodron ship2 give the eos a support drone bonus and 125 bandwidth it is a gangsupporting ship and would work well with rep bots and the like3 creodron branded subsystem for the proteus which actually allows it to function similar to any other highend droneboats lots of space 125mb bandwidth4 either switch the sins agility bonus to a drone bonus or again drop the creodron brand im fully willing to accept that the primary role of the sin is not effectively fielding drones but if it is only going to be less effective than the base model for drones then creodron should have nothing to do with its inception5 creodron faction drones and worthwhile navyrogue factional drones6 id like to see the helios bonus on the ishkur instead of more drone space but that could be a gamechanger7 pure droneboat battleship the dominix has been dominating for decades pod pilots are ready and willing to drop the isk for a new model make it happen8 overall more ships with drones as a primary armament like the ishtar instead of an afterthought like most ships if they ever revamp destroyers or do a second tier id like to see a droneboat destroyer9 droneenhancing modules i think ive mentioned this before highssmall drone control unit5 mb bandwidth 1 drone controlledmedium drone control unit10mb bandwidth 1 drone controlledlarge drone control unit25 mb bandwidth 1 drone controlledroughly as tough to fit as the largest rail in that size 150mm 250mm 425mmrigsdrone bay reconstruction10 drone bay cargo standard penaltyedit also amarrgallente skillsused rogue drone faction ships
supporting the hell out of thiseve does not have enough modules and rigs for drone purposes i want to see the modules you introduced
prolly ought to support myselfand yes i know pvpers are concerned about drone boats because they operate outside normal restrictions a lot of the time i firmly believe drones are balanced in this aspect thoughthey cant really be ewaredbut they can be blown upthey dont drop on the wreckbut they can be destroyed and damage your opponent even if they escapethey dont have to be fitted in module slotsbut they cant be overheated either and have their own sort of slotsthey have incredible range and adaptability rr drones are much longer than unbonused rr for instance but have to actually move to that range and then return to be switched outdrone boats dont necessarily have to be dps kings or even have all sorts of highs for neuts im not looking for more domis here but rather ships that use drones as a primary armament instead of a supplement to something else id be perfectly fine with drone carriers only having 23 highs i like the adaptability of drones and the micromanagement aspect not just throwing in the highestdps thermal drones you can siccing them and forgetting themdrone boats are the antithesis of interceptors mainly instead of focusing on your own modules and piloting and tending towards twitch gameplay it turns eve into more of an rts where most of your attention is focused on drone micromanagement this playstyle should be supported betterideally id love to see drones become a big enough threat that someone actually bothers fitting up a ship specifically as an exclusive dronekiller
wont support because of your high slot mods to drone control links although ive been a droneboater my whole life and love em to death you cant have 1 to drones controlled unless it is on a cap like it is now used to be you could control 10 at a time but they moved it to 5 and doubled the damage controlling more would generate waaay too much lag and make drones overpowered i wouldnt complain though 
lag is definitely an issue and an unfortunate one ideally these would be balanced enough that we wouldnt see that many more drones in space additionally less guns firing would offset some of the lag perhaps grouping of drones would be a good solution most people send all of their drones at the same target if they could be grouped into what the server sees as one entity somehow it may reduce lagas for overpowered see above drones are wellbalanced a 10drone boat wouldnt be stronger than a gunboat in some ways and weaker in others
i like some of the ideas however mods that allow both bandwidth and drones controlled seems overboard maybe keep drone controls as they are but allow another highslot mod that has the same fitting reqs as guns without awu and wu bonuses that increases drone bandwidth by a maximum of 15mb per mod
edit nm misunderstood your point of contention yeah nothing wrong with splitting bandwidth and drone control modules as long as both are present at that point it might be prudent to make the bandwidth modules lowslots thoughand the modules have to be sized 15mb is massive for a frigate and not enough for one more large drone for a bs doing a onesize fits all module means either small ships get screwed because fitting requirements are bssized or large ships dont have an option
definately yeswell maybe more thought needs to be put into thatmore ships is too vague that does not workdrone enchansing modules well as much as drone control modules sound cool i do not think their addition will be good gameplay wise hard to tell though they would act as a massive damage boost lag is not an issue when we are talking about specialized droneships as only a small percentage of the ships in a given fleet consits of such ships
add 20 damage  over 5 drones is the same as adding one more drone without the unbalancing possibilities think about 5 large dronessentryes  5 ewar drones and the lag
the unbalancing possibilities are actually the malleability that would make droneboats able to compete with conventional weaponrypoint taken about the ewar drones though theyre balanced around a set of 5 achieving the same effect as 1 module of that size essentially that means youd be able to trade 5 high slots for 1 medslot not particularly impressivemy point is drones are remarkably selfbalancing there would be some interesting tactics that could be employed with these modules but all of them have major weaknesses to exploit they would however force some adaptation which imo is a good thing
massive damage boost doesnt really apply which is one of my key points because the modules take the place of guns they shouldnt result in more net dps they should do a little less but have to be dealt with differently pure gunboat appears you neut it if it is using lasershybrids or disrupt it pure droneboat appears you pop the drones or screw its targeting drones are more resistant to this than guns but if he cant control where they go theyre as good as deadas someone who sometimes enjoys flying really cheap frigatescruisers into pvp id absolutely love to be able to neuter a droneboat by killing 510 of its drones even if it killed me id have done damage way higher than that incurred
a 10 drone boat would be much stronger though thinkof 10 tech 2 heavys and tell me how much dps that is putting out or 10 sentries on one slowmoving bs and also drones cause more lag than guns because the game has to create another little ship 5 actually and they specifically already halved drone numbers and doubled the dps for this reason if you double it again it will be ludacris
hi im the eve economist lets decide not to impact the market but well just add a crapload of extra supplyyeah thatll worktheres no way that prices are going to drop from this making highend ores available in all 00s with sov upgrades does not impact mining in any way nopeim not saying the sov upgrades are bad i think theyre awesome but ccp should get their arses kicked for continuing to say that we dont affect economy then continuing to increase supply  we saw this with increase respawn of ores in highsec as well
venkul is correct clear information on such a heavily discussed and important topic is vital
request of information souces of mineralsi always wondered what taste is the tritanium souce
if only ccp would hire an economist that could easily whip up a chart like that and release it on the forumsinstead of hiring an economist with zero experience in his field ccp should have hired a player who read economics for dummies and had him make some charts would have been 10000x more useful supporting this to show how inept eyjog is
i am also interested in the effect the various changes to the mineral supply are having on the ingame economyimho miners should account for the majority of minerals in eve if thats not possible it should still not be possible to buildinsuresuicide ships for a profit thats just silly no matter how you look at it edited to show support
this kind of information is extremely important to us industrialists the sad fact is that only ccp has the ability to generate these numbers for us hurt as we dont have access to raw market datayou know what that would be awesome if ccp could give us a market data dump say every month with all the useful information but i can see how that would probably be too much work and too much data to handle
while i support the request for information there would need to be some major changes to the game before removing t1 meta 0 loot were possible dont get me wrong im all for this but it cant happen in the game as it is right now without drastic consequences both on the market and on gameplayfor one youd need to add a lot more manufacturing stations somewhere like 3x the amount currently available as another youd have to make mining more interesting and profitable maybe by altering the composition of most of the asteroids in the gamewhat i would recommend in this incarnation is to reduce the t1 meta 0 drop chance by 10 a few months before the expansion that overhauls all the aspects goes live and continue doing this by 10 per month until there is no meta 0 loot available in wrecks meta 1 loot would still be available as well as something like npc goods dropped tags etc which would be a smaller income source for the mission runnerstldr supported for more info but dont alter drop rates until game mechanics are changed
this im wholly against the removal of the said loot for obvious reasons just think back to the days of being noob for crying out loudtop that off with the fact that i think the argument of minerals flooding the market from missions is totally off the wall i want to see the proof in the pudding so to speak wont reverse my stance until such timeps if they change it bunyips proposed change seems like a good place to start
ccp needs to keep its player base more informedsupported
i like this ideaevent systems and areas should be both opens all kinda of possiblilties from people host them making isk to rewards for winners
great idea give armor tankers some needed love
he why
i know it is but this is a good start personally i have no real gripe with plated and trimarked bs operating as an rr blob in larger scale fights you need that ehp otherwise youll likely instapopi do agree that the whole dynamic needs looking into personally id like to see the fitting requirements raised on platesextenders and lowered on reps or at least equalised id rather see platedextended bs limited to lowermid tier guns with active repped boats being able to mount higher tier guns but thats for another topic and likely will never happen as it will screw over a lot of cruiserbc pilotsyour an moran
why because i asked why he thinks armor tanks are weaker than shield tanks this clearly shows how moran you are i havent even talked to youyour idea to boost bonuses is stupid instead of boosting the reppersshield boosters this would only make some active bonused ships worthy to use these
protip read the op
theres always going to be a tipping point between active and buffer as numbers increase unless you nerf the crap out of buffer if you buff active tanking so that tipping point is more then well 2 you endup with broken 1v12v2 mechanics and ships that are still useless past the tipping point in fleets not to mention the hulls which are meant to active tank dont have the best fitting setups for large fights mainly blastersacswouldnt it be better to tweak the bonus to 10 to repair mod and 10 received rr that way the ships in question stay usefull past the tipping point the disadvantage over a resist bonus is 13 less primary buffer and the requirement of rractive tank to use the bonus
im on board for the principle of the thing although just going from 75  to 10  may not be the right fixid like to see a bonus like 10  to capacitor requirement and cycle time for repairers per level this would make them rep twice the dps at the same amount of cap and also give them a more even repair rate as opposed to long cycle times itd also mean one pulse of a repper wouldnt take as much cap
or a better one make them unkillable until they fit up a repper why notit wouldnt be more unbalanced than your current proposalso whats the problem with boosting reppersboosters instead of some ships then even without bonus there would be reasons to fit active tanks upand bonused ships would still be 75lvl better at it
because theres nothing wrong with reps as a module they function well on their own in a lot of situations the problem is simply with ships that are forced via bonuses to fit them in situations where they dont work wellthe solution is to make them work well for those ships even in situations where repairers dont usually work well not to boost repairers for everyone at a risk of overpowering them in situations where theyre already good
so wouldnt boosting bonus to 10lvl make those ships op in situations where theyre already goodbecause for those self repair bonused ships both changes would be the same  but for not bonused ships in your version self repairing would still be unwanted
if you really want active tanking to be viable the answer is simple you boost the rep amount done by modules if you think 10 more boost is enough youre crazy think more around 25 more boost for example a t2 xl sb boosts 600 hp a 25 boost would then make it rep 750 hp this cannot be only for ships that have in your opinon active bonuses for example the rokh has a resist bonus but is a great active tank and i feel sorry for hype pilots because the slot layout and pg does need tweaked whatever the change for active tanking it needs to be across the board and not to select ships
wow something everyone is agreeing on
yes
1 i dont care about eye candy if you want eye candy play the new crysis or how its called put more people on fixing bugs because these are ruining my player experience not missing effects
you be surprised how many people forget to do that on a daily basis
i dont see what real difference it makes but i dont see any thing wrong with the way it is now if it aint broken why fix itnot supported
exactly this mechanicif it was a passive mod all those comp skills no one trained would be useful 
those skills are actually useful especially with armor tanks as most people fit the eanm and that benefits
no unlike some people i do not spend my entire day watching topics i read your post 32 after you posted and responded its that simple ignorance is strength as you ran out of valid arguments you switched to personal insults i see arguing with you is pointless and it no longer contributes to the discussion so lets leave it
you sound bitter
loli mean come on i supported the freaking topic and he is still complaining
if it would have any effect at all on server load im all for it making it excluded by the passive module boosting skills might take a little codework but i dont think itd be extreme on either side it isnt a 5 minute fix but it isnt a major architecture changethat said the developers know how much server load damage controls generate presumably and they also know how much work itd be to change that presumably and they so far havent found it worthwhile so shrug
this
im sure this had been done a gazillion times already  but what about implementing a simple reputation systemmany forums allow you to do something similar  you can give people positive or negative reputation based on interactionsconsider it an extension of the standings system  maybe a public database maintained by concord for example you could give people negative reputation if the scam you or gank you or give good traders positive reputation for good trades or completion of contracts etcyoud have to flesh it out much more than that to minimise abuse ie negative standings can only be applied if they fail a contract or killattack you  positive only at the completion of a contract etcthis could also lead to a renewal of the contract system  id love to see a more open system  both in more freedom in how i can make contracts a cooldown period even just 5 mins to help minimize scams and allow a character to show their contract history so contract bidding can take place  ie say i want to hire miners  i can make a contract saying that i will pay a flat rate for oreminerals for 1 week starting next wednesday people can bid for the contract and i can see their history of what contracts they have taken who was involved and what the result was a kind of ebay like feedback system without comments you could flesh this out to a i want from 200 to 1000 of this item  123isk per item on a weekly basis indefinitely style contractsyeah
wat
i dread to think what the goons would do to that system
fyp
yeah and for some of us who are known for things would end up getting the wrong message due to some idiot giving negative repnot gonna happenunless the system is nonuserinteractive reacts depending on how you behaveknown for breaking the law and such would be nice
yo dawg we heard you werent popular with goonswarm so we put a really large negative number in your reputation so you can rage while you rage
theres a rep system in place on goonfleetcomi have 140153 rep and my posts are horrible which should tell you what a bad idea this is
corp hanger array now stop with this ridiculous post please 
surely i cant be the only one that has this problem  o 
you are complaining about having to spend 3 to 4 seconds to swap laser crystals cry me a freaking river cause it takes me 10 seconds to reload my missile launcherhybridsballistic weapons
last i checked your freaking missileshybirdsballistic weapons dont shatter after so many shots and are very easy to maintain as far as tech 2 ammosecondly reloading is not the same as being forced to change ammo twice once to get out and once to put it back in and not to mention penalties associated with ammo types to get the damn thing to loadso care to try again or are you just trolling to be trollingps if your going to troll then at least be rational and smart trolling like a  is embarrassing
very well then not supported because you are complaining about a 3 or 4 second at most crystal swap out time meanwhile it takes every other weapon 10 seconds to changeswap ammo sounds most like the problem is that crystals break down at different rates push to have crystal damage made more consistent so that in a rack of 8 guns all 8 crystals break at the same time
the really funny thing about this thread is the last time i saw drakes opinion on the subject of fixing laser crystals this was his responseso i have to sayto quote someonestop whiningseriously drakes been mining with tech 2 deep core strip miners along with the associated mining crystals and hes never had any trouble keeping things straightand they work on the same basic system that laser crystals would all drake had to do was make sure drake loaded used instead of new when he switched things outif he can do it you can do itthis proposal smells of cheese and crackers not supportedwhat all of a sudden faction crystals are a problem for you so we should now change it not supporting purelly because the topic has been raised bydrake i dont see the issue not supported draconis
cloaking as a whole doesnt need a change the only thing that needs a change is a pilots ability to stay cloaked for long periods of time while they arent even playing the game effectively locking down key mining systems and trade routes while they sleepi agree with the post at the bottom of page 1 disable autorepeat on cloaks and give them a 102030 minute duration if you are indeed actively engaged in playing this great game then you will be able to press f1 again to put your cloak up when it cycles off if not then say herro to my lil probeif thats a problem you can always log out
aggression mechanics arent unique to cloaking ships
you can do what ever you want with afk cloaker in system all you need to do is being prepared to fight
since theres now secure time codes people should be able to scam ingame with insecure gtcs clarification selling a fake gtc for isk would be allowed selling one for reallife money would not perhaps something can be implemented to let people use isk to buy gtcs from other players like plex not just securely buy them from ccp but theres no reason to continue the ban on gtc scamming now that secure timecode trading is allowed it goes against the spirit of evedark universe that new eden is supposed to beslimy
what sort of scams do you think should be allowed
umwhat are you smoking im thinking you should stop before it kills any more brain cells
im thinking instead of support ill click report why would anyone endorse scamming get out of jita and get a life
its a game not a way of life you already have plenty of opportunity to scam to your hearts content with in game content
supporting my own topic
im syssin and i support this topic
scamming gtcs which have real world monetary value because you can legitimately sell them for real world money has legal implications ccp are quite right to avoid theseas said above there are thousands of ingame items you can use to seperate chumps from their isk without exposing ccp to legal liability
you name is apt maybe throw in the word tit for good measure though
would never happen gtcs are purchased using real life currency if people get scammed out of gtcs the chances of them buying more decreases and ccp and authorised gtc sellers lose businessits also why ccp wont let you move plex in a shipif someone get ganked while carrying plex in their ship thats real life currency down the toilet and ccp would be on the receiving so many rage petitions theyd never get anything else done
thumbs down you got plexes to scam with
there are no legal implications since you wouldnt be selling a gtc for reallife money youd be selling it for isk which is not owned by anyone since ones isk is a number on a server run by ccp essentially youd be giving someone a fake number for isk not a fake number for reallife money
good idea
this is nothing more than the developers of eve to maximize their subscription dollarthere is no reason to have 3 character slots if you can effectively only use 1 at a timenot being able to train multiple characters is simply to slow down your progress in the game and milk the monthly subscription fee for as long as they can the problem is theyre not getting the new subscribers and theyre losing existing ones maybe they want it that way i dont knowanyone i talk to about eve has the very same reaction 1 what i cant level up on my own its time based 2 what i cant traintry characters simultaneously what if i screw up one of my characters and have to start over no way am i paying for that man
forum mods should punish people for necroing bad proposals
by nerfing buffer tanks active tanking would be more viable it would let small armor gangs in 00 be able to fight more than one fight without offlining their modules in deadspace to remote rep each other with their utility high slotsidea from this thread
yes lets boost alphaing make ganking even easierno not supported
there are some situations in which this is sound logic this is not one of those situations tanking is not a contained system but rather a countermeasure weakening the stronger method thereby weakens tanking as a whole and weakening as a whole of a countermeasure affects the overall balance as the poster above noted it shifts power even more towards gankthis is a viable change but only if you rework dps as well gank v tank is a more contained system
you dont want to nerf buffers you want to nerf rrbuffer can be grinded down
iirc ccp have increased the defences on ships several times because people were dying to fast in fleet fightso now why do we want to undo that generally popular move 
on kill mail yes
makes sense
supported ive taken to buying entirely different sets of hardeners for ships that are based at the same station and never used simultaneously simply because it is that annoying to jump into the ship unfit it and then jump into the other ship and use the modulesideally although itd require a lot more codework ships wouldnt be truly fitted until undocking all modules would rest in a combined module pool with the fitting window just showing what the ship would be like if it were to be fitted upon clicking undock it wouldnt function any different than now with the exception of modules currently fitted to other ships being available for fitting to a current shipcould cause issues with cargo bay mods though
ok you miss understood what im talking about i am not talking about the relative size of the color yes each color is 96 bits im talking about the increase in parsing time on the database itselfso for instance using arbitrary numbers here lets say currently there are 32000 people that play eve im not saying 32000 people logged on im talking 32000 paying accounts each person has 5 ships all with custom paint jobs you are dealing with a database 160000 enteries now this number is most likely alot higher i would say that most people own more then 5 ships total instead of roughly 231 color pallets that must be parsedso again same situation 30 ships jump into a system currently a database of 231 enteries is parsed for each ship that jumped in for its associated color palletecustom paint 30 ships jump into a system and a database of 160000 enteries is parsed for each ship that jumped in for its associated color pallete this does not even include the possible join needed to associated a specific ship pallete to a specific pioletnow where i should stand correct myself is im more talking about load time here instead of lag as soon as all the palletes where loaded the normal server lag would be the same as it is now but you would see a increase in load times upon jumpingcynoing into a new system with large fleets this would really only affect densly populated systems or during large fleet battlesalso this is assuming your allowed complete control over the color schemesi do beleive having access to any of the color schemes that share between the tech one tech 2 and faction ships would be a more plausible and liked idea but then youd have to ask about those ships that only have 1 color scheme my poor hyperion lol
considering servers are specialy made to hold and deal alot of data i dont think it would be a serious load expecialy with new technologys like solid state harddrives 1 tb harddrives octalcore processers 8 cores and like you said yourself there are allready other paintjobs used t2 ships mission ships rat ships and so on not to mention iv seen some pritty interesting and exotic looking test server toys in the graphics catagory the minimum of what im trying to get pushed though is to make all those paint scemes publicly avalable for people to pick and chose from i admit using a rbg system would use more space and cause more lag then the preset method but it creates a nicer universelook to the game cause ships will become more personalizedand thank you admin for the clean up
use a t3 shipstrategic cruiser skill bonus 5 reduction in the amount of heat damage absorbed by modules per level
i already doi thought when i proposed this that it would be interesting to allow standard ships to do the same but at a fitting costyes passive or ofline modules can be used to sink some of the heatdamage but only a very limited amount not the same that could be sunk using a dedicated modulethis is merely an idea that i thought might have some merit but apparently there was little interest so lets just move on
overheating should be for short periods right now you can already overheat most modules quite long doesnt need to become even longer
make the bonus  armour rep   recieved rrotherwise its always going to suck asoon as your up against more then 2 ships of the same sizethe difference to resists is that it has alot less primary buffer  requires active support to work
hyperion is wrong from the ground up even looking at the description the designers thought there was a desire for a big blasterboat there wasnt because the megathron fills that role excellentlyi mean ideally itd be an awesome drone carrier but people lovehate the domi so much i dont think thatd flythe problem is that gallente dont have too many niches and their main ones are filled by their other two battleshipsit cant be the fast closerange bs gallente already get the megathron and making it really fast infringes on minmatarit cant be the drone bs gallente already get that oneit cant be the awesome hugepgarmor bs because thats the amarr claim to fameit cant be the big ewar boat because gallente ewar is terribadi guess you could turn it into a bssized logistics ship seems a shame with the awesome battleship model to make it a repairmobile but some really heavy rr bonuses would make it a major fleet asset
got to say in whatever century this is if your flying around in space ships warping from place to place looks like they wouldnt have lost the technology of polarizing sunglasses
a option for a default group  shortcut to launch would be great1
drones need love too
sorry but in eve we have mission items you must be referring to another gamenext time ask the person that stole the item if you can ransom it back or buy it back on marked as that is where they usually end up im sorry if someone ruined your carebear experience next time ill try to do it my self if i have the time
the vagina monologues is a play that empowers women how is this offensiveim not proposing a concord response this time just let me shoot the quest item thief when they steal the damsel
an opinion is not a fact look it up
theyre not quest item thieves theyre mission objective thievesalso quit yer whining its a game where anybody can be a jerk if they wanted to and youre playing it
if you her back it will cost you 10mil

for once i agreegtfo op and stfo
quite the opposite its rather pointless after its implemented

210 bad troll
why do we only hear a few out of all the csm members on threads
probably because they cant be bothered responding to such a whiny little nitwit im sorry marlona im sure you are a good fellow and everything but with the amount of negativity and terrible posts you put out im surprised your computer hasnt spontaneously combusted i bet youre fun at parties too
your just mad because i dont give you a pat on the back for breaking the ndastop being mad
m8 i dont need your personaly approval in fact id probably think less of you if you did like some of the mouth breathers on these boards however you seem intent on twisting every bit of dialogue every communique every forum post to your glasshalfempty viewpoint regurgtating the same arguements over and over again like some sort of cowtroll chewing the cudalso yeah the nda thing theres no need to keep bringing it up every time you respond to me u mad i get it ok
people will react in simplified ways to complicated issues every single time no matter what you do and the vast majority will not respond to insults by changing themselves even a troll can be translated and if you do you discover theres always a legitimate concern underneath the bad language i could ofcourse tell both parties to stop flinging poo at eachother but they wont its human nature
here is my problem with the csmdarius johnson shows picture of rainbow land during fanfest and says ccp fix thisccp works closely with csm to come up with a resolutioneve is presented with dominion which did nothing but cater to the power blockscsm claims that they had nothing to do with itcsm members of power blocks ask ccp fix the game where alliances can get in 00 without becoming part of power blocksccp and csm talk about treatiescsm says treaties could be a solution to this problemcsm says grouping together is human nature while i agree it is of course but to put up fake sobs over why wont small alliances go into 00 just to get more features and tools put in game that just cater to the power blocksi suggest to change the way standings work to be similar to war decs and the fees involved and csm comes running in saying that you cant stop people from being friends this new idea we have to better 00 is far better excuse and all it is is some new way to keep 00 the way it isi want to see conflicts all over 00 not none of this team a vs team b only crap with 20000 grid locking system crashing super ultra blob whatever crapbottom line is if it in any way remotely could have a negative affect on power blocks they will do whatever it takes to make sure the idea never sees the light of daythis is true you know it i know it and everyone who reads this thread knows itthe day csm stops fake complaining about how sov mechanics cater to power blocks is the day i stop calling them out on their bull it just truely is pathetic how csm works either its some scandal going on or something being pushed forward for political reasons instead of what is best for the eve communityrant off
having to asume the posibility that youre either correct or incorrect the notion that you feel you cannot trust a csm that has ties to an ingame powerblock stands either way in real life politics there are laws in place in some countries preventing this conflict of interests problem in eve there are no such laws treaties and dominion dont seem to be the core of your issue theyre just the symptoms noso let me ask is there any way you can think of thatll allow you to trust the csm even if it contains members of powerblocks what sort of evidence of their impartialness are you looking for
i understand this but when i or anyone else calls them out on such things in question they throw up their hands in denial nothing anyone can do about that a lier is a lierwhen the csm members start represnting the eve community and puts aside thier own political agendas that day i fear will never come
well theyre opting for closer contact between ccp the csm and the players which seems to be something that benefits the players more than any partial csm member so there are good signs around wouldnt you say
nothing i can say will convince you that there isnt some big alliance boogyman pulling the strings as to what darius or any previous csm did or said i cant speak for them so i wontif you are going to accuse me of lying then kindly point to a post or otherwise where i have been untruthful rather than slinging mud in this general directionim interested to hear why formalised treaties to remove the need to blue people everywhere would be bad but that some kind of 00 wardec which would simply be a treaty in reverse would be good perhaps you would be so kind as to point me at this proposal you raised so i can take a look
interesting stuff with regards to overviews in station and docking while scrammed wouldnt it be fair to say that the issues of neutral reppers docking and jumping mechanics is a greater issue than general docking games
neutral repping wouldnt need to change with ccps proposal you could scram the logistics so it cant dock however i would prefer this idea to only kick in after the target has agressed eg you have to undock and shoot somebody before you can be blocked from redocking by others in that situation repping would have to be considered agressing too i concede that will be viewed as a kick in the teeth to dedicated logistics cruisersas far as gates are concerned there is already a viable counter to a target deagressing and jumping  have tacklers waiting on the other side
thanks for posting the minutes i would also like to thank all csm members clearly a tough job i find it extremely difficult to be critical of the people or the process for a couple of reasons 1 the effort and time required by csm members 2 the nda leaves me blind to a lot of details all i can do is review the minutes please correct me which is nothing more than a minor snapshot of the discussion with ccpreading only the minutes from this meeting it seems many aspects of eve were under represented a meeting of this importance not to broach topics such as pve markets industry ui exploration wormholes lowsec and technical but talk about black ops bss seems rather insignificant it is not to say a topic such as black ops bs should not be discussed but when so many other macro issues are left behind it really looses its importance to the grander scheme once again because of the nda i am blind and maybe all these items were discussed in detail a while back i played swg post nge i knowUFFFD they also had there own csm galactic senate a platform where players elected senators to represent aspects of the game i was quite impressed with the delegates because they were all experts in their field of game play while the representation was outstanding it was doomed to fail because most proposals were cast aside as dont have time or resources dividing eve into sections and electing qualified representatives might be something to consider who qualifies obviously people who play the game but people who write guides and help others in their field and are experts in that area they wont serve find out why and what incentives or changes can be made to get them to serve each delegate has an alternate and the most important part we can recall them i believe doing this term limits are irrelevant and the macro aspects of the game are represented i do commend you on hitting some really important topics ccp not managing expectations for expansions and quietly cutting features were refreshing to read the treaty system was a very important aspect of dominion and was a great example of this cut a promoted feature to never discuss again trend with ccp also worth mentioning the csm would like to have a budget of development time dedicated to going through a backlog of projects that they prioritize what good are any csm suggestions if we dont have commitment and communication to an agenda items status well done csmthe most disturbingthe csm calls for an increased dialogue with ccp regarding game design during the actual development process rather than after release of an expansionduring development how about before do we really think once ccp has started development they are going to make any substantial changes in my humble view csm should already have a really detailed plan for tyrannis and pretty good idea what is planned for incarna if that is the winter expansion if csm only has the information presented in the recent devblog for tyrannis then sorry to say this we are wasting our time with csmone last time just want to thank csm members for all the hard work
youre probably not going to believe me but i represent people that like to blow stuff up regardless of their ticker
now this id also like to know way i see it any large force would tactically do well to prevent any and all smaller forces from developing themselves near them so even if small alliances had access how could they stay there without being completely overrun by the bigger powerblocks or becoming part of one and what could large powerblocks gain from smaller alliances being near them even if treaties are possible
one of the options discussed was that for example smaller industrial and npcing corps could more effectively rent blue status from a sov holding alliance in a particular region or constellation without being blue all over the galaxy this system would be a lot more dynamic than the current standings and could potentially get smaller corps easier into 00
dont you think that the alliances would see such blue status renting corporations as being competition to the available resources in their 00 systems and that the big alliances would prefer to reap the resources themselves rather than to outsource it
the issue at the moment is if you want to let some smaller alliancescorps live in your sov space you have to set them blue and that blue status would be anywhere in eve thus some alliances wont consider such options having renters able to go into any of your sov systems for examplesome alliances would quite like to be able to either rent space to other alliances or be happy to have smaller alliances living next door with some kind of no sov war pact for exampletreaties as originally described would allow alliances to have roaming pvp anywhere in 00 whilst allowing blue status in a few key systems such as the sov systems of the smaller alliance the benefit for larger alliances is a potential income stream as well as small gang roaming pvp the smaller alliances get the pvp too as well as the chance to hold sov space or rent outposts etc in 00 without having to own a cap fleet to defend it from the locals or blue the whole areait is a significant change over the current system and would open up new options which could become more important when planetary interaction hitsis it a perfect system no but it opens more interesting options than are available currently
no because the sov holders could cash the rent and not have to bother with npcing themself see also tds post
you guys keep dodging the question of how this is supposed to allow smaller alliances the ability to access 00 without being all buddy buddy with power blockspets pay renttreaties are a tool to manage thisjust keep spinning and spinning this does nothing but enhance the current power blocks in 00 nice addition for low sec for say a peaceful mining corp wanting to rent from pirates or somethingdoes nothing for 00 to open up access without being bluesigning treaties with power blocks nice spin on the pet tool though
if you are going to not bother to actually read my posts im not going to respond to your anticsm hate any furtherfor the last time read what i said many larger sov holding alliances would welcome limited blues that is blue status in a limited number of systems to allow smaller alliances to live next door without dropping a cap fleet on their head these larger alliances do not want to fully blue people so currently they are not receptive to the ideais that clear enough some alliances do not want global blue status with every other alliance in a regiongot thatso a system as described originally could allow a smaller alliance to hold space next to a larger alliance with some mutual understanding of no capsov warfare and blue in a couple of systems it doesnt have to be a paid for thing some alliances and i know this because ive spoken to them would love a smaller alliance running regular small gang roaming pvp because it gives their small gang pvpers something to do between huge sov blobfestssome alliances would use it to allow pets to have access to certain systems but not their whole regionlets now address your next pointdoesnt have to mean renting some alliances again i know this because ive spoken to a few dont want to hold sov in all nearby systems but would be happy to have a smaller alliance take some in exchange for a no sov war policy no isk changes hands no blue status except potentially in their home system currently not an option but would be with the treaty systemhow can you sit there and not think that opens up 00 to smaller allianceswhine about pets and renters all you like how the heck do you expect a smaller alliance to hold space without having some no sov war pact with nearby alliances no sov war pacts are not full naps are not full blue status and mean roaming pvp is an option currently unavailable would every alliance give such an offer of course not but the option would be thereit opens up options not currently available and would enable some smaller 00 alliances to hold sov without having to nap train everyone nearbyand it doesnt automatically mean an isk requirement ive spoken to a few alliances who would do this for free just for the roaming pvp chancesif you take the anticsm blinkers off for a minute and actually think about it you would see that fine grained control with treaties  more options for living in 00you keep repeating this but it isnt true see my point aboveill close with a questionhow do you expect a smaller alliance to hold sov next to a larger alliance and not get face stomped by a capital blob seeing as how you detest the idea of diplomacyif you choose to ignore the difference between having the option of limited no sov war pacts and having to choose between fully signed up nappet relationship or no 00 then i cant help you
wonderful example everyone want to firm a treaty saying we will get isk from you for using system x but we will camp every adjacent system and blow you up when you try to enter itmaybe you should think a bit more about thisyou and her want very different things i doubt you will ever agree on what you are discussingshe want a way to get in 00 with risk but without the need to become the serf of someone your reply is all about as you can become a serf maybe it is not possible to do it in another way but it is still fairly unpalatableall your post is about the wonderful life of being the sparring partner of mike tayson in exchange for access to the gym dont seem a great deal
if you have a treaty with a nearby powerblock that wont protect you from the nearby powerblocks you dont have a treaty with do you expect the powerblock you have a treaty with as a small corp or alliance will stick its neck out for you in defense against an opponent that you yourself as a small corp or alliance have no realistic chance against
maybe you should because if you can set it for single regions or constellations then its easy to set an area with access for your renters
dont give them easy kills and they wont waste their time camping use other ways to get stuff in and out of the system it isnt hardthe point is at the moment the only two options are blue every alliance living nearby which means blue to them everywhere in eve or dont live in sov 00in all seriousness you have to weigh up the offers dont assume every alliance will want isk for this type of arrangement i can tell you for a fact is not going to be the case 100 of the time again i state i have discussed this kind of thing with other alliances already but without the treaty option it isnt as likely to happenthat is something you have to decide some larger alliances would offer that kind of thing not wanting other larger alliances living next door other people will bring in mercs to help defend insteadthere are more options with a treaty system than a basic blue everywhere in eve or not at all arrangement which is the only current systemagain i say this is not a perfect idea but it opens up a ton of new options which are currently missing and should be fairly simple to implement if system  x then standings  yif you are expecting changes to allow small alliances to hold sov and be able to solo defend against larger alliances without at the same time making it utterly impossible for larger alliances using the same game mechanics to be unseated then im afraid there isnt anything on the table at this time
what im more concerned about is that the smaller fish in that big ocean will see limited rewards with increased risk from the much bigger fish the bigger alliances take up all the really good bounty and can defend themselves against the other big fish the smaller alliances that are there through treaties get the scraps but can suffer great losses against much bigger opponents is that unrealistic of me to think
dont forget empire level 4 agents compete with 00 isk income potential pretty well so we are back to the whole why should a alliance go out to 00 to be a pet oh forgive me i mean sign a treaty with a power blockalso about the solo defend thing not going to happen here is whylisten up everyone pet number 14 err i mean that alliance we have a treat with in constilation whatever is being invadedbut not all of us will be blue to each other if we all go to help out what can we possible dohere we modified everyones treaties so we will all be blue therewow pure geniusassemble the blob
i demand that the csm provide me with information that proves how useless they are failure to do so will only prove how useless they are
the thing that started to bug me from that closed topic was that why some ppl keep isk farming cheating but if it was sp farming it would be legit at the end i really cant see difference specially when its withing game rules
sweet so now all i have to do is log in and leave my computer on 237 and i get better fasterthis is a great idea
thats totally dumbhow often newbies have to confirm that tehy want to do something that is involving concord action 2 times three timesits like the big red button with some text in capital letters clost to it reading if you press this button the universe will blow up are you sure about thatafter you pressed the button another button appears asking you to confirmoif you are really sure about thatin my opionion the following happend in the csmccp discussion the pvpcsmler dont wan this to change thats itbut that does not matter it is not logic since newbies will not leave the game after acknowledging four times that they want to blow stuff up they will leave if they become suicide ganked and suicide ganked is backed up by a juicy insurrance payout thats stupid
i dont think touching insurance should do it because every once and a while i lose a ship to npcs and id like to get the insurance from thati think its a simple ui changetry this as a message box you have just been volleyed by a battleship in jita explode yn
this
bump
this oh and bump 
yes do it
after following this thread and the one before it i think both rails and blasters just need a lot more damage make having the drawbacks of the other guns worth it its that simple because kinetic and thermal are heavily tanked by almost all ships just look at the resists and how ships are fit
1
yes please
this will add to the rang of tactics that can be used and thus gets my vote UF04A
just keep bumping up the bounties on rats and make the ore rarerall high qualities of ore or they produce morereally we would just need more corporations to be comfortable with the isk they can make to live out there and put up with pirates eventually it would lead to 1 of 2 thingseither the corps get blobbed out by pirates that refuse to take losses most likely or 2 corps get themselves situated out there and try to take some pockets and bottlenecks to rat and mine in if its 1 then pirates can make some more isk as well as being more vulnerable to antipies while making that isk if its 2 then the corps may evolve in skill and actually enjoy the random pvp aspect of it and defend their home areas in low sec from other corps if a small increase doesnt work increase it againit will draw some attn id say 10mil an hour ratting in a decent sized system would compete with passively running level 4s in a raven without looking at your screen hardly ever not counting salvage plus the level 4s in low sec do pay out better also but can get a bump as well

i think this is painful problem to most of pvpers and i am personally tired of this useful ability in most cases capitals use self destruction to dramatically reduce to minimize profit for opponentsas result those who killed sd capital gets nothing no loot no killmail etcbut what does it cost to capital pilot he gets very nice insurance payout and no killmail which can show that he is unbelievable noob who lost a carrier to industrial ship or something like that main issue is that capital ship now can avoid true loss in the majority of situations and no matter is he attacked by small hac gang or good battleships gang his active tank allows him to live long enough to finish self destruct procedure and leave opponents holding the bag except large 00 blobsthis problem is in csms plans for discussion 
agreed
1 no i dont like this maybe if applied to all ships to dicourage selfdestruct in combat needs to be loocked at carefully2 sure3no point if first point is implemented 10 minuts seems absurdely long to me so no on this one 4 yes as alternative to 1 but cannot be used together with 1 5 yes as alternative to 1 and  4 but they cannot be all used together
like everything else in eve what a player may try to obtain can be denied from them sding denies the aggressor the km and rightfully so irc ccp has stated that the lack of km for sd is working as designed and i for one can completely agree with them sorry but bring more dps or htfu in eve nothing is given to you and you have to take the initiative to obtain what you wantnothing makes me happier than pilots tears from not getting their precious km even better yet is when they fake said km because they earned iton the issue of insurance i agree with you to a degree but sd is a legitimate game mechanic for a number of reasons such as getting stuck some missions ect ectnothing is more pathetic than lazy pilots demanding to be given something that has been taken from them hmmm this sounds really familiar like pilots complaining about salvage not being theirs maybe
couldnt have said it betternot supported
i think that people who kill capitals arent doing it for the loot its a not a serious argument to make against self destruct optioni see how self destruct option is kind of a downer for the gank squad lets face it its only used by victims of overwhelming force but it puts a nice twist on the whole pvp scene and it goes well with eves core theme of hurting people
meh i dont like self destruct right now for the simple reason that the person who is doing so is having his cake and eating it he is able to deny all loot the killmail and he gets his insurance payout its a winwin scenario for the self destructer now i couldnt give two hoots about the killmail or the loot as long as the person doing the self destructing gets hit in the balls by it figuratively speakingfor those saying htfu and bring more dps really gents you want to encourage more blobby behaviour
then why current csm have selfdestruct balancing on their issue list as major issue for this yearthe topicstarter personally participated in killing of 10 carriers and his corp participated in killing or killed 16 not mentioning numerous others which selfdestructed and not mentioning that he in sum have more than 700 killson the other side you have 36 kills for all your lifetime which is very very small number and 15 stupid lossesso you have no right to say sorry but bring more dps or htfu because youre in fact totally incompetent in common pvp not talking about killing carriersare you piloting a carrier to be happy about it do you ever selfdestructed oneif not youre just yet another carebear theorist which enjoys posting his incompetent opinion
i dont see it as encouraging blobs but when you dont have enough dps to kill them in time you might not get the kill mail no need to whine about it move on and find the next target
if its a win win to self destruct why dont you do it more oftenlike when your territory is being attacked simply self destruct and all your troubles go away the enemy gets nothing so they would be too discouraged to come in the first place right
wait whatnope there are tons of carriers doing lv5 missions in lowsec and some of them factiondeadspace fitted and u dont need large amount of dps to kill it on a mission in example today we 3 bs with neutralizers drake and dramiel have caught natos on angel mission in iges but he self destructed on 50 of structure no loot no km wtf and this kind of stuff happens all the time
your ideas are almost as bad as the ops in fact in some ways they are worse
i like how they dont actually solve anything either im sure there are greifer corps who would be perfectly happy to skill up some low sp alt pilots and just do it with t1 mods and hulls insteadnewsflash dav sps are really only part of pvp arguably not even that big of one certainly not the main part
sounds groovy the tax thing though maybe a way to autocollect alliance fees like an office rental style just a thought

that table is nice but misleading two words alloy compressionnow try to guess how much that skewed the datastealth edit i was going to leave it at that but i feel a rant coming oneveryone babbling about the economist being clueless needs to get it through their heads he doesnt work for you his job is not to print out little graphs showing what you should invest in next he will not be giving you sure fire tips on where to invest on whats hot and whats not if ccp did go down that road it would be a madhouse ie you are all a bunch of mindless lemmingsthat said i have nothing against generic information being released generic as in non specific like it has been last thing we need is the official ccp economy guy telling all you twits that alloy x or mod y is going up
a worthy proposal the numbers previously relased are propably somewhat misleading for example i compressed few days ago 212 mil trit 50 mil pyer 20 mil mex and some other higher end minerals and then melted em down today just to save few freighter trips to for moving all that around 122 to 130 compression ratios are possible and used on regular basis when moving minerals
yes if only to show the world exactly how badly broken the mineral production really is 
knowing someone that recently had their account hacked all shipsmods melted and the mins sold so ccp wont return anything i totally approve of this kind of security measure
anyone speak klingontamber
you have my supportlets kick things up a notchbam
very observant and this is the truth i personally asked ccp who are the people responsible for fw there is noone responsible when game design is confronted with any fw matter they go this is not my responsibility and im already assigned to x and the issues the csm send to them end up in limbo as they do not get assigned to any teamsame thing with bug fixing there is noone sitting on the other end to pick up fw bug issues gm people do not know how the fw mechanics work either so when confronted with bugsexploits these tickets do not get resolved properly eitherfw needs a team permanently assigned to it period
i support the motion to revisit fw and fix the purpose and mechanic of plexinghowever there must be a general scope review from capabilities of npcs with their ewar for example to standingslp gains for doing fwi would like to see fewer quantities of npcs in plexes but a bit more dangerous with not only jammingdampeningdisruptingpainting ewar but warp scrambling and webbing too with long range and short range weaponry on all factions and with plexes that do look like real military garrisons maybe stasis towers neutering towersexecuting fw missions which i have is a bridge between missioning and real pvp but real militia corps do not gain the war by running them they win the war by capturing systems and killing opposing fleets please take these concepts into consideration
there are a few bugs in faction war that need to be fixed but i think fw gets a low priority because its not seen as really important to players wallets you dont lose anything tangible when you lose systems whereas if there are bugs in null sec players are losing large amounts of isk while i agree that any bugs should be fixed i cant see how this is somehow more urgent than other bugs as far as a larger fix well everyone has different often contradictory ideas about what that should be more npc involvment less npc involvement etc i would like to see people propose real things that they would like to see fixed as opposed to vague requests for more attention for me i would like to see a few more faction war exclusive items
personal pos is not that bright idea i would prefer tho system where one corp can transfer the ownership of tower to another corp thru some system or the very least fix the friking acsess rights to tower so that i dont have to keep several altcorps and altalliances around just for empire towersedit support added just for the heck of it
this proposal has been entirely overhauled to include 50 less sucknew proposalhello everyone id like to outline a system that ive drafted up to severely hamper macro mining in eve and hopefully return eves economy to a healthy statemacro mining has historically been somewhat of an arms race between the bots and ccp ccp bans accounts and the botters acquirehack more while i applaud ccp for initiating and maintaining such a vindictive effort this neverending story needlessly ties up ccps resources and only merits shortterm success while i initially thought justice could be served via actual players this was simply to hard to implement without opening up a can of griefing worms what follows is a somewhat longwinded explanation of my revised idea read onas the macro issue has long been a scourge to the players of eve it is time to acknowledge it amongst the people of new eden by identifying it as a rogue drone invasion or otherwise sentientartificial threat ccp would be able to combat the macroers within the game itself without breaking immersion macroing hulks et al would be understood within the game universe as compromised by rogue drone forces criminal hackers or other scifi whathaveyous this perceived threat would allow for the creation ofindustrial policecreate an npc force of industrial police an extension of concord who in empire space fly between belts of various systems and scan any ship that has fired a mining laserstrip minermining drone at an asteroid in the last five minutes this scan would consist of what is essentially a captcha image presented to the miner in a popup window modified of course to fit the eve designlore this would need to be filled out within 15 minutes upon successfully entering the code the police units would leave the miner to his business and continue scanning other ships if however the miner fails to enter the code correctly the police units would be able to request that the miner cease mining operations in the area further attempts at mining in the same region would be met with concord aggressioni must stress that a these captcha images must be easy to read and b that the pilots are given several tries to accurately respondit is also important to note that the frequency of these vessels should be both entirely random and also able to respond to player reports of suspected botting whether the units are randomly spawned similar to npc pirates or are actual roaming entities does not really matter they should however be fairly consistent while not being an overt nuisance for average players they should also remain in the beltarea if the miner were to dock up this is to prevent macroers from simply dodging the policei know its not perfect but its as best of a solution i can think of short of an entire overhaul of the mining system which come to think isnt that bad of an idea in itself but some sort of challengeresponse test should be incorporated into mining and this is one way to do that with mining in its current implementationas a miner myself its frustrating to have to compete with what is essentially people generating isk for nothingtldr concordokken the macro minersthoughts
really a new ideaand as i said the last time  no
darius  lets form a new industrialist police force that would keep these idiots from proposing ideas that destroy industry by harming the legit ones ehoh that means hell no to you op
you dont need to justify macro mining in roleplay terms what is wrong with you
what about macro ratters they are a bloody pain as soon as you enter system they are goneone option dont allow use of cloaks but only on specialised ships but everyone will cry about thisbut having police checking all the time may be a processing issue thats alot of checking constantly think of all the people mining at the same time also what you if you get a massive mining op with say 50 playersthe best thing to do is firstly petition it and to be honest when i have done this ccp have check it out cos in about 2 weeks i never saw them again also if they are in your space then you have to do your bit a patrol the systems yourself keep doing it they will movewhat you got to remember is as well its rare you find a hostile macro  either ratting or mining so if they are system then just go start ratting yourself or mining as all they do is hide and cloak up eventually log so really they shouldnt even impact on your mining or rattingand if you wasnt there before then you wasnt using the system so what difference does it make if they macro or not so to speakyes this maybe a isk issue but help remove them yourselves and thats the solution you see macros make an effort to remove them yourself
and what of all the legitimate albeit stupid afk miners who set up before going shoppingand what of all the legitimate miners who are chewing the fat over a nice juicy beltno one their right mind would ever want to penalise another to the extent you seem to want there is a reason why ccp is trying with questionable success to minimize the damn popupsthere is no easy fix to automation in games best one can do is make it so bothersome to set up that fewer people make it through with sanity intact random belt spawns rather than static surprise rat spawnsetc
or we just wait for ring and comet mining where ccp said that you cant macro it
or planetary interation and besides you dont think macroers can take care of your code  ya you added one step to the program and annoyed the hell out of the rest of the real miners way to go someone pod this guy 
i did some interruption of macros once or twice by convo spamming them but hek thats costs me isk maybe if it was 0 cspa or wotever to convo bomb them and then be able to pop them without having to worry bout being wardecd or corded and then loot the bots stuff more live players would get involved maybe
i could see the captcha going into effect not just for miners though captcha pops up after a certain amount of time in game sometimes 2h sometimes 3h never the same everytime sure macros can get a couple hours in of mining before they are logged off and flagged if people want to be online and not at the keyboard mining they arent really playing anywayedit the captcha wouldnt interfere with anything going on onscreen that way pvpers in a fight wouldnt be interupted if the capcha isnt filled in properly within say 15 minutes person is logged that will keep people at their comps playing instead of overloading the game with afks also an afk would be fine for 1015 minutes other than that log off even people running scouts dualboxing can switch back and forth ever so often no harm there if the comet mining can be used to prevent macroingwhy cant they do it for regular mining also funny how many people who try to block attempts to end macro mining are pvpers not for the ganks but because of their alts maybeps op drop the indy police bit that part really does sucksupported
if you still believe that captchas prevent anything you are pretty naive captchas count as broken
rather than constantly putting down any attempts to stop macro mining how about try to help with it or at least give up your macro account name for fun seriously and dont give the usual i think im a badass so ill post some stupid  kind of post reply to this why you think macro mining should be legit since you constantly put down any attempts to help end it and never give any positive posts to assist in ending it
suicide gank the miners works for me how about youcommon sense has nothing to being a bad ass captcha are broken and annoying in the web already no need to annoy people in game with it
he didnt say macro mining should be legit you asshathe said it would disrupt legitimate minerscan you read because im starting to think your just more upset over the macro mining than anything
i support this i think macromining in highsec should be legal but since its not ccp needs to do something about it even if that will hurt the amount of subscriptions they get this solution would discourage both automated macroing and human macroing ie afk mining
reported for encouraging the violations of the eula
if someone cant handle a popup or two that takes a few seconds of their time every few hours while theyre mining than they are most likely afk or bottingits not exactly the 1st amendment that we would be giving up here mining as it stands is a very relaxing activity as long as it was done in an immersible way i dont see any issuesi wouldnt be surprised if someone told me that the majority of the mined ore comes from people who do abuse the rules as it simply isnt feasible to compete with macroers at this pointyou dont see any automation in games where the interactive nature of them outpaces the complexity of simple programs if captcha really is the son of satan to everyone than perhaps we should be looking at ways to increase the extent to which a miner is involved with miningit cant remain as is to say the least
macro mining is an inseparable part of eve at this point most large 00 alliances would lose a lot of their poses if they didnt have access to cheap and plentiful fuel mined by macros in high sec their industrial divisions cannot produce the amount of fuel needed for poseswhy do you think ccp introduced jump freighters to make it easier for 00 alliances to import the mass amounts of minerals fuel and t1 goods produced in empire by macro minersdont get me wrong i dont support macros at all im just calling it like i see it back in 06 i started this game with industry and mining as my chosen profession and i spent over a year training for it but then i realized that i just cant compete with guys that have their macros on from dt to dt every day i could carve out a battleship every few days where a macro miner could spit out 3 a dayid like to see macros gone but i just dont think itll ever happen most of eve wants to pvp not make ships but every ship lost in pvp was made by a player every t2 ship was once a blueprint mined from asteroids invented from datacores and a t1 blueprint harvested from a moon cynojumped out to 00 in the timeline of a ships journey through the sandbox its flight in pvp is only a small wedgeeh this is starting to sound kinda rantishin short ccp ignores macros because macros keep their game running dey took muh jooorbedit bring back jihadswarm 3
no no and damned well noi wish all you mob who suggest boostingfixing active tanking modules in preference to boosting the active tanking bonus would get it through your thick damned skulls that the issue here is not the mobule but the tanking bonus balanncecurrently the 5lvl resist bonus is superior in almost every way to the 75lvl rep bonus there is a margin a very very small margin that a repair bonus is superior in raw dps tank this btw is the case even if the resist bonused ship goes active tank alsoif you boost the active modules it wont change a thing the resist bonused ships will still be superior because they can fit the same modulehence why the op asks for a repair bonus increase then at least the repair bonus will have a clear superiority in smaller engagements and not by a huge amount and certainly not a game breaking amount but a clear enough difference to make it worth using a vulnerable tank such as an active bonuswere not here to fix active tanking modules were here to fix active tanking ships
so you are saying that these active tank bonused ships are fine atmeven when fitted with such modulesthen why do you want to boost them just because they have different bonus than other ships it makes no sensebonuses are different ship to ship that doesnt justify that bonuses have to equal to eachother only ships performane mattersand as you said these ships work fine as they are nowif they are fine there is no need to boost themwere not here to fix active tanking modules were here to fix active tanking ships then at least the repair bonus will have a clear superiority in smaller engagements so you just want to make you ships the only ships reasonable for smaller engagements awesome for balance what i see is that you want your active tanked minmatar ships even betterbut these are fine and such a change would make them opthou i agree that some active tank bonused gallente ships are weak and should be boosted but then there is the ship hull is the problem not the bonus itselfbetter slot layouts and fittings could fix them easily
ahh you still dont understand i cry for your parents hope they didnt putmuch into your educationi will try one more time to explain the situation to you although i doubt you will read itcurrently with the way resists incoming dps tanked dps time and cap use if an active tank bonused ship and a resist bonused ship both fitted an active tank the active bonused ship would only be superior by about 2 in tank however as soon as both ships have to disable their rep due to cap the resist bonused ship wins out the superiority of the active tank bonused ship is also only within a very small window of incoming dpsnote if a small gang vs small gang situation had both gangs with a logistics cruiser the resist bonus ship would be vastly superior than an active tank bonused ship negating even the minor superiority of active tank bonused ships in small engagementsonce the incoming dps is sufficient enough ie medium sized engagements and up the resist bonused ship is superior by a great deal in all situations because an active tank ceases to be viable rr ehp and for small ships speed are the only accepted tank for those larger engagementsbecause the resist bonus is so far and away superior in the vast majority of pvp not that i gripe about balance in tanks for large engagements it is only fitting that active tank bonused ships were equally superior in small engagements as resist bonused ships are in large engagementsps if you dont understand this then sod off your a waste of forum bandwidth
i wondered when youd tip up in this thread spilling your man juice and love for the rokh everywhere im not just refering to the hype but all ships with this bonusill refer you to nian banks post he put it quite well
signed
vv
in small gangs the maelstrom is pretty damn close to the rokh in tank the maelstrom has the cap advantage making it better if it has to tank a long time so say you get your 10 boost per level thats only 125 more boost with bs 5 thats less than popping a blue pill if your arguement is to make active tanking viable in smallmid size gangs then you better ask for a bigger buff even with hg crystals right now my active rokh still melts in larger fights as it should so imagine if you get a buff to your ships that equals having hg crystals it still wont be enough id be very surprised if ccp buffed active tanking in any way but good luck
mining as profession was discussed on latest summit csm 40 like it was discussed with previous csms there where some ideas tossed around and as far as i understood ccp is looking into itas sokratesz said summer expansion is all about industry and comet mining is in future plans to our knowledge so we should all wait and see how things goalso any ideas on how to improve mining or make it more interesting are welcome if you have any feel free to poke me or send ingame mail
yes please
to be fair this was something i hadnt thought of but lets consider how much it would actually increase ehp of your average hauler probably on the order of 1500 ehp which would come at the expense of cargo capacity tbh i dont think this seriously weakens the suicide gank mechanic

oh my god you sit here and argue however you have 100 no idea wtf you are talking about dcs are not stacking nerfed with anything pull up eft or mess around with the fitting manager in the gamealso using arguments that making it passive would cause extra server load is one of the dumbest standpoints i have seen this yeardo you know how the code works nope do you know that items cant be sepperated from the effect of skills nope so stfu and stop talking out your ass like you have some knowledge about how the game works when you are clearly making it all up just to support your trolly argumentative banternow for my opinion no dc does not need to be passive its already the most powerful low slot tanking item in game why do we need to make it even more powerful
do you behave like this in real life because maybe you should keep reading this before flipping out all of my points were absolutely valid points until it was determined that a it is seperated from the skills already so any extra load it causes already exists and bthe stacking nerf does indeed impact its shield and armor resistances just not its hull resists since there are no hull resistance modules ie if you have 20 resist and add in a hardener to get it to 50 and add in a dcu you only get 5 more which would be about right with the current mechanic of an 87 reduction in effectiveness for the hardening bonus of the dcu on top of the standard reductionits a debate moron try to keep up in a debate i can be pursueded however most people dont think of such basic things when they shout there ideas to the eve community such as opportunity cost and load so i point those out regularly if you dont like it then dont visit the assembly
although deuro dc is an active module defacto it is a passive module as it has no capacitor consumption even if you are neuting a frigate with a battleship you will not shutdown the damage control it consumes 130 gjs which is literally nothing that means every time it it being activating there is an unnecessary request to the server as it does not serve a practical purpose no i do not want it to be passive because of afkers we are not fighting afkers by making uncomfortable ui red raider please you are trolling so bad it hurts he is not complaining he points out how obviously stupid your argument is i really hope that you are trolling
i only behave like this in rl to people who are so ignorant about their own interpritation of facts that they think they are right when they are 100 incorrect dcs do not have any stacking penalty what so ever you sit here and type about how assembly hall is about debates when this simple fact is not up for debate because it is a factthe debate is do you think dcs should be passive modules and i have already stated my rather simplistic point of view no the debate is not about if dc has a stacking penalty because it does not the  of resistance added by the dc is based on the meta lvl of the dc and has no other modifier try it out put on 2 hardeners then put a dcuii on after if my resistance on thermal is 618 2x eanmii and i put on a dcuii it increases my thermal to 676 that is a 15 increase the amount of increase to thermal if the dcuii was not effected by a diminishing returnstop trolling already youre not good at it 010
even if you are right its irrelevant and you very well may be right but i honestly dont care also if you are saying that 58 is a 15 increase then you need to rework your math but thats not a central issue here if you pay attention i am not the one who started the resistance argument that was the op stating that passive resists are not affected by the compensation skills and i corrected him then he went off on a tangent just like you are on funny how that works are we alt posting nowmy point in being against it as a passive module has already been resolved and thus i supported the op in the end it doesnt matter because the afk hauler hitch will probably kill it anyways though i honestly dont understand why you wouldnt just equip a webjammer to resolve that problembut oh well keep railing against me for debating a topic it wont make me stop
qft
get out not only are you an idiot or a troll you also are incapable of basic math lets make dcs passive current situation is pointless
you just made my friday this would be a possible solution to prevent abuse  maybe something like a concord history showing when you have incurred the wrath of concord or if you have failed to complete a contract etc
precisely the reason this is a pointless exercise goonnoobs or whoever will have their whole alliance increase the rep of someone for no reason whatsoever
ive been trying to figure out a system like this that could work in eve for about 3 years nowno luckcerbus
because goons are the only people in the game who would abuse a system like this you people jesus wept
no
that answer does not make a whole lot of sense
there is a difference between a glitch and a mechanic this is not a mechanic frustration its obviously a glitch when it comes to groupingnow if your going to just poke fun and laugh then go right on ahead im sure the mods will love to ban a few more trollsi dont have a problem with inconsistent rates i dont even mind having to reload in the middle of a fight so long as its the same crystal setbut having to switch to a different crystal set then switch back again just to pick up a replacement crystal seems a bit unintended as far as mechanics goall other ammo types just reloadits like having to reload nuke rounds but in order to do so i have to shove in plasma before i can reload nuke roundsand yes all other ammo types dont behave like crystals fine but the principle is the sameyoud throw a fit about it if the situation was reversed regardlessagain i dont mind the nuisance of reloading different guns and different rates just doesnt make sense that it doesnt follow the same basic pattern for all other gunsif anything its a glitched mechanic when it comes to grouping and not necessarily the gunif the guns where not grouped it wouldnt be an issue as the one gun would stop while the others keep cycling and it will likely mean i just have to do thatonly issue is the damage is inconsistent and tends to vary more when individually firedthat and its not as cool looking
i prefer to lob missiles at things but i hear you on the cool looking aspect i sometimes wish i could keep my missile launchers in one big group for mechanics reasons but have the launchers ripple fire them 1 second apart cause a buncha missile launches look cooler then one launchin regards to shooty things when those lasers are in a group and you right click on it is there an option to reload or reload all
i know what you mean grouping missile launchers just doesnt work for a number of reasonsas to your question the auto reload is always turned on and asking it to reload causes an error dont recall the message but it didnt make sense to begin with
the user interface is extremely cluttered  to the point where by doing anything simple can become tedious and slow and very painful to do anything quicklyso i propose you extend functionality thats already there for some on the iconsthe functionality thats already thereclick on fitting window pops upclick on fitting again popped up window closesextend this to the remaining icons a lot of the time people click on the wrong icon and have to move the mouse over the to the x on the window to close it its annoying as hell when u open the market and cant close it lazily
combat scanner probeye i believe this should work as its name ie put an option on the probes like in people and places and market  search in order to scan down specific players or corps otherwise it is basically used to scan down ships randomly really good for privateers just looking for anyone not really practical as a combat scanner probe imho or maybe change the description to very popular amongst privateers for general probing did not the snoop scanner probe do this  scan specific i dont remember been a few yearsminesye also i hear they do not work anymore  i have only seen them once in market dont remember what system but i believe with all the fuss about players salvaging others kills and what not they would be very practical to use to mine the area to make it a bit more difficult and challenging for salvagers to do so mines could be set to fof or just set to genrally kill anything in range except to the player who launched it of course with option to retrieve them back or not just leave them for the next salvaging privateer or the next mission looting privateer heh lol now i realise they were once in use but i dont know what the specifics were and that they no longer work should bring em back imho
phail its called a locator agent

your missing the point plexes which were born when a gtc was converted are ingame item in game items are bound by rules of the game and not insert random countries trade laws heregtcs are not in game items they legally could be bound by insert random countries trade laws im not sure if ccp even has the authority to regulate gtcs once they are bought i could buy some from a site then sell them for cash on ebay if i sold a fraudulent code for a gtc on ebay i would be facing fraud charges its not a real stretch to say you could end up facing fraud charges for selling fake gtc codes through other communication mediums eve chat includedtldr gtc time codes are a tangible real life commodity subject to all sorts of laws only after it is converted to plexes does it become an in game item and subject only to eve law

i posted this thread on the fi board which was met with good responsein its most basic form change the balancing approach from thist1meta1meta2meta3meta4t2to thismeta1meta2meta t2t1t2meta3meta4meta t2more detail in the fi post obviouslythe caveats would beto handle the invention boost issues caused by removing certain meta items as they would become redundant and also that under the current invention boost mechanic a single meta module would be considered best which is not in line with the spirit of this proposalhandling the faction meta types in line with the spirit of the proposal this would be based heavily on the result of testing and balancingwhilst this proposal does not target a specific module group any mention of specific module groups is purely for example this would be a change in the general aim of the balancing effort to add more choice to the players experience
no t2 is already just a very high meta of t1 and meta is just bridging the gap between them so you dont have to train all the way to t2 to get almost the same thing t2 needs to stay as its own plain and simple if you want something more seek out complex and commander modules

given ccps past willingness to award characters or accounts special gifts zephyr apotheosis snowball launchers  it seems that itd help break up the long hard slog from new years holiday to labor day international may 1st or memorial day usa last monday in may if ccp awarded something fun in the spring april 1st known as april fools day in the west seems like as good a day to celebrate as any other nonreligious holidaymy modest proposal for this years april fools day award would be a roll of duct tape in the hold of every assembled minmatardesigned ship and possibly minmatar hybrids like the daredevil additionally ccp should make duct tape a new consumer trade good sold in some minmatar corp stations you know that minmatar pvp pilots would buy it to put in their ships holds hello isk sink yeah i know it would be a trivial sinkmdd
fun yes i would always have duck tape in cargo since my exotic dancers need a restin rust we truste
me and my 18 characters support this idea just too lazy to add there all the 18 thumb ups so count this one as 18 will ya
an additional increase in the neutnos amount would be nice
the pilgrim would be useless if the nuet amount bonus was changed to a range bonus you would have no way of eliminating the cap of a larger target fast enough to keep it from killing you firstthis is idea would reduce the pilgrim from a battleship killer to an antiinterceptor platform a slightly less useless rapierpeople keep bringing this up the pilgrim has to commit to a fight but it is capable of taking down larger tougher targets than any other force recon if you cant handle getting up in the targets face please do yourself a favor and buy a cursepeople who have no idea how to fly pilgrims need to stop making suggestions about changing them
maybe replace the combat bonus by the mentioned range bonus i know it will break the recon ships standard bonuses blah blahanyway revamp is needed signed

i tried to search for a forum posted under my name today and it would not come up although i have had 2 postings this last week under my name i was able to search through page by page and eventually find it i would suggest implementing a simple search by poster that would allow you to find quickly a posting from a character you are looking for i was trying to find this in a hurry because someone hacked my account and was trying to sell my character either way it would not take that much work to implement and would be very helpful in future searches
why does it make sense edwardnardella its all very well complaining that naysayers dont have a reason to say no even though its been clearly explained by a few posters but its not like those supporting have anymore reason other then their own personal satisfaction so take your ad hominem and stuff it

i suppose it is annoying p although why would you buy a ship you cant fly with things on it you cant fly  thats not smart at all lol
its true that there need of course be ways to make more money in 00 than in empire for the average player  this was discussed and several ways were proposed
have you considered that attack on a smaller renter alliance would in fact be an attack on their overlords signing a treaty does not have to mean you get sov and everything else but does give you the rights to use certain parts of someones space this kind of agreements already exist in game its just they are not lets say official some alliances allow others to farm in certain parts of their space usually one constellation and kill them on sight if they do it in forbidden areas even if they are blue this kind of system would just make this kind of scenario easier
may i suggest this one gets looked at
520 supports  how many more do you need ccp git r done
really hope theyll do it in new expansion
there will never should never be perfect balance between races if gallente got buffed itd be complaints about caldari if caldari got buffed wed hear whines about amarr being slow as crap and having terrible trackingyes your ideas have merit in fact blastersrails are in many ways weaker than other weapons but not gamebreakingly so imo quit wasting time on buffingnerfing weapons if you want to talk about something that could use rebalancing how about the completely disproportionate use of falcons over other recons but thats another threadif you want to keep wasting time making sure that no weapon system is the weakest sure boosting blasters is the way to go while were at it can we start planning ahead on how to boost missiles

supportedsound should deserve a better treatment i mean eve online is probably one of the only games today where it is better to get sound off as it is nearly off by itself anyway or too buggy to be usedalso ccp should include the possibility to customize sounds
indeed some of us do have sound enabled fully supported
supported
i support fixing the sound id really like it to be like it was back in empyrean age where you heard everythingon the same note though the new engine is aimed for a more realistic approach would it not be so hard to include an option to choose between the two sound schemes
also gives alliances more reason to use their space i like it
of course
more ways to support interaction ftw
thats the whole point of the topic  the body in the carrier can deny enemy everything but loses nothing from it  he can cancel self destruct at any moment he gets insurance and receives no penalties for initiating the selfdestructno they just dont understand that unproperly fitted carrier can be killed with relatively small gang but selfdestruct in that case gives carrier pilot 100 useful ability with no penaltiesand so what next target will selfdestruct toobad fat troll its a winonly situation for victim if he is already tackled which is the situation discussed in this topic
ok i forget some some carebears misuse the carrier for mission runningand im all for the inhumane treatment of carebears but theres gotta be a different way than messing with the self destruct for caps across the board maybe modify missions so they dont allow carriers to finish them after all npc rats deserve better treatment too more than some carebears
why treat the leg when in fact its the ear that is in the pain
i support it
110 i thought you quit anyway
agreed cap pilot diying in a blob by focusing dont have an ability to take his ship out without casualties why moron caught by small fleet must have one if you need to get your insurance  do it somewhere on spot with adequate timer
singed
agreed
sounds like good idea supported
irl if there was one like eve if i was going to lose my ship i would set self destruct and gtfo i dont want technology getting into enemy hands if anything make the timer last longer like 5 minutes
signed
agreed
selfdestruct maybe used to deny loot that is fine with me killmail needs to be sent out
i think the self destruct timer should be based on ship size classif the ship reaches the end of the timer then no kill mail should be issued to anyoneon another note of the whole he selfdestructed and is getting to have his cake and eat it too crap since when was anyone able to make a profit off a fully fit carrier or dread when is fit take into account the amount of isk to buy the insurance and the cost of the mods fighters drones rigs you get the ideaonly t1 crap fit nonrigged t1 ships that are subcapital are you able to pull this off and not on all of themthey are still out isk especially on capital ships not to mention the logistics of getting said stuff replacedin closing i am in support of the timer being adjusted based on the ship size itself i have had many ships selfdestruct on me when i was unable to kill them in the 2 minutes but i shrugged it off and moved on with my life maybe it is time for you to do the same
support it
no the whole whine point is about something entirely different ask yourself a question why the loot drops when killing ships in eve because among other things its reward for the winnerbut with capitals we have alwaysworking nopenalty ability accessible to anyone despite their skillpoints ship state or state of battle that allows victim to deny this entire aspect of game loot drop  killmail generation i think that is fundamental reason why csm plans to discuss selfdestruct balancingalso i agree with you that making sd timer dependent on ship size and making it more big for capital ships is most easy and rational way to nerf self destruct but i also think that killmail must be generated nevertheless for proper counting of kills and losses on killboards
you assume ccp cares about killmail and killboards but they dont
agreed
yes they care much about it if they dont theyd havent implemented killmail portion of eve api via which most of modern killboards receive killmails nor they have had implemented ingame display of corporation kills and losses almost ingame corporation killboard
agreed
i think 15 min sd sequence for caps will solve most of the problems you either have 15 mins if the victim logs or if the victim sds also there should be a notification that a cap started sd sequence
self destruct should do a few thingscreate a wake damage similar to a smartbomb over for a capital of say 30kmr smaller of course for smaller ships putting out a damage of 13 the sd ships total base hp across all damage typesthere should be a killmail generated with the last pilot to land a blow prior to sd receiving it the pilot of the ship would be on that killmail with the weapon listed as self destruct initiator no damageinsurance payout as normalim torn as to weather all modulescargodrones should be destroyed or all drop but either way it should be all not just a random collection if all drop they are all damaged regardless
you should stop posting you are terriblei wasnt implying that the cap ship pilot is making money out of it ill spell it out for youyou are doing an anomolyjump to a cyno at an ssundock from a kickout in your carrierdread and somehow most likely due to an iodine deficiency or extra chromosone get caught out by a 6 man hacrecon gang you scream in alliance but noone is around to help they are nibbling away at you and while you can tank them you dont think it will last at least not until backup can arriveoption a let them kill you embarrassing killmail generated aggressors scoop your precious mods but you get your insurancelets call that 21 in favour of the aggressoroption b self destruct no embarrassment and humiliation on your alliance killboard no loot to the aggressors and you get your insurancelets call that 30 in favour of the self destructorthis is what is flawed with the system at least one of the parts of option b should be changed either make it so that there is some record of a self destruction enable some or all modules to drop or deny the self destructor his insurance thats called balance mate
i doesnt take all that to sort it out apply it to all ships and be done with it removed the freeisk gimmick to boot1 no insurance on sd2 mail to top damage dealer3 loot drop slightly reducedbasically make it into the time honoured naval tradition of scuttling ones ship rather than having it captured
but youre implying that the pilot is losing nothing the pilot loses his ship and all of the modules and dronesfighters attached to it all of that needs to be replaced the pilot definitely isnt gaining anything hes actually losing quite a bit 31 the loser and his alliance are out a capital ship and have to replace it insurance alone wont cover that21 the aggressors have successfully denied their enemy the use one capital ship so its still a military victory just because they didnt get a killing blow or an epeenstroking text message theyve still completed their objective the destruction of a capital shipthe pilot has to deal with the embarrassment of losing his ship and the logistics of replacing it probably a loss of respect within his organization and they may feel disinclined to help him replace it
signed
the ship is dead anyway so stop harping on about the great loss to the individual fact is in a situation like that where all is lost and you have the time there is absolutely no reason not to self destruct there are no drawbacks or penalties for doing sono even at platinum levels a cap pilot wont make money on a cap ship especially after cap fittings and whatnot but hes not losing anything at all by chosing to self destruct in fact he is gaining by there not being any record of the engagement and hence no loss of respect within his organisation and denying the aggressors their lootthis scales up even further with supercaps its unlikely that an active supercap pilot will lose his ship to hostiles unless he logs off and is blobbed has an appalling fit or faces a massively overwhelming weight of fire in the order of 100 dreads or has a misguided sense of ehonour
this is simply the result of us thinking differently and having different priorities youre looking to earn a psychological victory and enhance your ego through the embarrassment of your target and the record of the engagement im more concerned with the victory itself embarrassment can be gotten over and is worth absolutely nothing if my target or his organization has any sense of perspectiveyour argument is based on the premise that you as an attacker get absolutely nothing from a target that selfdestructs the fact that you dont get a killmail is a problem with the culture not the system youre simply failing to consider that youre still scoring a military victoryyour scenario states he called for backup so his organization knows he came under attack hes a known carrier pilot within his organization so hell at some point have to account for the loss of the ship true with enough money he could simply gloss it over and buy a new ship and outfit it but thats costing a lot again military victory
seriously i put up a constructive argument against your post and you go off on you should stop posting you are terrible cop out replydoes the selfdestruct feature need to be balanced sure does it have to be the lark way nostop being mad lark
the fact of the matter remains you lose absoloutely nothing by self destructing while the attacker loses everythingplease visit your user settings to reenable images
oh my god how dare someone stop an attack from getting a kill mail by self destructing of all the things wrong in eve this is the worst take away a players right to blow up his own ship its just not fairwhat no loot because he self destructed oh my god thats just terrible and unfair to everyone involved in the fight i mean how dare they self destruct their ship and destroy all that loothe got paid for self destructing wow thats just as bad as those gankers who suicide themselves in hisec getting paid too just unreal this need changedchange it change it now ccpoh not supported by the way if youre worried about this then bring a bigger fleet i would seriously be upset if i had to sit for 30 mins while i wait for someone to peck away at my shields and kill me slowly the self destruct is working as was intended and should remain so learn to kill faster and bring more friends
i think its right
agreed
wow everyone is all for getting rid of insurance for an act of defiancewont happen folks until they get rid of insurance for suicidokenimo the sd should cause a pretty nice boom thats sufficient to put a major hurting on the attackers as stoned said but drop the mods as normal
yes yeseverything about this yesbumping for great justice
iirc for day of darkness ii the guy was invited to ccp hq and could use their inhouse tools
oh i like that it is a nice addition
yes i am not reading most of the replies but if it hasnt been brought up i would like to see planet types depend on distance from star ie an ice planet at planet i closest to star doesnt make much sense when you have lava planets very far out last time i checked i believe they were random correct me if im wrong
yes a feature like that would keep so many people in the game too
wouldnt it be nice to just once see an idea for dealing with macrominers that didnt involved boring annoying or otherwise interfering with legitimate miners in the processjust once

theres some good thought at the heart of the concept but the implementation is terrible going off what someone said earlier about random belt rats id go with1 message goes out onto the grid about a pirate patrol being sighted heading out among the asteroid fields2 concord beacon appears3 miner has 10 minutes to activate the beacon which results in concord intercepting the rats4 if the timer expires without interaction a fairly sizeable for hisec rat spawn occurs maybe even up to a battleshipproskeeps things much more immersivemore ratting opportunitiesperhaps a reason to guard hisec mining operations maybe the rats would get stronger the more minerals being mined resulting in a ratfarming crew accompanying a mining crewconsnot particularly hard to add the activate beacon into your macro somewhere but they could take measures to make it annoying to do randomized namesdistanceswhatever
edit actually i changed my response i have come to grips with the fact that ccp is more worried about their numbers of subscribers than keeping the game legit for other players
resurrecting this because well need more player input the current csm lot are all concerned only with their pvp and not a whit about how the builders behind the scenes make all of those items they want to play with except to randomly suicide the fooltheyve got just one industrialist just one and they clearly dont listen to him much at all
supported but im anticipating a lot of blank stares from ccp on this one since it doesnt exclusively involve 00 andor things blowing up
point the finger at the csm not ccp quite a few csm members have already come out and said that they have no interest in industry and that they know next to nothing about it their priorities lie in the combat side of eve one even went so far as to call the industry side of the game overdeveloped and stupid it is more important to get titans firing dds in low sec than it is to represent the entire playerbase
keeping someone elses idea alive

because haulers are so hard to gank atm right the extra 15k ehp will totally imbalance the game
ok math time an ubertanked badger ii 4x mse ii mag scattering amp ii heat dissipation amplifier ii has 141k ehp with max skills three cargo expander iis and no dc with dc ii instead of one of those cargo expanders you get 174k ehp for an itty v the difference is between 127k and 158k ehp but given that people who afkhaul valuable items are not the sharpest knives in the drawer i have serious doubts as to how many would fit their haulers competently and of course fitting with reinforced bulkheads increases tank potential considerablywere talking 25k ehp with a dual structureshield tank on the itty with the dc adding a full 9k ehp but besides meaning you dont have cargo expanders those four reinforced bulkhead iis will slow you down by more than a third making afk autopilot times considerably longeranyway if people are worried about the afk tanking one alternative would be to keep the dc as an active mod but have its cycle time be 24 hours that way you still have to activate it while jumping into a system but it should mean that there is only that one server call per activation which is a whole lot less frequently than once every thirty seconds unless im totally misunderstanding how the server works which is entirely possible
130 gjs is not literally nothing its practically nothing sorry pet hate of mine pi have had my damage control deactivated repeatedly by a curse in a fight a gate camp a while back had to keep flicking it back on think they must have been running a small neut on itim 5050 on this so not supporting
dude you fail 58 is 15 of the difference between 100max resistance and the 618current resistance the 15 is applied to the gap between 100 and 618 or 382 rework youre math and you will find that 58 is the resistance increase of a 15 dcuas for me being an alt of the op really man are you really going to continue this pointless drivel
the problem is that you confuse stacking nerfed with diminishing returnswhat you are speaking of are diminishing returns ie the resistance bonus is applied to the difference between 100 and the current resists so the 10 resist of the dc in your example is applied to the 50 of the resist not already covered by the module you applied first 10505 btw 108787the stacking nerf is a modifier to all of a module modifiers if at least one of is modifier is stacked with another module affecting the same characteristic if you have 4 modules affecting your shield em resistance the first work at 100 efficiency the second at 87 the third at 57 and the fourth at 28 when activating them they are considered in decrescent strength order so the strongest give 100 benefit the second strongest 87 and so on for resists module both the stack nerf and the diminishing return modifiers are in effect with the exception of the dc that is affected only by the diminishing returns
the source engine has one why cant eve it would rid the youtube of all these crappy xfire videos a couple of them being mine admittedly and remove the frapscom label from the videos that are actually goodsure one could pirate the full version of fraps to record but it would be safer and simpler to have an ingame recorder which records demos during gameplay and renders them framebyframe after the user closes the clientthoughts
i dont think anyone knows what source isbut on the subject on hand already raised by csmcheck battle recorderno need to repeat what has been said
just a thought  you could buy fraps
but thats not frreeee
they want to live of something as well not everything you want is free pay the price or dont use it simple rule
no the target never had a chance in most situations atleast he should be able to scam you for his implants its a gamble for him if he dosent pay enough hes risking geting popedalso hes risking giving you any money because theres no guarantee that you wont pop him laterif you want the game to support ransoming wich is currently a player driven feature then the target must have 100 assurance that his pod will be safe after he pays then some severe consequences are needed for a pirate not holding their end of a bargainin shorteither make ransoming a full game feature with all the bells and whistles or dont touch anything

sto hades rest its godforsaken soul had the right idea a separate channel for damage notifications you could even set it to personal gang or fleetjust make a channel out of the notification process and if you want it there it is
totally agreed
ok so before you go off thinking im making ganking legal im not trust me lost my second proteus in a week to a jita ganker  anyways on to the ideai propose we make bounty hunting an actual profession with real isk payout and fun and actually takes work  how we would do this is have an npc ship much like a rat only mobile warp around from system to system not doing anything but that is warping until someone engages him then its an all out fight as if you were fighting a rat the difference is these rats have much higher isk rewards are much harder to kill and are much harder to find as they are always warping and they can go anywhere in eve id suggest they start off deep in null sec and have a more or less guided path towards empire but still at random this would add spice to bounty hunting and you could have all new locater agents to use for this which youd have to work standings up and the agent would give you the nearest target and youd have to track them around and hunt them down now theyd take a little bit to warp so your not chasing a frig in a bs or anything but still not gonna stay in one system for a half hour this would take teamworkluck finding them and would be worth the rewards also no commander or factino loot from null sec cuz its make those empire lovers get the same stuff as null sec so itd inflate prices and make null sec not worth it just stick to the bounty as it is bounty hunting
how the oh and about the idea i fail to see how it contributes to the game since highsec population is incredibly dense the npcs will get picked off by randoms at the first few stargates it jumps thus this bountyhunter profession will not be very viable
well theyll be considerably harder to kill and ya i know i didnt mean to fall asleep while in space at jita ok lol lets not focus on that but i was just bored and trying to think of stuff to liven up high sec make it a bit more interesting and it could still go pretty far cuz people might see them but wont be ready to kill them thus report it to friends who go off and track em not every cruiser and bc can kill them plus id like to add that a good portion of high seccers dont carry scram which is needed to catch the buggers unless your at war in which case you wont usually bother tangling with him
heres some tips 1 dont afk2 dont use autopilot3 dont afk4 dont use autopilot5 dont afk and use autopilotoh and not supported repeat rehash of the same ideas already proposed
did you not listen i fell asleep thats not quite the same as afk ya nub and wasnt on autopilot
so a gun which fires beyond 250km it does a fair bit of damage it also has alot of backfire so like aoe effect like the eryx or fgm148 javelin also obviously not instant travel munitionsit could be put on essentially the 3rd tier dread undockable behemoth of bad aligning the gun could also have an acceleration factor which pushes the ship back perhaps after 5 mins of shooting its moving a nice speed backwards that you cant manage to stop and align out of because of your size
ahh yes and we will use this giant gun to shoot at all the targets we have locked that are over 250km away that wewait i forgot we cant lock anything over 250km away how silly of me
you can fit a rohk to shoot over 250kmand as pointed out above the issue is locking
on another note this brings up a new idea of a new sniper ship that needs a special mod maybe a camera drone to be able to hit people from that far away p needs things like super good tracking and amazing skills large caliber just like real life lol
qfttheres nothing more annoying than a grouped weapon that utterly stops working because one of the crystals broke  this is a nonissue for charges because you always have to reload an identical amount
finally someone who gets itfeel free to rub it in the faces of the people who dont you earned it
you are aware that the weapons would have to be ungrouped to reload seperately rightalso i hear tell that 10 second reload times are completely not frustrating in those nasty little dogfight where the engagement is on a knifes edge and you lose because it takes your arty autos missiles blasters or railguns so long to reloadseriously get over yourself ing about an something where even the labour intensive way to reload takes at most 12 the time that it takes any other weapon system to reload or switch ammo even with this excuse to whine amarr players dont have as long sat there unable to dish out dps as the matar caldari or gallente
you are aware that you need to read the whole post before you respond as it makes you look foolish rightkeep it coming trollsits an obvious fing glitch people otherwise it wouldnt give a bloody errorgo try it for yourself i challenge you go see what happensand honestly i dont give a rip about rping like you guys do so please give it a resti play amarr for fun same as i would for matar or caldari or gallenteall have cons and pros this is not a whine about dps its a complaint about mechanics of grouping and reloadingand if if and thats a big if you read my post youd see i would likely ungroup and resume my gleefull fun of pew pew pew but your too hung up over yourself to get that so none of my concern i guess
the duration idea isnt viable because you cant switch it off during that period eighter
if the practice allready exists how will making it official bring more people into 00
so you see what i mean about treaties being nothing more than a pet tool
i see your point but lets wait what they have to say about it before anybody jumps the gun
you mean when csm plays the nda card on us i will just wait for dev blogs directly from ccp or gold bar comments from ccp anything from csm is like a box of chocolates
a delicious and thoughtful gift
not to mention an aphrodesiac if you believe some people
if women get too much of it they become fat
sssh never tell them that
just bumping it up again to remind ccp what to do else beside fixing lag issues for next patch more input always welcome to speed up the process
if u leave because u cant take what u dish out then thats your problem pvp goes both ways in case u didnt know so once again by all means go ahead and suicide a newb ship if u think its so profitable cause i dont see anyone posting threads crying about having their rookie ship suicide ganked
keep the feedback rollin fellas in the meanwhile up

do it
sounds like a pretty strong argument to me
no support  railguns are intended to have greater ranges but lower damage than lasers which is what they are usually compared to in this thread the argument seems to be based around the fact that the extra range is useless thus simply viewing rails as a lowerdamage version of beam lasersbringing rails towards dps parity would make them overpowered reducing their range to compensate just homogenises them with lasers i dont believe that the arguments in this thread has shown railguns to have a global performance disparity with regards to other longrange turrets that justifies them being improved they are undoubtedly weaker than other turrets in areas where those turrets shine ie alpha strike  arties dps  lasers but stronger in their own niche rangerailguns are indeed worse at being beam lasers than beam lasers are but beam lasers are worse at being rails
hello i was brought over tho this thread by tagami from a ships and modules discussion herei rarely post outside of the ships and modules forum and dont visit either the assembly hall or development forums very often i do however care about the topic and would like to offer some comments and pointersthe damage modifier proposalim not touching the railgun damage modifier proposal at a glance its a fair suggestion and i tend to not concern myself with detailed figures i agree with the notion of taking the edge off some of its extremes though and in that regard its a fair approach to cut range in favour of damage even if that may not sit well with players who rely on spike to compete in sniping people using the deimos for that is a readily available example wether 15 and 70 are the right target values though i leave up to the discretion of tagami and liang the concept i approve ofthe powergrid proposali disagree with the suggestion to pg those figures assume that the pg or overall fitting of the gallente ships is satisfactory while in reality the gallente hybrid platforms suffer pg issues of their own and to some degree the same could even be said about the minmatar muninn in regard to hacs all of those ships are relegated to fitting mods and recurring downsizing to frigate sized modules obviously the eagle is worse off than the deimos which in turn is worse off than the muninn but that doesnt add to the assumption that a deimos would be okay and a good target value for percieved balancein the larger picture the assumption that gallente grid is fine and caldari need to be put in line is a poor basis for suggestions a very simple definition of a good target value is assuming that a ship with a free utility slot should be able to fit something within its ship class for the slot to be deemed effective thats not to say its a bad idea to downgrade to a smaller module but to be limited to that mark a good definition of its shortcommingthe csm proposal and offsite linkthe first thing id do is to focus the proposal on the key matters its good to mention that certain things are affected to different degrees but i think it spends too much time on detailing definitions the different ranges serve a good example since no matter how you approach it you are presenting a definition you are trying to sell to the audience giving an explanation of different ranges is a good reference to provide but focus on things that your audience can relate to in a broader picture0012km1225km2575km75250kmthat is a much more intuitive way to bracket things up and define them by effects rather than how far different ship and weapon sizes can reach after all when you fly a ship ingame you are not limited to just fighting ships of your own size the 0012km range is defined by webs scrams shortmedium neuts and nos their stopping power and the ships that operate within that range and its mobility the second bracket 1225km is defined by common point bubble disruptor ranges that allow mobile mwd fights on grid but not initiating warp to escape grid the next bracket 2575km medium range is defined by a variety of effects from ewar optimals to the base control range of all drones the last range of 75250 km defined as sniping range is where only large long range weapons and range bonused effects occurthe terms scramweb range and point range are widely regarded and stapled within the communityyou might need to define mid in contrast to long range betterfurther attention to detail in that regard just risk throwing attention away from how the propsal relate to range
i believe you miss the point if you think that the proposal is trying to make railslasers rails are quite distinct from lasers they have different damage profile and use both ammo and capacitor rails have all the disadvantages of the other weapon systems ammo volume capacitor consumption bad tracking slow ammo selection without any of the advantages alpha or dps lasers have so much better tracking its not even funnywhat the proposal states is that in order to have parity for the shipsweapon systems in the tactical envelope they engage rails need a damage buff saying that the rokh can hit stuff  250 km when noone engages there is worthlessif you want to compare due to the nature of their bonuses deimos is more akin to munnin while eagle is more akin to zealot mega is more like the pest while rokh is close to the apoc
i agree with that but i think youre overlooking what goes in the other slots its become almost an expectation now not just to fit the highesttier guns but an oversized buffer module as well as a mwd and often cap booster as well something has to give and one mans realistic fit is anothers going too far i dont think there would be any disagreement that there need to be compromises when deciding what to fit  often the utility slot cant fit something like a shipsized neut because all the powergrid has been used elsewhere often with an oversized bufferif you fit a cruisersized ship with mediumtier turrets a single mar or 800mm plate and your mwd  cap booster then id expect you to be able to fit a medium neutnossmartbombwhatever in the utility high if youre upgrading the guns or sticking a 1600mm plate or a second rep then in my opinion youre using up your overhead from a neutral setup and dont really have a right to demand more fittingsthe concept of bracketing ranges based on effects is legitimate and at the very least empirical however unfortunately i dont think these brackets really mean anything or at least let us draw any conclusions theyre very broad and while they do a good job regarding the effects of the modules they cover for example a vagabond typically has to operate outside of 13km they completely miss out all of the modules that arent on the listfor example if a crusader can scramble a taranis and keep the latter at 910km the crusader will almost certainly win if the taranis gets inside of 5km it should be all over for the crusader these are both classed in the same one of your range brackets but yield very different results if a taranis could hit at 10km like it can hit at 3km the result would be very different so i dont see what were gaining by bracketing up the ranges like thisadditionally i would disagree with your upper bracket anyway firstly because ewar modules typically have a falloff longer than optimal so unlike webs and points there is no single cutoff point at which they stop operating but rather a very smooth over which their effectiveness diminishes secondly and arguably more importantly being in or out of this range doesnt give a concrete advantage in the same way that being in or out of pointweb range does i dont know anyone that would relish being able to hit from eg 80km instead of 70km because now theyre outside of ewar rangebesides i dont agree with your description of the upper bracket with respect to weapons  all mediumsized longrange weapons can hit past 75km even on ships without a range bonus at that point unless were discussing small railguns which we dont seem to be so much as medium and large everything gets lumped together into the same single range bracket so what was the point of this againas i posted above i think this uniform range mentality is harmful because it overlooks the utility of extra range if you have a 130km optimal and the other guy has a 100km optimal then thats rubbish if youre 95km apart but amazing if youre 130km apart
it sounds to me like youre trying to use rails in a tactical envelope to which they are mediocre performers why is it worthless to fire on your targets from a position to which they cannot return fire its the equivalent of essentially jamming the entire opposing fleet for the duration of them being out of range and then giving yourself a 60 resistance boost if they manage to burn to their optimalfalloff  that sounds pretty worthwhile to meyour argument is similar in concept if not in scale to comparing shortrange battleship turrets based on starting 45km apart of course the abaddon wins in this situation and loses if the fight starts 5km apartmaking the most of your own strong points while denying your opponent use of theirs is what eves rockpaperscissors is all about
i dont disagree with the rockpaperscissors approach and this is not an effort yo make everything the same with just different skin however you need to take into consideration the application of these concepts on the field if we look at bs class a position 170190km away is just as good as one 230 km away only enemy snipers can reach you and if your support is doing its job only on grid probing can get the enemy fleet to your position it allows the fc to utilise all the ships he has in his fleet and not only rokhs therefore the tactical envelope within we have to consider the ships is pretty much defined by the rest of the fleet compositionsame thing is for hacs or for support railboatsyou can perceive the balance in game by looking at ship utilization really easy you can check kms if you dont take part in 00 fleet warfare in a bs fleet count the number of rokhs apocs pests an megas youll realise that there is no demand for the range advantage of the rokh while most megas gimp their fit decreasing dps to reach the tactical envelope that shows precicely why it is of no worth to the pilot fc to fly have a rokh in fleet megas are more common due to their capability to sport an armor tank keeping with the rr concept for apocs and pests
its a fair concern i give it credit mine is obviously a definition based on trends and trends are not always a good basis for balance either there are other ways that you can relate to though if you want to take a step back and look at the legitimacy for those trends if you assume for example that the armor repairers were meant to be doubled in regard to the combination of shield booster and boost amplifiers or that a cap booster is not an optional module on active tanks  you can see there is more to the argument about pg than just 1600mm have become the norm even for cruisers instead 1600mm have become the norm because fitting 2x 800mm is equally difficult 1600mm is not as oversized as one would assume in that regard most ships after all share a common idea of how many slots make up a certain degree of tankwhat you gain is a general summary that provide an intuitive overview any generalization base on majority there is no perfect definition but as opposed to majority your examples are exceptionsanother way to look at that is by asking yourself four simple questions when you piece together a ship at what range do combat tend to become immobile in most ships at what range do i tend to be forced to commit to stay if i engage at what range do i tend to be able to disengage and escape at what range do i tend to avoid the majority of damage and effectsits not meant to be an exact rule to apply and quench vivid combat but its meant to provide an understanding of what you can expect at a given range from a variety of ships a gang as opposed to a single ship that an interceptor can point from 30 rather than 25 do not detract from the general understanding that you tend to be pointed somewhere in that vicinityi also agree with you to some part on the comment about mid to long range i even put a little disclaimer in my first reply there above you you could easily define mid range as 2570 2580 or 25100 at your own discretion it wont affect the context much though as there are so few effects that are concretely affected by those differences whereas it is important to define a difference between ewar optimal mid and falloff long or bonused long range weapons i choose 75km to pick a well rounded figure its not exact science but a cutoff point shared by recon optimals heavy missiles long range medium turrets on unbonused ships and drone control ranges among other they are not cut at 75km but they are all topped off around that range its alot of effectsin short you shouldnt class your crusader based on how it act against a taranis you should class it based on how it operates in context to any ship or the sum of all
i need to briefly touch on this as wellyou never are though thats the problem ive reiterated that several times in threads on ships and modules you do not magically appear 130km apart and your ship have no means of its own to establish and maintain that range you cant balance ships around the notion that you have a bookmark your opponent do not or that you have a sling providing you warpins while your opponent is not allowed the sameyou see that alot today when snipers fight each other gang a gain a warpin on gang b who responds with warping off and warping back in on gang a at their own optimals who respond again by escaping and reengaging at their preferred range thats why you can never assume an amazing 130km range advantagewhat you can assume is that the game provide natural warppoints up to 100km which is why 100km has become such an important figure for sniper hacs any range beyond that is determined and dictated by tactical measures anyone can have as opposed to an advantage on turret reacha big gang of eagles are no more effective against sniper hacs than a big gang of sniper bs sniper bs have a 13 range advantage with a 150km standard versus a 100km standard but they have little to no means to establish and maintain that range sniper hacs are effective in how they can establish 100km celestial warpin and often maintain their optimals on their own by being relatively above average fast ships and trap other ships in those uniform ranges on gates stations etc that you wish to veer away perspective from obviously i dont want to represent some sort of stale idea that ranges are absolute there is merit to bracketing though as long as the game itself use bracketing by bracket celestial warppoints and stationgate mechanics etc thats also why sniper bs are not extremely effective against sniper hacs and tend to fight to a stalemate rather than a decisive win thats also why the thorium eagle is the best eagle and spike eagles are relegated to a nische  twice the damage at half the range on a range you can control is better than half the damage at twice the range on a range that you cant control its easy to forget that one of the strongest assets of fighting around 100km is that you cant be warped to from the killzone eg a gate even if tackle and bubbles fail

killmail and loot denial is a valid form of counterintelligence and should still be possibleif self destructing really is such a problem then how about this when a ship activates self destruct all modules go offline because the crew members who normally keep them operating are running for the escape pods this still makes self destruct an option but it gives the attackers a better chance of killing the target before the timer ticks down
those alternatives nothe first set is excellent ccp can make selfdestructs spit out a shiploss kmail with nullattackers right like npc losses but a differentadditional placeholdervictim blows loot gets his insurance real imba issue suicide ganks in hisec pay insurance to criminal flags attackers get to link to him blowing up his ship their names and selfdestruct order on mailcant penalize a person who has decided to go down fighting its be like a kamikaze pilot bring less gas on his plane knowing he is going to simply aim it at some enemy and ram it not logical if he kills the attackers he should be able to cancel his selfdestruct just like any rational combatantscorched earth policy is a legitimate total war policy if eve is a sandbox it cannot be denied if it is denied this is closer to hello kitty onlineproblem solved carry on about your day
if implemented there would have to be a way to prevent corp and alliance taxes to summing to more than 100 perhaps have the alliance take a chunk of corp taxes
i see a problem with this idea it will tax again the same people that are taxed at corporation level and not tax the same people that avoid the tax at the corporation levelif it was something like a per head tax levered on the corp wallet it would probably be more balanced as the corp would then see that the member give some for of contribution work or isk or whatever they want worth his presence in the corporation so supported as a general idea not as a percentage of the npc rewards and bounties as for the corp tax

well that could be missused alot if you make a lot of money out of scamming you probably would not like to stand out from the crowd by being red solution flag everyone else as scammers if you and your corpmates flag random people as scammers then you really cant be singled out anymore and it would turn into a mechanic that tells you if someone has been in jitaand you really cant expect ccp to enforce a unjust scammer flag and even if they did what really is a scam is probably a personal experience i mean if someone who havent been playing for a year pops in and sell their t3 modules to a price they thought were resonable a year ago  they would probably be called a scammer todayalthough i would appeciate a working report scammer since jita local is a  i cant see how it is supposed to be done though reporting of isk sellers work because its such a blatant breach of the eula and that there is a hint that misuse will lead to ban while begging lies and deciet might be immoral by some standards  its within the laws of the gameread before you click

obviously a sensible ideain fact id go one further owning an empire planet automatically enrolls you in faction warfare so if youre not in a player corp youre enrolled in to the npc fw corp makes sense if you think about it for a moment pod pilots cant plausibly claim to be seperated from the factions while running planets belonging to those factions

nostop trying to make mob playing mandatoryas thing are at this point you run some industry on a planet you dont own itand malc in wwii ford industries in germany were running full tilt producing machines used by the german army and the profit were sent to the usa shareholders through swizerland so nothing stop you from owning a factory working in enemy territory for all of you pew pew obsessed there is pvp in this as more people work the same planet the less efficient your production became ie it is more similar to market pvp than combat pvp but the pvp part is there we should still see how it is implement but dont try to impose your one side vision
yes dont  up this with macro monkey  anders fogh needs to be sentenced for was crimes also marlona sky for leader of my death cult
i dont think it should put you in faction warfare player made corp is enough in my opinion
very good point the more ways to encourage ppl to leave npc corps the better
whoa this fix does not even that much new coding people assume theyd have to force a minigame into the laser but that is not the case only better if the roids stopped gunfiremissiles so miner could evade in the field of them as they might want to ninjamine lowsecnullseci dont mine ever since i learned there are not heavy mining drones of any kindformer vexorbarge thanny owner lol but id mine just for the mining tournies i could start
so the 2 csm post sum up to someday soon we will see something sigh nothing a bit more substantial
seems like a genuinely good idea lets see what the dev feedback to csm is before we speculatingsupported for the purposes of getting feedback
and we have a winner this is exactly why ccp hasnt made it a passive unit
nope there is a really old thread that ccp said why it has to be or had to be when they put it in or whatever an active module cant find the original thread though
then pirates shouldnt get a module for seeing a persons implants why should pirates get that information when pods are at the mercy of popping even if they pay the ransom
quoteit should not be allowed in high security space and can be used only by pilots with 10 sswut and people can seriously support that or are they all trollinghow about this idea then warp scramblers and disruptors can only be used by pilots with 5 ss
supported though tbh id be happy if i could just move it out of the bloody middle of the screen
and switchable offable
easiest way to say this is using a rp linecurrent concord rules state that any expidition into or thru a wormhole is a violation of law and therefore anyone who is caught going into a wormhole is subject to fines and or ship destruction the reason everyone isnt blown out of the sky when they jump into and out of a hole is that your ship becon stops transmitting just as if your ship cloaks or goes offline so responding to every case of a ship going off grid would not be possiblein short going to wspace is illeagal why the heck would concord then grant you sov for breaking the law
im saddened to see that learning skills have not been brought up given they have been brought up many many times before but a solution was never implemented by ccpthe learning skill design must be one of the oldest if not the oldest wart of eve and it is well time the problem is addressedother then that awesome csm representation i especially like the proposed remedy for the so called docking games
already read them before but here is my commentary since you asked for it i am slightly disappointed that multiple small ui changes that request swapping buttons around and etc where not requested they are fairly minor but they make a difference i am glad battle recorder and more meaningful nullsec warfare especially for small gangs was mentioned as well as extreme abundance of not valuable npcs i support csm in pushing the warpscrambling ships not docking this is a very good thing in my opinion as it would stop all the lame station games once and for all feel free in doing the same for gates then people will actually think maybe in this case we could even get rid of aggro timers or maybe we should not black ops yes warfare linksyes destroyers finally we really need to force ccp to redo starbases one day it has to be done maybe not today but it has to mercenary corporations should post corp logos ofcourcecorp bookmarks hell yes more involvement in development proses is absolutely necessary currently csm acts more as filter of ideas from assembly hall to ccp instead of being really involved in the development proses and yes it would be nice to know what happened to the issues brought up by previous csm line that seperates forum post from signature will this happen i am glad that these issues have been brought up but i would as most of the csm candidates like to know what happens to these issues after this thank you for mentioning the role system i would like to see the prioritized list discussed or at least published i would like minor ui improvements that have been suggested trash button windows closing on doubleclick so on to be there as such things need very little development time and are very important in general i got positive impression and am hopeful
except that theres hardly a consensus for any solution or even a consensus that theres a problem
most macros i have extensive ganking experience use active shield tanks instead of setting their drones to autoaggress thus if theres weak warp scrambling rats the macros wont be able to get away since they have nothing that damages anything the rats need to be weak enough to not give new players too much trouble ratting
yeah another let me gank people with even less hassles thread nice one
because macros can minerat independently but launching drones would be too hard to add to them
not supported highsec already has too much isk without enough risk
actually it the same since you were not around to respond and prevent the loss by not staying in space for long periods of time no supportand would it hurt to use paragraphs
remove the 250km lock restriction sure why notdoesnt need a new gun for this though as pointed out earlier a comedy officerrokh can have an optimal of 320km and also manned pos batteries can already lock and shoot way beyond 250km
having just read the minutes good to see that everyone is always open to ideas maybe black ops ships will get some love now and not be useless alsoi didnt see anything about cyno effects
why are we so terrible at csm oh wait
this is a joke right i have been denied on multiple occasions even when merely asking for a gm to inquire higher uponce or twice is more than enough to erode any confidence in the system  who do you report it to without it being burieddenied is the nagging thought i get nowdamn right it is feudal system for the winit would make lowhighsec dock monkeys invulnerable even if docking was prevented by active mod doesnt actually do anything except increase altscout use and decrease deaths on undockautomatic 2 months forum ban for all accounts associated with character  easy would require more diligence from moderators thoughps love the powergrab that kicks the whole thing off next time arguments for making csm membership permanent until actively voted out can be made
for the next csm meeting do you think you could create an index for the reportit would make it a lot easier to find specific areas so you dont have to search through anything  besides most halfdecent writing programs already have a function to implement this anyways
i opened it pressed ctrlf and typed in macrogot no results
cheersglad to see the question of blastersgallente was raised been plenty of good debate on the issue these last couple of months hopefully the devs will ponder some of the ideas raised
less chest beating more action plz from what i have seen this is the worst csm yet in fact
i beg to differ i had my misgivings about the csm 4 lineup but they seem to have done a pretty good job so far especially given the lack of continuity remember and i say all this without a hint of irony its still a relatively new process ccp are still going to be hesitant about how much involvement or say the csm have in things the csm members themselves will be unsure about how much they can poke prod contribute and involve themselves in the process dont expect the world just yet
sounds like a good idea i have to admit i had to recheck on the subject several times myself when readin g through them p
i play to interact with others but on my terms
for the same reason that your phone can show number of incoming calls you pay for it so you can talk to people right so why the need for ability to screen callsor for the same reason that you have different brands of beer and other goodies  choicereplies wasnt the convospam used as a weapon declared an exploit way back when was that rescinded when the ability to block all came in
loli personaly with my corp m8s can sit in a belt for hours mining chatting and goofing off in chathowever some wise  could easily misconstrue that as microminingso do you hace some special power that actualy allows you to guess who is a macro and who isnt ok so why spam ccp with unvarifiable fake petitions simply because we are mining your belt

currently all eve players are only allowed to be in two csmsi understand that this is to allow other people to have a chance of getting in and to prevent the same people winning every timebutthis leads to a continuous turnover of csm membersand all the talent of the previous members is no longer as available to ccpi would like to see the possibility of previous csm members being able to stand again for additional termscurrentno more than two2 terms total per personproposedno more than two2 terms per six6 csms per personthis keeps the benefits of the current system while allowing older csm members to stand again later ondiscuss
read last meeting minutesthey are lifting or are considering to lift the term limit and extend the terms to 1 yearif they do this i would like to see it become easier to replace existing csm as during my terms there were always slackers that didnt bother to show up for meetings and general productivity dropped like a brick after 3 months or so had passed because people had already raised all their pet issues been to iceland and generally grew weary
my advantage of playing actively is that i have more isk and therefore more assets than someone who just sits in a station and skillsand of course someone who plays for 6 years has slight advantages and no need to play as active as me noobno exp grindfest in eve
see csm minutes 
the csm minutes didnt really give any info
i think i supported this a while back but anyways support
those who say that 15 will make railguns overpowered just know this lasers dont need to reload or wait 10 seconds to swap ammo so the railguns actual realistic dps is still less than lasers
i have played gallentecaldari for over 3 years but i am retraining amarr because of terrible close in options and pathetic rail dps  cap use as long as im using cap i might as well not use ammo
what a well formulated argument for the problem were not talking about ive said it before and ill say it again between the lock limit and high damage on lasers allowing their falloff to compete with railgun optimals there is no 130km as you illustrate it theany point youre talking about exists and even then only maginally beyond the lock limit and are therefore completely irrelevent to the game this theory also ignores the fact that at any range you can at least try to shoot at the enemy if your max optimal is 100km 130km may still be within your falloff and if you do 2x the damage you can still beat the longer ranged weapons system at its own rangebeing the ranged weapon of choice means that at your optimal beyond the optimal of other weapons systems you do more damage then others by a fair margin this isnt currently the case and this imbalance has rendered the sniping vessels of two races impotant as a result
railguns need some looking into one quite big issue with fleets is that the railgun ammo takes much space and they fire rapidly  megas run out of ammo quite fast having the biggest m3 ammo consumption and also needing cap to fire is a major drawbackand in todays eve minnies with arties make better snipers than the rails on gallente ships rokh is a special case and rails are supposed to be the sniper weapons of choice
i disagree with that if youre at 170190km the enemy sniper bses can return fire if youre at 230km only their rokhs can the range bonus either lets you take a massive reduction in return fire or use faction ammo at standard ranges for 400 of normal tracking should you wishship utilisation only tells you about which ships are being used while desirability plays some part in this it is in no way divorced from many external factors affecting this choice toomost importantly a lot of eve ship fitting revolves around group mentality many fits have become popular only after someone tried something which was unconventional at the time and then others noticed it worked and started using it too concepts such as nano ships dualprop ham drakes as pvp ships nano rupture etc were all at one point regarded as strange if not outright lolfits crucially even at such times that game mechanics made them just as viable as they are nowmy point is that what people fly is often very conservative and based on common opinion that an option is not being used does not mean such as option does not existi take your point  but i dont know if your assumption is a valid one dual reps are roughly equivalent to shield booster  amp in terms of performance per slots but whos to say the ships were balanced around the expectation of fitting dual reps rather than armor reps having more cap efficiency with a lower rep amountits basically impossible to say either way but do i find it unlikely that repsappropriatelysized plates were always expected to be fitted in pairs else they would simply be more effective you could always downgrade to a smaller doubledinperformance rep if fitting issues or a hybrid tank were reasons not to do thisin fact this is a good example of what i consider to be an escalation in expectations dont get me wrong i agree that you need to go oversized buffer or dualrep due to todays metagame however i dont believe the ships are originally designed to be fit as such and while its fine that people are doing this i think they overlook that theyre already pushing the ships capabilities because thats become their baseline
i agree with the first point but i dont think the next three tally that well with your characterisation of range which is a good indication of why i dont think the classification is legitimateat what range do i tend to be forced to commit to stay if i engageif youre in the faster ship then the answer is the same as the first question if youre at say 15km and decide you want to leave then you can burn out of point range and warp the amount of incoming damage trackingmodified vs your ehp vs the speed differences will determine how quickly you can leave point range though so operating from 22km is going to be safer than 15km in that you can disengage quicker should the need ariseif youre in the slower ship and they want you to stay then this is point range but then if youre the slower ship and choose to engage youll almost certainly be wanting to go straight for the webscram to stop the other ship disengaging at what range do i tend to be able to disengage and escapeessentially the inverse of the above question likewise for the answers at what range do i tend to avoid the majority of damage and effectsnow this is where i think your classification of ranges is too simplistic because the answer is simply it depends against a taranis the answer is about 10km against a rokh the answer is 250km against other ships its somewhere in betweencritically most small and medium ships certainly those used for solosmallgang pvp have little ability to project damage much beyond point range so in that case engaging at 40km say will make you nighon unhittable this is actually pretty relevant in the case of stealth bombers for example battleships except for blasters and torps can typically hit reasonably well to that range but if you get 60km out youre usually safe againas another example an ambitrigged hurricane would murder a brutix because even at 20km hed be taking no damage on the other hand a harbinger would track and hit just fineone question that i think is missing from the above iswhat range do i have to operate at to stop the other guy from disengagingthe answer is pretty obvious but the typically 24km ceiling when soloing is very relevant to a lot of ships and setupsi agree entirely  and because the sum of all ships have such different engagement ranges i dont think theres any value in generalised range brackets typically asides from pointweb ranges its weapon ranges youre concerned with and with the number of weapons systems and tiers and ship bonuses and testcslociiambits and to a lesser extent pilot skills just about any range is a cutoff for something and theres no reason to choose one over another in a global contexti think there would be a lot more value in doing this for a given situation  eg going up against a hypothetical gang of sniper zealots brutices eagles and megas  the brutix has a 70km optimal the zealot has 100km the eagles and mega have 150km that way the range differences can be legitimately used to compare performance and damage mitigation in a particular situation
true but youre not magically at 95km either the engagement happens at whatever range the aggressors warp to the other party if youre choosing the fight then you get to choose the range you warp in at otherwise you donteven if youre on the back foot being able to return fire against eagles landing 130km away is much better than not being able towell no im not assuming that but i am saying that your preferred range is outside the range at which the other gang can return fire while you can still hit them at theirsanyway not having taken part in fleet sniper fights surely the point is to prevent the other gang from warping around like this by bubbling them if you dont tackle them i dont see how theyre meant to stick around in an unfavourable situation and you definitely want to make it an unfavourable situation for thembesides as youve said  if they warp out and back to you at 95km you can just warp out and back in at your preferred range i grant that 100km does have some importance because of being able to warp that far from a warpable point however unless the targets are sitting directly on a celestial youd need a covopsinty to get your a warpin anyway at which point they can position themselves 30km closer to you for a 130km warpinand if were talking about battleships and the utility of the rokhs range advantage this point has no merit since bses will need to have specially established warpins anyway  at which point it is just as feasible to establish a 250km warpin as it is a 180km onetrue to some extent  but the eagles are still sniper hacs as well as having battleshipsniper range they have agility to get into warp quickly cruiserclass mwd speed even though pretty slowish and the tracking of mediumsized gunsand the ability to choose between the two even with a ten second ammo change is greater yet though i dont see why you can control a 100km range but not a 200km rangegood point but the same still holds for eg 130km sniping with a smaller buffer
falloff on heavy beams is 19km with three tes going 35km beyond optimal theyll hence be hitting about 95 of the time i can assure you that railguns do more than 95 of the raw damage of lasers thats definitely not true for small or medium turrets and i was lead to believe that the standard range for bs snipers was 150180km a rokh has a 250km with spike with just 2 tes a 3te megathron firing at this range would have a 39 chance to hit with an expectation of 314 of its raw dpsit doesnt ignore that at all  its just that damage degrades in falloff possibly faster that youd expect even if youre doing double the raw damage of another ship and were seeing nothing like that discrepancy here youd still be doing less damage at your optimalfalloffso yes if the longerranged weapons system was doing half the damage for a bit more range less than your own falloff you would have a point however thats not the case looking at the raw stats railguns do 9 less damage for 20 more range and more importantly comparing actual ships you end up with greater disparities in both with optimal bonuses skewing the crossover point even earliernot only that but how many sniper ships are going to give up slots to sensor boosters in order to hit beyond optimal  falloff theres a very real chance that even if another ship could be hitting you for 30 of base damage they wont even be able to lock you in practicethats a ridiculous claim what is it about your optimal that makes it special if your second clause is taken to mean anything then it requires that only the longestrange weapon system could be the ranged weapon of choice since otherwise its not beyond the optimal of other weapons systems hence railguns win regardless or if we ignore the clause then neutron blasters win its simply about having the best range of situations that you can come out on top in having extra range is an advantage in that it lets you engage from many more positions and outside the range of many other weapons systems though this is useless if you dont use it the real kicker is having the best combination of damage and tracking for the situations in which you do engage and i have seen nothing that shows railguns are not competitive in this regard with other longrange turrets
gartel reiman you missing many flaws of railships therefor your conclusions are wrongalso your theory about fleet battles are flawed aswelljust be in some of them and try to answer your questions about why they are not working as you imaginedthen you will get where you are wrong and why railships are badrailships dont have any advantage over beam or arty shipsslightly better optimal isnt enough to compensate the huge list of disadvantages
now please tell me what those flaws aredont just say he have flaws in his post without telling what the flaws isbut yeah i agree that railguns need a little boost  tweak in something but im not really sure on what is needed to be boosted  tweaked yet though
did i just read someone compare chance to hit and dps as if they were somehow the same or could be used to offset the otherif you have a 95 chance to hit and 100 dps it is not the same or comprable as an 18 chance to hit and 30 dps you have to factor in rof ehp of the target so many thingsit may seem obvious but to some its not apparently
so you presume that your fleet is comprised only of rokhs false premiseapoc aurora l 372  19333 tracking 000524 rokh cn tungsten 323  19749 or cn iridium 287  168 49 tracking 001202 false premise wrong numbers strawman argumentlaw of large numbers and statistics disagree with you if you amass a fleet the composition will be influenced by the majority the majority follows the performanceisk rule false on this count as well data and numbers tell the truth stop trying to pass white as blackthere is an upper ceiling to the ships capabilities and that is what we are asking to be to modified if i or anyone else can reach that ceiling is totally differentwe are not dictating fittings we are indicating design shortcomings dont mix these too upyou are doing this backwards what is your performance criterion for that situation you described whether or not each ship can reach the target false methodologya realistic tactical situation is we warp in  100 from gate and engage which ship will be able to deliver more damage to the target
sorry to bring this up but shouldnt you listen to the opinion of people that have taken part in numerous fleet bs fights sniperhac roams etc i believe that there is an expression used by field personnel for those guys that try to argue vs experience using unfounded theories dont just theorize measure and analyze the relevant datasee aboveqft
200km is more common you see a lot of bob fits fall around that area and it seems you havent met the new sniper on the block the apoc which can get up to 230km putting a rokhs 249 optimal well within reach also comparing a megathron to a rokh is 100 absurd since theyre both saddled with the same poor weapons system and the rokhs bonuses should make it the primiere sniper in the game compare it to a snipe apoc if you want to be seriousive based all my stats and conclusions off the idea that you do around 50 damage at the end of the first cycle of falloff which you seem to agree is the case later in your post you seem to underestimate just how large the falloff margins are next to the differences in rangeim not sure what stats youre looking at but heres what i know based on the sniper battleship situation comparion rokh to apocapoc gets 25 more damage for 8 less range then the rokh more conservative setups will lead to a 17 difference in range with a falloff of 4144km which means an apoc can still do 340 dps at the rokhs optimal or 180 with a more conservative setup where the rokh is stuck at 320 dpsthis is based off both setups with 3 damage mods and 23 tracking enhancers 23 sensor boosters and 8x 425mm railstachyon lasers fitting this as well as a mwd on an apoc isnt easy of course but with the right rigs you can manage it and get a ship thats unambiguously better then the rokh at any range
this is a laughable argument and complete misunderstanding of how things work and what i said so ill explain again whats special about your optimal is that it is the optimal range of your weapons system with spikeaurora in short its the best damage youre going to be doing within 80km in either direction if another weapons system is fighting at that range while having different optimals then you should expect to do more damage likewise if you try to fight the enemy at their optimal you expect them to do more damage to you what this means and what youre repeatedly failed to understand is that without a damage advantage at your optimal having a longer optimal is useless because you will be outpreformed or nearmatched by the falloff of higher damage lower ranged systemsmost weapons systems have a damage advantage at their optimal blasters do pulse lasers do beam lasers do and rails either dont or have such a marginal advantage as to not matter at alldamagedamage vs shieldsdamage vs armor

the only tool you need to prevent yourself from being scammed is the one between your ears scamming is a legitimate part of the game mechanics  theres no need to nerf it
holy crp i actually agree with darius for once
ya its legit part of game unfortunately which sucks for the real players i ran lottos and was called a scammer before they figured anything out  there would be no validity behind these reports
let me get this straight you want to come up with tools for antiscamming because you feel everyone that plays eve is stupid and gulliblewow mass global insult good job
scams are legitimate and supported gameplay and dont merit a deterrantthere is absolutely no need for anyone to be scammed ever there are already all the tools in game that you need to avoid being scammed
best way to combat scamming is to follow the golden rules1 do your due diligence2 if its too good to be true it probably is3 trust no onenot getting scammed is the players own responsibility not other players nor ccpnot supported
i have never been scammed that said i dont like scammers yes its part of the game but it is really annoying to sift through dozens of contracts and people talking in local when 90 of the contracts are scamshonestly i hope the rules stay the same but somthing is done to make it less profitable and likely to scam someonefor the sake of localthat said i dont support the idea as ccp would have to regulate it like the report isk seller button

that part of your post ive bolded is a very good idea gives the ship two roles solosmall gang self rep bs and a fleet bs used with rr the numbers need running but i think his is something to concentrate on
why not simply engage the memory block in your brain and realize that this hasnt been the problem in the past it is an emergent problem since we can remember the states of the game where it was not a problem and when it became a problem we can trace back the changes and isolate the ones mostly likely to be responsible for this passiveactive disparitythis never ending cycle of tanking boosts is starting to look disturbing but then again youd need a functioning memory to see the pattern
i love flying active tanked shipsill support but the problem isnt in the ship bonuses imho five times repair amount and capacitor use on the modules themselves would go much further
great now i will finally be able to collect the insurance on that cyclone thats gathering dust in my hangars
qft i like that
there should be a way you can break into a secure cargo container use a code breaker or something to unlocks it after a long peroid of time that way people stop spamming with them all the time and so miners arent perfectly safe while macroing with a large can
because everyone that mines into gscs is a macro user right
they unanchor after 30 days anyways plus have you looked at the orca gscs suck 3900m3 is lolsmall
rotfl hell yeah macro mining hulks sure use those gscs
yes to being in a player corp and make it so if you leave the player corp it stops producing untill your in a new oneno to being in fac warfare
dont you think you people might be making a bit of an assumption herejumping to conclusionsyeah ill let you wave your pitchforks and such
i support the idea as far as no npc corpers
lets make it so you cannot ninjasalvage unless you are in corp huh same logicthe blind pokes at random in the dark
as much as war decing your competition over what is bound to be pennies worth of income is probably more costly then the amount of isk you could possibly make i support thisremember ccp have said they want low entry point which means low amount of skills and low amount of isk needed to work a planet sorry to say this people but if youre war decing fee is higher then the amount of income you could possibly make from their removal then maybe you should consider actually looking at the finance of it instead of blindly wardecing everyonefrom a griefers point of view yes player corp because blasting newbies out of the sky is awesome entertainment
have fun whining about the unfair and totally over the top 6 second reload times on t2 laser crystalssupportin marlona as it seems sensible at the least
not sure how ccp intend to differentiate between UFFFDplanet miningUFFFD in the different sec levels but this sounds like a good idea for empire
this is a bit premature ccp said that the combat part of planets will be in the expansion after tyrannis and include dust 514 so combat will be a major part of it despite the whining of carebear venkul mul good lordim going under the assumption that you will be able to attack other peoples planets even npc players in high sec it will all be done on the ground so no ships or war decs neededsupporting this just incase ccp does something dumb again and allows macros to claim all the planets and be unattackable
first more info no reason to worry about stuff now
supporting op plz we dont want macros ruining our income
true but i would rather they know this is how we feel about it well in advance so we are not suprised when it is released dont you agree
i can agree if wardeccing would have any effect on the stuff but if it doesnt it would just be a way to tell other people how they should play
just my thoughts on the whole thingi have never been ganked in this game first off my idea is simple instead of breakingfixing insurance make it so you are fined by concord for a response by them maybe 10 of the your insurance pay outanyways more thoughtsfirst highsec ganking is part of the game the issue currently is you easily make money from it but when you lose money its not enough if you gank a hulk with a bs you probally lose 1mil from the ship loss and another mil from the smart bombs after insurance pay outso your 2million iskthat hulk probally had 3 strip miners ii 6million isk easy total  it probally had either mining lazer upgrades or cargo expander iis wich are decent moneyassuming u have a salvage ship nearby you easily make 2mil isk but if you fail you only lose 2mil isk that is the issuei believe high sec ganking should be a make or break type of deal an example would be spotting and killing someone carrying bpos or other high end stuff not miners with nothing but ore and cheap modules or industrials with saved up mission lootsanyways just my suggestion thoughts i like insurance makes losing a ship easier but i think high sec ganking needs to stay its just rediculous now a fine would fix it people would choose the ganks wisely instead of  incoming ship with like 60mil worth of stuff inside
greetingsmy proposal is simple enough and mostly related to a lot of what ive encountered in whiskey space simply that with dreads being so large seiging of poss in wh space high sec can be extremly difficult it is far to easy to defend against anything short of a 30 man bs fleet attacking a pos which essentially makes wh and high sec poss invincible to anything but large blob attacks unless of course the pos is ignored by the ownermy proposal is simply to create either modules with horrible tracking for bs size ships essentially only capable of hitting a pos sized object or to create a secondary ship class of lower skill requiring glass cannons so to speak whos primary role would only be to seige large targets obviously they would not module or ship wise be as powerful as something like a dread but would at least be powerful enough to make seige of poss in whiskey space and high sec more viable and less time consuming
i just did a flyby of mitsolen ice belt and counted 73 in local and at least 40 hulks the ones that i ran an info on appeared to be members of student accademies for a 6 months to 2 years with no security status no mission runs and no pc corps in their histories no doubt that many of these are macro miners flooding the ice marketsit would be awesome if ccp would allow us to wardec 1 year academy students but as it stands concord stands ready to protect their activitiesthere should be a limit to the amount of time that someone can hide under the skirts of the training academies i suggest using the 2 mil sp break when your sp grace period is up you have graduated and either become a solo or must find employment in a pc corp eject these maco miners into the sandbox where we pvpers can cull the herdyes rookie players need the protection but once they have the skills to fly a hulk they need to be in a pc corp where they can be wardeced
so you want risk free ganking of hulks without any penaltiesif you are so annoyed of them you can just gank them i hear tempestsmaelstroms with artilleries work well for thathave fun
no
you think that having somee thousand 2 mand corp and the active character switching between them will make some differencenext time use the search function and read your proposal was done hundred of times and always shot down it will simply not workand btw not all people want to be part of a blob
only if wardecs are 10 billion isk per week
the hulkageddon threads were full of aw man look at these totally awesome carebear tears which is finenothing against suicide gankingbut it rather deflates any claims that you want it to be easier to protect us all from the vile scourge of macro minersits not like your proposal would even make macroers easier to target just make a bunch of shell corps and shuffle macros between them when a wardec hits
wellnpccorps got a 11 tax that tax is for missionrunning only npccorpminers dont suffer from this penalty and thus are not forced into a pccorp we need a solution for this asap
report them for farming then blow them up in a suicide bs post screenshots and i will pay for the bs sok
1 does nothing if someone wanted to stay in an npc corp all people would do is create a corp then quit it and end up in the second tier npc corp and sit there instead2 not everyone wants to be in a pc even though ccp thinks everyone should be in one3 when your sp grace period is up you have graduated and either become a solo there are no solo pilots in eve everyone belongs to a corp whether it is a pc or npc corp4 just because someone is in a noob corp does not mean they are noobs you might not like what you find with their pvp prowess
im all for getting nonplayers out of npc corps of all kinds but as wars currently work its an utterly pointless driveuntil war flags are persistent by pilot no matter where they go these macro users will just jump corp to corp to corp if they the skirts of npc protection were taken awaywars need to be fixed then the npc corp situation in that order

nice thread  if only you knew what you are talking about first btw  comon flame him boys  
facepalms1 trading in jita is done to 9999999 in one station 44 caldari navy assembly plant the other stations are mostly unused2 you already pay more tax and broker fee for bad standing given the volume that can be quite a lot of extra costs3 jita isnt the major trade hub because ccp made it that way players created itand you know why it it is the major trade hub because people move all their stuff there to trade itthe regional trade hubs get close to it but dont really reach the volumeyou really dont know what you were talking about
the trade at 44 is supported by production from numerous factories labs and mining operations in and around jitawrong tax is limited by accounting skill standing has no effect broker fee is marginally by corporation standing and faction standing this is clearly not enough to discourage trading with the enemy which is frankly sillyeve is a sandbox governed by the rules and toys ccp provide the jita effect was inevitable and was even called the yulai effect when that was the number 1 hubthe faction trade hubs are not even close to jita if you had been bothered to read the qen you would see the figures speak for themselves jita 53 domain 89
come back when you know what you are talking about
thisin answer to your other thread1 no2 not applicable
touche a minor error now corrected that doesnt change the fundamental point it is so small it doesnt discourage trading with the enemy which is sillyand no i wont stop posting because somebody tells me to only when somebody provide a cohesive argument why the proposal is wrong a single line troll isnt that this is supposed to be a discussion
by definition of the network effect the majority of the trade volume will clump up in one convenient location regardless of any attempts to distribute trading volumes more evenlythus trying nerf jita and all that rabble is a moot pointnot supported
if it was larger the most that you could expect is that people would use alts to avoid it
i would still think that the location is more important than the stations aroundeg dodixie got a hub because of the good lvl4 agent and the relatively close position to the jita  hek piperens mostlikely got a hub because it is relatively close to amamakeamarr is pretty close 56jumps to many lowsec entries
trade hubs are created by playersyou go to place a buysell order at any station you can dock at and there fore you are commencing tradetherefore you dont know what the hell your talking aboutccp cant do nothing about this people just need to get used to doing business somewhere else
only true when each path is equally weighted there increasing the lengths of some routes and the value of some nodes will diffuse the networkperhaps you should read up on opportunity cost and barriers to entrythere are plenty of things ccp can do to shape the environment and influence player decisions on this matter the question is which of these many things are the most appropriateto name a few i dont like them all but they would workdocking queues at congested stationsincrease in exploration sites in quiet systemsmore rats in quiet systemscongestion charge based on how busy the system constellation and region are applied to factory  lab charges broker fees office  hanger rentagents in busy systems have fewer missions and occasionally make you wait or send you away to run x number missions for my college in quiet station zagents in quiet systems pay increased bonus or lp to entice pilots in to work for them
yes a lot of people run missions in jita or plexes
for some time i have been considering this same problem there must be other gallente loyalists who are concerned about this problem anyway your first vote of support
jita is fine in fact its so fine that its a product of the multiplayer sandbox manifesting itselfalso adding arbitrary and pointless limits wouldnt help anything traders dont have to be in jita to trade in jita or have you never looked at the trade skills treeno one is compelled to go to jita to trade in the slightest but because its so big and so competitive it often has the best prices for buying and the quickest sells a player can do just fine in other hubs both with trading or outfitting shipsreally you havent even given a decent argument that there is a problem in the first place why should we even bother to consider changing it
thereUFFFDs always a way to get than done for free anyway p
agreed the avatar icons take up way too much space and it causes my chatbox to cover some of my combat interface
i proposed this very same change a while ago yet it just never got the traction needed not to mention certain people criticized it then but now they are for it eve players are so moodysupporting in hopes that this thread will get the traction mine did not
dont limit it to local rather have it as a general option for all chat windowssimilar to the show text only and show text with small portrait that is available in the chat proper would be perfectas for local giving intel what the hell does that have to with anythinglocal will be history soon enough at least in nullsec and has no bearing on proposal keep lobbying for it and it will happen but dont use it to sabotage other ideasproposals
do want why doesnt it exist already
as an option yes plsfaster scrolling less loading times

i propose that we either get the ability to map keys to cycle between our locked targets or that the left and right arrows keys be made to do thus i believe that this will be a handy addition making it so we dont need to waste time clicking somewhere on the screen to change which of our locked targets we want to shoot or mine or whatever it is you are doing thoughts comments concerns
considering that all the important parts of the eve interface are as far apart from each other as possible to make the use of the latter as uncomfortable as possible yes i agreea ui overhaul is desperately needed a few hotkeys wont do
lets see you can move the target list around you can move the hud around you can move your selected itemwindow aroundso on my screen the hud is move to the lower right corner above it i have all my locked targets and above those my selected item window and above that the overview window very minimal mouse movement neededthink about itfor the proposaland then you combine that with the autotargeter module and you get afk missioning with all ship types or whatdont be that lazy you should playinteract with the game and not just watch it like a movie
because being able to performed a necessary action with a single click instead of getting lost in menus is afking
i quite agree with you on that we need a complete overhaul of the ui and i sure hope this is one of the new features of said overhaul i would however like this change in any event as to fears of this being used for afk missioning the people that already run missions semi afk are going to do so anyways this still requires them to do things with the keyboard so i dont see how its any easier i would just rather have the ability to use my keyboard rather then clicking on things with my mouse all the time
ccp have stated all palnets 00 wh low sec and high sec will be able to with different conditions be able to be part of planetary interaction  industrial expansion
you drea came true ccp has stated that wormhole planets will be developable tyranis is coming to wormholes
leave the human part of giving rep out of ityou get the contract done it gives you 1 you dont finish a contract 1also have a log of past contract so you can see that is 100000 rep isnt goofy if you see the name of people you trust in the log you will be more incline to trust im we wont be safe from corrupted mind and do we really want that but its a tool we could use to represent the idea of trust in game
nice onei have to say i agree with the vast majority of what the csm said so good job therealso ccps answers seem very reasonable thankyou ccp i just hope your really taking into account what the play base has to say as after all were the guys that play your game and pay your wages right so all in all good job communication is the key 
 marlona skyhell this guygirl is ing awesome someone who i personally think is talking sense mostlysparking some fire into this whole debate yeeehaawwwwwbut seriously lets look at this who nap train thing properlyyou have your main powerhouses 
generally a very good job csm but i have one question what is your excuse for not bringing up rocketsseriously they have been borked for ages now they were one of the most mentioned items in the thread where ccp nozh asked for 3 things wed like to see fixedits no good saying that 3 of you own titans when apparently none of you fly frigates the number of people affected by this issue far outweighs the number of people who will ever care about low sec doomsdays
roflkets were brought up by csm 3 so they should be balanced soon tm
iirc so was fleet warfare yet it got mentioned again i hate to think what ccps rebalancing pile must look like but i get the feeling afs in general and rockets in particular are going mouldy near the bottom of said pileit would be nice to see someone give them a prod
those are my biggest concerns about increasing the terms to 1 year one advantage is that you would have a longer streak of attendance since you have 2 summits it is also why i recommended that the terms start with the winter elections that way you only have 2 months after the fanfest summit before the new csm term starts people who are burnt out will not put themselves up for election and even if they stop showing you only have a 2 month lame duck period to shuffle though i would assume a chunk of that would be put towards setting things up for the next csm term anyway
then i suggest you read them again p unless of course you want to know exactly how they wil be fixed  but i doubt even ccp knows that at this time
one day the hawk will not suck on that day i will a throw a party and crack open a bottle of champagne
speed bump agility bump 4th bonus bump
ab boost was a good idea  just not to every afit would make the enyo useful in pvp dont say rail enyo  get in at 15k with your ab speed tank their guns while doing 400 dps with blastersdoesnt make sense for every af though but it does for a few come up with some more bonii and spread them around
bumping this as i am about to enter af territory skillwise
to the top

hybrid guns suck
i do agreeblasters really need a boost
no i presume the squad of rokhs is composed solely of rokhs the other guys warp to normal sniper optimal but your rokhs can operate from beyond thatwell youve put some tracking mods on the apoc and none on the rokh in that comparison but anyway rokhs cn tungsten tracking is 001202 while its tracking with spike is 000301 so the faction ammo is tracking four times as well as normal ie longrange t2 ammobeams do track better than railguns natively though the 44 better base tracking of tachyons than 425s or 59 better with megabeams is possibly a more valid issue than the damagerange debate possibly not depending on the intended engagement envelopesyes data and numbers tell the truth and the truth is simply that more megas etc are used in large fleet engagementsdata and numbers dont pass any judgement on the raw facts any interpretation as to why is subjective and not backed up by the data youre claiming more people fly megas because rokhs are inferior im claiming more people fly megas because of their trained skills alliance fit  reimbursement policies and fc tactics its easier to try to make all ships fungible so you just need to think about sniper bses rather than to manage different types accordinglyin particular i dont agree that when you amass a fleet the composition will be influenced by the majority rather the composition is influenced by the longterm dictates of the alliance policies coming from the few leaders and the immediate requestsdemands of the fleets fc your individual pilot doesnt get much chance to be a snowflakeits simply a question of whether what youre asking for is inline with the concept of the ship some would say that eg a thorax could get 15 damage per level and still fit within the intended performance bracket others wouldnt its simply an issue of what that bracket is intended to be for a given shipin that exact situation its the one that does the most damage at 100km quite simply as i said above if youre not expecting return fire you simply want the highest damage at ranges outside of the enemys optimal that situation makes any range above 100km dubious other situations would not
of course and thats broadly what im basing my assessments on dont get me wrong im not saying im right and heres why im pointing out that i havent been convinced by your arguments so far and am explaining why based on my knowledgeexactly if your proposal is valid then it shouldnt rely on just knowing from experience it should be presentable purely in the abstract based on the actual numbers and figures of course there needs to be some interpretation eg how likely is it that you can get a bubble on an enemy fleet get a 6second warpin going on etc but that only really effects which numericallybacked situations are valid  not the validity of each individual subconclusionability to warp to your gang im afraid i dont get which part of above weve generated quite a lot of it  youre referring towell it wasnt comparing dps and falloff so much as comparing damage lost in falloff compared with extra optimal and the equivalence or otherwise of the two asides from the rather strange choice of figures in the example that dont really tally at all  the difference isnt that great in fact were it not for hit quality youd have the same expectation of damage from 8 guns with a 50 chance to hit or 4 guns with a 100 chance to hit the only difference is that the former might do up to double the volley damage which averages out by doing as little as zero damage on other volleysin actual fact because of hit quality being degraded by a lower chance to hit the one in falloff will actually average around 38 of base damage rather than 50unless youre shooting at a very small number of targets that you need to instapop and your combined expected volley is something like 80 of their ehp  this difference is going to be insignificant over any engagement due to the extra highs being cancelled out by the extra lows rate of fire will only make a difference regarding the steepness of the distribution ie the odds of getting a result distinct from the average over a given period of time not the expected average damage dealt unless you are taking a very few samples ie trying to kill something in one or two volleys this is broadly irrelevant and the ehp only comes into the equation when its somewhere close to your volley damage and even then it balances out against multiple targetsso really the important figure is the expectation in which degree we can obviously offset base damage against falloff the only way anything else matters is the degree of volatility you would prefer
definitely true about the apoc i mentioned the mega as a baseline on an understanding that its the shortestranged common sniper ship so if fcs are going for a uniform warpin range for ships this range has to be the lowest common denominator which is thus what i was looking to calculateits 38 damage at the end of falloff which is a notable amount less than 50 i think you also based your arguments around one weapon having a 2x base damage to the other though which is also definitely not the casei was looking at the turrets themselves  which i know cannot be considered outside the context of the ships that use them of course however if the raw stats compare sensibly but the ships are out of balance it would suggest its the ships bonusesslot layoutfitting thats causing the imbalance rather than the weapons systems themselves its a legitimate point to consider when deciding what boost if any to ask forcomparing equivalent setups 3 damage mods 3 range mods rokh has 186 more range and apoc has 25 more damage rokh also has more falloff but the locking cap means this cant be used effectively its already got a 274km optimal two things that i do agree are unfair on the rokh herethe locking cap completely screws over the rokh here at 300km the rokh will still do 227 dps while the apoc does 59 dps there the fact that the rokhs optimal with two range mods is already beyond the locking cap is silly this needs to be increased if the rokhs extra optimal is to be of any real use other than as a pseudotracking bonus with cn thoriumtachyons are effectively a tier higher than megabeams there is no direct railgun equivalent while this makes the apoc a  to fit it does make it shine in abstract comparisons like this against megabeams range difference is 305 and damage 16
projectile weapons never do and theyre ok right now damage types alpha tracking cap use and fitting all do come into it as well its not simply a game of dps numbershaving extra optimal gives you an option that the shorterranged guys dont have as i noted above the rokh gets screwed over here because it cant use its extra optimal due to the locking range cap whereas a tach apoc has the perfect amount of range 23148 means its still hitting just fine at 249 thanks in a more general sense though eg anything with medium rails this concept still holdseven with falloff perhaps letting the other guy hit you at your optimal this just blueshifts the ranges you can go a little bit into your own falloff against lasers especially not so much against arties and they lose a lot more damage against a small amount for youso in many cases railguns do outdamage any other weapons system at their optimals simply because the other weapons systems cant hit that far and will be well into falloff by then apoc vs rokh is a particular case where this doesnt hold because of the locking capthose graphs arent accurate primarily because they join the dots linearly the important part in particular is the line between the last two dots on each series ie optimal with t2 longrange ammo going to optimalfalloff with t2 long rangewhen this is fixed it shows exactly what you say should be the case above the beam lasers are the shorterranged weapon system so by your logic should outdamage the longerranged rails at every point within beam range this is true then as soon as we go a bit past the beams optimal range the railguns start doing more damage consistently
thats still a false premise because if you peruse kms youll see that the average number of rokhs in fleets cannot fill even a squadi used standard fleet fits 3x damage mods and 2x range mods on both shipsapoc is 1x te1xtc rokh is 2x tc so lasers do more dps have better tracking  same range and this makes my arguments not valid i am confused here damage delivery is reliant upon the product damagerangetracking if the apocdamage as dps and pestdamage as alpha are superior in all three over the rokh and mega doesnt that indicate there is a reason to boost railsso you mean that alliances dictate individual skill plans sorry but were not in boot camp everything you just said boils down to the performance isk rule if the rokh performed as well as the apoc youd see them on alliance reimbursement schemes since it is underperforming it is not thus people with railgun skills are forced to train for the cheaper mega or pest or apoc fcs ask for fleet snipers 170km range max dps 56k ehp sbs are the new dd not for shiptypes
fair enough examine the ships then under these premises1 fleetbs engagement envelope is 170190km fleet operates as a unit and the variation in ranges falls within 20km from the warpin the fc calls megas and pests will warpin  170 apocs and rokhs  190 no individual squad shenanigans2 sniperhac engagement envelope is 70100km you can see in game justification for these ranges if you right click in empty space3 ranged antisupport engagement envelope is out to 80km meaning that their mission is to obliterate asap any enemy support that enters that sphere of influencethis is standard operational doctrine for fleets and is the basis of our comparisons hypothetical situations that involve combat  250km do not happen so there is no merit in including them to the conversation when both mega and rokh railboats underperform vs pest and apoc then you need to look at their common trait if their only common trait is rails then there lies the problemsee above for operational doctrine as ive said before an eft number that has no ingame application at any time is of no consequence anyway it was shown before beams have pretty much the same range as rail for operational use does that constitute your counterproposal nerf lasers
the megathron is outperformed by all snipers except the rokh which has longer range the hyperion is outperformed by the apocalypse the rokh underperforms all other snipers in all aspects until they get into the most extreme range at issue is simply the benefit that people talk about extra range really doesnt hold up in reality rail ships have no benefit and many penalties compared to other weapons systems in eve lowest alpha lowest tracking uses cap and uses ammo
i think this is the crux of our disagreementrailguns excel only at range when there is no real benefit to range then i agree there would be no real point in choosing railguns over an alternative weapons systemyou reiterate without any justification that fights at 250km in a more general sense fights beyond other weapons ranges do not happen why what is stopping the rokhs choosing to warp in at 230km in your above situation instead of warping it at 190kmi agree that if fights at long ranges dont happen then railguns will be pretty mediocre in practice indeed but even in this case i dont think that buffing rails is the best option because theyre intended to do slightly less damage with longer ranges but rather address the mechanics that mean their range provides no tangible advantage
lets look from the fcs position he has like 40 apoc30mega20 tempest 10rokh or around this he can use 100 of his force at 170km and 40 at 230km so what would he do yeah warp the fleet to 170km as any sane person wouldnow look from the enemies point if they cant fight backthen they will warpjump out this way fighting from 230km holds no advantageso lets assume that enemies can fight back so they can shoot at least 170km farnow lets see what rokhs would do they can warp to 170km like the rest of the fleet or to 230km to their optimalwhat they will get from warping to their optimaldpsalpha wont increase at all in some cases it will decrease if you would use lower navy ammo than iridiumenemies wouldnt attack them at that ranges but here is the problem they would attack the rest of the fleettempestsmegasthen enemy dps wont decrease even a littlemaybe even increse as the rokhs tend to be the best tanked sniper bs most of the time by moving the best tankers out of enemy range is a moronic stepno fc would do thisso from fcs view you get no advantage at all if you move your rokhs to 230km there is absolutely no reason to use their better optimal because it is pointless to do especially the opposite using rokhs as the rest of the fleet makes managing the fleet easiertherefor we can say that better optimal in sniper fleet than the rest of your fleet holds no advantage at alland for fleet fight you cant make a rokh only fleetbecause only a little part of your members can fly thoseand training for them takes a lot of time and possibly would result with 0 advantageand rails are used for sniper fleetsand rails better optimal is no advantage at allit is just there but you cant use it out because your fleet doesnt consist only of rokh or eaglesoh and here comes another stupidity the resist bonuses for caldari snipers if your tactic is to keep out from enemy range then why the hell do you want to have a tank bonusoh and dont tell me that it is for blaster fits because there optimal bonus is mostly pointless to havesum up rails advantage better optimal i already pointed out why this is negateddisadvantages small ammo clip10sec reloadhuge cap usefixed dmg typeslow alphahard to fit up to caldarigallente shipstiers scale badlyso like 0 advantage versuse many disadvantages and you ask why rails should be boosted
naomi did a good job describing the thought processes that justify the facts what i want to emphasize is that the field experience we were talking about and you stated that you lack is all the justification required to outline the operational environment we are inso to sum it upyou sarge why do i need to keep my gun cleanme cause if you dont son itll blow up in your faceyou ill take good care sarge to not get it dirty keep it out of the sand and mud on the battlefield and it will need no cleaning rightme son ive seen it happen poor sod didnt have a face afterwardyou but sarge you havent justified yet why i need to clean my gun
i support the damage proposal but do not support the othersas background i fly megathrons and occasionally rokh in 150k rr gangs quite often my alt flies an equivalent apoc at that range my mega does less dmg has less tracking even with its bonuses and has less ehp than my apoc both have poor cap the rokh can do well in some situations 200k and if shield tanking is allowed but overall its mismatched tacticallyi also use sniperhacs mostly muninn zealot is far better than the others with superior dps and it can also be quite nasty with pulses as well in the bc class the same trend is true gal is the worst medium rails need a big boost the myrm bonsus dont work well and its damage is poor compared to the other bc i have limited experience with frigate guns and will not comment but my limited experience leads me to believe that pretty much all long range frigate guns are irrelevant anyhowbut overall i believe rails need a buff i also believe several galcaldari ships need love especially the demios hyperion and myrmidon i also call for ccp to consider nerfing some laser boats that outperform all other ships in their class including the zealot and the apoc with a real good look at the other amarr bs
so in your effort to find out potential problems with a weapons system you compared two ships using said weapons system instead of against others brillianteft says otherwise and dont make false claims about my arguments theyre based on the fact that you railgun optimal falls well within the first falloff of a tach apocquotei was looking at the turrets themselves  which i know cannot be considered outside the context of the ships that use them of course however if the raw stats compare sensibly but the ships are out of balance it would suggest its the ships bonusesslot layoutfitting thats causing the imbalance rather than the weapons systems themselves its a legitimate point to consider when deciding what boost if any to ask forso what youre saying is that you examined railguns in a world without lock limits thus ignoring one of the major problems with the platform make a new analysis that actually sees what happens when you put these things on ships context mattersthere you go you compared equivalent setups and got similar results as you pointed out yourself much of the range advantage you quote comes to no use hence why i chose to use just two and leave optimal at 253km also oversized or not people use tachyons and ignoring them wont make them go away simply leave them overpowered next to other systems
to prevent messing with pew pewing drones during combat just have it so that when they jump to another system all drones in their bay are repaired to full
lets take this one step furtherwhy should capital ships be the only one with this feature why not any ship with a drone bay
were flying internet spaceships piloted via direct neural interface surely it makes sense that such highly capable machines would be capable of performing these maneuvers at the flick of a pilots willwell supported

ccp is pretty retrded here first off if you are developing for xbox 360 it isnt that hard to port to pc second off is thinking that they can make a dent in a market that is already flooded with fpses without relying on their current customers to champion their product is foolhardy i dont own a console and i wont buy one for the mediocre fps dust 514 just look at all the problems and bugs with eve you know that dust wont be a polished a grade shooter there will be no reason to buy it outside of something to do in the eve universe when not running fleetcorp opshowever i would be willing to pay 40 id laugh at 5060 to play dust 514 on pc but justifying 130 for a console 65 for a year of xbox live and then 50 for the game adds up to 245 for a game that i dont really want to play in the first place tldr there are too many good thoroughbred games out there to play dust 514 on console
youre aware that the xbox 360 doesnt use x86 processors right

problem is not with selfdestruct existance but in that it places no penalties on the one who initiates itit is his right to destruct his own ship  but there also must be responsibility connected with it but currently such responsibility doesnt exist  i can initiate and cancel selfdestruct any time i want and i will receive no penalties for either of these actionsthe problem is not that he destroyed his loot but that he piloting the capital can do it almost always regardless of his skills as human being agility or anything other  he just presses one button and timing is not so important too he just see that he is tackled aloneno i dont want to bring bigger fleet because it will generate more lag on server side and will lower pvp skill  learning of each individual pilot in my fleeti have no objection  go on selfdestruct in such situation but receive no bonuses from it such as denying enemy killmail or loot is it fine with youwhat do you mean  faster you mean bring blob to kill something that can be killed with much less amount of ships no thank youno it is not working as intended when it was first introduced in game there were no capital ships which can tank incredible amount of dps and so successfuly selfdestruct most of the timealso ccp already posted somewhere by words of csm delegate korvin that killmail must be generated in case of sd
i think the only reasonable change is a minor increase in self destruct timer for caps  by 1 minuteand denial of insurance payoutbut no killmails since the whole purpose of self destruct is to deny the killmail and loot these 2 things should not be overturned
yes i think that combination is reasonable and rational but others may be too but ccp sometimes overreact nerfs thing to the root  i dont want that to happen with selfdestruct of course 
guys guys think of the precious kd ratio
thats bull i only am required to bring the dps nessesary to break his tank that is it obviously the lest attacker should get the killmail and thats it all self destruction should do is deny the attacker the loot
it wont work and actualy it will do worse then now as ppl will flag every person they dont like as a scammer and scammers themself will simply flagg evryone they see to confuse everyone elsebesides that imho scamming itself isnt a problem the amount of scamming in eve now and scammers spamming is the problem its about 1 year since i prefere to buy and self stuff in amarr not an jita all becuse there is almost none scammer spammers in amarr local while jita local now is real trashthree solutionfirst make links in chat unable to modify so if you link raven contract it will show raven contract not an cnr contract or allow them to modify while typing but nethertheless posted unmodified for example i create contract for raven set the price to 400m isk link that contract to local channel and then tried to modify it so it would say raven navy issue instead of raven but then i press enter to post it and will actualy post unmodified link of ravensecond solution is about same link in local but about those who spamm the local about zydrin or mecacyte contracts first of all same make contracts unable to modify secon make links say amount in words not in numbers or at least mixed for example again ive create contract with 40k zydrin and trying to sell it as 400k of zydrine i linking that contract to local chanel and suprusigly find that its said forty thousand of zydrin or 40 thousand of zydrin and if ill try to modify it at will post exact amout of the good i with to sell anywaylast thing is about direct trading there is also contantly spamming in local about selling something via direct trade because of dts little defect wich is used alot to get isk from ppl its about changing amount of changing amout of offered isk in last moment dt now prevent to removing offered items from dt window but it doent prevent to change the price and fix is also very simple make the summ of isk for dt locked after first typing of it so you if yo are actualy make a misstake in typing summ of isk you need to close current dt window open new one and then try again ist raher small irritation for those who using dt not for scamming but it will almost kill dtscamming iitself as it is it will finaly make spamming in jita local about such scamming worthlessfinaly i dont belive scamming will be beating in eve ever but it can be reduced to the point there only ppl who realy dedicated for scamming who belived thats exactly thier playstyle who is using thier own brain to make the scamming possible will continue to ehm doing what they doand that for good
the point is none of that is necessary if youa dont use direct trades except with people you know and trust if the seller cant take the time to post a contract i really dont need what youre sellingb read everything twice  its a wise move in real world contract dealings and its doubly wise in eve where there are no legal penalties for in game fraud and scammingif youre paying attention and careful youre not going to get scammed
that way haulers carrying a few battleship bpcs dont show up as having lost a few billion isk worth of stuff
support while youre at it put in some kind of distinguisher between bpos and bpcs to make it easier to sort between the two
agreed on both points i realy hate checking all the bpcs in my hangar when things got messed upagain
yes plx
supported if  damage is shown in contract also want to be able to remotely contract any other damaged items in the same way and be given the option to repair those that can be repaired for the customary fees as part of the contracting processin a universe where you can communicate across light years effortlesslyand where the contract process is smart enough to unload weapons remotelyit only makes sense that contracting a repair crew to do some work in a remote station should be possible
sorry if this had been mentioned alreadyi get around mostly by right clicking in space and using the stargate drop down menuwhat irks me is having to show info on each stargate and navigate to the system info box to see what sec status it is that or using the mini map which uses up a lot of screen and basically you have to do the same thingi propose that the names in the stargate drop down menu be color coded or even go as far as to list what type of sec status it is without having to look it up in all those windows or live in the area and get to know which system is which
declining a mission usually means hey i dont wanna do this mission and not i dont wanna do this mission please offer me the same exact mission in another system can we please get the mission system changed to where if you decline a mission you arent offered that mission immediately after declining it the first timethis is incredibly frustrating
moved to assembly hall
reasonable request actually just set a flag on that mission you declined and reset it after the next mission is offered
yep sounds logical
we cannot be silent any more we wrote petitions  they were accepted we filled bugreports  they were successfuly assigned but ccp still for at least more than a year already havent fixed three fundamental flaws in game mechanics which known to many many pilotshere they are1 you logoff and after that someone places aggro on you  but you will still disappear after 1 minute2 you logoff login logoff login  and appear on a spot not where you was or where youre travelling previously3 you click warp to and instantly logoff  no one can scramble you or even lock youwhat does these flaws in game mechanics allow1 the 1 allows player if he have enough effective hp to escape smalltomedium camps in lowsec and during highsec war and most of the camps in nullsec if theyre without bubblesliterally that exploit makes freighter pilot using it almost invincible even without a scout  he will die only if fled to camp of 5 battleships that can kill him in 1 minutealso during highsec war if you have camping enemy pilot and he jumps to your small camp he can just logoff on his cnr or marauder  and to disappear after 1 minute2 the 2 exploit allows pilot to escape any camp when quitting the system  in highlownullsec pilot warps to other stargate and see on your scanner that there is camp here  so you just doublelogoff in warp and appear not in the camp with bubble but on a safespotalso it allows pilot to escape in his ship including capital any pos blockade  even if entire pos is covered with bubbles pilot just makes doublelogoff with 15 minute interval after first logoff and appears on the spot where he can turn on cloaking device warp out etcalso it allows safely stealing capital ships from enemy pos without a worry about pos disruptors all you need to bump them with alt out of pos shield and get into them with your main  and logoff pos even with 15 large autocannons will to kill nude dread or carrier in 1 minute  so after double logoff you will just appear on the safespot not near pos3 the 3 one makes pilot using it literally uninterceptable in high and lowsec  regardless of the ship he is piloting be it noobship freighter or capital nuff saidcarebears and pvpers  unite lets make ccp to fix this damned things at last so we can happily live together in peaceful and good eve oh wait
as soon as you tell me how to tell from the servers perspective the difference between me unplugging my network cable and my internet going down surei mean sure we can trap for ctrlq or closing the application  of course if i open task manager and just terminate the process none of that code will fire either so
when you terminate your process or press ctrlq all tcpudp sockets are closed and server notified about that immediately in case of udp by special command game sendsalso no single one of these exploits fixes requires server to make such distinction
1st seems to be considered as game mechanics feature not a bug by ccp for numerous years so im inclined to neither support it nor completely disagree with you here2nd and 3rd are obvious exploits and hopefully sooner than later will be removed from gameid call such distinction a bad move  it will encourage players to simulate hard disconnect
yes but again no fixes for these exploits require server to ever make such distinction

the 3 points in op are valid and important enough to warrant fixing i dont see any technical difficulty of fixing them so its not that much to ask either the only issue people may have is ideological one either you believe in carebearism or hardcore pvpim afraid the devs have gone soft
yes i want it
1 from russian community
for every one person rescued by the mechanic as it should be theres a hundred people who use it for safety and personal gain nullsec is more safe than empire with this nonsensical safety measure
not supported st1 but 23 sounds good
players can logon and logof as they want we can cry for years
fixing these bugs will not prevent players to logon or logoff anytime they want  just if they logoff in camp their ship will die as it should be
1  norm2 and 3  signed2 is so cheating 
that words of ccp not myne i agree this exploit rude exploit
plus my voice
well thats a hard decision signed for 23 first 1 is hard to fix
logging off being a viable way to protect virtual assets is moronic thumbs
this was raised by yours truely during csm 3 i suggested that your loginout spots be anchored in order to prevent double loggoffski i believe its being looked into
thank you for information
coughbullcuoghyes its a problem but stop making tcpip concepts out of thin air mkaycase and point pull the plug on your ethernet cable and well see if your server is smart enough to know nice try nooblet
it was actually in the preliminary release notes for dominion iirc but then got pulled for the final release pretty strange
one year ago ive filled bugreport about it  currently it is closed with words fixed in planetary interaction so 2 will be fixed in next expansion  tyrannis
1 agree with jeremey
logging out should never be an exploit however abusing logoff to get to an nth position that isnt where logoff 1 happened should be an exploit also the log out when just about to come out of warp and going 10000ms and are invulnerable should also be fixed
agreed at all
qft
agreed for 2 and 3 but 1 is intentional
it may be intentional but its still carebear if the log off timer was 2 minutes that nonaggro exploit wouldnt be so useful in most cases when people log right before they are targeted the attacker needs just 3060 seconds more to finish the joband lets face it if you log off on purpose to save the ship you deserve no pity you must be destroyed
ok has noone herd of combat probes have an lat sit with 4 probes at 1 at aound a gatesurvs 2 functions1 insta scan for bcs and bigger on log in if agressed for shootingbeing shot by uthe players ship will sit in space for 15minits so scan them down and kill them while they log off2 pilot in capship fitted with cloak will be scanned when they land on there ss grid the cloak is not going to sace them when u warp to 0m with a fleet containing ceptors and dronesi dont personaly see any of the ops complaints as exploits dont use them eitherif u want the km then go the extra mile to get it that simplestow whining and tool up for the job in hand
thats all fine and good until you go ld warping into insert combat scenario here and die because you had no chance to defend yourself against insert anything that shoots here a lot of legitimate disconnects happen at handoffs and spawn points like undocking jumping and entering a deadspace areaif you didnt get to kill that shiny freighter because he pulled the plug on you then you should have brought more firepower it sucks and it is carebear but you could have done it where as a legitimate disconnect shouldnt suffer a ton of grief over a technical issue as it is now i believe someone discoing is an exploit so when they do it report them and let ccp handle them ccp developed the 1 minute timer for a reason and with a lot of thought to prevent accidental ship losses and the influx of petitions that would follow asking for reimbursementso since you know that you have 1 minute to kill your target if heshe is a douche then plan accordingly and make the douche pay dearly especially since if he discos his pod will still warp off to a safespot and you can still report him for discoing and he lost his ship
how would probes help with catching lockimmune ship in lowsec or preventing ships breaking thru gazillions of bubbles from pos in whdont make ld jumps especially in systems with only 2 gates burn your cap to warp within 114 au from gate check then warp to gatethere should be absolutely no difference between disconnect and log off in pvp in pve it may be okay imo  as i stated this encourages players to simulate disconnect in trouble if you get disconnected often then your ispswitchpower upply is pile of  blame it and not ccp yes any disconnected person in pvp battle shouldnt have any additional optionsabilities when compared to logged off player
i love this suggestion as well as all the excellent discussion for and against this proposal would like to see more alsosupporting my own proposal

active tanking modules and bonuses need looked at simultaneously otherwise youll achieve nothing because its so much easier to fit an oversize extenderplate than it is to fit an oversize repper  boostera large shield booster  medium cap booster takes up more pgcpu than two large extenders and takes 109 seconds to make up the same amount of hp assuming lvl 5 skills not many 1 vs 1 fights are going to last long enough for that to be a worthwhile trade offon most cruisers the choice is between a large extender or medium booster  small cap booster until this discrepancy is fixed active tanking bonuses will be worthless on anything smaller than a battleshipquoted as proof that intelligence exists somewhere on the eve forums
strongly agree
i have to suprise you t3 can use covops cloaks they just lack of role of covertcynoshipsand just how letting them using cover cyno will make bos more worthless oo
only 2 things need to be done1 give it covert ops cloak2 give it longer jump rangeotherwise its foolishgive it a reason to be useful inspite of its shortcoming dps
i actualy like current feature of bos extra speed in cloak as i said before they are the only ships in game now who have that feature since sbs lost it yeah they cant warp cloaked but even then they are very good with t2 or even better faction cloakso unless ccp will make bos run faster even in covops cloak i am againt that fixthey are not an logistic ships like carrier or jf so why they need longer jump rangesound logical to me that bss size ship can jump only short distances bless thier creators they are able to jump at all 
for someone who likes black ops you obviously dont know much about how they are employed1 black ops ships are used as a jump bridge tool for any ship using covert ops cloaks the whole point of black ops ships is to covert ops to strike fast and stealthy soif a black ops ship cant warp while cloaked its a very expensive wandering target and not likely going to be used in ambushes without decent backup or an exitand only as a fancy covert ops bridge it never made sense to me to call it black ops when it cant even warp while cloaked yet it enables said ships with said ability to go vast distances2 longer jump range is for only jf and logistics are you for real what the hell did you think i was getting at if you had bothered to research youd see that the black ops has the most horid jump ranges for max range its dreadfully short and only allows at best short range strikes it has nothing to do with cargo carrying battleships have crap for cargo space as it is at best a fancy bpo carrier and even then thats just stupidnow if your going to argue why or why not try to think before you postcovert ops i can get why people may not like it much but thats just mebut everyone agrees that the jump range is limited why you dont doesnt make senseand the dps doesnt make sense for its role but the covert jump bridge makes up for ityet this is about how unloved they are sadly alot of us think they are great potentials for hit and run strikes but a very bloody expensive one at thatlets make it worth while
i warped alot in bo in lowsec space before never lost it to gate camp or something if you cant keep your bo safe reletevly without covops cloak it doesnt mean it cant be safe at alldreads need longer jump range much more then bos they dont get it titans direly need a longer jump range they dont get itits dreadfully short and only allows at best short range strikesthats what they are for short range strikes if you need longer distance prepare more cover cynos on the routetbh i like they even as they are now more to say i will hate to see the day then bos will become overpopular could be strange to hear but part of the bo strange is about thier unpopularity
if only because im tired of hearing about it on ts
i actually have to agree you guys are jumping the gun so to speak it would be best to see what they are doing before whining about italthough im certain nothing like increasing spawns of very valuble items in one certain area of space which happens to be host to a certain alliance would ever happen
agreed
bob still controlling your game eh
i am against anything that forces players to join player corps i am just as much against players being forced into any corp at all i am not forced into such things in the rl so a game that is supposed to be a sandbox should not be making those decisions for meplanet miningoperations should be just as mining is now highsec means lower valued resources and limited numbers there should be steps taken to somehow keep macro miners from setting up camp but system security levels should mandate what risk planet side structures are inpersonally i see planets becoming like moons something i will just not waste my time on well except if 514 turns out to be a good ideared
the only thing you are forced to do in this game is pay the monthly subscription to play so you have nothing to worry about
you cant launch a pos when in npc corp i dont hear ppl whining about that imho its the only logical step to make planet interaction require you to do the same as when launching a posplz ccp remove report to another place 
still n8 crystal ball but dont seem you should be in a corpas i was saying the pvp part is more like market combat not pew pewthe pew pew part come in low sec00 where you can deny moving the stuff you produce on planet away from the planet you can find the interview here
yeah i linked the interview at the very begining of my op so that is nothing new the main argument is that if you do not have to be in a player made corp whatever market planets will provide will be macroed just like belts are by marco miners in this case planetssure 00 and even low sec will be harder to do but every high sec planet will be fubaredit spelling
you have no idea of how the mechanic will work but you are sure that it will be something that can be macro mined if you had read the little stuff that has been said introducing tyrannis it dont seem the case it will be more similar to moon mining than asteroid mining start the activity and return after a time to collect the results we are both using a number 8 crystal ball upon very few informations but you add in your previsions the caveat that the developer will be totally stupid i hope they are reasonably intelligent hi sec return will be low but simply because the planets are relatively few and there will be a lot of competition so each planet will have a lot of players using a few resources as for all other activities that could be done with little effort little capital and low skills the net profit will decrease very fast to a minimum wage level it is the same for building trading and mining even high level missions are somewhat nerfed by that even if they require more skills and equipment and the bounties are fixed as the value of lp and loot has decreased to minimal levels rtm people will maybe do them no need for a macro if they will work as depicted in the b possible it is a good reason to deny them to part of the players no especially as the suggested cure will cure nothing forcing players and macro in shell corps with one wooden head sitting as ceo and one character will change nothing you wardec them and they move from one corp to another in 24 hours net result you have simply annoyed the real players forcing them to form shell corps but you have resolved nothing apparently some people think that forcing other players in shell corps will cure anything in the game wishful thinking but it will do absolutely nothing beside annoying people and making corporate management 1 a essential skill
more important is a function to filter bpcsbpos but htis has my support
with regards to the csm minutes posted in the recent dev blog there was a mention of the possibility of maknig it that being warp scrambled will stop a ship from being able to dock instead i would suggest creating a module specifically for this which can only prevent docking and has no other purpose this could only be fit to an interdictor high slot modulethe purpose of this modification to the original suggestion is1 to give the interdictors a unique role in high sec and low sec pvp currently they are quite rarely used in high seclow sec2 as per the conversation in the csm minutes it would be a way to counter docking games or carriers sitting on stations ganking ships with relative safety though i personally feel its not something which should be an effect of warp disruptingscrambling a ship there should be a specific choicedecision made to use the tactictldrmake a high slot module for interdictors which stops ships from docking
came in expecting to be against it but as long as its done as you suggesteda specific module and limited to interdictors id support it
agreed sounds like a good idea if its done where its a specialized mod only for ceptors
at the very least you need first windows in stations but even then it only will increase the amount of station camping going on
if this module prevents people from docking in highsec then i am against it however if station campers need help in low sec i really wouldnt care either wayof course the chances of this being an actual vote are pretty limitedred
i support this if stations also have windows so that you can see if someones outside waiting for you highsec wars tend to be mostly undock games which are lame
supported as in being only usable on a specific class ship what about interceptors s  under the condition that we can see whats outside the station while being docked
or better yet assault frigates to give them a role in fleetsi dont know really i am really against the whole hey i can see out the windows so i can fit specifici just see this as a docking game boost right now
imo docking prevention needs to be possible a specific mod for it sounds great to me but i am unsure if it needs to be restricted to a specific shipas far as windows i think they are not 100 necessary but i am not against them as long as them being required does not delay the implementation of docking prevention mechanicsthe mechanic for windows could possibly be implemented like the directional scanner could possibly work with a much longer delay 30 seconds and possibly not directional with limited range
as long as it only works on capital ships
this  station undock gankers do not need a boost thank you very much
the csm felt that any such module being introduced into the game would have to go hand in hand with being able to see and overview of what is outside the station while still docked though i personally liked the suggestion of making it more like the ship scanner and only able to be used once every 30 seconds
well tubes  one thing i notice u did not add in the opso as that is was not an iwin button for every shipi was restricted to a class of ship so that you would not have droves of ships fitted with it and perma holding some guy in placesecondly that it was a module not unlike ecm that when used would jam your ability to comunicate by jamming your sensorecomms arreyit would have a 30 second activation so that if it missed a cycle the player would have a chance of escapehe would need to be on the ball though
youre a moronand for your second point to me thats a stupid idea therefore i did not include it
sry not supporting this unless you have a way to see out you will get rped because currently you have no way to know a station is being camped then to undock although i do hate docking games
tractor beams that affect ships pull with a force and speed based on mass differentialpull those bastards right off the undockoh so fun
as it currently stands i will have to vote down on this one for nowsince the talks are heading towards a module to be used on one of the smaller ships i do not see a tackler pulling anything larger then another tackler no matter what the module wasslade
this was my initial concern but im sure it wont take long for the hordes to start recommending an alt to take a peak or trouble a friend a few systems away to come see for youwelcome to alts online
indeed although and alt wont help you when a lowsec or 00 station is being camped
supported interdictors are very fragile ships its not like they can just bubble and run away with this module make the range of this docking disruption module to be relatively short like 10km this way there will be considerable risk while operating antistation games interdictorbut yes i do agree that you should be able to see outside of the station if this is actually implemented
agreed to both pointswithout a means of seeing outside the station its an iwin button for station campers with a means of seeing outside its an interesting idea for a highly specialized fleet role
as it is having negative sec status is more like a badge of honor or prize for a pirate its just as useful as the bounty they carry there is absolutely nothing about a negative sec that cannot be overcome with an altno doubt this will cause lots of tears among what i call carebear pirates players that behave more like carebears than pirates and in spite of this whinage id like for us to maturely critique and discuss the following changes to make having negative standings more challenging and actually mean something more than just a badge to proudly display1 fix sec status so that anything resembling a pirate in lo sec can be attacked without penalty to ones self lo sec pirates usually keep their sec status above 5 which translates to a sec penalty if someone attacks them this goes hand in hand with making it more of a grind to rat your sec status up see point 52 make kill rights discreetly transferable so pirates dont know who has dibbs on them3 add higher sec penalties when blobs are involved in lo sec if a 10man gang attacks a solo ratter they take a greater hit in sec status the more pirates are involved in a kill the greater the sec status loss this should discourage blobsganks a bit4 make aggro timers dynamic and dependent on a players sec status the lower the sec status the longer the aggro timer yes i know its annoying but thats the point make negative status carry real consequences that cannot be circumvented with alts the current mickey mouse consequences are a joke and an honest pirate will admit to it so a 10 with aggro would have to wait maybe 15 to 20 minutes to be able to dock and clear his aggro5 make it so gaining positive sec status immediately after aggressing someone is harder for example if a carebear pirate wants to rat his sec status back up it will be more difficult to do if he had attacked someone in say less than a month ago if the carebear pirate has not attacked anyone in a month then he may rat his sec status back up at the normal speed this month can be thought of as reflection and penitence time that shows a genuine desire to be good panyway let the pirate tears blot out the sunin all seriousness i am expecting a whole lot of immature responses and the normal idiotic behavior id expect from carebear pirates however i will see past that and hope i can have a serious discussion with the more mature playerbasediscuss and critique
you really have not earned a constructive response based on your usual behaviorhowever im feeling kind this morning1 i got no problem with making life a tad rougher on  yellow pirates no tears from me here2 sure whatever wont matter to anyone ive ever flown with i never pay attention to whether anyone has kill rights on me in system as a 10 player i am a free target to everyone no tears from me here3 if being 10 is a badge of honor then i dont understand how you are hoping to illicit tears by making it easier to get to 10 no tears from me here4 if you make a proposal that actually diminishes the amount of pvp possible in the game dont expect it to be supported by many players or devs this one is so bad that it isnt going to go further than your imagination no tears from me here5 again if 10 is a badge of honor than you have just made it easier to both get there and stay there i got no problems with it it wont happen anyway the devs have this funny philosophy where they like for players to have few restrictions and lots of freedom strange no no tears from me herethis is why youll always be my cupcake you are just so darned cute
its not just about making it easier to get to 10 its about adding consequences on your way there as well as you said yourself these changes will mostly affect those playing sec status yoyo games namely carebear piratesin reference to your response to 4 its about adding real consequences as it stands there are no real consequences to having negative status it seems to me that out of everything i suggested this would be the only one to affect you and since that seems to be the case why would you stop pvping all together for this minor inconvenience whats wrong with earning that 10 with a little take whats wrong with having actual consequences to your actionsand if its as you say the whole point to pirating is to do it without any real consequences so that there is lots of pvp in the game then why not just get rid of the whole joke that sec status and bounties are that would surely encourage more pirating and more pvp in general would you not agreethanks 
yellow pirates should be concorded the minute they enter highsec i am almost always pirated when i enter lownull sec so they should feel the pain and be better balanced if you choose a life of crime then you need to forfit your civilized system rightsredflame suit on
do itnowim tired of using ctrlaltshiftdownarrowr for binds
mining should be boring i prefer it that way it should also remain as a reaaaallllyyy slow way to gain isk boring and the least profit making venture forces people to move on to other things its a natural progression and should not be messed with i like mining but also think that mining technology strip miners mining upgrades should not be advanced any furthermondaythursday i mine a few hours at night while i catch up on all my favorite shows friday i update all my variouis trade orders and saturday i run missions or do some things with friends if mining is messed with too much i have to spend more time trying to make enough isk to play thru the weekends
to give further purpose to certain modules faction turrets and to encourage players to fit faction ships with their racial modules make it so fitting a faction module on a ship from the same faction gives a slight boost to attributes this could come in the form of damage bonus turrets range webs or a general over heating bonus for the modules the bonus would be quite small perhaps 2 so it doesnt tread too much on the toes of deadspace modules
you mean a set bonus the problem is that if you 2 per gun or 2 more mwd for ships that alrady have a record of being solopwnzwagons then you end up with a ship that becomes a threat to sizes of ships that it shouldnt be fighting last thing i want to see is a dramiel that has enough dps to take down a battecruiser
its an interesting idea would do something to make otherwise identical mods distinct from each other and theres a certain logical appeal in having faction equipment optimised to function with their corresponding faction vesselas above though it would need to be implemented carefully in case a particular combination proved unbalancingly powerful tentative support
i was encouraged to post this on behalf on a lazy alliance mate i do agree it would need to be carefully implemented perhaps it would be less likely to result in over powered ships if it gave purely overheat damage reduction of a small amount just something to not make it overpowered but which does result in some benefitand just in case it wasnt clear from the op this would only apply to factionpirate ships not regular t1 or t2 hulls
it always seems logical to me to fit a navy raven with navy mods however i do agree it would be very tricky to balancenonetheless i like it
assuming that any balance issues can be worked out so that as mentioned before these ships dont become omgwtfsolobbqpwnmobiles of doom then im all for iti mean if im willing to field a faction ship with faction mods i should get some benefit from it aside from being called primary first
how hard would it be to have more missionsnot more missions as it stands now ie go here kill stuff return to base or the occasional mine this and bring it back or the go bring this to be from another stationbut rather more engaging missions maybe missions with a conversation between you and an npc instead of go here and click name accept mission maybe even a new mission type diplomacy missions if you will also maybe some scanningprobing missions maybe even some hackingarchaeological missions
nohulk pilots should just accept that flying a t2 ship means you lose a lot of cash when you fail to tank it and it dies if they want to be safe they should fly t1 covetors which are insurable thats what the gankers are doingits ganking people with marauders and whining because you never make any money at it
it was an example the loss is next to nothing is the point suicide ganking should be a group of ppl kill a freightor because the guy had alot of stuff that was worth money i think this idea is better than throwing away insurance or making suicide ganking  no insurance at all
no offense but having never been ganked your speaking out of your ass ive been ganked many times twice in a proteus few times while hauling lost 500mil on one haul and that sucks but its eve if people wanna be little s and cant take null sec then just use your killrights and take you money back
insurance is broken which is why suicide ganking is currently unbalanced rather than apply a bandaid to just one symptom fix the root cause make the insurance value dynamic based on the traded mineral cost of the ship so that it is never possible to make a profit from buying a ship to destroy it and the problem is largely solved along with several other problems
this  as much as malcanis and i rarely see eye to eye on anything hes got the right of this one insurance needs to stop being based on fixed based prices and start being based on the actual value of the asset which is how real insurance policies work

r u proposing to make t2 and t3 all reward no risk so t1 becomes utterly useless cause theres already a game like thatits called world of warcraft
ive got two problems with suicide ganking on the whole1 as people have said the current minimum loot to be a worthwhile gank is way too low you could have half an industrial full of quafe and itd be profitable to gank if someone is hauling lots of expensive stuff they should have to be on the lookout but im of the opinion that moving say an iteron ii of tritanium should be fairly safe on autopilot this also applies to ganking for tears where people begin to gank expensive ships not for profit but merely because theyll destroy more than they lose because you lose so little if you want to say well lose 100 mil of ship to destroy 200 mil of ship sure at least youre putting something out there 10 mil for 500 mil not such a good exchange2 escorting in hisec is tricky youre basically relegated to rrs and even then ganksquads are rather quick and youd need good timing or a lot of repairs because the ganking side will always always always have the first shot theres no way to be proactive about escorting in short if ive got a 200 million isk budget to protect my industrial full of tritanium and the gankers have a 100 million isk budget to gank it theyll win every time because theres no real way to spend that money to proactively defend against ganking this harkens back to the spentdestroyed comparison uptop because the gankers only really need to factor in their single target ship the industrial can spend 500 million isk on escorts but all that really mattes is how much tank they can pack into the target ship which is fairly limited without a lot of rr whereas the ganksquads applied dps is far more easily raised hire another raven it also has the same issue as eccm namely you have to fit and prepare for someone that probably wont occur so youre better off just losing a ship every once in a while and not sacrificing your daytoday effectiveness hiring a merc corp to escort you everywhere with rrs for instance means youll never make a profitthe combination of 1 and 2 is bad because it basically puts hisec industry at the mercy of suicide gankers with no real way to combat it ideally if the gankee is willing to expend more resources than the gankers he should have some sort of defensive option
all kinds of greatness in this threadbs turrets are too small in fact they should be about 3x the size they are now at a minimumall gun effects suck except lasersgo figure acs should either fire a burst of ammo or continuously fire through the cycle time and both projectile systems should have much better firing and hitting effects hybrids also have crappy effects most guns sound like complete crapthough i like med rails a large ac should sound more like a 25mm bushmaster chaingun instead of a spitwad cannon and a small ac should sound like a burst from a minigun with the cycle noise in between bursts even if the computer is simulating the sound give me the choice of the sound hell in theory you could program the computer to make it sound like you were shooting geese or cows at your enemy so why not soundehreal then intensify the effect if you are overheating the systemmissile effects are ridiculous in that i would love to see smoke trails and explosions that were much smaller and spherical instead of planarthe hull damage idea is cool though aging as you own your ship is kind of dumb but if it is limited to your client and you can turn it off then i am all for it at least let me bust out a high pressure washer and a paint brush to keep her looking good and dont kill bandwidth with something unnecessaryit would be cool to see smoke coming from your engine if you are using an ab or mwd intensify this for overheating as welli dont like the change to wrecks since it really adds nothing to the game unless you are directly looking at the wreck but mehsounds good
this was mentioned in the cp section and i quite liked the ideasomething in game needs to be added to allow for the smuggling of drugs the idea of risking a payload of drugs to sell in highsec seems like it could be quite interesting if done right not to mention boosters could take a slight tweak anyways

more words tia
this many of those actuallyedit supporting my own idea 
only when we start banning stupid proposals
i want to know the net isk flow from eve insurancetheres the negative flow from purchases of insurance plans and positive flow from payouts what is the net change over 1 month does it fluctuate greatly from month to month or is is a stable figurei think this data would help people discussing insurance system more objectively and theres no reason to keep the info hidden
you mean the same guy that didnt know that the increase in pyerite prices came from insurance fraud
1 your topic is in the wrong place the assembly hall is for proposals and issues of which this is neither2 net incomeexpenses depend on the mineral prices of the month higher mineral prices  more cost to build  less or negative insurance payout from selfdestruction lower costs  lower cost to build  more profit from insuring and selfdestructing3 minerals will never go below a certain price market floor because when they get cheap people buy them and there there is less of them and when people stop buying they get cheap because there is more of them supply and demand
yeah the same guy
isnt the assembly hall is for what you want to bring to the attention of the csm i think this is an excellent place to ask this question anyway what i would like to see the eveonline economist do is calculate insurance policies for ships every few months i guess this is a proposal
im sure it been asked for before why must my freighter pilot have to contract all his rigged ships to an alt to have the alt set up a courier contract for the freighter pilot to deliverand once the ships are delivered the alt has to contract them back to the freighter pilotplease make it so that the freighter pilot can make the courier contract and accept it himself in fact seeing as this is also nonsensical just allow rigged ships to be placed in a freighter without all the contract malarky
as the way i see it in eve if your escorting a ship you cant really throw yourself in front of oncoming fire therefore i believe that there should be a modulewarfare link that makes you unable to target a certain ship i think it should be a warfare link within the fleet that forces the targeting system of the hostile ship to randomly select another ship in the fleet that is in system and in range while i do see some exploitsfaults with this idea i was hoping that the community could help work them out otherwise the community would come to realize that this idea could not ever work please provide criticism

hisome of the ingame effects got an overhaul recently and are stunning now for instance laser or projectile effects or the armor rep effect or the web effect btw make sure youve hdr and bloom enabled  it is a huge difference sometimesother effects didnt get an update yet1 missiles  graphicssee my sig thats what i mean  missiles should be launched at separated points on the ship its a pity theyre blobbed in one uncool glowing ball atm it would look way cooler if they would fly on parallel routes onto the target and no it wouldnt lead to more server lag because its a pure client side effect which can be turned of the server doesnt even need to know about detached missile routes for the server its still one volley of a number grouped missile launchers if the missiles are detached they should look small but more gleaming for ingame comparison just look the new salvager effect the shiny point in the wreck or just remember the look of star trek photon torpedos2 missiles  soundthey sound to lowtech hissing to loud and not powerful enough imo and its the same sound for all sizes turrets do different sounds for different turret sizes i propose a more hightech and more subtle  but powerfull at the same time  launch sound good comparison are the missile effects in the new bsg series cylons or the star trek series and movies3 rails  graphicsi did a serpentis mission first time after enabling bloom and hdr the incoming railgun effect of the npcs was really awesome difficult to descibe maybe call it a ultra fast moving shred of high energy towards you important is thats not a continuous ray  thats what makes them different from lasers and looks cool as said  the npc railgun effect is nice only the player railgun effect looks unspectacular why4 rails  soundsmall and medium rails are nice imo its the short and hefty bang sound which makes them cool just large rails should sound much more hefty they sound weak atm 5 blasters  soundsame like rails the large ones sound too weak blaster in general should sound very dry and short and hefty atm its a bit too much hissing imo6 sentry and combat drones  graphicsthey are barely visible on the field right now only exception are projectile drones sentry and combat maybe id like to see a much more visible effect  like logistics drones for instance gallente and caldari drones could do a blasterlike combat drones or railgunlike sentries effect ofc not that dominant like turrets but still very good visible its a pity a sentry dominix just get lost when an amarr bs starts its light show 7 combat drones  soundthe bigger ones should do a more brutal sound than the smaller ones atm they do the same8 lasers  soundlasers are too dominant atm you need to have just one laser ship in your fleet and you dont hear anything other  imho they should tuned down a bit that would appear more hightec and spacelike then also9 sensor boosterseccm  graphicstoo bright and really disturbing over the time 10 sensor boosters  soundtoo loud and disturbing needs to tuned down a fair bit11 shield hardeners  graphicsid propose any fancy effect here instead of just a second semitransparent layer around the ship and each spike the armor hardener effect is really nice in comparison12 shield hardeners  soundthey are too dominant13 shield amor and hull notificationswhy these beep sounds more aura1 plz let aura announce low shields or low armor  she does that for capacitor alreadyone note to my too loud remarks if one effect is too loud lowering the master game volume doesnt help much  other sounds your capacitor is empty wouldnt be hearable that way thats all
not supported ever think that perhaps highsec poss are harder to kill by design to even put one up you need a corp standing of 10x the sec status of the system with the owning faction plus it consumes faction charters which you or whoever you buy them from needs to run missions to get the lp to purchase them with in whiskey space you have the option of building a dread in the system to take it down as last i checked the xtralarge ship array could build them and didnt need sov to anchoronline
declining a mission usually means hey i dont wanna do this mission and not i dont wanna do this mission please offer me the same exact mission in another system can we please get the mission system changed to where if you decline a mission you arent offered that mission immediately after declining it the first timethis is incredibly frustrating
stupid that i have to make another post to support my own idea
this is stupid it really is think through it first insurance puts a floor on the prices miners receive for their work and even mission runners to some extent it encourages pvp by making ships cheaper and by covering more of a loss hello insurance people are more willing to undockthink of a real world scenario i have car insurance that covers all damage after 500 i pay my money every six months lasts three months in eve and im set i get a new car if my car gets owned im not scared to drive because my car might get wrecked because i know it wont be the end of the world people do take losses on insurance when they fly multiple ships with rigs as there is no reason to not rig now some insurance will inevitably lapse people cant easily make money through insurance but you also shouldnt fault people for using a mechanic in the game for making money if anything you should go after macrominers that oversupply the minerals that make producing ships that cheaply possiblemy second major point is the absolute last thing this game needs is fewer people undocking because they are scared of losing their ships if you think it is bad now just imagine how it would be if you cut insurance payouts by 13 or more it is really really dumb
im surprised there is so little comment on ccps response to suicide ganking and insurance essentially its suicide ganking is ok except we will put protections in case newbies accidentally concordokken themselves whether or not your position on it i would have expected more back and forth posted in the minutes on that and a more detailed response from ccpalso this little gemso dont expect faction warfare to be upgraded anytime soon but well fix any exploits we see pop up if it wont kill the serverthe csm raise needed points but ccps response to me is pretty disappointing
macro miners dont bother me even when i see 70 ships sitting in a ice feild isk farmers actually dont bother me either and it would seem that eve actually does a pretty good job of finding and banning those players however i do understand that wide spread farming can have adverse effects on a game so see the need for ccp to be active if there is proof that a macro miner is an isk farmer then ban the accounti tried ice mining for a while but quickly decided its not worth the effort one field i was bothered quite often by the other real people who were very territorial of their ice field but the other one which was obviously a macro field didnt bother me once and i was able to try the ice mining out given the choice between chatty cathys and mining bots i preger the bots cause they leave everyone else alone
the planets  phisically correct planets would be good to take a look at granted as far as i understand ccp has already acknowledged that there is issue but seeing as planetary interaction is coming as next expansion it might be worth poking at it some to make sure it is something that does not get forgotten as its a lot harder to fix afterwards
this thread is bad and you should feel terribleyou are also misusing the definition of playing in the eve universe change it to paying would be more accurateif you are paying you have the option of playing where as someone who is was ghost training would not you may say but i actually meant playing  but then do you really expect people to play 237365finally as people have said the offline training at a constant speed is one of the unique feature and draws of eve if you dont like it then gtfo and find another mmo that has a experience system that you like there are plenty out there
declining a mission usually means hey i dont wanna do this mission and not i dont wanna do this mission please offer me the same exact mission in another system can we please get the mission system changed to where if you decline a mission you arent offered that mission immediately after declining it the first timethis is incredibly frustrating

reasonable request actually just set a flag on that mission you declined and reset it after the next mission is offered

thats the most interesting part of your post for me are you implying that most fleet battles in 00 happen because both fcs honestly believe theyre going to win and that the objective is to onevolley the opposing ships if the enemy is able to disengage at will then i cant see any other conclusionin some respects your point is selfcontradictory fighting from 230km clearly holds a massive advantage if it changes the enemys perspective from lets fight i think well win this one to we have no chance of winning i realise that given your earlier point this would not get you any kills but it clearly has tipped the scales massively in your favour and thus is a powerful advantagethats an interesting point and a good one the advantage of extra range is of course that you can outdamage the enemy snipers at that range but if most of your fleet is still at the standard range then they can still be fired onso you can make pseudoinvincible rokhs but if these form a small percentage of your fleet its not likely to swing things one way or another or in other words it merely changes the order of the enemys primaries pushing your rokhs to the end where you argue they might be anyway due to the resist bonus so its only going to materially have an impact once all the nonrokhs are deadmmmhmm that does seem a bit silly especially when a sniper ship could get a second bonus to help with this  damage and tracking being the obvious ones though both of these are typically gallente bonuses so presumably thats why they havent been appliedi dont know if negated is quite the word it arguably makes your ship individually better the issue is that most of your gangmates dont have the same advantage and so die first and then its a nvs5ni fight if you lost or a win if you win but this is surely always true of inspecting individual performance of a ship in a fleet composed of disparate ship typesonly compared to lasers unsurprisingly arties have half the clip size and have to reload tooonly compared to the capless projectiles lasers take mroe than twice as much cap and yes almost all amarr laserboats get a cap reduction bonus but that basically turns them into singlebonused ships just so they can use lasersagain lasers fare arguably worse here with fixed damage types that are additionally worse against armour likely to be the dominant tank in bs fleets as i understandtrue though for a given dps low alpha  high rof and depending on the situation its not clear which is preferableall highcalibre longrange guns are hard to fit whether rails are harderi to fit to their respective ships is hard to say but 425s seem easier to fit than 1400 arties or tachs rails have notably lower base grid requirements at the very leastcould you expand on that at a glance they dont seem to be tiered any worsebetter than beams or arties looking at damagerangefallof vs capfittingtracking
its a reasonable point and i believe in that situation i might find it within me to trust my sargeant however if the sargeant then wants to propose refinementsimprovements to the cleaning process based on his beliefs and without any hypothetical testing then he does need to be able to justify his proposals even to those who have not had to clean guns in a warzone before especially as the chances are that half the board that will review his request will not have the same experience he does and because his proposals will ripple beyond the sargeants operational theatrein order to investigate the problems with the weapons system i was establishing the baseline situation replace mega with typically shortestranged fleet sniper the weapons system is irrelevant at that point as its purpose is merely to establish the maximum range that commonly all fleet snipers can engage at and which the fc will use if hes going to warp everyone as one blobeft 212 at least does include hit quality in damage figures and so shows a gun doing 40 dps at optimal and 15 dps at optimal  falloffi dont know about well within theoretically its 23148 for the tachs vs 27458 for 425s so the tachs are at 915 falloff at which point they do 437 base damagein practice this is irrelevant because of the locking range cap but i definitely support removingincreasing this to allow a rokhs longer optimal with spike to at least exist additionally tachs are slightly problematic with respect to balance and i would tentatively support a review of them comparing against megabeams rokhs optimal is at 168 falloffnot ignoring  acknowledging and investigating how this fix would put things as said above i agree that the lock limit needs to be lifted clearly this is a technological decision probably one made 6 years ago when 250k is enough for anyone indeed but if theyre balanced on raw stats and broken on ships the ships must be fixed not the guns
1 the proposal is based on data ship utilization fleet engagement envelope ship attributes corroborated by numerous independent parties it is not based on beliefs but on experience experience can be quantified that define the design framework2 hypothesis testing we are dealing with a deterministic system it is a simulation after all and we have the functions eft falloff calculations hypothetical testing in this case is running the numbers in eft and making the graphs if you want to discuss benchmarking and how we should do it for these ships sure ill be happy to explain3 you seem to have not read the thread where the different scenarios and ripples to other railgun applications pve are examined extensively we even discussed how this change will affect the performance of kronos and came to the conclusion that it will enhance it without making it more powerful than the rest of the marauders it will actually not move it at all in the pecking order but it will be a more satisfying ship to fly4 you seem hellbent to force the discussion on changing ships instead of the weapon systemammo interaction as i have said before a 15 damage increase to the ammo is very interesting and it might be exactly what blaster users are asking lets enumerate the ships that need a buff because of hybrids rokh mega hype ferox eagle deimos harpy moa merlin would you suggest that all these get a damage bonus to compensate for the railguns anemic performance oh wait some of them already have one and it does not fix the problem therefore we need to look for the simplest solution ocams razor the common trait is the weapon system therefore the weapon system needs to be fixed5 you seem confused you talk about hypothetical situations that do not happen or require a system change more radical than increasing the damage attributes of railguns just to let you know if the lock limit increases to 300km the probability for lag situations increases by 80 i dont think ccp will lift the lock limit any soon6 baseline situation was established you failed to substantiate any faults in that baseline you try to hypothesize a different situation that we informed you many times does not happen you want to pass that nonexistent situation falsely as baseline well to do so you need to prove to us that your hypothetical situations are more probable than what we use as baseline from field data in effect if you can get the fcs of it rzr a atlas mm tcf etc to come here and state that they order engagement for their fleet at 230km then you will have justified your views otherwise you are just trying to create a strawman argumentto recapitulate1 fleetbs engagement envelope is 170190km fleet operates as a unitmegaspests will warpin  170 apocsrokhs  1902 sniperhac engagement envelope is 70100km range is dictated by game mechanics and ship speed agility get in position burning w mwd3 ranged antisupport engagement envelope is out to 80km mission is to obliterate asap any enemy support that enters that area to protect the fleet bsis that clear now btw care to enlighten us what is your experience with hybrids
lets form a fleet together if you can warp to warp to me at 150km with the click of a button then you win the argument and rokhs can warp in at 230km and engagethe problem with your argument is that the way fleet fights work is a cloaky or ceptor sets up between 50100km from the enemy fleet then the fleet warps to them at 100km alternately for a fleet that is already in place they setup several sniping locations at about 150180km from the gate the enemy will come in through in this case you have no ability to engage at any other range that the sniping spot range as you are warping around the gate so warping at anything other than 0km will put you closer to the enemies not furtherin effect even if you wanted to engage at a longer range than the rest of the fleet the only way to do that is to warp in at the same point as everyone else then use up your cap burning out to the range you want to engage at in the meantime the fleet is probably about to warp to another spot this happens every few minutes so the other fleet cannot get a close range warpin on your fleet so if range is a benefit the warpto ranges would need to be at least 200km and that would only work half the time allowing warp ins less than 200km would only allow the warp in point to be closer to the enemy fleeta sniper engagement is like a ballet where both sides keep moving to prevent their ships from being tackled by a dictorhictor generally both fleets align to a warp out spot so ships can immediately warp out if they are locked unless a pilot is an idiot and doesnt warp right away the only way to kill them is to 1volley them the only time when warp outs are not used is when a system is swarming with both fleets so warp outs are not safe lag is usually horrible in those cases so rr usually can get to work before a second salvo is fired so you are left with needing to 1salvo them once morewhen a fleet finds that they cannot 1salvo the other fleet repeatedly andor start losing their own ships andor see that their sniper spots are compromised they will disengagethis is how sniper fights work in eve so no having a fleet capable of engaging at a longer range will only be a benefit until the other fleet adapts at which point your fleet will have to adapt eventually both will disengage because neither will be able to engage for more than a few seconds at their desired range and they will quickly run out of safe warp inout spotsbringing a sniper hac to a sniper bs fight is suicide plus both ship types have almost the same cost but the hac doesnt have insurance

not supportedi tend to support personal player skill in pvpwhile those maneuvers are useful if they are done automatically it lowers the bar for skilled pvpeve navigation system is already extremely dumbed down more like rts than space sim even tho you control just 1 ship instead of many  where dumbed down system is warranted i want to see some people fly well because they learned how to do it not because ccp gave them new buttons

bumping to put into the view for the next csm meeting
1 shield and armor tanking is two different concepts2 regeneration is an integral part of shield tanking3 you give up other things in order to gain regeneration4 a dumbed down example is to square shield regeneration against lower nominal hp total with worse fitting restrictionsoptions5 thus any percentage based armor bonus is likely to introduce a higher total hp bonus crude 1600mm mindlink hp bonus  lse mindlink hp bonus6 not letting shield bonuses apply instantly and citing regeneration is thus dually punitive regneration and total hp let the bonuses apply instantly let the shields gain the indirect bonus to regenerationno need for complex balancing actsthe effective application of the regeneration bonus is far less representative ingame than the loss of total hp is limitingelse provide me one live example where added effect of regeneration would risk throwing the game balance worse than what is currently incurred support for the idea even if the regeneration penalty isnt needed in my book
not supportingyou propose more ship stats to be changed every time anyone leavesjoins fleet  thus create more lag and lag on joining fleet is bad enough already so no thanksplus i cannot care less about some puny hp boost thats somehow delayed
what this is already done every time you change localbooster change localit wouldnt make a difference at allso pls check that support check box like the rest of us thx
speaking before thinking ftlpeople train shield management for 5 per level 10 level 5 siege warfare or 15 with the implant is a huge deal especially on bigger ships even if you are in an armor tanked bs having an additional 10 shields is usually 10003000 extra ehp imagine the difference on a capital or super capital huge
signedmost of the capitals which i was involved in killing tried to selfdestruct most succeeded its rude to steal killmails in such a wayyou dont want lossmail  you make something to stay alive
while wardeccing is a bit broken to say the least there arent many ways it could actually be improved still i had a couple of ideas1 pay for timethe wardeccing corp has to choose how long the war will last when they declare and pay an isk amount per day so just for example 10mil isk per day so a 4 day war will cost 40mil2 keeping the peacewardec costs are just bribes to concord to look the other way still no matter how much you pay them there is such a thing as going too far leave wardecs as they are but have it so that they are void in 09 and 10 systems after all these are highly policed and civilised systems you cant just have people disrupting the peace by blowing each other up outside of stations on a more practical note it would give members of a wardecced corp at least some areas that could feel vaguely safe in bar the odd suicide gank of course theres not much to do in 0910 but such is the price of safetyon another note unless youre just really unlucky if your corp is falling apart due to random greifer wardecs then odds are its failcorp either work together to do something about it or find a new onecarebear and industrialist

i had my share of disconnects both during a fight and just travelingand i cant think of a single pvp situation where i was glad that the server disconnected me you know whybecause when you pvp you have the 15 min aggro timer people who disconnect during pvp do not benefit from current exploit mechanics at all only the people who disconnect seconds before aggro benefit and what are the chances that you are going to randomly disconnect within a few seconds on combat233600  82800so for 10 seconds its 18280 chance of legitimate disconnectand what are the chances of somebody disconnecting on purpose 10 seconds before combat im pretty damn sure its 1000 times more
every other mmorpg i have played has a harsher log off system than in eve and that is just flat out unacceptable for a hardcore mmorpg in these other games you have to sit still for 2030 seconds and if something interrupts you like say by attacking you you must sit there until you reconnect if you die then so be itlets get real here the vast majority well over 99 of log offs after jumping through a gate are not real disconnects and ffs if you log off you should reappear exactly where you left off no repeated log onlog off tricks to magically teleport to a safe location these exploits should have been fixed years ago and it is an embarrassment for ccp to be so blindi thought this csm was supposed to bring issues to ccp how many years have players repeatedly brought up this subject to ccp with no response supporting this although i have little hope as ive been watching targets get out of jail free for well over 3 years

no all itll change is that if today they have to work hard to kill a logoffski unless its a russian macro but then they are macros and are obnoxious to trickstomorrow those who today go in recklessy with a chance to die will stop going in recklessy and thus the chances of killing them will decrease not increaseanyway all of this talk is pointless without proper statictics which ccp probably got telling what  of logoffski missed kills vs how many non logoffski kills happenits probably a zero dot zero zero something  and its why its in the backburner compared to how often real disconnects happensome will miss the simple fact that not everyone live in london many connect with all what they contry has to offer that is garbage i used to have some greek friends who envied me when i had a 200k awful dsl with 500ms latency they had to pay like 65 euros a month to have it even worsei dont know how much their situation changed since 2 years ago i recall when we raided and they disconnected all at least once every 4 hours imagine how nice would be to lose weeks of grinding with such probability and have no chance to have a better connection
start playing in 00 you obviously have no glue what you are talking about i can tackle a ship and it logs out after a minute not ewarping to a 1 mio spott it logs out  how do scan a ship thats not there we are not talking so much complaining about ships that log off before they got tackled though i say logging off in front of an enemy should never be an option for saving the ship we are talking about ships that are successfully tackled and taking damage that have not not aggressed and therefore do not get the 15 minute timer but log out after one minutein essence freighters and other capitals are completly indestructible to small to medium gangs who cannot burn through the hp in one minute  but would certainly be abble to take down the ship in 15 minutesi dont request to change the current log off times i only request that a ship thats being aggressed by players get the 15 minute timer 
1 no  besides theres another story to it after that2 definitely3 definitely
well like i pointed in another unrelated thread about rr mechanics old  ugly foundation code read touch it and the game easily breaks is managing both pve and pvp and this is a major scare factor for ccp to make changes expecially when the cases are so specificin particular in some places the code seems not discerning between npc vs pc being the originator of the actionsexample of very often dc  crash scenario player warps in plex or mission npcs could almost instascram usually its npc frigs vs player battleship size signaturewith no intervening mechanic the ship is basically as good as deadto counter this ccp made frigs randomly turn off scram or switch to web and often theres some kms of space before the frigs can lock all to prevent lots of ragequits and petitionsthere are still some missions which are an harsher exception to this though and its why i believe they still let exist that behavior you noticednow if the combat code could detect that its a pc point being made and not an npc it could probably act differently something tells me its not so though and to change it it requires to open their canoworms codemaybe its intended they are bringing their biggest available horsepower not an iteronyou are bringing in an agile setup to be able to gtfo i suppose are you sure you are not being bear at all in this that is not your biggest available horsepower yet you want to kill their biggest horsepoweri mean would using battleships be enough yes they are but you use bcs and  or hacs and  or inties etc because you dont want to be hotdropped so you are also not perfectly virgin in this talksaid that id be totally fine to have pc scrammed ships die i just dont think ccp are ready to fiddle with what works since yearsill even add more meat about the exploits ok its fine that t3 needed some push because after so much work they revealed to be meh and players ignored thembut isnt it vastly too much to sell t3 to the players to give them te ability to be unscannable what counter for that logoffski can be countered with effort exactly like mwd  cloak can be  100 safebut whats counterable about total immunity from probes goes to create a thread for it
support all  its just stupid that you can save your ship just by logging off
seems like its related to your connection anyway as i didnt have any single occassion of such dcs all of dcs ive experienced are problem of my ispfyi  npcs do not have scan resolution they have reaction delay min and max random amount of milliseconds between two these is picked after which they lock youpersonally i dont mind intervening in pveonly as long as it can be steadily and reliably separated from all other caseslol they do not switch scram to web if you stay in their scramweb rangeso you say that you can catch warplogoff freighter in lowsec
it is not a disconnection in fact i did not disconnect had just to press ok to the message game just acted up an eventuality you cannot remove even with years of debuggingand thats exactly what atm is not implemented along with proper rr attribution of aggression  timers etcsome things are very old ie the counters to rring npcs till they would kill an npc scrammed player piloted neutral shipthis is why they are probably vary to change things the ripple consequences are always ready to bitei mission for lots of hours a week do you think i have not seen what frigs do they can drop scram whether its another ship putting up the web same name cant demonstrate its the same or its the one who previously had scram up does not change the resultevesearch for noirs tutorial
then its a bug which needs to be tracked down and fixed eliminating its impact by mechanics which will influence tons of other situations is bad ideawell from what ive seen in pve logout  disconnectthen their orbit is close to scram range 7500 for some npc frigs and from time to time they move out of itwill do didnt see it
they can remove this bug but ccp wisely i am a programmer in rl too and see this to often cannot be sure they removed all of the sources of crash and thus they play on the prudent sidebut here comes the catch you can always disconnect by plugging the cable be it because its genuine dc or notso how would the game discern a malicious dc vs a legit oneccp conservatively chose to consider all dcs as legit by default because this saves them tons of customer care and petitionswhat do you offer in trade that you put a thank you ccp on a killboardhow its achieved is not my concern it happens even when i stand still got the tank for it for several missions less wrecks spread quicker salvaging

1 no2 and 3 signed
signed for warplogoffthe first two are bad only for campers the first is bad only within lowsec and when you do not have enough damage and im not agreed with the idea to stimulate some idiotic camping
you have never had a disconnect while zoning docked in jita 237
logoffskis are a pain in the arse to be sure and itd be nice to eliminate themhowever legit disconnects happen all the time  and whilst this is the case i wouldnt support changing the game mechanic  better that a hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man gets punishedbesides if the problem were that severe thered hardly be any kills in new eden  a brief perusal of the various killboards available tells me thats not the case

i even had multiple losses due to disconnect but i have balls to not whine and admit that its my probprob of isp and loss is legit
and so what if ccp will fix these exploits legit disconnects will happen all the time tooa brief perusal of current freighters pilots actions tells us that these exploits are used by almost every freighter pilot in lowsec
eve has always followed a very healthy basic philosophy everything has a risk vs reward component and dont fly what you cannot afford to loseeven the borderline techniques namely logoffski mwdcloak playing with grids all have more or less laborious countersyou can bring probes and risk bigger ships to counter known logoffkers you can drones spam and leave all sorts of wrecks and so onbut what is the counter to an unscannable ship none that i know some could try indirect ways to find tracks but they are totally ineffective against anyone who is not macroing  sleepingnow its understandable that t3 ships needed more incentive to be accepted by the player base but isnt giving immunity a touch too much wasnt the bubble advantage big enoughis breaking the long standing eve philosophy a fair price to pay just because a class of ships was not selling well as expectedsince those scan immune ships can still accomplish the missions it means the downsides are negligible vs the advantage of denying pvpthere is no one saying i chose to still be scannable in enemy territory so i can kill  defend vs npcs better this is because this feature is imbalanced in fact its basically a de facto standard to make the ship immune to scan as soon as the ship is going to risk pvp or even just to bypass players interaction unscannable in missions  no risk of ninjaing no risk of mission item stealing all mechanics ccp wanted to havethis also brings a negative impact on other ships who have to pay dearly aka tight specialization for their ability to perform tasks that can still be effectively done in a lone t3 shipok t3 is meant to be versatile but then whats the disadvantage whats the counter just some higher isk cost
you can kill them on gates stations when they attack you just do it
why cant do this on every other ship as well and they are even bound to bubbles so the other ships share this weaknesson the contrary any other ship becomes immune once they leave gates stations and so on how many other ships share this strength and still can combat
your claim was they are invulnerable but they are not that was my hole point
they are invulnerable to the scanning mechanic
i have an idea for cloaking which at least seems interesting in concept if not in actual mechanicswhen using covops cloaks ie the only ones where you can do anything at all with the cloak on if you warp you hafta pay a small fuel cost around 20 units per au jumped after which you decloak this might balance recon cloakers slightly but afk cloaking is fine if youre so paranoid of someone who cant move shoot or chances are even find you you shouldnt be complaining after all you can still see them in localedit so what if theyre scan immune thats the whole point of a cloak thats like saying you should be able to shoot people while cloaked
he is talking about a common setup for t3 shipsdissolution sequencer electronic subsystem gives sensor strength per levelinterdiction nullifier propulsion subsystem bubble immuneoptionallycovert op offensive subsystemwarfare processor defensive subsystem gang link bonusesthe dissolution sequencer subsystem can raise your sensor strength to a lvl where it is very hard to probe you out when you fit 12 eccm jfyi formular is sigradiussensorstrength  108so for roaming gangs you get a nice commandship that is relatively safesome people also use this relative safety from being probed to run missionsplexes in less friendly space but their tanks are usually pretty gimped compared to the full potential tanklast but not least this also works on other ships ceptors eg so you can have a double eccm stiletto waiting in a safe to land tackle or just gather inteli wonder if we will ever see a day where people dont whine
unscannable ships are about as harmless as afk cloakers
so in short the whine here is about not being able to ninja salvage a t3 mission runneri never liked that ninja mechanic so im fine with thatbut maybe the op is right and that might just might need looking atanything else that can be acomplished with an unscanable ship can also be acomplished with any ship with cloakplease next time dont hide your whine behind so much text
out of curiousity and since you seem to be all about balance what is the counter to ninjaing
since 80 of my current income comes from missioning you are looking at the wrong direction about ninjas and similarthey are despisable individuals but ccp decided to support their miniprofessionif everyone else has to be subject to them why some should notafk cloakers cannot farm plexes under someone elses face thoughsalvaging while doing the mission is a good startshooting the wrecks at least denies them the stuff but i have yet to resort to it due to the abovepersistent pests are usually fixed by warping out and getting them killedno the unscannable ship breaks an eve principle that is everything has a counterif they made say a 1b module that can be the only one that can be fitted and only on another t3 ship and that 1b module allows to track an unscannable ship then there would be a counter sure itd be used very few times but the principle would be restored
you can not probe out the ship but you can probe out the plex the anomaly the drones some people are stupid enough for thatyou can wait for them on gates you can wait for them on stationsthey made some effort to make your life harder but it is not impossible to catch them so you have to put some effort in to get the killif you want easy kills run missions
ummm so your solution for someone doing say level 3 missions is to fit salvagers and tractor beams on their caracal and race the ninjaer to them or let me guess they should l3 on marauders  but you find it ridiculous when someone suggests to catch t3s at the gateoh and destroying your own wrecks isnt a counter its just trying to spite someone for stealing your wreck while spiting your own self in the process
unscannable ships are used for two thingsmissions in hostile areassafe gang bonuseshow is the first bothering you their efficiency is significantly cut down and they can be caught patience is a virtuethe second instance needs looking into but imo this is more a problem with ships giving bonuses off grid than it is unscannable shipsas stated unscannable ships cannot run plexes with immunity as you can simply scan out the signature
they farm intel with impunity which is what theyre there to do in the first placesee my response abovethis isnt a counter this hoping wishing and praying that the ninja salvager is stupid enough to not warp away if he cant tank npc ratstry again with ninja salvaging none of your suggestions were valid or they are as good a suggestion as the ones you were provided to counter unscannable ships 
 salvage before they do or get a friend to do it for you very new players make great slave labour they dont want for much laziness is no excuse
exactly if someone is too lazy for not wanting to use a properly set up gatecamp to catch t3s at the gate that isnt an excuse either under a properly set up gatecamp no ship is immune
when the cry goes out that a t3 has been found near your space you end up with enough people in a fleet to properly catch that ship a t3 ship showing up in someones space draws the same attention as a faction bs or capital ship people are willing to bubble and reinforce poss to get them the only two places where a t3 ship has a dramatic advantage is in low sec and when traveling rapidly through low sec or 00if you want to make them scannable then all cloaked ships should be scannable which would be one of the biggest nerfs ever
cloaked ships cant fire weapons use ganglinks etcespecially those t3 fleet boosters are invincible on a safe spot there is a reason why ganglinks cant be activated while warping after all you can simply exploit this mechanic by using an unprobable ship this should be considered an exploit
wait what it cant be probed because it is cloaked if it is cloaked the gang links arent on if it isnt cloaked you can find it with probes
read the whole thread pls you can make ships unprobable without using cloak by raising your sensor strength to 108 of your signature radius can easily be done with the correct subsystem of t3 ships and some eccm modules you even can fit 2 command processors and 3 ganglinks along with covert ops cloaking and interdiction nullifier good at gates on your way to safespots perfect gang booster character that is unprobable and has cov ops cloak
unture in real life there are somethings you can find or scan for so it should be in eve
false they can still be probed it is harder to do but if you are hunting down a ss gang booster during a fleet fight you are probably doing it wrong there are far better uses for your time even if it was a triple extender fleet command ship besides with hundreds of ships zipping around as they warpinout you arent going to find a single ship very easily unless it was titansized
nope if its signature to sensor strength ratio is under 108 then with no skills and equipment youll be able to get a warpable result on itin reality even that much isnt required because really how many probers have full virtue sets in their clonei dont see anything wrong in ship that cant be scanned though it gives more advantage then a cloak but it gimps your setup more then cloak too
sounds to me that if there is a problem then it is with gang links not t3 themselvesso perhaps the thread should be about nerfing gang links and at least your arguments would be consistent not that i think theres a problem with those either but youre better off arguing that gang links are overpoweredthe fact iscloaked ships in hostile territory collect useful intel with impunity this is working as intendedt3 ships can boost sensor strength to be unscannable while plexing working as intendedwhere they differ gang link bonuses
going beyond 100 sensor strength cannot be working as intended its like pretending to have  100 damage resistance enemies give you hpthe only reason ccp has not closed this exploit that is smart use of game mechanics is because they could not entice people to bother with their labor intensive t3 and so they dropped an huge hooknow they sold the t3 concept they may as well close the hole which imho should figure on their internal cvs as pure bug ie letting modules stack beyond the maximum possible
youre still evading the issue now youre nitpicking sensor strength beyond 100 which isnt an argument in on itself youve failed to address the arguments above but ill bite this one anywayif indeed is an unintended oversight as you claim it is then they can always cap it at 100what i dont understand is how you could possibly argue that cloaks are working as intended collecting intel when there is no real counter to them and that t3s are broken for performing the very task theyve been created to specialize in you cant possibly fix one without fixing the other as they are both doing their jobs as intended and in my opinion neither can hurt you and both are gimped to pose any kind of serious threatif you want to argue that gang links bonuses re broken then you may be able to pose a better argument there but the fact that youre avoiding the issue to basically just fix the one problem that bothers you is very hypocritical im sorry but that is just how it looksbottom line is there is nothing overpowered about t3s
if it was just for me id nerf cloaks as well
i think you got some misconception there 100 sensor strength doesnt exist you can always add more eccmbackup arrays until you run out of slots and friends for eccm projectors
good idea no reason to oppose this easy to implement
low sec will be pvp pirates attempting to catch ninja planet industry operators  hoping there is defenseattack wormholes might become attractive for short term pos sestups go in deploy a pos harvest the planet for a while  hoping different planets have different benefits move materials out will mean more movement and so forth but until we see the plans its simply speculation
just thought when managing countless targets a cycle current locked targets hot key would be very useful
one problem in fleet warfare especially so if fleet limits are increased link is the floods of broadcasts generally all logistics is in a gangwing so rr broadcasts should be sent to that specific gangwing not the entire fleet generally logistics is not shooting primary targets and it can be highly annoying if a broadcast for reps is displayed but when you click to lock it has switched to a target broadcast so they have no need to see what ship has been broadcast as primarythe proposal is for the fc to be able to set where broadcasts are sent both top down broadcasts ie targets are sent to everyone except x gangwing and bottom up broadcasts ie rr broadcasts can be set to only go to a specific gangwing this may also reduce client lag during fleet fights especially if fleet sizes are increased as stated at the beginning of the post
there already is this little quite handy feature called broadcast filter which you can use to ignore nonrelevant broadcasts
which individual pilots have to set the suggestion is to allow it to be set by the fc if i understand the filter mechanic your client is still receiving the broadcasts and removing the ones you dont want if the fc sets the filter it would be assumed to be set on the server thus cutting down the load for the clientalso support
please ccp can we have a better contract indexing of blueprints  especially to tell bpos from bpcsa lag problem can exist just from folks having to click and inspect the all the multiple items sells as it is thats unnecessary database callsjust trying to find researched bpos with the right me and pe is work
what your suggesting wont work for bpcs below battlecruiser valuewhy because your putting all the work on the seller as opposed to the buyer where it is nowif your expecting bp copiers to trawl through 100s or thousands of contracts  including lame offers and scam attempts for a few 100 thousand isk per shot you are living in a dream worldwhats needed is a way to stack  unstack runs and the ability to sell bpcs on the market while keeping mepe intactmore work for the devs this way i am sure  but better a solution than a half solution that wont work and will just end up wasting dev time
proposal to add a second orbit  range button to overview targetin combat there are generally two range designations that matter tackle and skirmishat tackle range you want to be close enough to hold pointscramweb at skirmish range you want to be close enough to lock but out of range of pointscramwebcurrently you can only set one orbit  range if you want to orbit at a different range than the one you have set you have to rightclickorbit atset range which takes precious timeit would be easier if you could just set a 2nd orbit at range buttonit would also be nice if you could tie the orbit  range to a ship fitting so when you undock in a given ship it will know at which range you want to orbit rather than having to manually reset them every time
maybe check this thread
new ship idea the trapper a t2 battleship based off of the interdictor skill requirements prevents ships from cloakingship chassis abaddon rohk hyperion maelstromfitting t1 counterparts in dps and tankspecial fitting can fit a probe launcher and a decloak moduledecloak moduleacts like a smartbomb but a much larger radius up to 30km max it works in waves once you activate the module it will give off one wave and decloak all within the range the reactivation time will be 3 minutes then it may be fired off again the module will not work nearby a starbase or a stargate to prevent people from anti cloak campsthank you for reading and i hope you like the ship idea
how would the decloaking work send out a wave that decloaks any people in range of it or a constant effect and im guessing the range would be dependent on the level of your skill of the ship among other things sounds interesting but i dont have enough experience with cloaks to really know sounds fun thou  of a lot cloakers im sure
brilliant get out of my head was just rowing my pod back to hq thinking about just such a setup
great idea
i mentioned a decloak bubble in another post as a reply supported
not supported if it worked like a bubble it would be way too static and easy essentially nerfing cloaks beyond usefulness keep in mind that sbs are active in an anti blobbingrr bs roll this would easily negate them in any situation where they could set up a firing run what would perhaps be better would be something indicating the direction or location of cloaked ships on grid and then having to still decloak them the regular way with interceptors and drones etcalso obviously this is not against afk cloakers since they are on grid with you so dont suggest it is second you make absolutely no argument otherwise for why this should be brought up at all other then of course to nerf cloaks because they bother you third you make no argument for why afk cloaking would be a problem even if this is what your solution addressed which it doesnti really wish there was a thumbs down on these boards
the way in which it would work like a bubble is that in a range of 30km or less you may activate the module and it will decloak anyone within that 30km range it would not scram or lower the velocity of any ship it is merely for the sense of decloaking ships i do not have anything against cloaking ships but i believe it would be an interesting role and a fun ship to fly having a probe launcher and being able to prevent enemies from cloaking would be a very fun experience to pvp in i do not think this ship will nerf cloaks but i think it will keep t3 cruiser pilots who may not be interdicted and can covert ops cloak from causing havoc without having much sense of worry when roaming continuously through enemy territory also it would fill a role of preventing your fleet from getting stealth ganked i think the ship idea seems versatile for those whom wish to low sec roam or do corp ops in a multiple role battleship because the other t2 battleships are hardly fit for roaming or for broad fleet ops a black ops ship is already extremely limited to its use and a marauder is typically used for missioningi believe the t2 battleship class needs to be looked into further to find more useful roles in fleet ops that everyone can roam in and that the heavy interdictor would be a very interesting ship to follow up on
maybe a bubble that visually shows a cloaked ship but you cant target instead you need a ship to approach to decloak
roflnot supported this ship would become defacto standard in gate camps and render cloaks as option to bypass camps totally useless we dont need to nerf covops and recons into uselessness
how will this stop afk cloaking you do know that afk cloakers are in a safespot that you can never probe out right you do know that your decloak module would completely overpower gate camps and make getting dedicated cloaky scout ships impossible to move around 00 right you do know the penalties of the t3 subsystems you talk about rightif you make cloakers easily probable and decloakable then you might as well just remove the cloaking device altogether as what is the point
if its a blast with a greater than 5 minute cooldown i support it not a constant effectalso make the t2 hyper black
this ship  hics  roflits basically outright opwhat about normal gate cloak
even with just a pulse that thing is overpoweredexampleyou jump into their camp in your viator align with mwd and cloakcurrently it needs competent ceptor pilots to decloak and tackle you good chance for them to catch you but also a chance to run for you 5050 in my eyeswith his dreamed up t2 battleship fire decloak impulse aresstiletto lands point on you and you are deadchance for them 100chance for you 0same goes for recons bombers covops hell even ships fitted with a normal cloakhe wants to get kills feeded without much work skills and costs will not balance that thing out
edited topic so that it prevents people from anti cloak camping and makes the ship less op in the sense that it will completely nerf cloaks
press f1 to decloak hostiles is the dumbest  ever no matter how many idiots propose it in hereedit hah while i posted that he changed the op so it goes from brokenly overpowered to utterly worthless
not supported espionage is good for eve
stealth pun cloak whining not supported
i am no expert but cant any cov ops cloaky ship uncloak when a ship undocks an lock him down and wait for backup to arrive whocares if u got a window while docked if there are cloaky tacklers could be bad for transports battleships and cap ships
the idea would be that its a module only interdictors could fit if they chose to fit a cloaking device it would seriously mess with their lock time so would probably only be capable of catching freighters and capitals at that point
let us use the hundreds of windows on stations then well talk otherwise undocking a suidical noobalt to peek outside will become routine in lowsec
its really simple just put the dang thing on the bottom i dont feel safe with it so close to activate ship
that is one of the reasons i started just doing the click drag and drop the ship onto the hanger to board it
never trashed a ship accidentally this way but i still dont feel safe with the button that close
ive accidentally trashed some very expensive ships before
in place of paying the rl money fee why not pay in plex lets say 1 or 2 plex per transfer
becuase that would give 1000 boost to character farmingthe same reason why skill queue is only 24hrs
im not a fan of checking the sell forums for useful items only to find at least half of the posts are lottery spamwhen i first started eve 3 years ago there was a bit but now that eve has so many players its really gotten out of hand 
i am pirate and yes im 10 ive never tried to raise my sec status because to be quite honets i just like killing poeple and taking their stuffnow 10 has penalties you cant go to hisec gate guns wont help you when people shoot you anyone can kill you anywhere without fear of the law or security hits people dont realise being a pirate is one of the most dangerous careers in eve it is a hard life and most pirates like it that way eve was never meant to be played on easy modeall i see many many times on the forums is people who want lowsec to be made safe or some risk free play well eve was never meant to be risk free ever not even hiseclowsec is the place for pirates and criminals if you cant take the heat stay out and for the record most people in lowsec spend most of their time warring between each other not sitting waiting for a haulerminertourist to come to lowsec and be ganked most gatecamps happen when the warring facrtions dont have fleets out killing each other because making craebears cry is usually just a hobby to fill in the places between fleet fights with your enemy
heres the thing though yes its true you cant go to hi sec safely however you can use an alt to mitigate this consequence and from the open admissions from pirates themselves they use alts to go shopping for them in hi sec so im sorry but this isnt hardship its a joke of a consequencein reference to your comment about gate guns well lets be honest theyre not really doing much in lo sec its easy to tank their paperwet dps they dont hold you in place youre free to warp away from them as you please and they dont just shoot at 10s they shoot at anyone with an aggression timer on thempiracy isnt one of the most dangerous careers in eve im sorry but i just cant agree with you there you know who i think have one of the most dangerous careers in eve players looking to pve in lo sec now that is risky you see the pirate chooses the target not the other way around it is a hard life and most pirates like it that wayi hear this all the time but it seems the carebear pirates only want it to be a hard life for the carebear not themselves and this is what i am trying to do make it harder but this doesnt sit well with pirates because well its making their life harder and it wasnt what they meant when they said eve is harsh and cold  the truth is that there arent serious consequences to being a pirate everything can be mitigated with an alt so ill ask you again what is it that causes you serious hardship for being a pirateyour last paragraph i kinda agree with you so no arguments from me there only thing i can add is that when you freely engage a target consensually you cant count that as hardship or risk if you engage by choice youre doing it for fun and you yourself are controlling that risk even if you lose get what im saying
its a shame the op put so much effort in to this thread when there are perfectly good ideas on fixing the bounty hunting system that could do with a bumpsee here1while itll never happen i quite like this idea it would mean that by keeping your sec at about 1 you would have the advantages of being flashy red extra fights in low sec while still being allowed in to high secdont think that was the ops intention but that would be the result2yes for the love of god fix the bounty system see above link3bad idea the reason blobs happen is because people like to play alongside their mates this is hardly unreasonable in an mmo anyone who solos regularly will know that its not pvp its pvppppppp and sets themselves up accordinglyif youre not willing to either bring friends or fight when outnumbered youre playing the wrong game4again a bad idea this would mainly penalize 10 pilots and make wars between pirate groups very difficult the end result would be large groups of pirates sitting on stargates ganking noobs to relieve the boredom5no what you call carebear pirates id call casual pvpers and its hard enough to encourage them in to low sec as it is one mans blob is another mans target list and i want more targets not less
1 absolutely there needs to be more incentive for antipiracy2 absolutely not so much for the reason you outlined actually i would say that if the kill rights get transferred it changes in the persons character sheet as well but transferable kill rights better bounty system is definitely need3 i dont particularly agree with this what if its 10 frigates going after a battleship 4 okay5 real pirates dont caredecent ideas but your motives of wanting carebear tears is sort of pathetic grow up
its why i said 1 goes along with 5 if you keep shooting targets you wont be staying at 1 for long considering it would be harder to rat your sec back up i dont think youve completely understood the whole idea you cant shoot nonneg players and expect to stay at 1 especially when i clearly also recommend making grinding sec status harder this is mostly to discourage the parttime pirates that spend 3 days pirating and 2 days ratting their sec status back upheres to hopingthis is understandable to a point and as you say pvpppppp is part of the game but the fact is this wouldnt affect 10 to begin with it would only affect the parttime blobbers and i dont see how this is a bad thing they could continue blobbing with all ten or thirty of their friends but they just need to accept the consequences of a little harsher penalties isnt this what eve is about consequences for your actionssee above we shouldnt be encouraging more blobs and this change would still allow you the choice of bringing your blob anyway just be prepared to take a sharper hit on sec status it means there are now real consequences for blobbingas opposed to docking and being bored regardless im afraid i dont follow your logic here troubling you a little bit for living the life of a pirate isnt against the spirit of the game the whole point is to have real consequences for your actions and adding a 15minute aggro timer to a 10 pirate is a consequence you coudnt resolve with an alt you have to weight out the timer or perhaps you can think of something that could replace this idea im open to suggestions but it has to be something that cannot be mitigated by alts and that carries actual consequences not a slap on the wristthis changes would actually encourage them to stay in lo sec you see theyd stop playing yoyo with their sec status and decide once and for all whether they pirate or carebear it up and since these are likely players that enjoy blobs and ganks id say theres a better chance theyll go the dark side not only that but you have their attention in lo sec for the entire time since grinding sec status would be more tedious and not worth iti appreciate your feedback thanks
good point however ask yourself this would it not be worth to consider if it reduces the number of blobs it wouldnt affect players with 10s of course but it would hopefully sway some of the yoyo pirates concerned about their sec status in keeping their gangs to a minimum after all pvp is more fun when its quality not quantity and in the end youre still given the freedom to blob if you wish just be prepared to accept the consequence of taking a harder sec status i honestly dont see this being as gamebreaking but thats just my opinion and i respect yoursexactly and this is what my ideas are aiming to do if you decide to go the pirate route then it means youve decided not to care about your sec status and its consequences but a pirate caring about his sec status and being able to manipulate his sec status to plunder then go about living like a regular citizen yoyo pirates is kind of a slap in the face of the game mechanics and it also breaks game immersionactually the tears i was referring to were from carebear pirates or yoyo pirates p i know there are some good mature pirates out there but from experience i can tell you there are lots and i mean lots of douches out there as well dont take those comments to heart theyre addressed to the idiots that abound these forums not the actual people that have some respect and level of maturity in any case it doesnt seem like it applies to youthanks for the comments o7
i have only been playing eve for around 2 months including my buddy trial and i overall enjoy the experience i have however noticed something that could easily be improved currently there is no way to tell if someone is there or not to chat other than if you were around to see them type afk or in a battle any good messenger system nongame of course  im talking windows live hotmail or yahoo messenger here has a status system to let other people know what that person is up to and subsequently if they are available or noti propose a system like this in eve  so that if we join a channel to find some information and the players are afk we will not simply assume they are ignoring the chanel when they do not reply and so that we can all easily tell who we can speak to and who we canti suggest such statuses as theseavailable  for those who are at the keyboard ready to type as and whenafk  for those who cannot type for whatever reason food toilet whatever pbattling  for those in a battle and can only type at select timessemiafk  for those who are only checking their screens every now and then such as when miningthe system for changing your status could be a simple right click of your name or character sheet and selecting the drop down menu status then selecting which or programmable keyboard short cutsbecause this is for other people to know there would also have to be a visual queue or marker for each type of status  their name could be in different writing in the right side members area of the chat window for instancei ask anyone to post supporting this proposal and suggesting improvements over my ideasthanks
wow a totally new ideanot
also since the last change you have to click with the mouse to chat if you got focus on the other windowthats so wrong its unbelivableatleast before you could just start typing now its click then typeas anoying as possible like someone is doing it on purposeplease yes implement enter to start enter to post like all the other normal games havewe could also then finaly get normal shortcuts like op said

what the hell are you talking about
no roids were worse designed but flashed of a nice light when lasers hit them dmining brings in too many resources vs how many are consumedany change they do requires a massive nerf on how much material comes in game including nerfing missions whs and 00 sov spawned beltsany improvement to make mining better and more interesting will just make more people do it worsening the long standing situation where insurance fraud is the only option to make minerals leave the gamemining needs an automation nerf aka making it interactive and a global yield nerf  less than other mining professions though beginning with l4 missioning i am making double the minerals with missioning than with 2 t2 fit hulks  bonuses plus i make lots of mega and zydrine no way it can be done by an hi sec miner
how does this not fit into the category of ccp should review mining
i imagine this would function much like full implant sets  granting a nice bonus but perhaps having more mediocre performance on their owncare would have to be taken to make sure that the set bonuses make sense though  i can imagine the 05 active armor tank bonus ccp will give the federation navy set already for instance
i would support this idea if it worked for pvp only  since this set bonus would encourage people to fit more faction gear and thus result in greater loot and more excitement in pvpif its just used by the carebears to grind their level 4s  no they are too easy as it isbut either way its highly unlikely ccp would do anything that increases risk or losses in pvp
nice idealike other people pointed out it would have some balancing issuesso how about a heat bonusmake the set generate less heat not game breaking but still usefull
when it came time to review the myriad of things passed by previous csms i personally poked about rockets and the af 4th bonussoon tm
thank you good sir may your rocket live long and poke lots
remember the more exclimations for bonus points use 1s after an idea the better it is
eve already is an eqwow grindfest where your wallet represents your experience level just ask any leet pvper how much they enjoy their level 4 mission altnot that im supporting the op im just sharing my perception

actually while were at it can we please make it so that you are never ever offered the same mission twice in a row it gets a bit tedious when you get unauthorized military presence three times in a row dont get me wrong i like the mission but i it just feels a bit pointless after th esecond time around
it can be frustrating to get that one haul 20000 m3 of stuff to low sec mission it would be extremely annoying to get it again after declining it
black op are mostly ok as is could use a few changes in its class though to make them more coolchanges id like to see1 give them better t2 resistances2 give them more damagetracking etc bonuses  remove cloaked velocity if you have to who uses it3 better targeting range and sensor resolution3 longer jump range sure why not
yes d
please revisit these ships to make them worth the price tag
i see part of your difficulty i believe its been repeatedly stated that changing the lock limit isnt going to happen and this makes sense given the effect this would have on lag and server load so while many of us are working under the assumption that we have to work with the lock limit as an unchangeable limitation youre not so yes 249km is well within an apocs lock limit 274 not so much but 249 is the number we have to work withsure this may be the case but it would require unraveling years worth of balance starting with the whole concept of having the disadvantage of lasers be cap use then making most of their ships half that very cap use not a very practical solution and thus were left with working with what we have youve still failed to actually explain where railguns have a meaningful advantage compared to lasers as ive stated the many advantages beams have and how few rails have as a resultyour baseline just happens to be the worst sniper out there the fact that you didnt know this speaks volumes to your lack of experience and understanding and as tagamis pointed out the fact that you havent read the thread or its predecessor
the fact that the mega is a crappy sniper the rokh does no damage and the hyperion is mediocre at best dps as a function of range  looking at alpha strike is even more shocking wouldnt this prove the point weve been trying to make all along railguns need to be improved
my god yees
love the idea
ahh i was mistaken i apologize
agree 100 it must be looked into
i really like this proposed compromise i very much support this
definitely
this would help ccp with the hacking issue probally

this annoyed me again last night jumped my carrier back from the ass end of nowhere and couldnt bring any of my geddons or abaddons etc back rrrraaaaagggeeeeeliang
this issue should not require the attention of the csm if you are experiencing this problem you should file a bug report this should have been fixed years ago
so what happens when you decline all the possible missions actually thats a great idea leave angel extravaganza or your favourite other mission 
the only mission that you should not get is the one mission that you previously declined immeadiately before requesting a new mission this does not stop an agent from cycling through two or more missions that you keep declining nor does it prevent the agent from offering the mission within the 4 hours of declining it provided that another mission is offered immeadiately after the first time the original mission was declined
fanny batter
first i never whined about anything you may want to look in a mirror to find that i stated what ccp has already made perfectly clear a 1 minute logoff timer is in place to reduce the chances of a legitimate disconnect resulting in the destruction of a players assets the op and the people supporting his first item are whining that 1 minute isnt long enough to kill a target anything can be killed in less than a minute if enough firepower is available but a player cant avoid legitimate disco which is why the rule exists that doesnt mean i support people using this tactic to avoid losing assets but since doing so is considered an exploit then it is up to you to petition the offending party not me and everyone else to lose our ships because of a legitimate disco and you and yours not getting a kill because you were unprepared to dish out the firepower needed to pull it offso in summary you have multiples avenues to deal with item 1 while legitimate discos have no way to stop a legitimate disco so they shouldnt pay the consequences and ccp agrees

if im flying ship with relatively small hp this rule wont help me if i fly a ship with some nice hp buffer  then i will use it in any camp where hp buffer is enough to survive 1 minute but not 15 and where i will be defeated anyway if ill stay online and fightconsidering this now i agree with point 1 because this point doesnt prevent everyone from being destroyed in smaller ships even if they had some real disconnect and easily abused to avoid definite ship loss in bigger ships  and thats something that should be changed

supported most of mentioned things are pretty stupid and honestly dont have much to do with real connection problemsi think you should be able to stop warp with some delay though it has always annoyed me that theres no such feature to stop warp when you know youre obviously going to wrong place there should be some delay so you cannot just click scanner and quit warp though
signed for 2  3good idea
why wouldnt you log off your cap at the posand if you are in hostile system with no support fleet and no friendly pos maybe a cloak would be good idea or just cyno out to safety before you call it a dayotherwise what prevents you from hitting that x button just as you see enemy dictors exit warp on top of younothing but your honorand even if you happen to have any you can bet that a whole bunch of other people wont
you are basing everything that occurs in eve off of lowsec and 0 pvp unfortunately for you the vast majority of eve doesnt live and operate in either of those spaces so when a noob in a frigate jumps into his level 1 mission and doesnt get killed because of a legitimate disco its because this rule is in place due to the fact that a huge majority of paying eve customers face this issue every day this rule is backed up by rules specifically designed to stop people from using this mechanic as a way losing your ship there is nothing broken here except for the fact that people are not reporting it as they should be instead they come whine about it in the assembly hallyes its frustrating but ccp isnt going to make 34 of its paying customers ed off because 1100th of them disco on purpose
what saves the noob in this case is emergency warp that happens immediately after disconnectnobody here is proposing any changes to emergency warp your point is moot
wrong there is warp jamming in some missions
what saves the noob is 2 minute aggro from npc no one here proposed any changes to that also no one here proposed to remove emergency warp or making ships stay for more than 1 or 2 minute if they dont have aggroif you dont know that player aggro and npc aggro are different things with different timers that are triggered differently then go learn basic game mechanics before posting such posts
please provide evidence of level 12 missions that have warp scrambling rats
it doesnt matter because he doesnt understand that in this topic no one proposes to make npc aggro timer to reset itself even if player logoffs the whole talk is about player vs player aggro timerfor every one who doesnt know if npc shoots at you youve got 2 minute npc aggro  if you logoff your ship will be present in game for 2 minutes it will either warp out or will stay in place for that time if npcs have scrambled youon the other hand player vs player interaction shots warp disruptors ecm etc places on you 15 minute aggrothe whole bug is that if you logoff and player places aggro on you after that you still disappear after 1 minute but no one here proposes to make that if npc shoots you after logoff or disconnect to make you ship stay for 15 minutes people who think that this is proposed in this topic are just dont know even current game mechanics
you are right jeremey the proposed changes have no effect on carebear that doesnt get attacked by another playerthe main problem is people logging off literally seconds before they see incoming aggro and as i said earlier the probability of real disconnect in that case is less than 110000
major support
the misconception is in the inhumane efforts spent to avoid pvp at all costs in the top non consensual pvp game of all from that misconception come the need to invent all sorts of principles all sort of parables all sorts of nitpickings
your entire argument is fundamentally flawed and shows a severe misunderstanding of the game some examples being unprobeable wasnt introduced ex post facto  it actually included in the first introduction of the scanning system and people found ways to make it happen with t3s along side many ships up to battlecruiser sized capping sensor strength vs sig radius means that you cap how well someone can resist being jammed smooth move there slick becoming unprobeable comes with significant sacrifices  a tight specialization if you will this is a significant enough penalty that id wonder if they wouldnt make more isk in high sec than missioning in 00lowsec especially if they fit the covops mod and interdiction nullifier being unprobeable doesnt offer many advantages over being cloaked from a pvp perspective you cant effectively attack someone but you can give bonuses and collect intel in local well i suppose i have to give this one to the cloaked ship seeing as how it can do all that but doesnt so significantly affect its actual combat abilities dealing with unprobeable mission runners this seems to be your primary beef is extremely easy they are still vulnerable on gates and stations and people regularly kill recons on gates and stations and t3 are not any different to put it bluntly if you cant kill an unprobeable ship in your stomping grounds its because you fail complaining about someone having nor isk of ninjaing or item stealing is pretty ing lol theres lots of ways to do that and my golem has never had anyone enter the mission and steal loot or salvage t3 has a much heftier penalty for loss show me another ship that forces skillpoint lossliang
i know this and does not change it should not be possible to do it on any shipactually i always found it quite peculiar that boosting sensor strength on yourself you affect another stat but i suppose this is just another residual of who knows what ancient pastif it was significant enough people would not apply it on every opportunitynever said being cloaked should not be looked at all of its advantages and eventually nerfed its another escamotage to reward for no risk after allbecause safe spots dont exist and you must dock with the t3 ship even just to get more ammo no way you could do that with an alt in a cheaper ship oh waitrecons are strong ships but dont go beyond the rules after all killing a t3 on a gate i dare say it might be harderapparently the cant kill an unprobeable ship works so well that everyone and their dog fit that kitits like nano again or like falcons again when it becomes a must to do a certain way it means the game is imbalanced towards that way and you know that sooner or later it will get axednevertheless for every blatantly overpowered feature theres always a fat group of benefitters who find it just finewhat i can read here is really nothing nothing new that i have not found in the many years i play mmos a new game feature is introduced insufficient testing does not let the developers cover every hole and of course theres a mob of people working 247 to find every possible opening to take advantage of course they find it perfect fine and appropriate to use these misfeatures and will beat on everyone who is not hypocrital enough to join the clapping mobyup you have to use some very very basic diligence in your golem though thats what makes the golem finethe loss is because you fly a small signature yet powerful and tanked ship not because you are permitted to circumvent being found
ive seen lots of requests for unprobeable mission runners but very few in space and the ones ive seen in space i can probe i think youre jumping at theoretical shadows herenerfing cloaking also nerfs the ability of the few to wage war against the many in any fashion id be 1 to a cloak nerfbecause missions are all in the same system and you dont have to dock to get more missions and involving more than one character doesnt always bring more advantages oh waitdare say it all you want it doesnt change the fact that its not any harder than killing a recon  and in some ways its actually easier but in the end all your post is boiling down to is bbbbbaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww besides dont you have 7b isk to pay off before you can waste our time about how you fail at pvpyep all the pve threads are about unprobeable tengus thats right folks you heard it here havent seen a cnrravendomiabaddonpaladinnightmarenighthawkcaracaldrakebomberblah pve thread in monthsoh and btw i do choose to be scannable and not in a tengu no less in hostile systems so that i can have an edge in pve whoops because nobody does thatyes because nobody has ever been able to fly around in good small ships before liang
i do lvl3 missions with a myrmidon it has tractor and salvager on it i did some lvl3 with a vexor even probing question it had a salvager
setups with great sensor strength should be much harder to probe like theyre harder to jamm not completely immune
thats the whole point of the thread you are not meant to see them in space they would not even buy a t3 if you couldat dr we started in like 510 people in early 2009 and ended in 150 men fleets by nov 2009failure to attract players with a solid corp should not be hedged by using a module imhoedit this thread is not about cloak why do you keep trying to derail it into thatalso cloak is a solution to some game problems ie how to find out enemy weaknesses etc and has no limits or numbers to be violated ie ccp planned cloaks and they just work like them or not unscannable t3 instead play exactly with elder mechanics with parameters that can be violated exploited to be more appropriate to achieve something originally not intended to become so last time i checked you dont have to dock in a t3 to turn in a missionoh but by missioning the other overpowered thing you frothe at the mouth to defend so much i am half done alreadywith 1 bpc  minerals  some self made t2 modules and a 150k shield what is it in total in 2 hours a day i am earning almost 30 a month of what varo jan is earning with a 150 billions investment in the research alliance he purchasedof course those inties and cov ops have a battleshipalike tank and gankthats exactly my whole point
then the same should be for cloaking
i dont see any parallels or logic here care to explain
cloaksrecons have the ability to collect valuable intel in null sec and even prey on minersratters its what theyre for and they also cannot be probedif your argument is that it isnt fair some ships cannot be probed then logically your argument should also extend to recons not being able to be probed why would you include one and exclude the other
i wasnt going to comment on this issue just because i know nothing i say is going to convince anyone of anything  but whatever ive never been known for my ability to keep my mouth shut even when i shouldi found this loadout on battle clinc of an unprobable loki that had received decent ratings 23 0
then why wouldnt you fit cloak to your missionrunning ship instead of loads of eccms because it doesnt allow you to do anything except for flying aroundwhen you fit eccms  you should sacrifice efficiency of your ship gaining more time to bail when you see probes not to become completely immune to them because your ship is still able to do various things including killing npcs when you fit cloak  you reduce pvegang boosting efficiency of your ship to zero making it impossible to scan you i dont see any irrationality here
why does your sensor strength have anything to do with how difficult it is to probe you down thats what i would like to know why isnt it simply a function of your sig radius if ccp just changed the equation none of this would be an issue if you want to disappear use a cloak
because just as a recon ship needs to be cloaked in order to perform its job properly its why its called a recon an npcing setup t3 needs sensor boosters to npc properly ie what its meant for the bonus of the dissolution sequencer applies to eccm modules not cloaks its like fitting eccm on a recon instead of the covert ops cloak why would you do thatthen youll be happy to know you are sacrificing efficiency run a plex with max tankgank and then run the same plex with eccms fit instead compare results when t3 ships fit eccm modules they are gimping their tankgank they cannot hurt you and therefore will not be a threat to yourecons arent specialized in pvegang boosting therefore the fact that they lose efficiency in those areas is irrelevant what they dont lose efficiency in even when cloaked is the ability to recon ie gather intel in fact because they are cloaked they are invulnerable and thus able to perform their job at a much higher efficiencydc
you can still catch it on gates or stationsno and id say its still isnt enough when you take into consideration that t3s are around 500m and cost you 4 days of training when you dieits understandable that pve ship is avoiding pvp but player still have to dockjump the gate to complete mission get new missions refit and get ammo  it definitely isnt invulnerableit isnt standard you are giving up alot of ships potential by making it unprobeableits counter to this mechanic again you are giving up alot of ships potential by countering ninjaing through making ship unprobeableno generally  its a whine of pvper hard to call ppl who hunt down pve ships real pvpers who is not able to probe down mission runners in system he lives and is too lazy to do a proper camp

hmm compared to rokh vs maelstrom i see no reason to boost the maelmaybe after a blaster boost so it is clr that maelstroms bonuses are fineno need for this active tank bonus boost
yup
gotta love amarr eh naomi they get the dps the range advantage the buffer and the rr and active tanking advantage the maelstrom requires 150 more remote reppers to be on par with the abaddons remote rep tanking ability the maelstroms dps is actually the same as the abaddons at 15km the hype does almost the same using null at 15km unfortunatly the rokh fails here too doing only 80 the dps the other three ships offer  so if the active tank boost goes forward the rokh will need a boost to increase shield to compensate it all needs balancing out but well find a way in the end
sorry im a moron didnt have any drones in the rokh updated above post
also change the hype to 10 shield boost ammount per level pretty please real men fit neutrons and four mag stabs
1 my main flys a trirep dual boosted myrm this will make my tank 2ez4lowsec 
oh it seem different now so giving 75lvl for incoming remote rep is fine with me but not this 10lvl the op wantsbtw it seems that armor tank  shield what a surprisemaybe ccp should do something about that toolike increasing the base shield resists a little bit
i agree that 10 is a little too much maybe 9 per level is a better figure end result is 75 better  lvl5 than current9lvl remote rep recieved looks like an excellent fix for the disparity between the resist bonus and the local boost bonus according to eft this would give slightly higher defence efficiency on a single remote rep than a ship with the resist bonus ive only been checking out battleships with this idea and it looks perfectyes the rokh needs either a slight boost to base shield resists or a boost to base shield ammount to balance it all out with a good buffer i would prefer the latter as better resists  better rr tanking

black op are mostly ok as is could use a few changes in its class though to make them more coolchanges id like to see1 give them better t2 resistances2 give them more damagetracking etc bonuses  remove cloaked velocity if you have to who uses it3 better targeting range and sensor resolution3 longer jump range sure why not
i like the jumps in highsec jita runs are rediculous but maybe 8 systems and lower for them
they wouldnt be a black opses then any longer1 giving better t2 resistances to bos same as giving recon ships higher resistances just same as recons are not hacs bos does not need of higher resistances2 same here would be strange if recons one day will have same dps as hacs so bos with same or better dps then t1 bss and marauders are likely would be strange3 scanres though wouldt be bad for them even though they dont have decloaked recalibration though targeting range imho does not need any boost4 as for jump range ive already mentioned
ships have got the audio warning when hitpoints fall below definable levels id like to see something similar for drones since they are so weak theyre often gone before you even realized they were under attack id like a user settable option which makes drones manifest themselves if they start taking damagetrying not to think of the squeals of worms when you hit them with something incendiary

with the advent of more customizeable and advanced corporation tools in dominion and the new stuff coming in tyrannis  to whit the new calendar and the like i think it would be really handy to be able to modify the welcome email sent to new members of a corporationthis didnt really used to be such a big deal when the mail system kept the mails that had been sent out to the corp and the new members got them as soon as they joined but now that this is no longer the case that welcome mail would be a good place to lay out corporate policies links to forums and websites and welcome aboard make sure you do these things first kinds of messagesobviously this is not critical but i think it would provide harried ceos with a little assist at getting new people in their corp on the same page as everyone else more rapidly

the capital class interdictor would be something you did not field regularly and that you did not field lightly it would have a hefty price tag being a t2 variant of an already existing capital ship it would not carry any sort of weapon system or even be able to self sustain the scripted version of its interdiction bubble without carriers or sc to aid it these ships would share the jump range of a dread and would not be deployable in low sec costing in the range of 37b mineral cost and not being insurable past its t1 counterpart a capital interdictor would be something used when you have the upper hand and absolutely do not want the hostile fleet escaping sporting several times the hp of a dread or carrier and dual defensive bonusesresists and local rep the ship is designed purely to soak fire and keep hostile ships locked down over a larger area than previously possible it would not have the massive hp of a sc or titan but would be enough to soak fire with the aid of reps from your fleet the normal unscripted bubble of the capital interdictor would extend out to a 40km radius cycle every 30 seconds using a high amount of cap the bubble would cause the ship to become immobile and increase its agilitymass by 16 fold so you could not effectively bump it out of your way after the bubble is disengaged either by the pilot or forcefully by nueting the ship would be unable to warp for 1 minute afterwards or jump for 10 the scripted variant would extend to an 80km radius and would require significantly more cap than the ship could generate for more than a very short burst without the aid of carriers or sc supporting it scripting also reduces the cap recharge by 75 and has all the same effects as the unscripted bubble in short t2 version of dread or carrierprobably carrier 37b to be determined by the dev designing it several times the hp of its t1 counterpart only as insurable as any other t2 ship 75 repair bonus per level 5 resist bonus per level 40km radius bubble unscripted immobile while activated and for 1 minute afterwards unable to jump for 10 minutes after deactivation scripted 80km radius 75 reduced cap recharge no additional high slots to discourage cap transfering several to create cap out of thin air and be self sufficient without support
i want a capship that can speed tank the other capships
how is it better then 3 bil worth of regular interdictors
you cant alpha it with a minmatar bs and a lucky shotand it can jump to cynosural fieldsand it can realistically sit in a fight with carriers repping it while under heavy fire unlike a normal dictorand yes this ship would be the largest threat to supercaps as a supercap pilot i still wouldnt mind seeing these in the game i think supercap proliferation has gone too far as it is
this move would have a bad long term effectknowing theyd be unable to escape enemies would desist from attacking pvp becomes sparser only attack with an hugetastic fleet surely able to crush yours blobs just got worse pvp recover would become longer again pvp becomes sparser because wiping out the entirety of the enemy makes them longer to rebuild  rebuy all you just killed guerrilla tacticsonly positive effect is if you have a major alliance able to relentlessy steamroll everything with no hope of defense basically a star wars empire deathstar  interdictors
1 people have said this with hictors as well and dictors and pos and dominion and many other things people arent going to stop pvping simply because you have a larger bubble if you have placed your capital fleet inside a bubble i would say you encouraged a fight not discouraged one you can anchor a few t2 larges and actually cover more space than this for far less cash and people do 2 hi maybe you havent looked at supercaps which require blobs to counter more than 1 or 2 already the lawlblob response is dumb and antiquated every major war in history has been won by a blob and it wont stop just because you hate fleet pvp3 or it causes an alteration of tactics and people who routinely use caps in ed fashions without support fleets find themselves without a cap fleet regardless of its size 4 uh no i didnt this isnt a grid wide bubble i am sorry you can not go point blank with 60 rr bs when one of these bubbles is up and get out immediately again it only stops them if the person is using them defensively which means their capital fleet is inside a bubble
by your own admission the capital hictor would be here so that a minmatar bs cannot kill it etc etc this means you want to not stop pvping but the others would otherwise they would not focus on hics to fleehigh value assets are made to be weak and need to be defended unless you can pretend to have capital falcons and similarhey i can be accused of many things but with my signature how can you say i hate fleet pvp then a cure is to nerf caps or make this t2 hic only affect caps that would save the small fries and smaller skirmishes would still be viablein general your post seems about the bad mechanics of the game ie heavy handed usage of rr capacitor tricks capitals abuse more than about bringing in a fresh shipwhy not putting steep diminishing returns in stuff that already exists then
i want a pony
because your sorts of changes have been asked about for years with no movement towards that fairly safe assumption they wont change in the near future anyways mine works on current standards to give us a ship designed to work with the fleet at all times not sure how a large dictor means i dont want to pvp please elaborate here because your logic seemsconfused at best as for your sig you basically went lawl blobs bad in your post fleet fights are always going to be about blobs the day they arent is when ccp is close to shutting down tq

perhaps to solve this annoying roamers in your home system problem ccp could add a new item that works with the new sov that negates the ability of your enemys to enter your space and kill stuff an upgrade like this should only be available in your well used systems every system that employed something like this would make you safe as highsechow it would negate the roamers ability to mess around forever perhaps make it so devices gain damage while used when they get too damaged the modules die this would happen like you were overheating the module another possibility would be for everyone but blues and alliance members would simply explode rp reason the reactor has to be on a certain frequency or it becomes unstable

i have seen 1 week old players managing to use the keep at range option on a titanif there are such idiots who are unable of doing that you should not have them deal anywhere near a titan and possibly anywhere near your corporationanyway since the titan pilot has to face the possible consequences of something those idiots could cause i am going to thumbs up on this

on my monitor i can see fov is wrong then i look at circular objects i wouldlike to be able to set it up the way i feel right
i would suggest everyone log onto sisi to look at this before replying to the thread a good part of the features is up and running enough to see exactly what its going to be aboutthe activity on planets would be almost impossible to script so i think macros arent going to be a problem
i think the player should have to fight off rats from their planet regularly to maintain the structures
new devblog on topicmore information
not supportedi dont support macro planet mining since no one can mine planets this isnt possible yet if it will be possible who knowsim against just about anything that dictates how a person can play a game because other players think that they should be doing it the way they do for their own selfish reasons say whatever you want that is the reason you want people to play your way so you can gain in one way or another from them doing so
be able to recruit mercenaries from a faction that you have a high standing with the higher the standing the better ships you can hire but they would not be cheap and cost a decent sum of loyalty points and iskyou would be limited to two mercenaries per player and they would have loot and bounties when destroyed that way players can gain rewards out of killing thier enemys mercsyou would not be allowed to have mercenaries with you if you are in a fleet that way it prevents huge npcplayer gangswould be awesome if all factions had mercs availableput some use to those joviansyour mercs would target anything that aggros you and they would warp gate jump and dock when you dock but they will be a seperate tab that you can managewhy would someone want this well they have really high standings with a cool faction and want to show off thier awesome stuff it would also give support to the solo player who needs help on missions
i am going to say no to this simply because eve online is not a single player game if you need mercs hire some player mercs i bet you could even find some people that would be willing to help you run missions for a cut of the mission rewards and salvage

id support a better contracting system with set goals like kills of ship typenumbers or players of x skill points etc so you might be able to dictate what success is for payment it is all too much for me to go into at this point because a it isnt my proposal b im only typing a bit to waste the 5 minute timer if it is still in effect i know it was supposed to be lowered but who knows and ill find out when i try to respond also im letting my account lapse cause im bored with eve so i really dont care about teh million things ccp couldshouldbut wont do to make the game betteroh well still waiting on the reduction of the 5minute timer wouldnt think editing something like that would too hard but apparently it is
i would support the idea if we could also boobytrap containersleave one floating in space that goes up in a giant explosion if opened so that the hackers have a measure of risk in what theyre doing rather than just opening containers owned by people offline so that the thief timer doesnt mean crap
this issue should not require the attention of the csm if you are experiencing this problem you should file a bug report this should have been fixed years ago
so what happens when you decline all the possible missions actually thats a great idea leave angel extravaganza or your favourite other mission 
the only mission that you should not get is the one mission that you previously declined immeadiately before requesting a new mission this does not stop an agent from cycling through two or more missions that you keep declining nor does it prevent the agent from offering the mission within the 4 hours of declining it provided that another mission is offered immeadiately after the first time the original mission was declined

this is the most brilliant thing ive ever read on these forums ccp if you implement these changes and expand upon them in the right way allowing us to create mighty stations with many roles and much functionality then i will definately have to get a third character just to help support mine

drones set to aggressive stance will attack any reds near them even if theyre not targeted so this possibility basically already exists though you cant control which red theyll attack but getting an abmwd on closing in on target and launching drones should have the same effectguess thats what to expect from a caldari rocket launcher again aggressive stance is the key

but man life was so much easier before you trained amarr
this shouldnt even have to go through the csm as stated before this is akin to a beta level flaw that should be fixed before release but suprisingly that is the case for quite a few issues around here ccp fix this issue without needing the csm to bring it to your attention you have a perfect opportunity coming up in just a few weeks
supported if the contract system gets a field for  damage
i many times wanted to see a decent grid to see distances across a sphere so u can put up structures at 360 degrees easiernow we just have the usual horizontal tactical overlay to use but as u all know that does not help alot when u are anchoring guns at the poswhat i propose is a sphere like the probe system wich u can pull open with dots at an adjustable number of km equally spread across the sphere it would provide easier anchoring points for the dreaded long times you spend on there  this would certainly serve as a good way to optimize anchoring at starbase or any true 3d way
not supported this is already in the game youre just too lazy to customize your overview settings
wholeheartedly supported author described current problem and bug with wartargets in overview perfectlyits a bug that exists for more than two years now and it must be fixedand you dont know what are you talking about overview settings dont work as intended  you cannot show only wartargets in overview without setting negative standing to them  their corpally
 plotting a course between two selected star systems should be possible if im in x i also want to know how many jumps from y to z please
supportedid also like to have the option to show all system names this could have several settings for selected region and bordering regionsalso could we have the region names a little more transparent or just give us a setting for it
id say in addition to these changes maybe add a level of zoom from star map to system map when you select a system dunno how hard that would to implement though

okay boys and girls ive reread whole thread and noticed that almost everyone who opposes these changes uses what happens if i get real disconnect argument so lets look a bit deeper into itwhen you get disconnected server stops getting data from client to make sure that connection is really lost it waits for 30 or 60 seconds before making emergency warpoff and only after that moment youre considered as logged off opposed to instalogoff using ctrlq1 you logoff and after that someone places aggro on you  but you will still disappear after 1 minutetherere really 2 cases in this single point 11 after jumping into some system through gate and 12 all others major difference is 4560 seconds of cloaked state which provides you total invulnerability after jumping into some gate11 if youve got legit disconnect in gate cloak  most likely youll be able to avoid aggro and if you have enough tank your ship will vanish in 1 minute in this case suggested mechanics change will affect you in some edge cases but personally i think number of 111 legit disconnects in fat ships which can survive camp is absolute minority when compared to 112 number of legit disconnects in cases where your ship wont be able to tank campers youll die with 1 minute aggro the same way youd die with 15 minutes aggro plus number of forced logouts which are done just to keep your ship alive12 therere numerous situations but lets take some fat ship in the belt say orca and group of hulks they noticed few interceptors enroute to their belt and have no time to align and warp to pos at least thats true for orca they log off right when interceptors land into their belt and if gang doesnt have enough dps arriving instantly after interceptor to the belt  most of miner guys will survive if they had real disconnect  theyd be aggroed before server issues log off after time out is reached in this case it wont help players which got really disconnected2 you logoff login logoff login  and appear on a spot not where you was or where youre travelling previouslythats pretty obvious that its impossible to make this trick especially multiple times without instalogoff which is not the case with real disconnect where time out should expire before actual logoff3 you click warp to and instantly logoff  no one can scramble you or even lock yousame if you click warp and hit log off  this trick works if you click warp and get disconnected  you will be aggroed and killedsooo is what happens if i get real disconnect argument that strong i dont think so really p
everything you wrote in your post is quite right but just small remark it seems that eve uses tcpip and not asynchronous udp so server doesnt literally waits for client data  its just notified when tcpip connection is timed out as i can say from my programming experience without touching the game itself of coursefrom practical standpoint we can say that during legit disconnect not closing game client by ctrlq the server just waits 3060 seconds for client data
step 1 log in and get into a fightstep 2 pull the ethernet cable out of your computerstep 3 rinse and repeatweak argument my ass server will never be able to discern the difference between a logoffski and a disconnectstop theorizing and talking about things you know nothing about peopleyes its a problem but the suggested solutions will cause more harm than you ever thought possiblejust wait until it happens to you i guarantee you will be first one to scream at ccpit only takes one incident just oneps and before you flame me note i supported this proposal so shove that up your missile tube
anyone who had legitimate disconnect during battle as i have knows that the current mechanism doesnt benefit you at all you fight you disconnect you log back in 30 seconds later  your ship is deador you fight you disconnect by some miracle you werent scrambled you warp to safe you log back in 30 seconds later warp back into enemy gang weakened and probably dieor you fight you disconnect you cant log back in cause of serious internet problems but by some miracle your ship wasnt scrambled so the enemy probes you down in 25 minutes and you die anywaythe only way to get any benefit from this is to exploit the system purposely
have you read what others wrote here we talking about that if server or devs cannot descern between legitimate logoff and cutting your ethernet cable then logoff should not give advantages induring pvpalso if logoff happened not during pvp so player doesnt have 15 minute aggro timer proposed changes will have no effect on himwhat harm exactly fixing these bugs will cause please be more specific when making such statementsno i think it is fair that if youve disconnected in the middle in the fight  you die if enemy have scrambled and shooting you with enough dpsthank you for clarification that is exactly about what im talking about too
ive wanted to buy all before say theres only a low amount of ammo in a nullsec system and you need it asapsupporting but doubt itll ever make it to production 

you could also catch prenerf nano ships and falconsthe player can dock turn in missions and get ammo in a cov ops or even a shuttle all it takes is an altin my case its even easier as expecially for non empire agents so i can just switch standings alt and reuse the pilots i do everything in station with an alt the pilots just kill the stuffas for changing system its what having multiple l4 q20 agents in the system is for and in case of real need to leave its still possible to come and go near downtime with impunityyou trade the complete impossibility of doing a plex or mission there with the possibility to do it sure on paper its giving up a lot but its the enabler to do what you could not otherwiseall you need is to head on the mission forum to see what i am doing atm exclusively missionof course you cannot even begin to believe that someone can be different from the standard what makes me immediate easy profit i approve and justify regardless of whether its good or bad and thus call nerfs against his own professions for the sake of game long term good
what a terrible argumentnanoships and falcons completely skewed pvpunscannable ships are rare and hardly affect anyoneregardless the pilot is being limited they are having to be extremely careful and take extraordinary precautions to stay alive unscannable ships have opened up a new door for missioners albeit with a few strings attached
your problem seems to be with alts but your real intention is to nerf something you cant gank with your pvp ship while its at its most vulnerable doing pve so ccp comes up with a ship that counters that and naturally now you want a counter to that counterthis isnt a problem inherent to t3 ships in fact this isnt a problem at all but youre better off arguing that placing too many hi quality agents in one system creates an unfair ability to pick and choose missions but like i said your true motive and gripe is not being able to gank pve ships with your pvp gank squad of death but you wont say this you come under different pretenses but meh whateveron paper have you even ever tried stuffing a t3 with eccm and compared its efficiency with a noneccm version you dont seem to even understand youre giving up dps and tank you say youre a mission runner but are you really from what you say you dont seem to run missions a lotand by game long term good you really mean be able to gank even the one ship that specializes in countering attacks to a pve setup gotcha
im talking about pve aspect only here titan also can bridge ships from safety performing its role well reconscovops can too but guess what covops dont have bubble immunity subsystem and can be caught easily after jumping to other systems by some nice campand  dissolution sequencer doesnt boost eccm bonus it just boosts your sensor strengthi still can do 4 lvl missions in it its efficiency is less but far from being zero
of course you are wouldnt want your advocated nerf to interfere with your playstyle just the one you dont likeccp please nerf pve but leave my cloaks and pvp aloneever heard of inties i hear theyre great for declaokingbumping and quick locks and before you bring the you cant use bubbles in lo sec ill just point out the bubble immune subsystem is useless in lo sec as wellhow about a friggin recon it does its job better because its cloaked in 100 safety lets nurf it but let me guess you think those are fine in lo sec you pretty much have all the advantages to win a fight against a pve fit but that still isnt enough you seem to be so incompetent that you scream and whine to ccp to give you even a greater edge when you fight against a pve ship seriously just ask ccp to make all pve ships on a system you jump into just flock to you and automatically line up so you can oneshot them and display your killing prowess on your killboard
makes sense
id like to see roden fired altogethergallente ships are not missile boats and ships not just gallente with those horrible split weapon layouts underperform to other shipscross training is a pain id rather see roden ships replaced
supportedi understand that some ships are meant to be versatile but there comes a point where being so is actually a detriment the typhoon as pointed out is a great ship due to its versatility and can pump out a lot of dps however ships like the lachesis dont have enough high slots or grid to utilize the split weapon bonuses properly and as a consequence cant perform against other purebonused ships within its class dpswiseas for the nitpickiness well some of us like a bit of consistency 
nit picking or not bold faced lies in game tend to ruin the theme
this is a small easy fix someone just has to go in and change the text roden has no business saying they make missile boats and the bonus on the ships with it is a waste and every reason to claim they make powerful electronic warfare and logistics ships so what they say and do are basically oppositeeven if the bonuses are not removed the bonuses would be changed to something else in an ideal world even if the weapons mounts werent changed no need for missile slots in an ideal world at least change the text in the description
supported  roden ships are just another example of how hilariously badly thought out many of the newer gallente ships actually are
easy fix which makes sense 1

ok i have now spent a week trying to find keys to the angelpith 110 and 210 plexes and i have had no lucknamly its because tey are farmed to hell apparently these plexes drop btype loot this is where imo the issue ispeople can controal access to thes plexes by farming the first rooms this is because of the extended time between key spawnswhat i would like to see is these plexes braught in line with the serpentis plexes add a serp 210 static plex and scale the loot acordinglysoded 110 ctype faction frig bpcv rairded 210 cbtype faction frig bpc v rairdecrease key spawn times to around 1 hour and 2 hour respecfullyadd more rats to the 2nd lvl plexesok i know people are going to flaim that im moaning but hay its my right 
iirc they decreased the drop rate for the btype loot already anyway  try the lowsec plexes they are usually not farmed as badly comes with other risks though
i love itsecure thimble for sure nearly useless to anyone whos progressed beyond cruiser mining

well if i loggon on one day to fin 435 logon attempts failed showing up id petition it and they could then do some ipcheck magic to bansomething that ipsupporting my own idea as well
might bebut on the other hand what would it costi seriously doubt that itd be much work to implement and itll hurt no oneif even a single hack can be prevented itd be worth it
guess this is enough other supporters to give myself a thumbs up for this as well hopefully csm will put this one up not a lot of responses but pretty much all of them positive
if needed i think we can all live even with can without the compression advantage keeping as much stuff within as the size of the container often it will be more useful to be capable to better organize the stuff you move than to gain a bit of space supported
cmon guys this is eve we should all kinds of different sizes of cans for our indys and freightersand if someone could please give me a container that would let you transport a rigged ship that would be amazing even if for instance the container took up 50km3 but could only hold a shipfittingsrigscargodrones of a total 25k m3
does anyone here know courier contractsmore containers what for no thank you
eve looks betterjust saying p
please lock this pointless thread ccp is doing the job just fine without your you should recruit  and the csm sure as hell isnt going to recommend them
i would say that having some kind of more freelanceresque combat system like infinity could be nice it wouldnt have a big impact on large ships but for fast stuff like the vaga it could really improve the game

right now low sec is more a buffer zone between high and null secwhat do i mean by thatits inhabited mostly by 00 alliance alts and there upporters and or the true pirates occasionalythats not a criticismjust a reflection of eve most available assets are taken so the actual wildness of low sec is a farce realyill support any reasonable idea that makes low sec more wild for all concerned ie wether its big alliances or small pirate corpsits down right boring and pointless to goto low sec
score thanks zod

heck at that rate make it a notification
i could partly aggre only on 3rd matter though as long this feature will exist i will use it myselfbut 3rd thing is rly kind a bug as for 1st and 2nd its a normal game featuregather more dds to kill your target in 1 minute and dont let them go unless they will use 3rd featurebug so double logofflogin wouldnt matter at allyou cant just ask to remove every possible feature in the game thet let ppl escape from the grasp of agressors basicly you ask to make game simplier for you and your folks may be and thats wrongso as i only partly agree about 3rd matter no my support here
im not problob i dont argue to change log off mechanics just so the big blobs can kill more peopleif you are seriously interested in giving people more chances of escape from gate campers and blobbers we should undo the great nano nerf  when people had more speed and agility they could escape bad situations without resorting to lan cable pullingthe nano nerf was just as retarded as current log off mechanics the fact that ccp are just fine with this proves they cannot be trusted to make good judgment on game design we have to force them into doing the right thing for the good of eve community as a whole rather than select individuals
smaller ships are still fast and agile enough to escape most of gate camps in lowas for heavier there is still mwdcloak feature there is still warpstabs there is still ecmbursts a lot of ways still out there to escape gatecamps in low even without using buggy warplogoff featurenot even mentioning comlitely safe carriers logistics
not supported from me either because shes right there is no way to tell if i terminated the process unplugged the network cable from an actual unintentional dc the entire point of terminating a process is for it to immediately cease functioning which means its not going to send any commands back to ccp its simply going to drop all contact just like a dc would now with a ctrlq yes you could have that send signals because the program would still be running until the ctrlq command was finished and implementing a message sent to ccp saying ctrlq command was used to log off would work but the other methods are still useablecare to explain exactly how a fix could be implemented that the server would not need to be informed of how you logged off cause ive never heard of one before
escaping the gatecamp with closing game client is not a game feature  its undocumented outgame mechanics totally unintended by devsescaping the bubbled pos by doublelogoffing is not intended game feature too  at least because devs are already fixed itthe motivation of my statements have no influence on their rightesnousness or usefulness so please refrain from such demagogy
i had disconnects during warping into camp and i know what im talking abouti am solo pvper and had numerous losses due to disconnects i never screamed at ccp  please tell me what im doing wrongexactly you can counter each of the features by bringing more ships just to counter exploits ships to aggro you on the other side during warpin and separate team which will pursue you after warplogoff trick dedicated probers to catch logoffloginlogofflogin jerks bringing more dps to kill you in 1 minute without aggro its not really possible to camp gate with small team without letting guys who know these tricks escapedo you really want eve to become more blobbishoh come on dude did you read my post on top of this page care to test any of its points and say yes fixing this point will affect those who had legit disconnect
and so what how inability to distinguish between legitimate disconnect and unplugging the cable prevents fixing described bugs how exactly fixing described bugs affects the players who got legitimate disconnectcan you please answer these questions yourself and not repeat someone others legends and myths
1 fix this
1 no no aggro after you log off without aggro way too exploitable and unfair to those that wait out aggro timers and log wouldnt be that big of an issue except for 22 was actually fixed a while back you would warp back to original logoff spot no matter how many times you relogged broken game mechanic3 you cant point or lock someone in warp not sure how this works when combined with logging off heard it was ruled an exploit cant comment on this onesupported to fix 2 as it was already implemented once and broken in a subsequent patch
you instantly become invulnerable after hitting ctrlq  others cant lock you
and what do you call people who log off literally 13 seconds before they get aggrothe current mechanic is much much more exploitable than the potential exploit you worry about so even if changing it wouldnt solve all problem it would make situation at least 10 times better
lowsec has primarily become the buffer zone between big nullsec sov alliances and high secmost available assets are taken by thee alliancs and or there supportersits no longer a wild placelets fix that one idea is to make low sec moons depletable with a fixed amount of resources that can only be regenerated after a certain amount of time of not being usedleave null sec just as it is and of course high sec moons are all baren anywayto me this is a natural gradation between high low and nul sec
you left out the bit about piracy being an issue
the probing system could be a bit more userfriendly positioning probes in 3 dimensions on a 2dimensional grid is at times very aggravating
for those who dont know as how it work now the more ppl grinding one agent the more lps it will give until hit the cap for particular missionbut thats exatly the reason of overblobing such systems as motsu irjunen dodixie etc more to say thats the reason why 90 of lowsec agents completely out of useyou simply cant in solo or small team make forgotten agents worthwhile its very often then good quality agent in lowsec pay less then middle quality agent in highsec no need to add about security and comfort between lowsecs and highsecsso proposal is make it work completely reverse as more ppl grinding solo agent as less it will pay to them and so as fewer ppl will work on other agent as more it will pay them logical too if hundreds of capsuleers grinding one constelation then probably it is mostly out of any crime no need for local administration to pay a lot to keep things in line so otherwise as fewer ppl will work in another constelation as more desperatly agents in that constelation will requere service of capsuleers and as more they will accept to pay to themso what does it givesit will force ppl to split more evenly acros eve and it will encourage more ppl to explore many empty as they are now lowsecsps thats need to be done for highsecs and lowsec i dont mind if 00 space will keep the old mechanics for it agents
huhmissioners now have to spread out to make isk like say  practically any other profession except market tradingyesalso give anyone with over 10k lp a lollypop item in their hangar once this gets implemented
i agree with this topic as itll make ninja salvaging more of a nomadic profession i used to mission in dodixie so i know how much of a pain they can bealso it just makes sense there should be some kind of slider that prevents hubs like dodixie from ever becoming unused but just to limit the mission runners there
not really since it is based on missions and not agents agent himself only add to payout through the relative quality which does add up over timethe more times it is completed the more data points are available for autobalancer so in that sense it caps outbut you are ignoring the equalizer which is timetocomplete also acting as a modifier for agent payouts if a thousand people all blitz a mission then the payout will be well below what it might be if people waited until the last second to completesince it is the same missions being run from mostall agents of a specific corpfaction and the autobalancer works on a missions a ploy like yours will have no effect there will still be more to be made from higher quality agentscounterrewrite the autobalancer to include the following factors number of actively employed pod pilots ie accepted missions over time size of corporation in question the larger it is the lower the wages juts like real life additional things to do remove q20 agents from highest sec space 071 they are the elite recruiters surely a corp doesnt waste that skill by having them work out of the hq but rather where needed most ie where security is lacking introduce expeditionary branches of empire corps that only exist in deeplowsec 0103 and have better offers in store say halfway between militia and regular stores
theres no 420 military agents in hisecps does anyone have link to articlediscussion thread about how autobalancer works
they removed the q20 agents good stuff havent really paid attention to specifics since going industrial scaling q based on system security is still a good idea though long hard slog through chaff  autobalancer
linked thread describes payload balancer which balances mission base attributes not agents ive never seen an evidence of peragent payload balancer in my past experience proper base attributes are taken isklp reward and modified by skillsstandingssolar system security status eg angelsansha wc4 in extremely inpopular 04 system has never gave me less reward than the same mission in popular 05 systemthat is i still dont believe that thisis trueits important to remember though that in different regionscorpsfactions agents offer different set of missions its possible to have 2 missions which look absolutely the same but actually its 2 missions with different ids and different set of base attributes one may be taken by some agent in placid another by agent in aridiato prove existance of such peragent mechanism we have to find agents in the same region where lower sshigher quality agent with other things being equal gives less reward only because its unpopular
i dont think the op understands how the autobalancer works then again no one outside ccp really knows but at least some details have been made public afaik the quality of an agent and the payout given is independent of the number of players using that agent the only relevant factors are the average time taken across all of eve for a player to complete the mission in question and the security status of the agents home systemthat said it would be very nice if an agents quality was dependent on the number of missions it had given out over the last month or so with overfarmed agents rapidly dropping to 20 quality and those in farflung backwaters rising supported
mission base is all the autobalancer modifies this base is then adjusted by agent effective quality eqeq is dependent on personal standings with said agentcorpfaction and system security approx q10 per 01 decrease in syssec each mission has an absolute maximum payout that is determined by security of agent system and hitting that ceiling is very fast in highsec 65k lp for 05 system as i recall goes up rapidly to over 20k in 0203your wc example fits perfectly with this as the 04 agent would have a q10 and the ceiling raised all other things being equalif the goal is to encourage lowsec mission running then perhaps making the eq adjustment more steep is a good first step allow one to hit the ceiling faster thus making up for the higher risk  it is the low income initial agent grooming that pulls teeth ps i ran an agent in a 05 system onoff for over a year and eq went all the way to 7080 or something silly  ceiling was hit after a couple of weeks though

hi guys i am thinking of something of a mirror image to a war dec pay a fee to have the corp you belong to be unwar deccablepay a fee to dod based on the number count of the corp and for a certain length of time the corp cant be war decced and the corp cant war dec anyonemight work well if there are a certain amount of noobs in the corp like 30 or more
no
how about if there need to be a certain amount of misisons run per member or a certain amount of ore mined
you do not need to be in a corp to be a corpthe sooner you figure that out the better off youll be
you can already do thisif you stay in an npc corp you are safe from war decs for the low low price of 11 of your mission rewards and bountiesjobs done next topic
ccp ftw  cant this be solve by the on board computer pridictin a fligt path and warpin the pilot to a planet then to the intended destination and to prevent campin at plants because pilots will figure out  hmm he has to warp to this stargate which would take himher through this planet or station so lets camp here add a option to warp to diffrent points on the planets orbit and have like satealites orbitin that plant that can assest in a pilot warpin quickly for lowsec and high sec because warpin through stuff to me is a glitch even though ur movein at the speed of light
curved warps fix this up i think warping through things is one of those little things that drag eve down imho it look so goofy they try to justify this like warping is not really moving it wrap space or such asalso getting out of the same fixed and specific tiny boxes of space grid would be welcome by melastly warp speed is many times over the speed of light the speed of light being 000200398707 au  second even a slow 075 aus freighter is slushing around at 375 times the speed of light mach 1 is 340 ms just so you know
first of all thats gross misrepresentation of the facts you didnt just say those two words you wrote sexually explicit material which is a direct violation of our terms of service simply saying balls will not get you gagged we also do not always gag someone simply for using the f word it depends upon the context and it also depends upon your prior historysecondly we do not monitor conversations like you assume if you have a problem with something someone says you need to petition it specifically if you did that then we judged that in the context that it was in it was not bad enough to warrant a gag needless to say going on the forums and spreading halftruths wont help your case

i would like to see some sort of damage mitigation feature in eve where the more people targeting and shooting a ship the less effective the damage each shipclass would have a set amount of incoming dps where it gets 100 damage up to that dps after that additional incoming damage becomes more and more ineffective this would help make active tanking slightly more useful in larger engagements additionally in larger fleets it would start to become useful to have ships pick primaries by squads instead of 100 all shooting the same target however care would have to be taken to pick dps caps for each class that still allow for complex battle situations and dont completely destroy focus fireship class 100 damage until this dps 50 damage at this dpspossible numbersfrig 500  750cruiser 2000 3000bc  3000  4500bs 6000  9000cap 30000  45000for example an cap that has 30000 incoming dps will take full damage however each additional ship hitting past that 30000 number will not do full damage but merely a  of damage at 45000 incoming dps additional ships are only hitting for 50 of their potential
sins of the solar empire
the only problem that i can see is that unlike sins its extremely hard to determine income dps in eve thus it will create massive lag in fleet battles
congratulations you destroyed warfare

this is completely and utterly wrong00alliance usually have lowsec staging areas this is fact but the huge majority of lowsec dwellers are pure lowsec entities there are aloso lowsec arms of both 00 and hisec corpsalliancesbut the truth is lowsec is not boring just very dangerou unless it is your home most people simply fear it and rightly so in its way it is more dangerous than 00 i have lived in both for long periods lowsec needs factors that make it a unique place to live just like 00 and hisec have their ups and downs sides at the moment lowsec does not have that merely danger

i dont know if i like all the ideas but i support the need for change in the way lowsec works for me i think low secs problem is its lack of role in the eve universewhen i first moved to 00 it was to do pvp i wanted to get in a small gang and go roaming to find some other players who were also looking for a fight what i got was huge blobs that 4 out of 5 times ended up in me hanging in a system without grid for half an hour or so until i could see on my ui that someone were shooting my bs and slowly killing it and my pod all the time still with no grid so 00 happened to be about blobs and ratting safely for 15milh to afford getting killed without gridas that doesnt seem to change i would like low sec to fill that missing role low sec should be the place where you could have small scale pvp combat against other pvpminded playersi didnt want to move to lowsec at that time as what i thought i could do there were either just sitting all night long in a gatecamp or trying to act as an antipirate and get just about nothing in reward for those few pirates i would happen to catch maybe im all wrong about what happens in low sec but hey what i dont see i dont know so please if someone knows about another way of living there please enlighten meone thing that could make me move to low sec instantly and make me want to stay there would be by making antipiracypiracy worth doing so that low sec wont be about gatecamps and killing carebears but more about a fight for survival and profit for both pirates and their counterpartsi think for that to be possible there should be more profits related to piracy and antipiracy sure pirates got ransoms as a possible income source but there must be other ways to boost the attractiveness of living as a criminal in new eden smuggling maybe i dont know but i think the market or maybe a new black market will be a part of the answer as it would open up for new professions and new ways of making iski dont think there should be a sov system as we know it from 00 if there were to be one it shouldnt be controlled purely by military dominance as i think that will just make the blobs start appearing in low sec too in the way we know them in 00 once again i dont claim to have the answers but i definitely think that low sec have some great opportunities in the eve universe for new pirate related professions and for antipiracy organisations to see a reason for doing their job which is not in any way to make low sec safe for carebears instead their function should be to counter the new piracy professions in a way that could be profitable or in some way rewarding for the pirates or antipirates who do their job bestmaybe a system where sovereignty were controlled by some kind of piracy lps could be a way the lps could be given to both pirates and antipirates in some way when they did something that would have a positive impact on their way of living as a pirate or antipirate and the sovereignty of systems or the possible profits of the market or black market could then be affected by who had the most sov in the system if as an example there were two pirate organisations fighting for the sov of a system the one having the most sov gained through doing piraterelated stuffdont know how it should be earned but somehow without forcing huge blobs to camp the systems all day could have the best ability to manipulate the illegal part of the market and then if a antipiracy organisation gained more sov in that system it could limit the pirates ability to use the illegal market and then allowing the antipirates to do something else that could work as a income source for them insteadin that way it could be profitable for both pirates and antipirates to try to control the lowsec regions but as the sov system wouldnt be that dependent on combat and military control huge blobs wouldnt appear in the way they do in 00just some thoughts

if the reward is crappyyou dont have to do storyline missions at allbut i think this kind of storyline should be implemented for any agent out there not only for gallenteso storylines become somewhat difficult faction standing is very precious and a challenge people especially missionrunners interacting in lowsec is a great milestone in gameplay
you have my support these new storylines were very poorly thought out and implemented
from all the fw threads out there it seems that fw is still rather buggedexploitableimbalanced as far as the plexes go i havent tried it myself so anything i say is secondhand at best but it seems rather off to base a major change to a long established game mechanic on the results of an admittedly incomplete and low priority feature especially when it singles out only one portion of the playerbase performing the same activitysupported for that reason
moving to minmatar missions to avoid this thing is really fastidious

hey look at low sec nobody lives there but pets right right lets make it so that its even more unlikely anyone would ever bother going there nerf low sec cause its dumbyeah no thanks
i hate it when ccp tries to provide game balance through obtuse ui so im going to have to support this really now that they have the mechanics they want though i think they should take a look at rebalancing the system really id prefer battlesmiths idea though as its much more fluid and fits in with whats already there
yes yes oh god yesa good point is made about combat probes though in that it would give a big advantage to probers because it would take a lot less time to probe this new functionality would be solely for reducing how tedious it is to position your probes not to make it quicker so how about when you use a saved probe pattern it takes an additional number that makes sense seconds to run a scandefinitely supported
id support if the proposal was an improved ui but the current one is workable and i find myself falling in with the crowd saying it could make things too easy something worth getting should take time and have difficulty wonder how the csm will vote on it
there has not been any isk spammer threads in months so i think it is time we got rid of the 5 minute timeryes i know there are ways around it but they are still a hassle

of course there is a counter to cloaking its called probing at least thats what they tell me i have yet to probe a cloaked ship not much of a counter reallynever mind the fact that the only ships that get probing bonuses are all cloakers does it seem sort of strange that a ship should be its own counter
it is the other way around cloaks are the counter to probing
what is the counter to cloaks then
sensor recalibration penaltyscan res penaltyspeed penalty under cloaknot enough penalty for you
itt camping all of your own gates and stations 237 to catch one ship  extremely easy
its a button you press that makes your ship invulnerable forever
itt 30 second tops probing strikes for inability to run higher level missions in low sec solo in any semiefficient formas for impossible to catch them untrue harder yes impossible no even whilst the prey is running a mission
and one competent ceptor to decloak me on the gate
lol
you still didnt answer my question why wont you use cloak if its so effective thenproper decloaking is efficient only when target which jumped into camp cannot warp from its spot and has to fly 10 km just to get out of the bubble t3 has interdiction nullifier which helps to get out of the bubble anyway because even if youre decloaked its too late for campersye whats wrong with force reconsraging is poor argument go fit a cloak on your pve ship and prove that its still efficient and even more efficient than immune to probers setups
the same reason a recon wouldnt load up on eccms instead of a cloak because the wrong tool for the job no matter how good wont do you any good if what you need is a hammer and someone brings you the best screwdriver in the world youre still sol so how exactly will a t3 fit for plexing do his job cloaked and why would you not want a t3 to do the job its meant to do while you seem to not have a problem with a recon doing his job with 100 safetyactually this just isnt true so arguing with you that it is possible while you argue it isnt is pointless ill have to leave it at thatthere is absolutely nothing wrong with them im pointing out that they do their job extremely well while being 100 safe but thats what theyre meant to do wouldnt you agree but what im having trouble understanding is why would you think recons are fine and that they should be able to do their jobs in 100 safety while t3s shouldnt your response a couple of posts above was im only talking pve here which leads me to believe youre ok with invulnerabilities in pvp but not pvethen you change the conversation to well the interdiction nullifier makes it invulnerable and then my response to you is that your problem is with the interdiction nullifier and why not ask ccp to nerf that instead you still havent proven that the dissolution sequencer is overpowered and you really wont be able to because as long as you think 100 safe intelgathering is ok but 100 safe plexing isnt your argument is hypocriticalgo fit eccms on a recon instead of a cloak and prove that its still efficient and even more efficient than immune to probers setups
i am currently doing 0 pvp even felt like leaving my corp because i cant play long enough to be worthwhilemy true motive is that you can do like those who ganked in hi sec and managed to cheat concordor those in wow who would go over the roofs to harass newbies since guards were not programmed to attack over roofs the art of finding the little hole to subvert the game rules also called exploitits easy do you do the plexes  whatever with the gimped setup or notif yes then you factored in the gimpage and still found out its profitable enough to bother you factored in the gimpage and still can do the task that is gimp or not it does the job its a job enabler without that cheat setup you would not be there and thus you are exploiting the game taking advantages you should not takeand where is it written that a t3 is meant to do its job without any riskbecause thats a powerful mechanic that has been introduced to help t3 ships where they would be weak that is an intended calculated planned intended feature with no side fine math or tricks to go beyond the limitst3 ships were made with that advantage in mindits players who decided to add another so you get two powerful mechanics and one of them is beyond game engine management and thus an exploit
nano ships and falcons affected whole pvp aspect of the game unprobeable ships affect only lazy carebear gankersthen you can catch his alt and he wont be able to do anything only sit in space same with cloaky shipsyou still have to return mission and refit or get ammo and if you use alt for it it can be gankedyou can camp station all day if you have time even near downtime so you are saying it should be completely impossible to do plexes or missions if there are enemy ships in systemso being lol completely immune why having a role in pvp is ok cloaked ship scouting enemy but in pve missionin ship its notits still possible and if you are decloaked or you cant cloak because something is near you you are instalocked and dead tbh not that hard with competent gatecamp because every new bubble popped will interrupt initiated warp hard to believe it  as missionrunner you are whining for l4 mission nerf and as carebear you are whining for nerf of unprobeable ships that dont affect you in any wayyou can probe down plexes even if you cant probe down ship but i understand its hard for lazy ganker lies many ppl ran 00 mission even without unprobable ships and its not cheat setup its same like saying that cloaks are cheatingyou are lying its not exploit and cheatingthey are not doing anything without riskno its working as intended and its not an exploit
its impossible to have this discussion with you and well get nowhere fast no need to even address your points however the above gem is probably the most laughable of all if you think t3 pilots are exploiting game mechanics then feel free to petition them as exploiting game mechanics is against the eulaas was already said this is about lazy gankers wanting their easy pve kills all i can say is good luck with your nerf crusade that is all
its not only about ganking carebears there are other purposes for unscannable ships i mentioned t3 fleet booster ships beforebefore t3ships a commandship was vulnerable while running gang links because you cant use the links while being in warp or cloaked why did ccp do this because otherwise any commandship could warp permanently between several bookmarks and be invulnerablenow with t3s ability to use ganglinks and being unscannable this mechanic is obsolete and you can exploit the game mechanic of warfare links by being unscannable either get rid of unscannable ships or make ganglinks be used in warpfleet commands were nerfed pretty hard with the introduction of t3 even without that scan mechanic

supporting my own topic obviously
only being able to put 6000 dps on a bs before having some sort of penalty would destroy warfare really
this has to be one of the stupidest proposals ive ever read if you think active tanking isnt useful then dont use it or perhaps propose a buff if you think its underpowered its not dont go trying to completely ruin perfectlysane game mechanics in which if 100 people are dealing a collective 10000 dps to a ship that ship takes 10000 dps to change that would be to require a complete revamp of every single combatrelated module and bonus in the entire game and then everything would look different on paper but it would still end up working just the way it does now you know why because right now the game is balancedif you dont like how much damage you take when youre primaried by a 100man enemy fleet dont go places where you might encounter a 100man enemy fleet its really quite simple
i would not like to see any sort rr bonus on the ships in questions take the hyperion for instance what would you do be doing in a rr gang with a 8turret ship drop one gun for a rr youre not going to be accepted in a rr bs gang without a rr module hence bring the megathronif youre talking about dedicated logistics support well that could work but its already been stated that active tanking ships work best in very small andor solo engagements youre not going to have dedicated logistics around for thosewhy make this more convoluted than it needs to be the original idea presented is simple easy and makes sense and still has my support
there is a disparity between the usefulness between the armourshield resist bonus and the armour repair bonus in that the resist bonus works well with a buffer tank an active tank and spider tanking the active tank bonus is also useless when the ship is used in larger than very small scale pvp whereas the resist bonus is useful as either a buffer or a remote rep dropping a turret for a remote rep is not that big of a deal when it comes to it in fact in some instances we use dual rr fits on our megss in my corp when in fleet bs fights 9 per level to armour repair amount and remote repair recieved looks like it would work very well amongst the 3rd tier bss havent checked the bcs yet with some other tweaking of these ships stats all the 3rd teir bss would bcome very useful well rounded ships that can be used in smalllarge fleet engagements or solo
lets change kinetic only bonus to regular dmg bonus on caldari missile ships
im confused naiomi why have you asked for that in here i also disagree caldari are the kinetic race but were going way off topic now
it is easy same argument as your post kinetic bonus is weaker than the regular dmg bonusit limits those ships where kinetic is heavily resisted same way as active bonus does within fleets see similar d
how about no roden missile ships periodgallente do not use missiles nor should they ever give that to khanid gallente is blasters drones and blasters

yes plz
as a specific question would people be happy if rails received a 20 reduction in pg and a 10 reduction in cpu needs with all other stats remaining the samewould that be enough to balance them with other shipsoptions
multipart answer maybe and nopeople have found ways to fit the guns the biggest problem is they barely scratch the paint on other ships lowest alpha lowest dps throw bad tracking in the mix and they simply dont fill a niche in combatit is most notable with bs where most battleships are capable of engaging at nearly the same range or better range as railgun ships smaller ships have at least the benefit of longer range the smaller ships hac bc cs af inty frigate would find benefit in easier fitting but bss simply need to have damage that is relatively in line with all the other sniper shipsagain i will point to these two graphsdps as a function of rangealpha strike as a function of rangeif you are against the idea of the need to boost damage for large railguns and disagree with the numbers in those graphs i challenge you to put together better railgun fits than those used to make the graphssmall and medium railguns have a range benefit if they had lower fitting requirements they could have a healthier tank so they had the possibility to gain range before being pulled apart small additional problem with that is half the railgun ships are caldari which means they are also the slowest ships likely to be unable to increase or even maintain range from their target the easiest fix would be to give all railguns some kind of gotcha damage such as higher alpha slower rof placing them between lasers and artillery the alpha graph shows enough gap between the two where this wouldnt be unreasonable and it carries through for medium and small guns
sadly not it would fail to address their poor tracking fixed damage type low dps and alpha etc enabling us to fit more of a bad gun seems to be a poor substitute for fixing their behavior
but would it open up other advantages the other ranged ships would not have ie more low slots and rig slots because no rcus would be needed more rigging options more eans and tracking computers which are traditionally very high cpu and not viable etc and if so would this then give the ship an advantage no other ship has that is also viable in pvp
as i saidbecause battleships have enough grid and cpu to play around with to make them fit a freed up slot on a bs isnt going to allow the tank to be beefed up to compensate for the lack of firepower easier fitting for smaller ships would allow them to increase their speed or beef up their tank so they could get to a range where they are safe from counterfire
not really  while theres other dumb issues web bonus lol that make it a cruddy choice in general look at the kronos vs the other marauders and maybe compare it with the tier 2 and 3 bs of each faction tooit only needs to fit 4 guns thus opening up the cappg you describe and still suffers subpar performance because it simply cant push out the kind of damage that the other ships in its class do nevermind against therm tanking factions such as angelsunless you arm it with blasters which for missioning where most rats orbit at about 4060k is utterly idioticon the pvp side of things you will still run up against resistances and buffer tanking issues and you will still be saddled with the fact your guns dont hit well enough far enough or hard enough to compete at rangeoff the top of my head adding a 3rd fixed damage type might be a good way to go that means that while the damage of hybrids is still fixed they do have the advantage of a wider spectrum of damage making them harder to buffer tank against perhaps a 602515 mix of thermkinem or something id like to see a reasonable 7510 damage boost across the board along with some fixes to the awful state of t2 hybrid ammunitiongenerally speaking leave the long range alpha to artillery leave the shortmedium range chewing up to lasers and give railguns a niche in between them doing mediumlong ranged widespectrum damageps  blasters need work too someone in my corp made the argument that drones ought to plug that dps hole but my personal feeling is that relying on synergy between three different weapons systems to make up for the shortcomings of the others probably means we have three broken ways of delivering damage
my issue is with the idea that increasing damage fixes everything theyve done this countless times in the past and all it does is move the flaw to the next race in linecurrently mh hyperion fits get 401 dps at silly long ranges they have approximately the same dps capacitor and other statistics to similar racial bs typesfits the mega has a bit more fitting issue but 2 useful bonuses the domi has always been heavily limited by fittings but does well anyways because of drones increasing the damage of all of the rail guns is just going to push the hyperion over the top and make it the new best sniper bsi would argue that blasters need a hard look at and a lot of radical changes of some sort opinions vary but rails seem to do pretty well and if fittings were eased i could see a small boost that wouldnt be to damage for once that might just do enough to put them in line with other races rather than make them the new fotw maybe possibly look at capacitor as a secondary change if the fittings arent enoughas for the tracking issue it is very apparent people have no clue how tracking works in this game to be arguing over such small numbers the difference between the long range guns is hardly noticable and does not drastically affect their performance the only balance change you could possibly make on the tracking front to create balance would have to be huge to be noticeable and then the argument becomes where is balance between long and short range weapons actually if you added a 3rd or 4th mag stab it would give you that small damage increase most people here are begging for without having to change the gun mechanics themselves i believe the 3rd adds 14ish  and the 4th adds around 7 dpsbut yes you could also go with more tank or more agility or other things that might serve a purpose in certain fleets
please link this fittingthe mega is the worst sniper a domi sniper is just a jokeunlikelya 3rd mag stab is already standard on a rokh and it still does very poor sniper damage compared to the 2 damage mod fits of all the other ships a 4th is a stacking penalty jokean extra slot would also not fix the short range and low damage of the mega
except that drones cannot engage at sniper range so their damage has no bearingmaking generalizations for different guns is the basis of the logical error leading to the argument against boosting damage for rails if not for the bonuses from different ships creating overlap there are modules and rigs that do this even more except for damage  due to heavy stacking penalties but if we are going to generalize the different guns this is not balanced dpslaserprojectilerailalphaprojectilelaserrailrangeraillaserprojectileit would make more sense for hybrids to be a hybrid of projectiles and energy weapons  not only in name and technology but also in dps and alpha

improved the fit a little will be couple million isk cheaper

because in some older games in order to save resources shadows and transparent surfaces arent antialiased its not that you cant antialise them its that in some cases you choose not to for performance reasons
signed im all for this entering the pc market as well i dont mind seeing it on consolesbut i like many other players it seems will not go out of my way to buy a console purely for dust especially if it is a fps as those just are utter rubbish on consoles  ive tried many and hated all pc is the only true fps platform others may disagree but the console version is already certain for you i want this game to be made available for pctoo i have seen plenty of solid arguments that support a move to the pc but none that really stand out why this should be console only surely ccp can not ignore their player base like that
for the review of my peers the csm and ccp i would like to request the following revision of blueprints and how they are implemented within eveissuetransportingstoring blueprints is cumbersome and extremely high riskdealing with dozens or hundreds of blueprints is aggravatingin its current iteration blueprints are treated like a physical commodity a cdbookscroll they are moved physically and vulnerable to theft and organizing them is frustrating once they are in excess of 2030 each blueprint goes from being a stackable item to a unique item once researched im sure this is unfriendly to the item databases likewise with the constant removal and restoration of these blueprints when they enter or leave an installationideamove blueprints from physical space to remotely accessible databases in virtual spaceimmersion wise treat blueprints as a license to use copyrighted designs which is more or less permanent for the person or organizationthe exact implementation of this i am not emotionally invested in but the general idea would be to treat the blueprints more like a skill book and less like an interactive item player x travels to station y purchases a blueprint and installs it to a virtual space that is effectively omnipresent any costs involved and the delivery requirements for this process i leave to game designers but i would assume that a player who only needs to manage his 8 ammo blueprints would pay less or nothing and a player or corporation storing 100 would pay a more significant amount to maintain iti would imagine that the blueprints would then be organized in the blueprint tab of the industry window in a similar fashion to the way they are organized in the market tab by type and not by their current location a blueprint being researched would be locked from manufacture and viceversacontinuing in that thought train a player may have access to his own database and his corporation may also maintain its database that may or may not be accessible by the player as well adding blueprints to the corp database andor accessing those blueprints for manufactureresearch would make sense using corp rolespermissionsimpactfirstly that the system become simple enough that a normal player might consider purchasing simple blueprints for items they use frequently ammo drones because it is convenient and easysecondly give a mechanism for taking high sec industry into low sec hubs an intermediary step to providing a tortuga bay style jita in low seci now ask for and welcome the thoughts insights and criticisms of my fellow players

ccp please fix mining to make it worthwhile
thats no exploits afaik but bad mechanic and only thouse who logoff on purpuse get benefits from it  since if you really have problems with connection  good chances are that eveserver would go on like you still in game or close client after you engaged in combatthe way i see it fixed  after character gets logged off no matter for real or ctrlq for 10 seconds ship stoppes any warpmoving related activites or waits for warp to end if speed  01 au per second and then kickes 10 second timer on and can be agressed  after that  the usual emerg warp and 1 or 15 minute timer depending on agr state
to often and easily abused to be left in tbfh
this would not work against those ctrlqing right after warp in and would also require a change to pve scrambling mechanics and would make warpinaggro missions easily exploited  defeated
i do not sign it jeremey why the hell did you tell everyone about these exploits why you think itll help and i say no it wont help before this thread only a rare golem or whatever would use these things to get out of the camp but now youve opened so many peoples eyes on it that everyone every single one uses this crap now have you lost your mind man or its juat a rage cuz you sometimes fail to kill some sweetass carebear shipfreighter well im glad to tell you that now you will have difficulties to kill a lot more people as these things have become extremely popular you may be proud of yourself gjnot signedimho this thread should not exist devs plz delete it as it tells everyone about the exploits before only about 200 people were useing them in the whole eve now every single bud uses em omgwtfbbq yeah big thx jeremey big thx man good job ffsgrammar mistakesi was fine about these exploits although i never used them myself and i was fine when sometimes my victims use them because it were only rare occasionsoh and btw some people have really bad internet so wtf if they have a disconnect in campwarp they lose their ship yeah sounds good for you but perhaps not for them i personally do not want to write reimbursemnt petitions every time i lose my hsip because of a power cut etc and then wait few days just to enjoy a gms refuse to reimburse my ship because the server was not lagging it is me who is laggingthis thing is nto exploit it was created to help laggers to defend them from some ass piratekiddies who want to kill him when he lags and now these pirate blobkiddies are whining on forums we cant be silent anymooooooooar we want easy fraaaags it is such a pleasure to kill a faction fitted golem or whatevah when he laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaags whyyyyyy we cant killl heeeeeeeeeeeeem how bou you guys grow up a bit eh

evidently you have little experience in mission and how the payout change over time not a surprise new missions are rare and in recent years only a few people has seen the payout change generally it go this way when a new missions is deployed the payout and time is at the minimum level after it has been completed successfully enough times failedrefused missions arent considered the payout and time for the bonus start to change going up but rarely even going near the maximum payoutwhen enough people has done the mission at least a few times or it appear in some third party forum with the suggestions on how to do it the payout and bonus time start to decrease going generally to a very low level going in lower sec systems increase the floor minimum pay and the ceiling maximum pay so in low sec you have a higher payout as the floor is higher and the agent quality get increased by being in a lower sec systemnot supported as the op dont know what he is speaking of agent eq is not influenced by the number of characters using it
apart from different wording you just said the exact same thing that i did so not quite sure what the hell that patronising crap is for
rereading your post i see i did read part of it wrong so my apologies i had read it as new missions get to the maximum payout fast something that rarely happenyour main argument instead was a suggestion to modify the mechanics a bit so that the reward from new agents in low sec get to the highest value possible with that agent fasterso again my apologies for the wrong interpretation and the patronizing tone
dont know how much flaming ill get for this one but it should be funi want to encourage more new players to stay with eve after they start playing  that said i have noticed that the easiest way for new players to play and learn how to play is to jetcan mine it allows the new player to build some isk buy skill books and learn about the gamepeopleshipsfittings at a reasonable pace i have done it and i know most of you at one time has as well the issue here lately is the imbalance between new players and the veterans who are bored to tears and want to mess with the carebear easy targets trying to build some isk the aggressor flies up in a tech 2 frigate and swaps all the ore form your can to their can you just lost a bunch of ore if you try to take it back you get tackled and blasted to bits  you just got canflipped and a welcome to evehere is my observation it is not possible to deployanchor a secure container in 08 space which means that concord will not help you if its pulled off by someone who wants to mess with you concord does not view theft as aggression i know the obvious replies join a better corpalliancefleetmerc friends etc thats not always possible when you are just getting your feet wet into the game proposalallow players to pay concord to prevent theft from jetcans by adding a huge red warning to the standard warning that the property is protected by contract with concord in 08 space or better if the veteran player wished to continue to take from the jetcan it will be viewed as aggression and provoke a concord responsethe contract is limited to the system that it is made by contacting one of the captains flying around the stargates the contract has a limited duration based on cost which can be secured by individuals or corporations that have an office in that system contracts cannot be made by players who have 180 or more days played or set sp cutoff yes its good to have some cover in 08 to 10 space while preparing for 08 space no i do not agree that all players have the resources to counter this imbalance between new players and the veterans we all are very aware of the learning curve in eve which is a good thing however the imbalance created by the veteran players cannot be changed and the limited recourse available to the new player includes finding another game to play i do not want that to be the norm given the vast potential for people looking for that extra challenge in a mmo  meaning eve not the tool who likes to canflip i think small adjustments are in order to help encourage the player base to grow just my 02 isk worthps  yes this is an alt because i do not need a wardec or kos from that tool who loves to canflip for sg
wonder if it will encourage suicide ganking of carebears in highsec for sgforget the ore just kill youccp should allow flags to be transferred to merc contractors then you will have a solution that keeps concord out of the way maybe
not needed have your mercs in the corp if someone steals from you they are flagged to your corp so the mercs in your corp can just kill them happilyproblem solved
i should have taken bets on how fast the obvious would have been statedim sure it has been a while since many of you were new to the game hindsight is 2020 from where you see the situation your point is valid but it is not something a new player typically has available
true the new player doesnt have this but this kind of benefits you get when joining a player corpccp should not add some protection you can hire in while being in npc corps
if can flipping occurs in starter systems you can petition against it as it is against the rules
what exactly qualifies as a starter system
you play safe here because you know ccp are tolerating this side effect of an oudated system the scanning vs sensor strength mechanics because they could not sell t3 ships otherwisealso exploiting does not equate to violate the eula it only becomes a bannable offense after the eula gets changed to forbid that precise exploit its why everyone do them impunely before they are fixedalso your resistance to pvp in a pvp game is peculiar did you lose too many autopiloted badgers in low sec in your early days
well ive read the replies thought it over and realized that i am indeed horribly wrongi have spent the last week inflicting corporeal penance upon myself and of course wracking my brain for another solution you folks have made some good points and i realize that macro mining probably props up a larger portion of this game than ccp would care to admit but that does mean that it should interfere with honest miners trying to compete in the same market anyways heres a relatively painfree solutionfirst off we can assume as a natural extension to eve lore that the four empires who possess the neverending swaths of veldspar would have it in their best interest to regulate the commercial harvesting of said resourcesmy idea is now a simple one the use of an exhumer in empire belts would require a mining license said licenses are purchasable only by player corporations and by extension grant license rights to all members the costs of these licenses would be minimal and serve mostly to keep highend hulks from operating in the new player corporationswant the max yield perhour then you will have to open yourself up to war declarations and so on anyone not ready or unwilling to face those risks can mine roids in a covetor in much safer conditions in the npc corp this goes hand in hand with the risk vs reward philosophy and any industry corp worth their rocksalt will be able to handle a few wardecs now and againthis doesnt punish new players who can carry on mining in their cruisers and barges but will hold the macroers and similar ultracarebears accountable should they seek to continue their maximized profits if not they can macro to their hearts content  at a handicapped rate of course lowsec and nullsec mining would remain unchangedthoughts
against anything hands down no discussion against anything which forces players into player corpszirse there are like 10 other subjects way more important then this one you should put your efforts into one of themmove alongred
there is no forcing anyone to do anything here there would be an incentive to join player corps but it would be very feasible to mine in an npc corpunder the current system it actually rewards miners working from under the protection of npc corps often for all the wrong reasons this is easily changed and the proposal doesnt inconvenience a large group for the true antisocials its not too far out of reach to form your own private corpand i will continue to attract attention to issues that are important to me and what i perceive to be for the greater good of eve as a miner this issue is paramount to me
so t1 hulls look boring they all have exactly the same pain job as it stands now there are very few different paint jobs for each ship and most of those paint jobs require additional skills to use this is not a proposal to allow players to customize their ship paint jobs that would kill the servers rather quicklythis is a proposal to make existing models available for purchase and production by players evidence  in the dev blog about the upcoming change to the scorpion model there was a pic which had rows of scorpions with various paint jobs there were 4 that are currently purchasable in the game but clearly there are many more models than are currently usable by players i for one would enjoy being able to fly more than just the rattler widow navy issue and civilian scorpion ccp has them in game so why not let us use them perhaps give the models different bonuses or different statistics and make them buildable or just leave them the same and when a person purchases a scorpion they can go to the respective group and get it painted those colors or perhaps the paint jobs are dependent on whose station the ships were built at it would offer incentive to build ships in places that arent jita and it could be an isk sink it might even act as a mineral sink i would enjoy a bit more diversity in the models of ships that people would fly seeing 100 ravens all in the same color scheme gets boring after a whileanyways id like to say that i stole this idea wholesale from akita t dont credit me credit akita
they had it originally in sisi it was deemed too powerful this of course was long before some of the missile changes speed changes and blah blah other crap happened i agree it should be a missile boatall the destroyer t1t2 need a look at
the current insurance system linking insurance and mineral prices so that the sum of prices for all minerals doesnt go lower than the insurance payout that is an issue because its against the free marked the proposal is if someone buys a ship he gets an offer for insurance that is linked to the mineral prices too for example he gets 90 of the reprosessing value the base should be a 7 day weighted avg of the minerals
so you want a direct subsidy to manufacturers only
otherwise it would be exploitablei think this isnt really a good option for getting rid of this problem
ok modify the proposal so that the insurance payout is xx  of the value of the minerals of a reprocessed ship
thats pretty much what theyre doing on sisi at the moment
and only produces a downward spiral to mineral prices and doesnt solve the ops problem
really is the insurance payout on sisi linked to markedprices if yes then my problem is solved if not and only the insurance payout is lowered then we have the same mechanics as before
ccp quite often give people what they asked for rather than what they wanted

i wholeheartedly give a zillion thumbs up to this it turns highsec into  scan bs missioning invade with gank ship gank gtfo i dont even have to work for aggro this would be so sweet
i wholeheartedly give many thumbs up to this suggestion all two of them now ill finally be able to make my dream come true salvaging in a gank phoon 
let me put this in a way youll understand your proposingyour hunting a deer some other guy comes in and shoots you takes your gun still takes the deer and then leaves and then the police say to bad you where hunting in that remote forest we dont like to go toonot supported
to all you comparing deer hunting to salvaging or anything out of the real world except salvaging i think you should read this article and see for yourself that the rules for salvaging are very close to those irli could elaborate on why i exactly oppose this proposal but im not stating my opinion about why the salvaging mechanic ingame makes actual sense once again
true but in the case of marine salvage there isnt a large army of wellarmed submillisecond response and invulnerable police ready to blow you out of the water if you make an attempt to defend your salvagepersonally its more fun to pop the wrecks when you get close and tag team it over the whole mission  its especially fun making you fly 80km to the next wreck before popping it i dont really see how salvagers can make that much income doing what they do but hey if youre playing specifically to troll people thats fine too
if a ship irl were to attack another ship that was stealing their salvage their flag state would likely revoke their registration making them fair game for navies and other ships response time would be slower but the end result would be the same ship loss
hiyasbeen playing around with the ship scanner lately handy little gadget to check out other peoples fitsone thing i thought that might be useful for people that use it would be the ability to save to fittings much the same as when someone links their fit to a chat windowwould also have benefits for war scouts to link the enemy fittings to intel channels and such
that makes it too easy work for your intel
with targeting level 3 you can lock 5 targets who really needs any more than that
you have apparently never flown a logistics ship wtb more than 10 locked targets
logistics recon pilots esp falcons it is also pretty nice to lock small ships in bulk early so you can get a shot at themnot supported
this is madness
this is eve
epic fail noob
yeah i guess thats why there is a skill called multitasking which would technically allow you to lock 5 targets more on top of the 5 you get from targeting and the 2 you get standardalso whats up with the certificate whoring i just dont get it
locking your target  5 of his drones comes in handy targeting is a very useful skill for every player and has to be kept in core certificatesnot supported
i fail to see how swearing is childish there have been many people in this thread that just use the pat response well if you cant use anything but swears to articulate your point then go back to schoolstfu i personally use profanity like if i keep doing so im going to win something and you know what im a college graduate heres the rub though its all about the context in which the words are used a gm in this post even stated that they dont just ban people or flag them for using moderate profanity sexually explicit harassment is another issue entirelyi believe in freedom of speech but where is the line drawn additionally this is not an argument about free speech last i checked eve was solely under the jurisdiction of ccp they want eve to have a teen rating and who could blame them why would you want tobottom line is i use profanity frivolously and in so doing fall well short of the harassment line but i gladly accept that the freedom is limited so that all of us dont have to endure some moron sending up a wall of nonsensical profanity just because he canagain though in no way does using profanity make one more childish than someone who chooses not to they are just words and i know someone is going to reply well then just use other words i just dont want to i like them i like the way they sound i like what they stand for and i love the visceral meanness of themas for ccps prerogative to outlaw naughty speech get over it it is not changing and if it did even the staunchest advocates of free speech and swearing would be blown away by what would follow
id also like to add to this thread that petitions involving swearing or harrassment are dealt with on a casebycase basis by various different people in the gm department there is bound to be some discrepancy between the rulings since we have to use our own judgement in such cases whether a gag or warning is warranted or not if someone has an issue with a ruling they should petition it and a senior gm or lead gm will review the case we also tend not to spend a huge amount of time investigating such cases as we get quite a few of them in our harrassment queue and its more important to keep the queue down and tend to more important issues than play sherlock holmes in such casesin essence though using profanity ingame is frowned upon and any use of profanity could potentially get you a gag or warning if we officially gave everyone a quota on how much profanity they are allowed to use the ingame chat would quickly become littered with profanities and abusive language which would be seriously offputting to many of our customers public chat especially official channels such as rookie help recruitment channel etc have stricter rules in this regardalso if you suspect a player petitioned you not because heshe was truly offended by your language but rather just to get you in trouble then please petition it as doing that is not allowed we will punish players who try to manipulate us to get revenge on other players providing we have enough evidence to take action
honestly it is usually the guy who gets ganked then threatens to hunt you down irl slash your tires toilet paper your dog and beat you up with a rubber chicken or some variation that gets gaggedbanned the tantrums people throw on eve then are shocked when they get banned are pretty epic
this is simply an example of griefing taken to an extreme player a is simply trying to maximize screwing over player b its expanding on an atmosphere eve already encourages you see it a lot on internet forums too some posters will act like complete douches but then run to the report button as soon as someone takes them to task for it the difference of course is that eve is designed to emphasize its unfriendly aspectsits more of a teen thing teens especially young teens swear because its edgey and bad and they think it makes them look cool this is exacerbated by the fact that the internet allows people to dissociate with their actions and not have to hold themselves responsible for the consequences this is also what encourages the young punks on xbl to behave the way they dowhen you hit earlymid 20s you usually learn that swearing isnt nearly as cool as you thought and it simply becomes a tool of emphasis or frustrationas for the issue at hand simply put the rules are the rules and everyone here has explicitly agreed to follow them if you snap off inappropriately at someone because they did something the game specifically allows them to do then its your own fault
that would be cool if you can join a pirate faction militia
while this would be a neat idea i believe that a whole low secpirate expansion should be on the menu at some point
is this some kind of a joke you do realize your playing eve right
king dave said is this some kind of a joke you do realize your playing eve rightis your post some sort of joke do you not understand the problem
i duno pottsey but eve is a pvp game per sUFFFD and ccp wants it that waywow i made a rhyme
didnt ccps reports say something like 75 of people live in empire and on average less than 1 ship is lost per month per account in pvp combat this suggest combat pvp is the minority for a pvp game we dont seem to do that much pvp on the whole as a player base or i am readingremembering the data wrong
i think you fail to understand what a pvp game is if eve was a pvp game there would not be a pve option pvp games dont need a pve option enemy territory quake wars is a pvp game there is nothing to shoot apart from other players eve is a sandbox game a sandbox will naturally encourage players to pvp limited amount of sand to play with but there shouldnt be a need to force it on players as this removes options and makes it less sandboxysandboxes are about options not about linear paths if i wanted to play a pvp game it wouldnt be eve and i do play pvp games i dont pvp in eve because the game mechanics does not cater to my personal likesdislikes its simply put not my cup of tea i dont really enjoy having a massive advantage over my enemy as this makes the game less challanging i always join the loosing team in fps games as this makes things more of a challangein eve this simply means ill be on the loosing side and theres very little i can do as a single player to change that im not complaining about that however as there are plenty of other things to do in eve but dont try to tell me that i have to pvp because then the only reason i play eve is taken away from me and ill simply find another non pvp game to playtldr im not forcing you to minemissionplexwhatever it is that you dont like to do in eve so dont force me to do something i dont enjoy because i wontedit i almost forgot to mention pew pew is not the only way to pvp in eve almost every activity in eve is subject to pvp in fact even mission running is subject to nonpew pew pvp in many ways
im not claiming that pvp is the only way to play in eve far from it but the economy is driven by pvp losses and your minerals lp and loot wouldnt be worth squat without us to blow it to high heaven

what a waste of time
i could have sworn i had seen somebody from ccp claim they had now employed a font guy if i could find the attribution i would post a linksupported anyway will chase this up
i personally dont need them larger i just need those few letters distinguishable from other letters
may i make a suggestion instead of just boosting rails which doesnt really help gallente much why not boost rail boats like the harpy moa ferox eagle and rokh with a damage and an optimal bonus and boost facemelt blaster boats with a tracking and damage bonuswouldnt that simplify things somewhat
i dont think so the problem is more complex than just changing bonusesa full revisit of hybrid ships weapons is neededcurrently there are some problems with these shipslow dpscap usefitting issuesespecially for caldari rail ships and to some extend gallente blaster shipstoo small tankno real advantageslow ships this is mainly problem for the blasters but a huge one imhocaldari onlyvery weak at close range even if fitted with blastersslowno antitackler abilitymedicore dps at best completly useless at close ranges imho
true this ship can do 401 dps but based on your fit it can only do that for 4m 55s with the mwd off this wouldnt work in a fleet situation plus if you allow ships to not be cap stable then the amarr ships could do significantly more dps than the fits i used for the graphs such as thisapocalypse dpstracking enhancer iiheat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink iiinternal force field array icoprocessor iireactor control unit iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketssensor booster ii targeting rangesensor booster ii targeting rangetracking computer iitachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora ltachyon beam laser ii aurora llarge ionic field projector ilarge ancillary current router ilarge energy collision accelerator i401 dps  413 dps191km optimal  200km optimal2110 alpha  2841 alpha00356 tracking  00542 trackingtier 3 gallente battleship price  tier 2 amarr battleship pricethis noncapstable apoc would outdo your noncapstable hype for all ranges up to 220km where they both are pushing 315 dps and beyond where the apocs shorter falloff falters using drugs would only make it worsebefore you ask the abaddon can go even more silly than the apoc but shorter range obviously less you can do with the minmatar fits as projectiles dont burn cap but their alpha from the fits i listed previously is higher than either of these noncapstable ships all the way out to the lock limit
people seem to forget that when i did the balancing calculations and came up with the proposal i did it on the premise of using standard fleet fits or as close as possible and using the dpstankisk metricdo you know why you dont see hypes in fleets because that fit with 3x sebos doing 401 dps costs 200mil the equivalent apoc and tempest fits cost half thatperformanceisk is the major issue here and rails are on the bottom rung as far as that goeson the comment about fixing the ships instead of the weapons i think that looking only at the ships is ignoring the issue and beating around the bush the problem lies in the ammoweapon interaction if we want an all encompassing simple and elegant solution i think this would have to lie with reengineering the damage potential of the ammo after going through all the hybrid discussions it does seem that most people report that they are underwhelmed by the damage delivered in comparison to the disadvantages of the weapon systemsfor example the idea about delivering extra damage in a third type sounds promising but its too complicated i did like the rails kin blasterstherm weapon damage multiplier rebalancing idea quite a lot adding the 15 damage boost on top of the respective characteristic damage for railsblasters would be very nice indeed

if you were to give the caldari ships a damage bonus you would be taking away a range bonus thus requiring a little more base range to be added to the stats for railguns this would fix the issue for the most part but megathron snipers would no longer have the well at least im not flying a rokh phrase to comfort them the smaller gallente ships would be sol and stuck using sm blasters which are pretty crap as i am not fond of the megathron sniper to begin with it is out of its element anyway and am in favor of fixing blasters so they actually are functional i wouldnt lose sleep over it if this suggestion is implemented
thats the dumbest statement ive ever read you cant count ship cost when insurance totally negates it the only cost that matters is fittings on anything t1 the markets have driven the cost of building the ships down to exactly what ship  insurance cost would equal payout toothe apoc is hardly more cap stable also in fleet engagements its hardly likely to cap out a bs anyone with a lot of fleet experience knows that during a fight due to lag and a lot of other factors you just dont cap out often the only time it becomes an issue is when you do pos shooting or some other stationary shoot with a lot of hp to chew through thats not the intent of a sniper bs between swapping targets and periods of warp insouts there is plenty of time for the capacitor to easily out recharge the use not to mention that hype fit has a spare rig slot that can boost cap notice the one empty slot i leftthat hype fit is totally practical in any normal super sniper range fleet engagement thats been the big question throughout this thread and it got answered rails are pretty good all that needs fixing is the fittings issue most gallente have most amarr and minmatar have far less fitting issues than gallente do and this is really true of any weapon platform they may use

just moved into a wh a few weeks back although i havnt got one myself i can easily see how stupid it is that you cant refit a t3 ship in wh space
im not 100 taken with your exact details on what should happen with drones and specifically drone interfactinguihowever i am 100 in aggrement that the drone interfacting menu as well as the way drones work does need an update for sureso supported csm take note of this thread please 
supported lots of mission runners including me dont bother lootingsalvaging so therere massive l4 wreck fields from missions like the various extravaganzas and blockades and worlds collides just sitting there after we warp off and turn in the mission someone should be able to find that stuff before it despawns
i support thisthey have been around long enough for ccp to get the feedback they were after
edited version supported

these missions are bugged and not now worth running supported
these new expdrimental missions are the worst idea ive seen in this game so far supported
give me more pretty things to look at
ah im uses edgedetect and widetent which is added after everything has been rendered and you will find that the shadows are jagged because thats how the shaders were coded not because they are excluded when antialiasing is applied if you turn on your antialiasing youll see that it is actually applied to the shadows  theres just only so much blurring colours together can dotamber
all i can say is ccp why not make it available on all platformsyou really dont make sense for years your pc and pc only gamers have supported you operations and grew your game as you have wanted to expandi also totally understand getting into the console market however unless you have some awesome ideas to make a fps element in the pc eve that we play nowbe it incarna or something elsethen why would you not include a pc version are you plain stupid lol and im being seriousahh well if you dont then fine shoot yourselves in the foot if thats how you like to roll ccp o0

i have been wondering a while by now why cant we build multiple stations per system there is nothing mentioned in backstory about it just arbitary limit placed on number of outposts you can have in system if it is possible in npc 00 low sec and in hi sec why not also in player claimed 00 it is the same space afterall so i propose lifting this ban from eve allow construction of several outposts per starsystem i would also like to see ofc ability to build player station in low sec or even in hi sec also ofc but for now i have to be content with proposing just ability to build multiple stations in starsystems in 00
posting to support my own topic
i have also allways wondered about this unless there is a very specific reason or what have you supported
see no reason not to
with the current sov system being tied to stations and thus a system with multiple stations would be major pain in the ass to take over not supportedalso why would you want to have more stations in the same system
taking over two stations in one system would be considerably easier than taking over two stations in 2 systemshaving multiple stations in 1 system is a considerable benefit for industrial activity consider having your refinery and factory stations close together there is also the question of office spaceallowing multiple outposts per system would be a considerable help in increasing population density in 00
in my opinion having multiple stations in system would only be relevant if attacker and defender have more or less equal numbers currently this not seem to be case usually with attacker having clear numerical advantage so this would just mean currently in everyday situation 12 more siege ticks for the 50 dreads shooting at station while victims of the takeover stay docked or away as they do not have numbers to do anything against attacker yes  if numbers are equal it would make taking over the system with multiple stations a bit harder but hey you would get multiple stations for your trouble if you can under current system of countless rf timers in defenders prime time take a station system then one more station in that system would be irrelevant for the outcome in fact it would be easier to take over 2 stations in same system than taking over 2 adjacent systems with 1 station in each of them as far as why  in my opinion this artificial limit is a bit immersion breaking i can kinda understand why this system was in place under the old sov system  to avoid someone dropping 4 stations in one sov 4 system with 5 moons and putting deathstar on each moon in system even then i tought that this is a bit dumb way of doing it as there was no reasoning whatsover provided why cant you build several stations in the same system in 00 while this can be done in empire and npc 00  ofc i also have agenda i would prefer to keep factory station and refinery station in same system instead of having to run into adjacent system with my minerals its not about risk as there is no risk doing that be that factory system next door or 5j out jump bridges and several accounts full of scouts plus proper intel channels and there is no danger of moving your minerals in freighter or jf it is just not convinient ofc from leadership position one would want to make sure every system has station bcos of sov warfare reasons before making multiple stations per system if that would be possible  but that is entirely another story so if you have to pick between conquering 1 system with 2 stations in it or 2 systems with both having 1 station in it what one would you prefer  i sure would prefer the first one as an attacker  one less ihub to crunch thru
well you not intent to but you do circumvent theftyep and risk is good for eve you circumvent that risk too and no i dont have ideas how to deal with it except for them being a physical commodityas for other issues  yes handling bpos in manufacturing and researching process is horrible this is programming and ui issue why you do not propose fixes to that  after all keeping bpos in your servers may be plagued with the same problems as well
 this
well firstly consider the following blueprints are rarely ever exposed to piracy or theft anyway there is too much incentive not to when the cost of both currency and research time is so great for that reason they are effectively locked down in high sec station where they remain for all time when they are moved a reasonable player does so easily in the tiny hold of a covert ship and they are only exposed for a few minutes of travel time when they absolutely need to be moved or they are moved by alts in shuttles etc the result is not that blueprints are regularly stolen but that they seldom ever move from a secure location and when they do they are done so in a way that eliminates chance of losswhen i first approached this as a management issue escape sorting 100 items to build or research my first thought was that they would be stored in one item that manages all blueprints you steal one item you steal all of them that wouldnt address the issue of them being locked down but it would make them easier to deal with for sure 100 items compressed down to 5 or 6that evolved to the item being more like an implant transported in pod pods are relatively safe but that would then marry them to jump clones and the 24 hours timer associated industry would then become an impediment to usual gameplay not a bad idea still but they wouldnt be vulnerable to theft either only to permanent loss you could assuage the damage some and make them more like a skill where your research is damaged just like you would lose some skills without a proper clonethat then evolved to the idea of making it a permanent virtual space where the chance of loss is replaced with a known constant loss in maintenance fees the cumbersome moving of items is gone as is the need to lock them down in one physical spacerisking a ship  risking a blueprint if you lose a ship it can be rebuilt or repurchased funds allowing assuaged by insurance losing skills is almost impossible it doesnt make sense that with each blueprint you transport you risk several orders of magnitude more isk and months of research therefore i stand by my proposal that they function more like a skilli do think that the possibility for theft and or destruction is fine i dont have any specific methods of establishing that but i would like to see the end result of easily managed blueprints organized logically like they are in market instead of physically sorted as items
roflyou might want to stop by in the crime and punishment forum and do some research how often people wipe the blueprint library when the empty corp hangarsalso some director of intrepid crossing got popped in his covops full of all kind of capital and subcapital blueprints while trying to dock in a heavily bubbled stationimho blueprints as a physical unit have to stayoh and jfyi i have a nice blueprint copy hangar which has around 4000 copies all the time so trust me i know the pain associated with them
the first you can attribute to naivete the second to usual warp to 0 shenanigans it is possible to secure blueprints to what extent that is done varies greatly im sure would you rather they were all one physical item then that would still be an improvement for inventory and you could then make the change to blueprint sorting within it to a logical sort alternatively would you rather that the blueprints could be ejected and taken as individual physical items again for the purpose of resale or theftas a matter of convenience it doesnt make a difference to an inside man if he has to steal them all by moving one item or group moving the entire inventory it would effect the usability of the entire stock for everyone that had less sinister intentionswhere is your complaint exactly
interesting idea worthy of my supportwhile i do not like the corp theft mainly bcos of utterly crappy all or nothing security options from ccp side it is unfortunately one of the things that can be done in eve and is considered by ccp as one of the allowed activities so perhaps give us ability to make our bpo library one item i have over 700 bpos and it is indeed hassle to mess with them perhaps it would be better if my library could be condensed into magic box so i would have just 1 item to load when i open the hangar section with prints instead of 700 items ofc one would need also some ability to split the box so to say and do all the things you usually do with printsit would be kinda like putting the prints into container you just could use them while they are in container same could be done for bpcs ofc the 1000 item per hangar and 2000 items in contract if you are being clever and putting bpcs in cans are limits i regularly bump into i do not like them as no explanation has been provided to me why they are there from storyline standpoint i mean if i want to put 1200 max run bpcs of fusion xl ammo into my corp hangar what prevents me from doing it  being able to condense those bpcs into one item would be good as long as i could in theory start 1000 parallel 1000 run fusion xl jobs from that tiem as one can do currently with 1000 bpcs
you want to lessen or even completely remove risks when dealing with bpos noalso you want them to be represented in game with some kind of different interface if ccp cant make bearable bpo managing system for whatever reasons what makes you think it will magically appear when renamed to some virtual servers ui  especially when you not propose any specific improvements in this area 
they need to fix the industry ui not destroy the market by allowing anybody and everybody to build battleships in every 00 station they podjump tonot supported
i keep forgetting or missing contracts because of no flash would be nice to have
hell yes and this chart should also go in every econ dev blog published too
lie therere almost twice more votes for fixing these exploits than total number of supports in this thread
signed fix this its insane that you can escape death in this way eve is supposed to be harsh apparently seems most people are unaware of this get out of jail free card feature makes a mockery of the game tbh if your internet connection sucks so bad then dont undock in anything you cant afford to lose i hate losing something as much as the next guy but this is just a farce
not supportit wasnt an exploit for more than 2 years why it should be now its the same type mechanics as cloaked macrohunters  so its should be fixed both or neither
thats the truthand gentlemen please dont pay much attention to this bunch of lowsec pirates all the rest of russian community im glad to represent is perfectly satisfied with width and flexibility of the features eveonline offers to its subscribersthe following is the result of poll that took place in a central russiancommunity resource81 ppl would like those features to be eliminated160 ppl would like those features to be kept intactps i beg a pardon gents but most probably i wouldnt be able to reply you i cant read english i can only write messages in english
well if 80 is few  then yes its the truth pyea availability of exploits is flexibility of the features greatits a shame that you dont get that 3rd option no im darkside member and feel butthurt isnt the same as no uniting them into one single option and summing number of votes is bad idea mkay
i agree hate exploits and want them to be fixed
if that is the case than i am all for it i was unaware that pvp timers and npc timers were different and honestly shocked that pvp timers are shorter since i assume this tactic is used almost entirely by the pvp crowd and not the npc crowdas for that being basic game mechanics you are kidding yourself unless you are actively trying to figure it out instead of just dealing with the occasional disco you are never going to know the difference between the two without combing some mind numbing pvp guide to ganking on some fanboy epeen website that 34 of the population could care less about
i support this message
this deserves support i think
you certainly put a lot of work here do you  how about instead of copypasting the links which of course failed to paste you go read them lots of these ideas are bit outdated other linkies are here for the purpose of people to stop posting them over and over  because they were discussed ad nauseam and said to be not implemented for various reasons
nope i didnt put a lot of work in here but one of the csms claimed it was a lot of work to look in the forums and insisted these issues werent in the assembly hall forum so i helped him out some but hey if they are out of date then when they are presented ccp can say already implimented and they can move on i just want the csm to actually propose ideas that the players want not what they personally want as pvpers did you read the minutes of the last meeting it was a complete waste of time they should be representative of us so get some answers to some of our proposals in this case some of the most requested proposals in features and ideas
so you claim you want all these ideas to be implemented more even it is us who wants all of them to be implemented rather brave statementi will repeat how about you go and actually read that stuff 
i simply pointed out that proposals have to be raised in the assembly hall forum and that it wasnt the job of the csm to go hunting for issues and raise proposals on behalf of people too lazy to do it themselvesif people cannot be bothered to follow the correct procedure then their ideas will never progress forwardis that clear enoughthis is not a proposal it is a wish list each of these items would have to be raised as a separate proposal containing sufficient details to explain the problem and solutions as this thread does not contain any specific proposal this is not the correct forum for it
the proposal is for you to address these issue at the next csm meeting you have that proposal in front of you  or are you going to go back on your words now are you afraid of a little work on your part
that is not how the csm process works it is not a matter of a little work you cannot game the system to put a list of 110 items into the agenda as one single proposal even worse the items on the list dont contain any details required to make such a determination in the first place lastly some of the list have already been submitted to ccpif that is the best you can come up with then it isnt going to get looked at and at best will end up on the agenda purely to get rejected so we dont have to deal with such blatant disregard of the csm process in future
and even worse  many of the items on the list had been reviewed by ccpcsm alreadythey are just listed as commonly proposed ideas to stop people from posting them againwhich sadly doesnt work you prove it again
the original post contains a link to the message that lists all these issues with a link to threads on them if your so self centered you wont even look at the issues the actual game players are requesting perhaps your not in the right position btw from the last mission you general seem to have disregarded the entire player pbase from what was posted in the minutes so perhaps you process needs to be looked atit clearly isnt working thus far
i see the dont change my game crowd has spoken uplook the guy said he didnt have time to go looking for proposals so i helped him out with a nice little link to the most common ones and wheither or not previous csms have looked over them doesnt mean later csms wouldnt reverse their standing on any issue if they are going to be our representatives on this board then let them represent us if they are going to play ego games then let them pursue their own agendas as they appear to be doing now going by those minutes the last meeting was worthless lets see them actually do some work for us for a change
that is not raising a proposal that is attempting to put 110 items onto the agenda with absolutely no effort on your parta proposal thread should consist of the issue and a proposed solution so people can support it or not simply linking to another thread is not the way to do it linking to another thread with 110 items on it and saying that is a valid proposal is so false i dont know where to beginbecause i refuse to write 110 proposals for you im self centred check the last meeting thread youll see i raised 5 issues z0d raised 3 aleks raised 1  nobody else raised any issues at all and you are pointing the finger at me what exactly are you on yes i ignored the whole player base when i raised issues that players had put as proposals into the assembly hall following the correct procedureoh wait i didnt ignore them at all and their issues were discussed the job of the csm is to filter the issues raised in the assembly hall forum pick the best and submit them to ccpit is not the job of the csm to read every different forum looking for issues to raise on behalf of players like yourself who expect everything to be done for them
nobody is asking you to read every forum just features and ideas would that be so hard if your basing your whole representation on the vast minority that post on these forums your doing a disservice to everyone you raised 5 issues wow i am so impressed it should have been 50 either your minutes are way incorrect or yall really wasted a lot of time during this meeting
sigh you seem unable to actually read my posts so im probably wasting my timeone last timeproposals for csm have to correctly raised in the assembly hall forumis that so hard for you to grasp it would appear so i can read the features and ideas forum all day nothing in there can be submitted to the csm without a proper proposal thread in the assembly hall that is simply one of the rules coupled with that csm are not expected to write these proposals for you that is the only step you have to do but apparently that is far too much work and we should ignore all the people following the correct process to waste our time doing it for you thousands of other people are actively participating in the correct forum why cant youare you telling me that people who post in the features and ideas forum are somehow utterly unable to post the completed idea as a proposal in the assembly hall forumsreallydont you think it would be doing a disservice to the people who have correctly raised proposals in the assembly hall forum if instead of looking at their issues we spent the next 6 months raising and discussing the 110 proposals youve picked that doesnt sound very representative which is why each proposal in the assembly hall can be voted on so everyone gets a chance to support an issueyou call me self centred for refusing to spend 6 months of csm meetings dealing with a list of 110 issues that took you 30 seconds to cut and paste from another thread and it was even too much effort for you to retain the links read the raw logs we dealt with 8 issues this time a few of which were pretty simple and it still took over an hour to discuss them all what planet are you from if you think that a 23 hour meeting could possibly deal properly with 50 issues we dont just read out a list and say yes or no to them we actually bother to read the proposals and discuss them fully say we did plan to talk about 50 issues in a 3 hour meeting180mins  50 proposals  36 minutes per proposal36 minutes  9 reps  24 seconds per rep per proposal your ignorance of the entire procedure is telling
eight whole proposals thats amazingyou go to ccp to talk about the game face to face with them in order to represent the players of this game and you come up with 8 whole proposals to talk to them abouttwo of which are self serving 1increase length of csm term and 2make csm more of a stakeholder whatever the hell that means in the process of making new features and expansionsi am so impressed by 2025 you might just get to some important issues
i guess we will see delenne sheridan in the next term to see how much better she will dothough you wont get my votelast but not least  assembly hall proposal that merge 23 ideas are bad already because you can never tick the supported checkbox if you dont want to support some pieces of the proposals you drop 110 things at the us and expect we support all of themeven though your list contains things where ccp devs already stated that it would be too complicated to implement joystick control or that they will never return for various reasons minesbut i am amazed blaming others is so much easier than stepping up yourselfedit wow you are worse than i expected you should really step up yourself and do some work before you risk such words atm you behave like an idiot
i didnt say everyone one of those things should be approved i said they should be brought up with ccp and get an answer on why they can or can not be added to the game i have no dog in this hunt except wanting the csm to actually represent the players and not their own narrow 8 total proposals interests
well then you should atleast sort out all proposals with dev replies and former csm proposing them already
i really do suggest you read about the csm process and take a look at the minutes because you are making yourself look very very foolish right nowyou seem to be confusing the csm meetings we have every two weeks with the iceland summit which happened in feb because i have the numbers to hand i will show you how many issues we have managed to discuss per meetingmeeting 1  handover from csm3 introduction from ccpno proposals discussedmeeting 2  first proper meeting16 proposals discussedmeeting 315 proposals discussedmeeting 47 proposals discussedmeeting 56 proposals discussed issues list finalised for the summit ccp required it one month in advance of the meeting to schedule dev timethe list contained 14 major and 19 minor issues passed by the csmmeeting 66 proposals discussedcsm  ccp summit  many issues from the major list discussed as well as some of the previously raised issues and discussion on new features such as planetary interactionmeeting 7 8 proposals discussed the 8 i talked about in my earlier postso youll excuse me if i stick to my opinion that a single proposal which attempts to raise 110 issues is utterly ridiculous especially as you yourself dont wish to put the effort in to raising the issues correctly
out of 44 proposals you could only work 8 in for a summit where you went to iceland really come on you guys packed your stuff flew or boated to iceland sat down with the developers and for the time alloted you only got 8 items discussed
get of your high horse really everything i could say to you know would mostlikely get me banned for offensive language
delennei get the odd feeling that you have never worked for a company that holds meetings to discuss items of importance before i have personally sat in numerous meetings at work where we take 2 hours to decide on the wording for a single paragraph of a document to distribute to the company discussing a minor policy change and this is for around 100 peopleyou expect the elected csm volunteers to be able to propose and discuss numerous redundant items with no effort to define a possible fix in the short period of time they have allotted to them you are for lack of a better term insaneperhaps before yelling about topics that you pull from other threads post in the wrong place and scream about incessantly like you have done some real work you should do some real work like teadaze has suggested
who said we only discussed 8 issues in iceland i stated earlier that the last meeting we covered 8 issues the last meeting was on sunday wasnt in iceland and didnt have any ccp people there because you brought it up we had 28 separate meeting sessions over the 3 days in iceland and at least 20 of those were directly related to issues raised by the csm whilst many of the other meetings covered multiple issues too oh and the self serving discussions were raised by ccp not csm thanks for paying attention i have to thank you for your continued attempts to troll ive not laughed this much in ages
just amazed that they go all the way to iceland to meet with the developers of a huge game and all they get done is 8 thingsthey were supposed to go with a list of 34 thingsi guess we wil all just have to accept that there is no player representation in this game at all
reading comprehension faili like pieces of 8 though
i cant decide yet if youre incredibly dense or having one heck of a troll run here on the chance this isnt a trollgoing to the summit with 33 issues to discuss is a far cry from 8 please retake reading comprehension thanks
dont worry they were issues no one really cared about anywaythe important stuff is generally ignored

a system a new character starts in
ccp wrote a dev blog about this a while backit also happened to get published on apr 1st
i like this idea not only for the suggested idea but also for these others 1 i think ccp will like it as an isk sink2 i have often thought of this as a way to possibly fix or move in the right direction the bounty mechanics in eve which everyone knows are completely brokenuse concorde for hire instead of using the isk as a bounty which is fricken useless as payment for their shipstime to go out and hunt your known offender this wouldnt be cheap and you would have to provide them intel as to the known system that person is in if when concorde arrives there the offender is not there they wait a day and then leave if you spent the isk and he wasnt there  oh well but at least it gives the opportunity to exact your revenge for a price dynamics before you all flame me  you can only hire concorde for a certain period of time and only based on the standing loss of the other character that killed you in other words if you were popped in 00  sorry you cant hire them no whining if you got popped in low sec that would have to be either fine tuned on the sliding scale ccp developed for standing loss a while back or treated like 00 maybe you can only hire a few frigates or one bs depending on the level of the offense in other words2bfinally as always this would add some cool purpose to eve in the fact that intel would gain some importance other than just for pvp fleets and transporting goods you might see headhunters corps like merc corps in eve spring up as legit careers and as always concorde ships are vulnerable to attack and would have to be paid for accordingly in other words if you want to make sure that you get your man you have to hire accordingly the amount of ships and that is gonna cost you i think these concorde hired ships too should be allowed to travel into 00 and should be constrained to the normal gate mechanics if your target lives in deep 00 it will be hard to reach him
how  by making some npcs who do the work instead of them so can you choose your mind please concord goes to 00 or not  if yes what a nice way to wage 00 wars isnt it also while we are here i want to hire concord to kill my mission rats and hire that industrial ships who mindlessly wander around anyway to mine some ore for me
there is a difference between do my work for me and watch my back so i can do my own work in this suggestion if this is an anti tool mechanic im all for it
lets make invention less of a click fest please and improve some other stuff along the waywhen invention came in the devs gave us the impression that the current  now 3 years old   state of invention was just going to be the first iteration and that there would be improvements cominglike many things in eve once its out there and the most obvious bugs are fixed invention has been forgotten about and we have had no further improvements or tweeks1 improve the interface  invention broke my mouse  no really it did the left button no longer works correctly after all those clicksa batch job run would be excellentinstead of selecting 1 bpc and doing all the clickies select multiple bpcs of the same type and insert the jobs all at onceoptions include x in parallel or x in seriesparallel jobs would use multiple slots at the same instalation based off free time and use up the players science jobs 1 per bpc up to the maximum the player can startseries jobs would use only a single slot and would take x times longer to complete where x is the number of bpcs selected max  30 days this option would only use up 1 player science job2 remove the me pe protection given to bpo holdersinvention jobs with the worse possible or no decryptor should start from me 0 pe 0  bodging in the me and pe for invented bpc copies was a unwarrented extra cost lumped onto the invented copy builder over and above what is required for a bpo buildinvented bpcs already have the extra overhead of dycryptors which is substantial3 allow me and pe of input bpc to have an effect on output bpc me and peegoutput me  base me   input me  10  4add unrepairable damage to interfacesinterfaces wear out after 100 jobs and need to be replacedthis is so that explorations drops of interface build components and bps are not so utterley worthless as they are today
1 yes2 yes3 yes4 once upon a time those things were worth something now they drop like candy given out by creepy clowns this should be fixed
while i agree with 1 to 3 4 would drive my corp nuts we would need like 25 interfaces each month
you just need to treat them more like you currently treat dycryptorsmaking them a consumable item alters the cash flow from invention down to explorationpoints 23 would make dycrytors somewhat less necessary and make them more of an option rather than a requirement as they are atm for a lot of invented items  esp ships iircpoint 4 counterbalances this somewhat by adding value to interface build componentsso impact on explorations drops23 less iskies going to exporers for dycrypters  radar  currently uber4 more iskies going to explorers for interface bpcs and components  magnetometric  currently pointlessoverall invented build costs should come down due to reduced moon goo requirementsmeaning cheaper t2 ships and mods for everyone o
hint  if you run 2500 inventions per months it is mostlikely not ships so i mostlikely dont use decryptors 2500 decryptors
as you stated it should differ between the interfaces ccp would likely have to work out the lifespan of different interfaces
ok so your looking at 25 interfaces a monththe cost of those if there rigmodule interfaces is going to be peanuts compared to the mineralmoon goo you will save on the buildif your not doing the build but selling the bpcs then the extra margin on the build is of course reflected in the value of your invented bpcwhy do you say it would drive you nuts  are you refering to cost or the hassle of obtaining them yup this too  there no reason why high throughput interfaces rigmod couldnt take less damage than low throughput interfaces shipthe only reason for 4 is too keep some cash flowing back into exploration and too provide some differenciation in build cost between invented bpcs and t2 bpos
well i dont know if enough of them drop in eve so there wont be a shortage 
as alot of people use destroyers for salvaging and there isnt much insentive to go into t2 destroyers for anyone but those living in 00 why not make a t2 salvage destroyerthis is the ship i was thinking ofturret slots 0launcher slots 0high slots 8med slots 3low slots 4rig slots 2destroyer bonus 5 bonus to max velocity per level 5 to cargo size per levelt2 ship skill 75 bonus to salvager chance 75 bonus codebreakers and anazlyzer module access chance per levelrole bonus 100 range and velocity of tractor beamsskills neededt2 skilldestroyer lv5possible skill needed salvaging lv5race frigate skill lv5spaceship command lv5tell me your ideas on this and what could be improved i included the salvaging lv5 skill so people dont just go for the ship without going for t2 salvagers and getting a bigger bonus for less time also the destroyer could be split into different ships each giving a bonus to either salvagers codebreakers and anazlyzersedit added role bonus and increased t2 bonus from 3 to 75 because of loss of rig slot for t2 ships
sounds good
to me the idea sounds good as well but i still think salvaging should get more love by modules not ships therefore a salvager destroyer should add performance to existing modules and enhance them like a longer distance for tractor beamsalso i foresee a problem to make the salvadestroyer useless by only having 2 rig slots if you fly a salvacane or a salvamyrm with 1700m3 to 2000m3 cargo and 3 rigs you would loose 10 of a chance to get salvage at level 5 only a plus of 5 compared to a salvacane is not worth to take on the trouble loosing so much cargo unfortunately if it comes to ships you will likely get bashed to train a marauder as heard so often
good idea long overdue
its a nice idea but not supportedthe 100 tractor rangevelocity bonus needs to stay squarely in the arena of marauders or other larger specialized mission runnersas it stands this salvaging destroyer would make missioning in most hisec hubs impossible for anyone running a t1 battleshipsalvager dualboxif it was to be considered more seriously it would have to come with a paperthin tank and some changes to missiondeadspace aggression mechanics
how would this make missioning impossible in mission hubsyou cant tractor beam wrecks that you dont own
incidentally a t3 pilot with level 5 in the electronic subskill of whatever t3 ship he is flying can get a 100 bonus to rangevelocity of tractor beams also with the right module and t3 ships are considerably smaller then mauraders i would hardly consider an orca or rorqual a mission running ship alsopersonally i would love to see a ship designed for the mini professions of hacking archeology and salvaging
yep but t3 ships are very limited by expense although becoming more common and ive never even seen a ninjagriefer attempt to bug people using a rorqual or an orca  so thats a strawman at besti imagine the t2 destroyer hull being discussed here would be far more available for around 2040m
t2 bs and t3 cruisers are hundreds of millions in price a t2 destroyer is tens of millions it would seriously reduce the value of t2 bs and t3 cruiser or at least make the sub not worth buying to have a t2 destroyer with similar capabilities
t3 cruisers are already down to 300m material costs and that is buying from sell orders buy orders could cut off another few millions we are far away from the former 700m1bn
yest3 cruiser  300mt2 bs  600mt2 destroyer  30mthats what im getting at
oh i would be all for a 30m isk t2 salvage destroyer the thought of training and building a second tengu for my wh character is well daunting what with the huge  go get your 12 friends with battleships target that a t3 paints on your backside in a whso yeah a cheaper way to get the tractor beam range bonus would be freaking awesomeedit self censored word
indeed they put a developer or a whole team on trying to make this change it will take them some time to figure out how to work their forums and make this change please be patient it isnt like some of those crazy forums youve seen before on the internet where an administrator like logs in and goes into the settings to change things this is all tied up in a 7year old games code people have to be consulted and tracked down before a meeting can be held about how exactly this thing is gonna happen if in fact it can even be done man
there is just one little flaw you cant organize yourself in a human corp and have this goal topic supported if you can pay to wardec one must be able to pay not to get wardecced if you wanna fight get out to 00 and look for equal opponents not noobs in high sec
now i usually dont reply to ideas that keep carebears safe however what if there was a silent auction if corp a wardecs corp b corp be can either take it like a man ie all jump ship and make a new corp like they do or they can make a counter bid to concord if corp b elects to make a counter bid to concord corp a is given another chance to up their bribe but they do not know how much corp b is giving so whoever bribes concord the most determines whether there is a wardec or not now i like this idea mainly because it is an isk sink and an interesting one at that it gives the carebears a chance to fight back with the one weapon they have their wallets and it takes money out of the game which is always a good thing
and what is stopping you from organizing yourself into a corporation without being in a corporationor are you just being ignorantly foolsihthe corporation system is just that a system no one is stopping you from getting a band of npc pilots under a flag out of gameall it takes is a website or some sort of centralized communications platform and you got yourself a working teamthe only thing your not getting is a corp hanger the ability to drop a pos and a centeralized walletbut you get war dec immunity and you get ot do whatever it is you want to do until you feel strong enough to handle the problemshell make a 1 man corporation if you want it that bad and then go from therebut seriously people engage brain before posting please
set the fee to 10 bill a week and ill support it
the only things you have mentioned are exactly the things a corp want to have website is of course not the problemone more thing if you dont like the idea itself dont make the mistake and accuse people of beeing ignorant and neglecting brain usage doing so you end up like just demonstrated as such a person who is ignorant and not using his brain cause it does not come to your mind that one want to have exactly the features you just dismissed besides it makes you sound awfully childish oh and of course price cant be more then wardeccing itself so 10 billion is to much i am afraid
enjoy your blissful fun in high sec and let me know how it works out for youill be taking tear donations as you continue to whine and complainwhen your ready to put your brain into gear let me know otherwise keep on crying
you can pay to not get wardecd already 1 pay a merc corp to roll the corp that decd you 2 put your stuff on contract and move somewhere else where you dont have to worry about the dec anymore3 pay the ransom you most likely were asked for4 tell them to go shove it and everyone in the corp plays on alts in an alt corp for a week or two5 dissolve the corp then make a new oneyou have 5 ways to deal with wars paying ccp fake money to protect you from ebil piwats isnt going to be an option
sorry none of you suggestions are oriented on the topic from 1  5 you have been decced already the idea is not to get bothered with a wardec at all high skilled pvp people like you i guess should fight high skilled pvp people not industrials which hardly make it lvl2 mission niveausee it positive this way you would have only worthy opponents left why shouldnt it be an option you have to pay ccp fake money to declare war
im in an industrial corpindustry and pvp are synergistic you fail to comprehend this
awesome idea but a little change is needed instead of sending money to npc corp you should send it to me 1bilmonth should be enoughbtw send an offer for the wardecking corp that you surrender and pay d
lol yeah they are just totally useless and the whole point of t3 was to fly around unprobeable man this thread is stupid
even with these tricks t3 still remain less played than maraudersfor being the ccp stated versatile ships with t2 alike cost but without t2 00 alliances materials monopoly it is not really a great achievementdespite having squashed material costs on them again and againso the hidden pact comes we get a blind eye or two about some peculiar feature and you buy the ships because of thembtw a gm told me that they are aware of this ways of fitting and so far they are allowed but they reserve to change themso dont plan to necessarily sit on the luck machine forever
so waita gm told you that ccp reserves the right to rework game mechanicswas that really in doubti mean honestly did you really need a gm to tell you that ccp can change the way the game works if they want to i dont think anyone here is harboring any illusions about that point
well they can certainly put a team on it in any case p
only if it were also required that corps purchase missioning licenses ratting licenses exploring licenses market trading licenses salvaging licenses contract sellingbuying licenses and pvp licenses toosingling out one particular group of players legitimate miners for harassment in this fashion is ridiculous if you have incontrovertible proof that a given character is a macrominer report them to ccp if you have a 100 foolproof means of detecting game macros make real world  by selling it to game companies otherwise leave the miners to enjoy the game in their fashion while you enjoy the game in your own fashion
in this thread i am presenting my 3 ideas on how to improve usability of eve a bitwe all know its neededi put them all in one thread since its my believe they dont change any game mechanics but do improve the gameing experiencenr1 more dragndrop ingame make items in the market window ddable into chat windows and notes as you can do it with hangar items make hangarmarket items ddable into the search window of contractssaves alot of typeingnr2 mail groupsid like to see that ccp introduces mail groups like we have them in current mail clients like outlook and thunderbird you add contactspreferably by dragdrop into the group you can save those groups and make various of them contacts can be added without their approval mails can be sent to its members the same way as with todays mailing listsi think this makes sending one mail to many contacts a bit less tediousnr3 give corps some financial analysis tools most important give us charts and tables to categorize weeklymonthly income through taxmarketordersdonations  charts and tables with corp expenditures maybe also add the possibility to manually add data like pos fuel cost overviews of total weeklymonthly revenueprofitsthats all for now hope you like those ideas
i want this
supported i favour different hulls through bp so you have to buy new bp to make hull b c d etc and they should have some minor differences to justify the cost and physical changes ie extra weapon high more armour etc
keep in mind that as the devblog said each skin weight around 4mb for old shaders arond 253mb for new shaders and they need to be in memory cached or loaded on the fly when loading grid
i support fixing the eris to be useful in some way other than as a flying coffin the heretic needs love too making it a laser boat would be good since theres only one useful t2 small laser ship crusader so those of us that trained small lasers to level 5 for the slicer could have another ship to fly
supported i also think the heretic needs lasers rather than rockets unless ccp is willing to give all races an interdictor that doesnt have to use that races primary weapon type the heretic shouldnt be forced rockets on
i was thinking that it would be good if once a year you could pay say UFFFD1000 for to have all your assets moved to one station this would allow people to gather all there far flung assets as well as maybe speeding up the databases im sure ccp could do with the extra revinue during this time as well
lazy muchalso how would we catch all those juicy piUFFFDatas err sorry hauler if you could juts pay ccp once per year to move your stuff last but not least  you got courier contracts to move stuff aroundthat said  not supported
this
agreed if youre willing to pay real world money to move your stuff i am sure you would be willing to pay isk to accomplish the same thing right
dont care if its been brought up before new csm and i dont think this is in the wikiproposed by both astria tiphareth and rovan stargazer click on the names for relevant threadskey pointsnpc distress calls broadcasted in local or instation quick timer roughly 23 min for response can choose to assist either faction npc involved civilians or pirates etc could enhance fwpvp distress calls broadcasted in local as a warp to link would need timers and restrictions in place to prevent spamabuse would enhance the butterfly effect and also new mission runners who may end up in troublethis is not my idea but i think it could be implemented fairly easily and add a dynamic to the game that was lost when events were scrubbed
and what of the potential for spamming distress calls in local
do people even read posts anymorewould need timers and restrictions in place to prevent spamabusethere would have to be some way to prevent some person from spamming it over and over a simple 30min window would do
sounds very promising and could prove to be a very interesting dynamic to add to the game id definitely like to see ccp think about things along these lines
alliance is knocking over a system defending alliance starts dropping on top of them with x4 the numbers all pilots of the alliance that are now outnumbered hit distress as they are in distress node crashesor the classic get someone killed by mission npcs to salvage their wreck after dropping the mission
the node wont crash its the same as people spam local with fofofo and ascii art or random links nothing will changewell yeah the fact that it may be a trap is one of the appeals
no it would be like the jet can spamming that used to plague 00 to bring down a node before a towerstation could be reinforcedthis can already be done by asking can someone help me finish this mission i dont seem to have enough firepower  after having triggered all the spawns and dragged all the npcs to the warpin point some happy helpful carebear will always try to come to your rescue often will apologize that they arent able to help after youve caused their ship to explode fantastic little scam
local text and jetcans are two separate thingsagain jetcans and drones ie objects do cause lagtext in local causes the same amount of lagbut even then you can always choose to disable them then or have them off by defaultas to the scam you propose cool so whatits part of the game
i have no problem with the scam 1 if these distress beacons were added they would need to be a different overview class than other beacons beacons are usually on in pvp need to know if and where a cyno is popped if for no other reason2 if the beacons are off in pvp due to the previously stated issue people would have to switch them on once someone verbalized that they were actually under attack at which point it would have been just as easy to form a fleet3 if they are on in pve the first thing i would do and will deny this to the grave if i was fcing the gang is have all the pilots attacking the rattersminers pop distress beacons so it would make it difficult to fight back cluttered overview anything to make it easier to fight them or more specifically help the tacklers survive longer
then show standings to the one doing the distress callhas been proposed before will support again
edit forums futzed up my postits an issue as its already been laid out get 200 pilots to issue a distress call simultaneously and you get a serious problemcan you say jita  o p
would be best for the op to give a better explanation than just linking to a dozen pages of discussion if these ideas are ironed out then it seems like a good idea
preface i know this has been mentioned hundreds of times before so thus the title of my post revisit but i have not heard anything back from the csm on this and would like to know if anything is being done to move forward this very simple helpful and wanted eve featureproposal  modifying the icon pictures for most in game modules to provide graphics corner tags like t2 and t3 currently haveto elaborate t1 stay the same with no tag essentially a tag in and of itself officer items get a corner tag if you can imagine it just like t2 or t3 a little corner trianagle but instead of the t2 or t3 symbol an o standing for officer faction items ie gallente dread guristas corpus etc get a corner tag with an f in it original blueprints get a corner tag or banner tag a little rectangular box accross the top fo the icon square that says bpo or original blueprint copies get a banner tag or corner tag that says bpc or copy other tag suggestions welcomewhy you ask would someone so stupidly suggest this i say stupid because i am sure someone will try and flame the idea as seems to be the norm these days in life instead of providing constructive criticismbecause it helps when sorting your stuff making sure you identify and transfer the correct item but most importantly it saves time when it comes to the blueprints and having to right click and look at their propertiesccp made a step in the right direction with the last expansion and allowing people to look in containers from afar hows about fixing something so simple like the bpobpc and other item tags this is just good gui besides the graphics editing time ccp has to dump into it which speaking as a graphic artist myself the thousand of items this would apply to  this could be done in a matter of days by one serious working individual and more importantly again save playersthe customer thousands of hours in right click time on bpos and bpcs not to mention less heartache in other item identifying if only the time was alotted because your vote here spurs the csm and developers on thanks for your time and consideration
the only stupid thing i see is the refusal do to research as to why such ideas are refusedparticularly when its obvious your too damn lazy to search the posts for that reasonbut alas the ignorance must be blissccp has said time and time again they cannot do what you want without scrapping the database and starting overits how its mapped out when it comes ot indicating whether a bpo is a bpcyeseveryone and there mother would like it but it aint going to happenso stupidly asking for it for the billionth time will not make it happen any sooner or any later for that matter
ccp can fix the bpobpc issue  it would just be a lot of work for themcurrently they dont seem to feel that the effort involved is worth the payoffso every week up to 50000 players have to make extra effort with bpcbpo segregationthe scale of the problem and the number of people it negativelly affects does justify a fix imo even if it is a lot of unattractive grind for the devs there are spare fields in the inventory table that could be utilised iircfor example stack sizebpcs items are allways singletonssingletons do not use the stacksize field for inventory itemstherefore if the stacksize is used to indicate runs remaining on the bpc it would be possible for the assetsitems windows in the client gui to identify bpcs correctlysingleton stacksizeyes0 asssembled item or bpono0 not used atmyes0 bpc with stacksize  runs remaining this is unused atm no0 unassembled items or unresearched bpo stackof course this is a quick and dirty and would introduce lots of bugs that would need to be hunted down but it might be preferable to a database structure change that would require a substantial rewrite of a lot of the codeanyways whether its a database structure change or a quick and dirty bpobpc differentiation is one of the most requested features in eve so maybe the csm should get tough and stop taking no for an answer
under the assumption that mining is a viable profession at least it says so in documentation then removing the insurance fraud system would create a situation where minerals plummet in value due to the massive overproduction of minerals that currently exists so miners would make less isk margins would shrink on manufactured goods etcwhat wouldnt happen is missioners being impacted due to the payouts from missions remaining roughly the samenow if youd link the mission payouts to the mineral index then everyone would feel the same amount of pain and all would be good as it is a single player can make more isk missioning rather than mining although i can easily run 3miners  orca as one player but i cannot be as efficient missioning so the isk hit from each account being less efficient is made up from the multiple accountswhy does that matter fact is there are many players running multiple accounts just for mining completely trash mining as a profession then those players will either 1 cancel accounts or 2 quit playing what emorage nah i pay for my extra accounts via plex if plex cannot pay for them and make additional isk profit then those accounts will go away and ccp makes less real money pretty sure im not the only player with that thought processi do not currently engage in insurance fraud i do like it much better than an npc buying raw goods at least with insurance fraud you have to work at it by getting then researching a bpo spend time blowing up your stuff and acquiring the raw minerals that you may be lacking from your current mining exploits you make slightly under market anyway from bs fraudas the number of players increases in eve then demand for minerals will increase and the problem will solve itself as ship prices increase that is unless more players just want to mine
the mineral price is a another problem yes you will get more miners if the player base is growing mining ist popular and the prices going down that is the sandbox adapt or die but that is not my problem i want solve the problem that the current insurance system is awfull because its a problem for the free marked
whether you intended to or not what your post is saying is that effectively eve has more miners than its pvp population require this situation has arisen because of the long term distortion of the mineral economy caused by t1 ship insurancein short miners have been addicted to npc buy orders and now theyre faced with going cold turkey and competing in the player economysome people will retire their mining alts many more people will still need their isk making alt to make isk so theyll respec those alts in to invention or production or research or ratting or whatever until the economy rebalances
nice pic so how is it you get the snaz new scorp model months ahead of schedule or is that already seeded on sisi havent logged there in months
since the latest expansion they have fixed the aspect ratio problem i was experiencing with my triplehead2go setup 3x1680x1050 screens eve running at 5040x1050 is truly the only way eve should be played ill be sure to slap some pics here when the eyefinity 6 edition comes out i got the 6 screens ready to go just need the card now hopefully it will just work out of the box
threaddamn i needed that laugh
yeah that was a very disappointing outcome especially after we stressed that faction warfare is in many ways a stepup for new players to pvp and lownullsec

doh fixed
reallyeven leaving that out the problem of those missions is that they are ill thought ans made in a way that scream easy targets here for all you pvp guys no one like to be the cannon fodder for the enjoyment of other people even less if they have to pay for that
hey dont get me wrong if something is broken it should be fixed but pottseys concern of being pushed into pvp situations is rather silly given that this is eve
sokratesz said hey dont get me wrong if something is broken it should be fixed but pottseys concern of being pushed into pvp situations is rather silly given that this is eveits not silly if you look into it sending big slow pve setup battleships 15jumps for a 30jump round trip all to the same system is not fair or right no matter where you are in gallante space the new missions send you to the same system as all the pve people are sent to the same spot there is a massive pirate camp at the gates if we are setup for pvp we cannot do the missions if we are setup for pve we die to the camp not to mention the problem of 30plus boring jumps in a battelship all that for no reward pve people are not pvp people and we are not bait so the pvp people have easy targets pushing pve people into pvp is not only flat out wrong but its a good way to make all the pve people quit the game if we wanted to do pve mixed with pvp we would join faction warfare i would also question how pvp is the driving force of the economy considering how few people do pvp and lose ships it wouldnt surprise me if more ships are lost in pve then pvpeve is not a pvp only game a large amount of the player base do not to combat pvp and have no interest in combat pvpedit in my mind ccps biggest mistake it to try and push to many pve people into pvp things like that can kill games if ccp role out the gallante changes to all races i bet a large amount of people quit
great so we agree that it is broken and needs fixing the pvppve discussion isnt even part of this
fixed it for youalso how do pvpers maintain the price of lp and highend loot if 99 of pvpers dont fit factionmeta4 stuff on their shipsi think if less of it got evaporated the price of it might fall to a level that would make factionmeta4 items viable on pvp fits as for the price of faction gear that is also artificially kept higher than its real value due an artificial price floor created by isk costs for certain lp store itemsso no pvpers dont do squat to keep the economy going in fact because of insurance they do more harm than good another thing to note is that a healthy economy will see a slight rise in prices every year in eve prices either fluctuate more than a bouncing ball on crack or they slowly declineso either there are way too few people loosing ships which is supposedly what happens when you pvp or your theory about pvpers keeping the economy healthy doesnt hold any stockeither way i dont see any new mechanic implemented to force pvpers to do 10 jumps in pve fitted ships to an area surrounded by rats in addition to having no other form of protection so i dont see why pveers should be forced in to unreasonable pvp situations in all fairness its not balancedthe equivalent to pirates would be that from now on 10 pirates need to make 20 jumps through highsec every time they loose a ship and while in highsec theyd be considered ffa the pod but not be allowed to shoot back
are we playing the same game
i believe that was at fanfest maybe it was only a font guy and not a typography expertis there a chance this most valuable staff member has been sitting idle eating donuts waiting to be given the job of fixing the most important issue in the gamemaybe theyve been working on designing fonts for expansion youtube trailers
yes
yes
the eve font is terrible it coulf definitely use being revisited
i do not care about csm and i like this idea assault ships are meh nowadays everyone is using faction frigsi say either give em another bonus or give em an extra module slot
i also approve i like them mighty good and do think they could be betterhowever an ishk boost might not be fair that ship is good as is
when are you jumping the jf full of minerals to our home base dude or do you not look at material amounts are you one of the minerals are free crowd do you get minerals spawned in your hangars or are you really dumb if an apoc needs only 7 mil trit in comparison to 10 mil trit for a rokh guess which one is going to get built that is what makes or breaks the deal hype suffers from the same cost issue its just that caldari are stuck with the rokh for any kind of sniping and thus the problem is more acute for themyaay i am sorry to inform you that you did not answer any question you just demonstrated your ignorance and shortsightednessyou obviously fail to understand what is the issue here its not bs fits or hac fits its not gallente or caldari fitting requirements even thought the shortcomings in that area make the ws even harder to deal with its weapon balance and the fact that amarr have been op for too long matari caught up to them and rails are left back in the dust if you need to invest more in minerals and fittings to get the same performance between the races there is a disparityif you cant wrap your head around that and you think that fitting faction and expensive named items will solve the problem please contract such items to me in game isk donations in the bils are just as good thoughdo you really think that proposing a rigged bs that costs twice as much as the rest of the other bs show that there is balance between weapon systems is it the fact that you havent flown a gallente or caldari railboat that makes you shortsighted or are you afraid that the amarr boats you fly will not be that op if rails get boosted
it doesnt cost 2x as much quit saying it does if you are having logistical issues thats a totally different problem not costheres a good thought you can fit about 20 hypes in a freighter or about 8 in a jump freighter a few runs and you have enough to last your boys a while unless you just really suck and lose ships a lot if youre really packing minerals i believe it jumps to about 50 bs worth of hyperions in a freighter wtf is your alliance doing to lose more than 50 of one racial bs a monthyou cant argue that a ship isnt worth the isk because its hard to build you still get the same 0 sum gainloss once insurance is paid based on jita mineral cost as you would a tier 2 or tier 1 that fitting i popped up had no faction on it so where that comment came from is beyond any logic i can think ofi dont fly gallente right now because ranged warfare in general is dead bs ranges are far more practical in the 5070km ranges which suits amarr and minmatar better this is a result of the increase in bombers and the overpowered nature of rr platforms if you want to argue that blasters need a serious boost fine youd be totally right about thatbut i have flown gallente quite often in the past and i really do like the hyperion for ranged fleets the point is you cant boost rail damage and think thats going to solve this problem youre stating is a problem its just going to bork the system in some other way just as it has the past gazillion times the devs have tried it with a gun platformthe rokh is what it is change the ship stats if you dont like it but dont change the rails because 1 ship doesnt perform well with them when it comes to dps most other ships fall in line quite well whether you see it or not
i said nothing about the apoc being more cap stable but your argument is that cap stability doesnt matter anyway so i really dont understand your point also with max related skills i run low on cap in big fleet fights flying ships that are cap stable without mwd running due to the constant short warps would be my guess having a hard time understanding how a ship without boosters that lasts only a few minutes just firing its guns would survive very long in a fight unless it spends a lot of time hiding in safe spotsyour weapon of choice now is lasers back in your bob days you were flying with hybrids you stopped using them but are trying to claim they are on par unless of course you realized hybrids are inferior to lasers and prefer the inequality over balance i really cant blame you as i did the same thing the difference being i would prefer hybrids to be fixed rather than left as the fools weapon of choice
i use lasers because i use pulses which are mid range weapons that gallente just dont have thats more an issue with blasters than it is with rails blame rr fits and the pulses if youre going to go down that road as for the harbinger i use it more because the brutix is incredibly terrible on fittings i use the absolution more because the passive boost to hp is more useful in most fights than the active tank of a rail astarte and i hardly ever use close range weapons on a t2 command ship unless i fly a sleipnir which i hardly ever fly because the hurricane is so damn good for way less moneyas for the capacitor the hype has enough to last for more than an entire clip of ammo assuming this game has flaws omg impossible no gun every fires exactly at its intended rof in fleet lag even when its better than post dominion it only takes 1 second of delay between shots for the capacitor to be stable you also have 10 seconds at least of delay every 40 rounds of ammo which again builds your cap back upif youre using your mwd your goal is almost always to escape a situation and warp out no bs fit is cap stable with mwd on for fleet combat almost every fleet sniper bs fit has about 1 min 30 seconds or there abouts with its mwd on no competent fleet fit maker is going to worry about the mwd issue
looks at blueprints looks at faceless alt considers which one is rightif you need to procure more minerals to build a ship it costs more time to gather the resources is not free isk is not an issue nor logistics however if we jump a freighterload of minerals why not optimize their use why not make the more out of it why build 20 hypes and not 35 apocs since you know 20401 8020 while 35370 12950yep sure is no fleet fights are happening keep believing it
it doesnt matter if you do not have pilots to fly them if youre just telling me youre lazy fine youre lazy thats not a reason to avoid the hype some of us do the work and reap the rewardsif this is the logic you are using to balance ships seriously thank god youre not a dev
yaay you are so wrongcap stability mattersit can run out in ordinary fights especially when you shoot structures which is part of snipe bs role no matter what you thinkstupid hybrids need ammo too not like op lasers which can be fine with some m3 never ending crystalsbut hey according to you it is balanced somehowoh and usually you warp in off regularly in a balanced fight you have to use mwd to spread out and get out of bubbleshybrid ships runs out of cap even fasteroh and if you are low on cap and still need to mwd because your fleet just warp out then game over for ucostyeah tier 3 cost as much as tier 2 if you buy it insure and loose it before insurance is over most of my battleships havent blowen up before insurance is over  tier 3 costs a lot more than tier 2you know the point is not to loose your ship usually oh and if your corp produces the battleships which imho most 00 allience do who happen to be the only ones using sniper battleships strange isnt it tier 3 needs more minerals  less ships can be built from the same amount as for tier 2 battleshipslagoh there is a lag so you cant run out of capwohooo but suddenly refire delay lowers hybrids dpslets calculate with real datasassume a 1 sec delay between repeats assume 20sec reload delaywithout lag statshyperion 2110 alpha526 sec 402dps 40ammoclip with reload 4021104052610sec383dpsrokh 1736alphalol5108sec 340dps 40ammoclip with reload 324dpsabaddon 3453 alpha688 sec 501dps assume unlimited with reload 501 dpsapoc 2841 alpha688 sec 412dps assume unlimited with reload 412 dpsmaelstrom 6737 alpha1591sec 423dps 20ammoclip with reload 20673720159110sec410 dpshmm even now hyperion is below the rest rails suxwith laghyperion 2110 alpha626 sec 337dps 40ammoclip with reload 4021104062630sec301dpsrokh 1736alphalol6108sec 284dps 40ammoclip with reload 253dpslool crapabaddon 3453 alpha788 sec 438dps assume unlimited with reload 438 dps apoc 2841 alpha788 sec 360dps assume unlimited with reload 360 dpsmaelstrom 6737 alpha1691sec 398dps 20ammoclip with reload 20673720169130sec366 dpsyou see in laggy situations hybrids is even worse because their low rof time lag affects them morelast nail in the coffinammo use during half hour of shooting amarr 0m3hybrids 82m31800sec40526s10s16m3clip818clip fired131m3 auchprojectiles 805m31800sec201591s10s 454822m3so this show hybrids usually run out of ammo during ops my experience confirms this keep in mind you have to bring more than one type of ammo i usually bring 5 typesso i ask you these stats are real you can check it yourself do you still think hybrid guns are balancedthe fits werent included due to space issue
i think youre proving the point that blame is in areas other than a raw damage boost lower capacitor needs lower pgcpu needs double the clip size all three of those would bring it more in line with what you just pointed outi never said they were balanced i said im not a fan of a direct damage boost being the balance they needif you do what the op says well see a hyperion at nearly 490 dps and its just going to become the new flavor of the week until ing generates another damage boost somewhere else
exactly what do you guys think will happen on this forum if hybrids gets boosted i hope your not so dumb that you think that the projectile whines wont come back in full force all over the places hereif we boost hybrids then we are back to the projectile whines im 100 sure about thatand not only that when lasers first of all is overpowered then why boost railguns to something that is overpoweredhello jesus christ dont be stupidbut im all in for making the railguns easier to fit some some caldari ships and other gallente ships that have powergrid issues
people dont realize that at one point in time 300 dps was considered a lot for a bs usually it was average of 280 for a sniper fit from all the blancing the devs have tried with raw dmg boost were now up to 400 dps on bs and still theyre not considered balanced obviously damage boosting isnt working
then why not just rebalanced all weapons i also think that railsblasterslasers should also be able to wider variety of damages emthermexplosive lasersthermkineticexplosive railsthe ratio of damages would vary depending upon particle stream and or materials usedcurrently missiles and projectiles are the only ones that can pick which damage type they want to use course this is super advanced scifi based game why not push the boundaries farther with rail gun ammo that acts like projectile ammo this new form of rail would always do kinetic damage  another form depending upon type of new ammo that paralells projectile types
which is why were obviously not agreed a straight damage boost is a good idea but on the other hand the figures dont lie and clearly railguns are the bottom of the heap in terms of how much firepower they can bring to a targethow do you fix this without bringing in a damage boostlowering pg or cpu requirements will do absolutely nothing to fix this because fitting more broken weapons to my ship doesnt change or negate the fact that they still suck and will keep sucking no matter how many of them im able to use at once nor will their damage profile improve dependent on how many more unrelated modules im able to fit on the platform that carries themassuming ccp decided tomorrow to make the damage output of all weapons systems equal thus eliminating that argument from the equation completely how would they go about maintaining a flavor for each weapon system without overly breaking one of them because even if you nerfed everything back into the 300dps bracketrailguns would still suck due to tracking need to reload and limited damage profilethe combination of moving the armor hole from thermal to explosive really didnt help their case either this is before my time  but i heard it mentioned occasionallyso can we please try to think of a solution to the problem that does not involve overpowering the weapons nor involves ineffective changes to fitting statistics that will do nothing to alter their lackluster ingame behavior
thats why you trained amarr instead of flying hypesplease stop lying to yourself if hype was the op ship you talk about fleets would be composed of it however all i see in fleets are apocs pest and megas for the people that havent skilled amarr yet your doing eft warrioring and not considering the complete picture fyi for the 401 dps hype there is the 446 dps tach abaddon which costs roughly the same so throwing numbers around without looking at the underlying structure and relations is totally bulli see people yapping this is not the way to do it you are trying to make the railguns op blahblahblahdo you realise that even with 15 damage increase rails will do less dps than the equivalent laser boats how does that make them op maybe i am not a dev but i can see where there is a glaring imbalance and have a proposal to fix it what is your counterproposalif you can come with a better way to fix the railgun problems which are universally accepted low damage high cap consumption huge fitting requirements small clip slow reload bad tracking without making them lasers please do the math and propose a solution
for god sake how many times does it have to be said look at the ship fits theyre all pulses pulses  blasters for fleet work it has nothing to do with rails use some common sensefittings equate to a damage boost if you can fit a 4th mag stab in place of a rcu on any sniper bs its about a 6 damage boost if the player so choosesyou can also change clip size change cap use change tracking and whatever else all of which do not require a direct damage boost all of which benefit the ships performance in fleet why dont you instead argue about why sniper combat is nearly dead in this game rr is taking over and thats a much bigger issue than youve made rails to be
omg why everyone wants to compare railguns to tachyons its completely wrong because noone takes into account their huge fitting requirements so you need to fit only 7 guns to fit it for pvp not for eftwarrior mode also i loled at this tachyons armageddons as kind of arguments  ok go fit and try to fly itthe only thing you may compare to railguns are megabeamshigh cap consumption you say try to fly abaddon maybe youll want than to fit artillery or even railguns on it insteadtracking  isnt this 375 tracking bonus on megathron enoughdont forget that the balance is not just the numbers in 2 different modules  its much more completely concept that affects all the ships parameters their bonuses and modules they can fit toanyway blasters really need more love its all fine with the railguns
has anyone associated with ccp acknowledged the problem with hybrids anyone know if they are even thinking about this problem
lol so you want to tell ppl what they can use for their ships and what notamarr can fit and use tachyons so why shouldnt we compare it to megarokh fitted with 425mm rails hmmeven if it need more pgcpu apoc can be fitted with them and doing so it will be much better than any megarokh fit what comes from it  railguns are not fineneed a boostjust look at my post it is clear evidence that rails lack huge dps compared to their disadvantagesa 15 dps boost would just bring them onto the same lvl as amarrmatar atm it would still have many disadvantagesno lowering fitting is not an option it wont make them more worthy to be used like the lower tier guns hell nobody uses them why because they have crap dpsrange no matter how easy to fit themthey needs an usable role where they are favoured over the beamsartiesyaay strange where i fly we use mostly sniper fleets not some stupid rr ones which can be killed by a sniper hac fleet easily
have you read the thread nobody is comparing rails to tachs the comparisons were made between the ships used as snipers sporting weapon systems that they were designed for using same class moduleswhen comparingapoct2 mega beams pestt2 1400mm megarokht2 425mmandzealott2 heavy beams munnin t2 720mm eagledeimos t2 250mmusing 3x damage mods on each ship it was shown that railguns are producing on average 15 less damage output than the other ships at the same rangeplease read the thread before you try to be a smartass about tachyons and abaddons ok
sorry yaay couldnt help but point out your change in weapon preference the reason being both types of hybrids have been nerfed to hell and back i remember once upon a time when railguns were worth fitting i remember once upon a time when blasters were so good they were op as opposed to never used because they are crap my point is and i think you would agree now that projectiles are actually useful hybrids need to be reviewed and made useful again as well but not op i think there is enough evidence to show that hybrids are less than similar fits across the board in the end it is ccp who makes the decision on how to balance them so they are once more useful having seen and experienced the change to projectiles i trust ccp to find and make a useful niche for hybrids to fill that has some bearing in combati also agree with your point about rr combat however it isnt something new i think it may have more to do with an inability to play the my fleet has longer range than you and will be able to stay out of reach while popping your ships game that had been the strength of snipers for so long part of this change may be attributed to the introduction of logistics and triage modules making defense so strong that snipers are incapable of picking off ships in the other fleet i understand the attempt ccp was making to create longer battles but theyve sidelined snipers in the process to resurrect snipers they need to be heavy alpha slow rof similar to what any form of longrange combat is irl this is part of the reason i had suggested that a way to fix rails would be a large boost to alpha even if it kept dps as is
supported for rebalancing railguns and possibly reevaluating caldari gunboats
thats what im talking about youre just comparing 2 numbers in one class called rawdamagefromguns completely forgetting about another ship abilitieseagle it can shoot up to 200 with rails nor zealotmunin can do and you want to add damage to it think twicedeimos yes this one is poor in sniper role but it has 50m3 dronebaynor zealotmunin has and this ship ability can be used in some other way adding damage bonus just to guns and keeping all other things will outbalance ships in different ways so well see another whine thread again in the future
its obvious that you havent read the thread but you feel compelled to just throw random stuff in the conversationstop being lazy and spew inanities i am not going to repeat my self its 2 pages back in black and white go read it
i have posted fits for both apoc and abaddon that easily work with tachyons people dont use them for the previously stated decline of sniper capability in fleet warfare and the previous need for dd resitant fits amarr ships trumped all with 3x dd proof  150km range  300 dps abaddon fits incidentally 425 rails have higher cpu requirements that eat up low slots in a similar way to the tachs but even when snipers were good and even if they were to magically return rails  beams what are fleet compositions now amarr  minmatar  gallente  you will be primaried by your own fleet if you bring caldari gc fc and im confident he is not the only one to say thisyou bring up the tracking bonus of the megathron even with the bonus the mega has less tracking than apocabaddon since you bring up bonuses and energy weapon cap consumption apoc but really i was doing cap logi last night in a fleet and was receiving as many requests for cap from the megas as the apocs only saw 1 abaddon who needed cap the others seemed to be fine with their enormous hold full of 800s had one douche in a sieged nag who kept asking for cap in any event megas or tachs top damage went repeatedly to amarr and minmatar with megathrons hypes and some rokhs way down the listi repeat this is not balanced
hyperion is a blaster shhip so i would expect it to be inferior at sniping somewhat in ym opinion problem is in the ships capabilities not the guns the fitting parameters on both rokh and hype make me cry
that will work also lets have match target course and speedalso related idea here

loot drop is just another feature and dimension part of the game and that you fight for if it was a reward for killing a ship it would just appear in your cargo with you being declared the rightful owner to that loot but it doesnt when the loot drops it still shows as the victim being the owner this isnt the game you think it is where you get prizes for completing a task you have to fight for it tooth and nail so please do htfu
hey so this annoyed me yesterday  again someday im going to need to pull those battleships out of the ass end of nowhere come on ccp  let me contract them to my alts or alliance matesliang
if this was done then said contracts need to show as damaged big bright red leters at the top of the contract and players need an option to not show damaged contractsbut i dont actualy see this as the problem the problem being there is no way to trade things to an alt character other then contracts or having them both on and at the same stationfix the ability to alow players to trade to one another regardless of what station they are at or weather both parties are on at the same time this could be done with an option like a friends list a trade list when you add some one to it they can trade items to you and said items will drop into the station bay from wich the trade was made fromand ccp there does need to be a list or some players will trade a single piece of ammo to random people at a thousand different stations just for fun
with these options it is more then reasonable

as discussed here clone costs  punishing veterans for continuing to play their mainthe linked thread has many pointscounterpoints foragainst the idea many voiced better than i can put in this post so i would suggest a review of it the oldest most dedicated and supportive ranks of the player base seem to almost be punished just for being dedicated to their main charactersthe cost for clones seem to scale at a higher than linear almost exponential rate for a reason ive yet to find simply arbitrarily one could say clone costs scale at a seemingly unfair and illogical ratei cannot see how this serves either ccp the players or the health of the game overall and this could be lack of imagination on my partit almost restricts older characters from flying some of the more fun ship classes who takes a 40mil clone out it in a 15mil ship why should you face such a mandatory high penalty for pvp loss there are other insinuatedassociated penalties discussed loss in pvp is essential im not suggesting otherwise these losses present themselves effectively and in a balanced manner through ship costs rigs fitting combat implants etc making the justification for current clone costs questionablewarning needless sob rhetoric ahead this is eve it should be harsh i really hope im not coming across as looking for a handout to oldest players without further clarification from ccp it seems the current clone cost scale seems to be more of a kick of sand to the face rather than a pat on the back or at the least a fair deal vs the lower clone tiers one could view it as needless penalty for sticking around after years of continued support and continuing to play their main chars

i agree that the higher end clones seem to be too expensive however an asymptotic cost curve is dumb i think we should just scale it linearly at the end and make it 5million sp per 1million isk clone cost instead of the 31 ratio as it is currently
this at least seems fair enough but i do not want to see cheap assed clones at very high spsthe last thing we need is an isk explosion because you can die more frequently  o p

not supported its tough enough to come in as a new player as it is given you have to either roll specialized alts or spend over a year to train into anything remotely competent given the way the training system works youre almost better buying a 1yr sub in advance training up a character and then learn how to play the game rather than ing around for months unable to compete because you simply cant fly anything worthwhile when everyone around you is zipping about in hacs and capitalsthe high clone costs are one of the few balancing mechanisms to make using high sp characters less attractive and allowing new players and low sp chars to be even remotely competitive unless of course your goal is to stop new people playing the game and have it die the slow death of dwindling playerbasetheres a fine balance between making a game challenging and making it so frustrating nobody will bother playing it
you whathow on earth does reducing the cost of high skill point characters clones make new players quityour a fine one to bleat the industrialist that doesnt pvp we arent talking about carebears who never get into harms way but people who enjoy a bit of pew pew and you dont qualify your input is void we could all hole up in a factory slot or whatever and run when a new red enters system or is that what you are suggesting
ok so you play for years and havent figured out some of the x ways to semipassively make money in eve
the current clone cost system seems unjustified from a pure gameplay perspective ive read a few of these threads and havent heard one good reason for them so unless ccp has a reason for it that hasnt been mentioned yet the costs on high sp count should be made more reasonable
so what your saying is you dont have time to make isk and would rather prefer to be able to freely blow stuff up and die many times and not worry about affording to pay for your cloneyeah makes sense must suck to be a horrid pilot in eveguess what nothing in game even in life is free let alone cheapadapt or die lesskeep it coming ill need an another container for your tearsand before you blow off your smartass mouth again we are subject to the same penalties and costs you are we can die just as often as you can so please grow up and stop using pathetic excusesyou have no excuse at that age and at that rate you should be able to make enough isk to pay for your measly clone pa the tic
if you cant afford a high sp clone then dont buy oneyou will lose some skill points when podded next enabling you eventually to use a lower skilled cheaper cloneyou may have to retrain some stuff that you lose and needif you want the advantage of a high sp char then expect it too cost you  like any other expensive shipmod in evenothing is broken hereo and also stop sucking so much and stop dying it really helps with clone costs

not supported in its current formi support the general idea that the price scaling is wrong and making higher sp chars more risk averseproblem with original postit lists what you can concede is a problem but where one would expect at least a proposed solutionchange it is not even sketched out what should happenas such you are abusing the proposal tag in the subject line and it seem appropriate to file it as unconstructive complaintplease draft a proper proposal there is likely plenty of support out there if you bother to do it right
its not a question whether you can make enough money it is a question why should you be forced to make enough money and there is not reason therefore i support this proposal
not supportedif you have 40 mil sp and you are still trying to figure out how to avoid losing your pod you need to be punished
dont fly a pod if youre high sp and dont grind like a wow playerinteresting position if youre a cheap player whos been playing for a long time then according to drake you should never undockthis is about balacing it so the pilot has the choice of flying small ships if they so desireas for pilot skill and losing pods heard of lag
cripes stop training skills that dont help you make isk learn to make more isk and stop being a whineror pause your uber costly main and train one of your alts to fly small ships and die when you want to be in a small ship
so once again only low sp characters are allowed to fly small ships with any degree of efficiencywhat is the reasoning behind high sp characters being pushed away from small ships

while my base clone cost is still cheap i can see this is a problem opposed to people saying oh no the vets have so much already a vet shouldnt be locked out of flying many classes of ships or be forced into more carebearing for the same lossotoh maybe this is ccps way of saying that more experienced players should leave 00 for lowsec where the real pvp happens 
i like the idea it would seem its more a matter of server side logistics since each station gets a new database written it couldnt hurt to ask the devs about it and get an official response one way or the otheralso stations cant be destroyed what would stop 00 space from becoming littered with outposts into the future
i too would like to see this happen since the change of the sov systemthis might also make it more attractive for attacking parties to go after certain systems which ends up within the riskreward balance dropping 3 stations in one system per example will make it easier for your alliance however it also makes it a prime target for your enemywhat id also like to see in time is more customization of stations for example having several stations of the same faction with a few changes across the board and different 3d models for each also what id like to see is that when a station has been upgraded that the materials dont mysteriously vanish into the station but make physical changes yes modular stations
what prevents that happening right now  is there that big difference from the littered with outposts perspective if there is 1 2 or 3 stations in system you can already put one station in every system you own as far as im aware most big alliances have plans to do that in fact put one station in every single system they claim sov in in my opinion main preventing factor is cost  after you have 2 to 4 stations in system why would you want more  the population density a 00 system can support is finite as resources in the system are finite there is only so many people you can stick inside anomaly before you run into dimishing returns so at some point you have to ask if you would want one more station or would for example one more supercarrier or titan serve you better second quite relevant reason to ask for lifting of this constraint is in fact the inability to remove stations i would like to be able to remove stations even if it would take months and considerable effort and cost currently if some dumb person has built caldari station its deathtrap btw kickout style in strategically important location you are stuck with it if the constraint is lifted you can just ignore the crap that previous owners of the space have installed and do that properly make sure that your station undock point is in line with moon where you can dump death star and all the small things that count i would be asking for option to remove stations from your space also but it has been already asked many times and devs have stated that they cant or do not want to do that
if it can be combined with a change to sovereignty mechanics to minimize the prevalence of moarblob  all so that warfare actually becomes good fights and fun for everyonewithout such a change adding stations will just act as golden parachutes for kickersofsandcastles or whomever else is the first to make a 1k fleetwar is good and can be fun but if mechanics keep being tilted towards kicking the castles over building them the game loses valueattractionever since bob ran over ascn all of 00 has been engaged in a perpetual escalation leaving no room for the builders  this is the direct reason for the capitalsupercapital spam and to a lesser degree the blobbing we are seeing todayequal opportunity allow building to hold as much value as destroying
this has already happened look at delve providence deklein feythabolis tribute
could you explain why this is neededthe only reason i can see is easier logistics between different outpost types or we want to have more than one outpost type without the increased sov costsfor the logistic part i would answer more targets on the logistic routes which is goodfor the 2nd part  i would answer you want variations pay the costsso why do you want it
immersion empire building industrial might  reasons to ask for it are many and having station in system does nothing to sov cost currently btw ihub upgrades determine the sov cost  if you use the system you will have them and you pay for them system without ihub upgrades on the other hand is relatively worthless as it has only rare complex or anomaly and belt ratting is history after one can do it in l5 military upgraded system i have noticed that people for some reason seem to think that building a station in system makes the sov cost go up it does not logistics routes dunno  perhaps in those alliances space that lack proper organization in my part of space we do not use gates in non combat ships there is this thing called jump bridge goes from one death star pos to another death star pos up to 5 ly away and proper intel channels also ofc one must be taking unreasonable risks if he manages to get killed in non combat ship in properly organized alliance space and building second station in same system would be paying the cost about 22  25 bil or so in fact depending how deep you live and thus how big is your transportation cost for the egg  contents
i support this idea
well most people upgrade their station systems and iirc jump bridges are sov index 4 and cost quite a bit so either you are lying with the upgades or you use gates 
maybe its downt to the fact that not every low sec and empire system has a station whereas in 00 you can build a station in every system if you so wish maybe thats the compromise tbh do i support it yes and no but there isnt many stations being built anyway so the impact of allowing multiples in a system i dont seem would be large so i guess ill support itbut i think it should be limited to say no more than 2
only reason i can think is ccp wants to spread the player base out so forcing one per 00 system  perhaps the alliances should work to making every sytem in 00 have an outpost and then see what ccp does
im not one for the roleplay side but in eve we are all wealthy and our alliances are sometimes ever bigger then the empire allianceswhy cant we show our power by having multiple stations if we are to show off our welth i see this as a good way to go about itperhaps make the stations destructable if theres more then 1 station in the system tho i see no reason against having a capture stationdestroy station button would be a good idea i thinkand the owners should have a self destruct button to stop hostile take over of their stations tho the reason for having the indestructable stations is probably to stop the loss of assets a simple disclaimer should solve thatand ofcourse the industrial benifits are great
what elements of the ui do you dislike the only point of discomfort i have with industry takes place when dealing with the inevitably large amount of bpos and bpcs that accumulate i would like the selection of which physical copy removed and replaced with the a clean sort by typewhat stops someone from building a battleship in any station they want to already it would be a tall order to do that on clone jumps considering you have to wait a day between those jumps you could get more done faster by making and then distributing bpcs which is done anyway since copying jobs get their own lab slots and it is more secure bringing us back to my first point that reasonable players already eliminate risk of theft with their gameplayyou also assume an abundance of minerals and free factory slots in all those locations if the material for a galaxy spanning armada is already in place why do you believe that it wouldnt be just as easy to setup the blueprints for those factories to churn out ships into the distant future and even so there are plenty of opportunities to get those ships destroyed which is where most of the fun in this game happens anyway is this genuinely something you think would happen but is kept in check by messy blueprint hangars
then you already have it kind of switch to list view use filters not that your imaginary server would look any different knowing ccpif by clean sort by type you mean distinguishing bpos from bpcs it is desired by literally everybody and as such discussed a zillion times in last years ccp said they would like to have that too but were pretty adamant it is impossible due to technical reasons search before posting devising some imaginary servers is irrelevant here as it not help by any means problem is underlyingsame goes for presenting list of bpc detailsso getting stripped of ui issues we are left with pure desire to save bpos from hauling dangersno
not supported seems like youd just make blueprints and being limited to a single installation less likely so long as one obtained the proper mineralsmaterials and research would then not require the bpo be movedid support a bpo organization system or db that can be located at any station you can place bps so i dont have to scroll through them all in my inventory but rather have a different bp database i put them intothink special bp hangar they could be removed from that dbhangar for metepe or copying and transport but in general youd store them there for ease of use use would still require the bp be at the facility you want to use it would just be a way to not have hundreds of bps sitting in your items hangar to dig through with a better bp interface showing meterunscopyoriginal etc

selfdestruct timers are based on ship class according to the followingcapital 5 minutesbattleship 3 minutesbattle cruisers 2 minutescruisers 1 minutefrigatedestroyer 30 secondsselfdestructing issues a loss mail to the pilot that was in the ship and issues a kill mail to the nonnpc pilot that did the highest damage to said ship if it was being agressedbig things make nice boom when selfdestructingwhen you selfdestruct in a battleship or larger ship a wave of damage like a smart bomb goes of inflicting damage to everything within its blast range any security hits from such a blast are applied battleship blast is equivalent to its racial t2 large smart bomb in range and damage ie megathron selfdestructing would cause 300 thermal damage to everything within 6km pirate issued battleships that require two races to be able to pilot would cause a blast from each races version of a t2 large smartbomb ie vindicator selfdestructing would cause 300 thermal and 300 explosive damage to everything within 6km all nonsuper capitals would do double the damage and double the range of a t2 large smart bomb from its race ie moros selfdestructing would cause 600 thermal damage to everything within 12km all super capitals would do quadruple the damage and quadruple the range of a t2 large smart bomb from its race ie erebus selfdestructing would cause 1200 thermal damage to everything within 24km all other ships do not have any damage done to its surroundings when selfdestructing no smart bomb effect upon selfdestuct if within 5km of a station or gate

updated op and supporting my proposal
curious regarding the missing parts hereseems fairly specific and has a cover all clausesupport it even more so if ccp can introduce it in some stealthy patching way with no notes prepare for ramming speed
i was about to make a comment about aoe in empire however the only ship class with aoe damage is a bs and its only 1 smartbombs worth of damage added with the timer and it is very unlikely able to be abused however in the case that an aoe destruct affects a neutral party in empire the sec loss should be applied as if a smartbomb hitalso all mods and cargo should still die self destructing is also a valid tactic to prevent those mods from ending up in enemy handsotherwise supported
i can see it nowa horde of battleships sding in jitanot supporting until its improved and completed  o p
he is talking about when i first made post hours ago and it posted without any info
if you would know the history of the original posting hint  look at the time of my posting and the time of the last edit the original posting was broken
part 1 i dont care so much about the timers if something selfdestructs before you get the killmail move on try to get the next onepart 2ok i self destruct my raven outside jita 44 a hauler undocks and gets killed by your proposed explosiona do i get gccb does the pilot get kill rightsand yes you are not the first person with that suggestionlast but not least  2 proposals merged into 1 are bad
updated op with this in mind sound better
if they pop something in empire they have to get gcc and you cant pop a hauler with only 300 damage itll likely pop a tackler or frigate though honestly when things blow up they should be damaging stuff near them anyway or they really arent blowing up are they
a yesb yesi guess i could have split them but i didnt want to spam assembly hall with related proposals it is more of a revision of selfdestruct feature to make it based on ship size issuing a killmail and to make selfdestructing be a possible tactic i dont see an issue with that being in one proposal edit timers too long or what be specific
i dont care about them at all as you said in one of the other threads yourself if you didnt get the killmail move on stop crying so it was somewhat funny to see you bringing up the proposal 
add stargates to that and youll get my votebut such requirements would take the fun out of the mechanic elsewhere which removes the whole reason for it to begin with
you can not selfdestruct as you are too close to the stationstargate similar to the smartbomb warning dthinking about it  that could be amusing with station huggers but it would require that redock timer and self destruction timer are the same length so you cant dock up faster than self destructing hmhm so what about the thought to give both the same timer
i remember my stance on that then i got to thinking about the explosion thing and also the fact that they will simply create a kill mail anyways they still dont get the loot but this gives self destructing some sort of last fyou to the person doing it maybe the damage needs to be increased to make it worth doing also most people complain about capitals selfdestructing in two mintues my proposal would increase this to 5 mintuesthis is true 300 damage from one damage type really going to be an issue outside of jita 44 would a pod even die to that also if it is multiple people doing it at the same time they would all take massive sec hits and if what ccp has done with insurance on sisi makes it to tranquility we will see a decline in norisk suicide stuff in empireon another note that station should be modified with 3 more exits and when you undock you come out a random one you can not selfdestruct as you are too close to the stationstargate similar to the smartbomb warning dthinking about it  that could be amusing with station huggers or you can not dock if your trying to selfdestructyou want to bring that ticking time bomb in here hell no scotty
no atm the docking timer is around 1minute so you normally wouldnt self destruct on a stationgate but sit out the timer and jumpif you give both timers the same length you can choose between self destruct and dockjump
cant support it battleships should be 2 minutes the current amount of time given to sd and everything below decreasing in time youre trying to fix something that isnt the problem so battleships are being punished for what capital ships are causing if everything from battleships and below were given 2 minutes or less then youd have my supportbut the whines on self destruct are almost always about capitals so keep the solution tied to that
while i agree about the capital ships selfdestructing whines dominating any complaint about the mechanic it is only because a capital ship doing that is what stings the most to the attackers it should be scaled according to the ship class dont you think
im torn tbhi like the idea of causing damage while giving the finger in a sd as far as a tactic but it can be easily abused to hell and backand if you put too many safeties in place to prevent abuse it nerfs the hell out of it thereby removing the reason alltogetherwhile i oppose griefing in high sec suicide ganking i do not wish to see that niche go away completelyinteresting conundrum to be sure
idea needs more input wish more people would voice thier ideaopinion about this also wouldnt someone just fit rack of smartbombs to be more effective than the one effective smartbomb by selfdestruct
oh im with ya your idea is noble but the consequences are too harsh for battleships again i dont feel that battleships are the problem and i want them to have a decent chance to sd a battleship having to go through 3 minutes to sd is pushing it too much since theyre usually ganked anyway i just think it needs to be reasonable and 3 minutes is too much time for a bs
and give the satisfaction of punishment to concord 
i find myself agreeing with matrix herewhich is odd for me to say the least
why should the 3minute timer for bs be a problem finally enough time to nibble away the ratter in a rifter
id like to see a change for sure if anything make the ability to generate a km from a sd even if no loot drops
this is true so how about 2 min for a bs and 15 min for a bcalso should smaller ships than a bs set off an explosion alldamage or range be increased on what i put in the opjohnny 5 needs input input
oh im sure it would make for some lulz moments but that isnt a justified reason for changing a game mechanic as much as the lullerz kiddies think otherwiseedit supported
it would be a really good idea if it was a dotaoe so not only popping ships but also pods the reason being doing it would be both an fu and would decimate sec status if done as a suicide gank so something like 100300 damagesec for 6 seconds making it so there was no control over keeping it from popping pods would prevent people from using it as a high sec gank popping pods is a pretty big sec hit while creating a good middle finger to an attacker
ok i give it 1btw that will give nice wtf moments for mom pilots warping to close to a gate or getting bumped towards the gate you can not self destruct as you are only 22km from the gate
dont get trolled csm by this failposterop knows hes wrong now hes just trying to cover it up with an ill get the last word in so i dont look like a tool however we are well past that now op fail
ops got it spot on loot tables for mag sites may need looked at but honestly they need looked at anywaythe only possible reason for the invention interface being so bad is that it was designed by a sadist who enjoys torturing mice
current situation is that1current game mecanic does not take into account the fact that radial tolerance increases as an object approaches the gun reaching 180 tolerance when an object is at point blank rl example if i am standing 10cm from a freight train and holding a gun no matter how fast the train moves i will probably hit it second issue is that when firing in falloff it is equally hard to hit a titan and a frigaterl example if i am firing withought aiming i will have easier time hitting a tank then a fly solution 1 a mild adjustmentto the formulas this is not perfectly accurate but is a compromice between rl and game mecanics complexety implementing 99 realistic romulas would require reworking the entire targeting and tracking system which would be alot of work that does not really make a difference therefore lets1 when distance to the target is less then 10x its signature radius the sig radius used for tracking calculation is increased as target gets closer to the person trying to shoot it ofc and reaches 23x targets normalsig radius at point blank the increase is exponential therefore when a bs is orbiting a bs at distance  4km assuming sig radius of most battleships is 400m it will need more transversal to speedtank the other bs however if we have a frigate orbiting a bs nothing will change as frigates sig radius is 5060 meters and orbiting closer then 500 meters at full speed is not very common 2 propose the formula real falloff  target sig resolutiongun sig resolution  guns natural faloff where target sig resgun sig res cannot go any higher then 3 and cant go any lower then 13this will result in bs with projectilesblasters being able to hit towers with moderate efficiencylarge increase of engagement range or blaster and projectile armed ships against larger targets decrease of ingagement range of large ships against smaller ships puts blaster users into a less ed position in regards to tracking when at point blank which is where they belongincreases importance of target painters your thoughts on the system proposed
ok i do like this idearbut it has been mentioned 1000s of times and as yet ccp have brushed it offand for the record salvaging is not a profession is an aspect of expleration magnometric sites still hopfully ccp sees this thred and thinksits bouut time the destroyer class ships got some new uses and varents im not crossing my fingers yet thoughdd
60100m would seem apprirprate could have 40km tractor range and perhaps a 50 base salvage chance or standard salvager but a 10km radius fo salvage
better not tell that to the ninja salvage crowd they may start following you around
strongly supportthe point of training all those skills is to give yourself more options and yet a brand new player has the option of cheap easily replaceable losses thats a pretty damn good option yet players like me who have to pay 2030 mil thats a long ago dreama thing i love about eve is being able to do everything on one character not having to create a second character to train up a 2nd class alts in eve are for teamwork or doing 2 specialisations at once not cause your main character is limited the only way for me to viably fly a large selection of ships is to train up a alt to do it for some ships their advantage is cheap cost which is directly countered by my clone
only at 72m sp but the bare clone ie no implants cost already equates to two fully fitted and insured bcs or a t2 frigateanything to make dying less painful gets my voteaddendum alternative is to have just few sp tiers and then add costs dependent on intended use a clone with ability to contain full 4 sets being more expensive than a 2 capable one  higher grade clones  more expensive
slaps the opno one should be totally immune from danger not even in hi sec risk is what makes this game not suck
no
i support that let a corp pay a fee equal to the cost of declaring war on a corporation should a corporation attempt to war dec that corp the corp being war decd gets the option of paying a fee to undec themselves and it can go ping pong back increasing exponentially or maybe just doubling every time it gets smacked back and forth perhaps a skillset could be added to control the number of times the wardec hot potato could be lobbed back and forth or the number of counters a protected corporation could try in order to dodge the war dec a ceo also might train government bureaucracies and each level allows them to increase the odds5 chance to start for a max of 25 of having their counter offer get concord to drop the war dec which can then be started over again with all fees reset wardecs can still happen but it isnt as easy as oh look at those miners clickpayfeewait 24hrs for war
curved warp flights would be the solution
support it is stupid looking when i can warp through a can or station but get hung up on an asteroid
just because almost all this ships are flying in gay setup covert cloak i think they must be scannable
scanning became way too easy with apocrypha anywaybtw how come your ships signal strength inside a deadspace complex with tenn of structures and ships is greater then the signal strenght of this comlexships signal strength should be capped at complexs signal strength when youre inside imo
at least until ccp decides on what will happen if anything to localfor all prototype and improved devices when active all dscanning and probing is disabledcovert ops cloaks are not affected
cool story bro
hey look a 4chan meme

that would solve nothing most people are offended by the fact they see them in localthat reminds me to move my other cloaker alt to nc space
thisconsider thisin wh space if someone is cloaked and afk no one cares because no one knows the ship is therebut do the same thing in space with nondelayed local and suddenly people get all bent out of shape about itits a problem with perception not a problem with cloaks if you stop worrying about them youll find they dont bother you as much
im totally afk cloaking right now whoooo look at me im totally naked and you cant see me uh whooooo
your not a very bright miner are you considering the trash you keep spewingstop embarrassing us and walk away before you embarrass yourself
mission runners had to deal with a 11 tax while in a npc corp so why shouldnt miners deal with a 11 reduction in mining yield while in a npc corp
hint many of the mission runners are not in npc corps anymore they are in hundreds of new 1mancorps other mission farmers have multiple corps to jump wardecs over and over again hint fly to palas and see all the toons in the corps with the funny numbers as corp ticker and same goes for macro miners so your suggestion would not really solve that problem at all
i am well aware that many mission runners are no longer in npc corps this is self evident pretty much wherever you go in the eve universemy suggestion wasnt actually to solve the problem my suggestion would make npc miners to be tempted to move to player corporations to maximize their yield they would then be subject to war decs this wouldnt stop the miners from jumping corp but similarly this wouldnt stop anyone from war decing any corporation they jumped to this is similar to the one man player mission running corporations you refer to they are subject to war declarations as you well know
tax wouldnt stop mining in npc corps even thenjust like it never stopped mission runners in spite of the 1 man mission corps and furthermore the same applies to miners in 1 man mission corps as wellso basically complete and utter waste of time
i agree with you it wouldnt stop npc mining in fact i wouldnt want to stop npc mining at all the 11 reduction to mining yield as mentioned earlier would make miners whether macro or not tempted to move to a player corporation where they are subject to war declarationsdo you feel this would really be a complete waste of time
sure i let my npc miner alt mine the stuff and reprocess it with my player corp toon that even got some standing from mission running or if i dont have an alt i ask my mission running friend in his 1 man corp
your mining alt currently isnt mining at a 11 reduction to mining yield i wasnt refering to reprocessingrefining i am refering to a 11 reduction to mining yield
all your doing is making the problem worseif i was a solo miner i would make a solo corp mineif i get war decd i leave and go npc for a bit leaving an alt behind to spite them or jump to an another solo corp etcetchence total and utter waste of timeeven then i likely wouldnt give a damn about 11 tax on refinement anyway as my skills would make up for it and if it gets that bad ill go to whs where i can refine my own damn minerals at a 25 loss and still come out on topgetting the message yet
just to be clear i am refering to a 11 reduction to mining yield
doesnt matter even then just means it takes longer to get to the same result but not much longer
thats cool im not trying to stop mining it takes longer to get the same result if you are a mission runner in an npc corporation but not much longer why should npc miners be exempt
supporting this and bump
sign and support from me and my associates as well as bump it
many pilots run with minimum settings including texture detail when in situations where graphics lag could be an issue i doubt minimum detail textures are as significant thus this is probably a non issuebut i digress it is not for the players to decide what is feasible all we need to do is tell ccp what features we want and they determine weather they are feasiblewould you like to see this feature implemented
destroyers are such a nothing ship i remember when they were released people flew them for about a week and worked out they sucked balls unfortunately the t2 variant although it has a role is still kind of munted in terms of usefulness as one good hit from a cruiser will kill it
actually if you can just gain access to the can rather than it showing you the password would be cool exploding cans would be funny too while you set the password you select boobytrap to arm container lol
honestlyi havent met a single person who has used t2 rigs on the ships they actually fly ingameim betting some rich l4 mission runners stick them on their vargs and golems but other than that
much discussion has gone on about insurance and suicide ganking i throw this idea out to the crowdallow people to bribe concord hulk pilot pays x isk for concord to keep a small ship nearby suicide gankers can see said ship game result is a faster concord response time this is a form of insurance that is more in line with the flavor of the game and allows those concerned with suicide ganks to pay more for security if they want the faster response time would make it harder to suicide gank but ideally not impossible for a coordinated team it would dovetail with the existing variable response times in different security systems the bribe might be system specific or constellation specific if concord is too pure allow the bribing of the local racial cops perhaps put a new trade good in the game donutsit could also be considered that criminals could bribe concord as well to give them a bit more time both options act as an isk sink and keeps some kind of risk in high sec
i see 2 solutions on thatfirst of all this is a brilliant idea as pirating in systems of high sec is not part of the game nor intended to work this issue needs to be solved gankers should have not a single chance to proceed their plansi see the idea with the personal concorde bodyguard but it it still has vulnerabilities left to be used for exploiting1 solution i recommend not to make it with a concorde vessel the better way would be to use a skill for it this skill should have the background to use static concorde turrets in eg 1 per level of skill those could have a range of like 500 kms and only react on high sec pirates players that attack a player though still the chance is kept that a player lets fool himself by the old and still working faction trick2 solution instead of guns the use of concorde drones i am not sure if this should be skill dependingof course the lower the sec status of a system is the slower the concorde comes this factor can also be involved into both solutions by increasing the response time of the ship i just dont see the point suicide gankers are cheaters they use a weakness in the game engine to gain personal benefit this is what i call an exploit they attack they die i would not discuss since none of them is a paying customer but a trial account the pirate behind this tactic might be a paying character but if this way a gameengine can be optimized it is okikoniathe greater northern alliance
thats funny the devs seem to think otherwise
although i dont think pvp is the main driving force behind the economy i think its going a little too far to say pvpers dont do squat to keep the economy going come on now fille balle pvp does have a noticeable impact on the economy thinking about it more i and am switching positions a little pvp is a driving force behind the economy i dont think its as big a driving force as pve but its still a large driving force
if not for item destruction there would be no market for your loot lp etc item destruction results from pvp qed im not saying its more important in case i stepped on someones ego there just that it is the end consumer in a production chain and the demand that sets many a price it would be like me saying that eve would be better off without carebears  because the dependency works both ways
sokratesz said if not for item destruction there would be no market for your loot lp etc item destruction results from pvpi was under the impression there was a lot more item destruction from pve then pvp i thought but i could be wrong that the highest lost ships tend to be pve ships like ravens which you dont get in pvp much either way like i said once i thought about it more i think pvp is a large driving force and my first post saying pvp is not a driveing force is wrong
id like to see the number of ships destroyed by npcs vs the number of ships destroyed with a player on the mail im fairly certain that that ratio would be something outrageous like 110000hint hint ccp quarterly newsletter
well said this is exactly the issue here the nature of kill missions needs to be completely revisited wave after wave of bigndumb rats whos difficulty is rated solely on dps and tank nogive pvers a chance
yeah youre absolutely right thats taking it too far but on the other hand saying that pvp is the sole driving force behind the economy is taking it too far in the opposite direction in fact pvp isnt fueling anyting at all it is the fire that burns the fuel produced by mission runnersminersindustrialists etcsure no fire no practical use for the fuel but my point still stands if pvp was such a great way of burning fuel then why has the price of minerals dropped to a point where its profitable to sd a ship i think part of the reason is that 99 of eves players are carebearsthe only players that actually loose ships are either noobs or 00 soldiers any experienced player will know how to avoid loosing his ship even the pvper and they will all do everything they can in order to avoid loosing ships besides an average mission runner or 00 soldier flys a battleship or better where as an average pvper will usually fly a cruiser or a bc so when a mission runner00 soldier looses a ship far more minerals are burnedthis is what i mean when i say pvpers dont do squat yes youre right it makes a difference but not enough unfortunately
people die in pve i mean seriously ok maybe you lose a few ships learning the ropesdifferent missions and maybe the odd one when you forget to turn your tank on but otherwise how do you die in pve especially if thats what you do full time as a former mission runner i would need that explained to me lolthe reason the raven dies so frequently is twofold one its extremely popular compared to other bs so when people attack pvers theyre more likely to be hitting a raven pilot two one of the reasons its so popular is its versatility which includes its pvp role as the best torpedo ship in the game so theres intentional pvp losses on top of ganks aside from ammunition which is a consumable item pve does little to drive the economy unless theres pvp in the picture without pvp loss players will stop buying ships youll have the case where players skill up buy one of whatever they need at each level and then theyll hardly need to make another purchase eves growth rate simply cant sustain that kind of economic modelnow when you factor in replacements needed for victims and doers of suicide ganking 00 pvp including the caplossheavy sov conflicts lowsec piracy atrisk pveing like in lowsec or 00 where the barrier to attack by players is low highsec wars and carebears buying ships they can go out and pvp for fun in then you have what drives our economy
alekseyev karrde said people die in pveyes as there is far more to pve then just missions complexs and wormhole space sleepers kill a fair few pilots cosmos and expeditions kill a lot i bet a lot die in level 5 missions then there are those that seem to somehow die in level 4 and less missions i know some of the static cosmos sites i lived in used to kill a lot of pilots per day every day unlike the odd pvp battle here and there those cosmos sites are every daythat and as pve people outnumber pvp people by so much even if only a small amount of pve people die thats still a massive amount compared to pvpi really dont believe your comments on pvp are correct as ccp did give us pvp loss numbers and they were very tiny but only ccp has the stats to prove one of us right or wrong perhaps the pve numbers are also very small
yep lets nerf all successful ships drake myrm ishkur ishtar zealot rupture etc lets fix old problems nerf scorch range increase auto cannon pg boost rails remove projectile alfa etc lets make everything equal
and its opinions like this that keep you on the losing side of most fights ive never said dont boost rails ive just strongly argued that it shouldnt be a boost in damage specifically it doesnt matter what they do to any gun theres always going to be a preferred ship class in fleets a secondary and a third someone has to be third always
no it wont do the math right the 401 dps hyp comes to 461 dps after the suggested boost 60 dps for 30 km range lost to the apoc which is actually a perfect trade 15 damage gained for a 15 loss to range plus low alpha and cap issues on its major platform flavor of the month this is notpropose an alternative then you havent brought any new information that would suggest that things are either balanced currently or that the proposed changes would be imbalanced if you dont like the proposed changes anyways at least offer an alternative instead of simply demanding that the game remain unbalancednext youre going to say that range equates a damage boost arent you xd firstly you demonstrated yourself why this is wholly insufficient 4th mag stab gives you 6 damage when were looking at a need for 15 secondly not everyone will have low slots available for this as rigs are a fairly common alternative for squeezing more pg out of a fit if needed lastly rails fit fairly well to their platform as is i cant think of a rail platform that would particularly want to use an rcu unless theyre also fitting 1600mm plates  mwdprove it you havent introduced any new information weve produced numerous fits with tachyons and decent ehp and mwds on apocs before honestly if nobody can compare anything to tachyons then the only solution is to remove tachyons from the game since theyre either designed to be op or appropriate and should be compared with other top tier sniper weaponspropose an alternative or gtfo
actually i believe the calculation would be243 the dps without the mag modifier11 10 increase401243 the increase provided by the mags4411 dpsthis would make it a powerful ship even though the cap wouldnt last but it has already been pointed out that you can get an abaddon similarly fit doing 502 dps that would be doing more dps than the beefed up hype until about 180km also can get a maelstrom over 400 dps with all the massive alpha as well 4411 dps on a hyperion isnt overpowered unless you are flying a rokh
4 mag stab hype is 425 dps op says 15 increase in dmg 115425  48875 with 3 mag stabs its 461 why would someone do a 4 stab hype i think 490 dps at 210 optimal is reason enough
please do the calculation again the damage boost is to the guns themselves if 4 mag stabs make 425 dps then a 15 boost to guns would bring it to 48875 still less than a 502 dps abaddon 3 mag stabs as your fit showed would be 4411 dps as i showed in the calculation still less than the 502 dps abaddon up to 174kmare you in favor of nerfing beams so the abaddon and apoc dont trounce railguns wait then projectiles would be op and have to be nerfed to match the other weapons or they could boost railguns to match everything else
you want to talk about a 4 mag stab hype then well talk about 4 heat sink apocs and abbadons and how theyre absolutely rediculous 425 dps231km optimal on an apoc and 532dps175km optimal are either of them practical not really but hey 4 damage mods must still be a good and sensible thingi think were assuming different boosts here youre thinking of a 10 boost and were thinking of a 15 either way neither of the results are overpowered in any way as the worst case scenario is my proposal with the 15 boost where you trade range for damage perfectly equally between the hype and an apoc
so glass canon  frentix is your answer to balance issues is that a valid argument i believe not is it a strawman argument no but it is naive or very biased trying to force the argument a properly fit hype does 357 dps  19148 km less than an apoc at the same range and tanks 68k ehp a 15 damage increase would take that only up to 410 dps so yaay you can now stop using failfits to try to argue that rails will be op if boosted if you have trouble fitting a fleetbs its ok pay attention you might learn somethinghowever if you are one of those people that show up in fleet battles in expensive nonreimbursable ships that cant be repped before they get popped be my guest darwin will take care of your affliction
on the contrary despite talking about glass cannon fits yaay seems to use more cautious fits such as this apoc with only 1 heat sink or this 2 sink sniper apoc or the 2 sink sniper harby or this superplate abaddonso i guess i have even more trouble with yaay pointing to glass cannons with fear while flying normal or tank fits why dont you fly with 4 heat sinks the same reason almost no one uses such a fit on a hyperion
funny part is that the glass cannon approach ends up favoring the apoc pretty well as it can sit signifigantly further out while doing very nice damage allowing it to get away with lower ehp numbers since the only thing hitting it will be a rokh and they only really tickle setting up a 401 dps231km with 48k ehp apoc is fairly easy and with implants and a faction te you can bring that dps to 425 that is a glass cannon or a cannon at least since 48k ehp isnt supersquishy in the end
youre an idiot for comparing pulses to anything long rangeim using the same argument against people that have argued the other side i showed stats with both 3 and 4 mag stabs for that reason comparing any abanddon fit to any other sniper fit is just idiocy yes it gets ridiculous firepower it also caps out in about 12 shots thats not even comparable to other races that can get about 60 shots off before capping out in the most ideal situationwith or without frentix the range difference is about 17  20 optimal thats not a lot and again it has nothing to do with damage issues you guys keep ignoring the point and trying to just discredit me in general point is there are far better things to balance rails with than damage you guys keep arguing about every stat but damage at this point because you cant win the argument the hype does nice damage and it fubarred your arguement because you didnt know it could do that at those rangesits the difference between wind bagging an argument and actually doing all the proper analysis first i dont like your idea because in the history of eve it has never worked and its been tried many timesi think making fittings easier and some small tweaks to secondary stats make far more sense for railsi dont use glass cannon fleets because theyre impossible to use these days 710 bombs kill even the avg tanked snipe fleets a few bubbles and a rr fleet tears them to peaces too theres virtually no use for a snipe fleet in game thats not an issue with rails thats an issue with fleet warfare in generalif some of you still use snipe fleets good luck but when you face a competent force youre going to die in a hurry
except this is an tach sniper fit that you lost 312 dps  200km  37 falloff and 80k ehp from a time when fear of dd was greater than doing more dpsi wasnt laying into you yaay i was pointing out that you fit tanks not glass cannons as had been suggested also pointing out that few people you are an example fly glass cannon snipers with 4x damage modsthe 502 dps fit caps out after 5 minutes which is more than the 425 dps hype fit 5 minutesand again i agree there are other things that can be changed other than just boosting dps

not to mention give pveers a reason for being in 00 beyond making isk and give alliances a reason for having them thereits not the great solution to move all pveers out of highsec but its a good step in the right directionsupported
if what you are saying is popping rattersminers in a system impacts the system industrymilitary levels this is a good ideaedit support
what he is saying is that ratters and miners are now a valid part of the defense strategy for a system but that they will need to be defended for this to work and that preventing them from doing their thing will make the system easier to take a little later on actually popping them has nothing to do with it its an incentive for sovereignty holders to man or woman up and defend their right to rat and mine rather than dock up or move to a different system and that should mean more real fights can be had rather than simple ganks  and thats a good thing
not sure if its been mentioned but the hilarity of adding this to the faction that uses drones you know the easy to scan down drones only adds to the wtf ccp

while i do support this do you read liang use the damn courier contract work aroundive been using the courier contract work around for a while now and while it is annoying it works for alts its easy as just making a courier to them for what ever to where ever with no prices they accept and break contract ohh look you have your items
heyoo it has come to my attention that there are multiple people who have a problem with accidental doubleclicks in eve which cause trouble and distress to playersexample 1 you have a helios and it is cloaked in a deadspace site you rotate the camera to get a new vantage point of your surroundings and about 15 seconds later you are completely decloaked and are being shot at by rats you lose your heliosexample 2 you are at a pos in your thanatos you close a chat window then need to go afk about 1015 minutes later your cell phone is going off your corpmates are calling you because your thanatos is 120km away from the posthese are all frustrating incidents which can increase the potential for losses due to poor mouse click implementation so lets fix itproposali propose that we implement a ship anchor button whether it is a button near your reset viewtactical overlay buttons or a right click option in the hud triangle U25BA it would allow you to anchor your ship in place alternatively if your ship is not already stopping and is moving you could have it keep your current direction of movement fixed so it basically will lock down your ship movements to whatever they are at currently when you warp the anchor deactivates automatically if you stop warp before you warp you will need to reanchor your shipnote if your ship is stopping and you are decelerating from say 200ms and you hit your anchor it would prevent you from moving once you land in place if you are aligned to say a star and hit the anchor button it would make it so your ship may not divert from its current alignment to the star i feel the urge to state this does not negatively impact other people attempting to bump you if somebody bumps you will still move you just will not be able to input new movement commands until you unanchor your shiptldr implement an anchor button that prevents the client from new movement commands except warpthis is frustrating to many players and has been noted in this thread
approving my own post d
so if youre stopped dead and anchored what effect does bumping have would it be the regular stopped  bumping effect or would it be more like the approach  bumping effect
this thread has been made under the pretence that doubleclicking is an issueit isnt
then please explain to me why when rotating the camera i will start moving in the direction which i first single clicked to grab the camera
happens to me too but not supporting because this isnt the solution
then what do you propose where is the negative impact of this idea
supported
not supportedpeople should take care of their ship it isnt all that difficult
youre in a car you park on a hill you put the car in park and turn on the ebrake like anybody would you get out of your car the second you turn around your ebrake fails and your car slips into neutralyour car goes careening down the hill and crashes into another persons car now you did everything right the car had some sort of malfunction you werent expecting though who is at fault you or the car
your hand break is keep at range on the tower
i dont think you understand the problemin eve accidental mouse clicks are detected sure i can tell my ship to stop tell it to orbit tell it to stay at rangebut as soon as i click my mouse somewhere else there is a chance my client will send that to the server as a double click and off i gothere is no way to prevent it from happening for some people so that is why i posted this thread
you have a doubleclicking problem you propose a togglebutton solution i sense a new instance of the same problem incoming
fortunately the problem doesnt work like thati am not 100 sure what causes it or else i would fix it myself but it doesnt seem to happen when i click on most ui things that are fixed in place the only thing it has happened to before is a module which wound up with it turning yellow it was amusing and any chat box which is stacked on top of other chat boxesso regardless of it being a client issue or a server issue why cant it just be something that we could have as an option
i used to have an issue with double clicking and ending up with my hulk drifting away without me realizing so i got a new mouse and problem was solved
this problem happen so often to me that i press ctrlspace preemptively when i play with the camera and need to be sure im still standing stillthere can be multiple solutions thought like changing the shortcut for moving or playing a sound when the ship received this order
i have this problem have had it for some time it is massively irritating after some simple testing i determined that not surprisingly it is my mouse at fault not eve replace your mouse see if you still need an anchor however the alignment lock aspect of this idea i do like very much a starship drifting back to neutral trim is both idiotic in concept and problematic in practice ill support this for that reason
supporting on the assumption that it can be assigned to a shortcut
not supported doesnt take much effort to make sure your not moving before you go afkadapt or die comes into play here
yes for an option to disable doubleclick we need nothing more
this i would support if it were its own proposalthe op on the other hand gets a no
i support the idea of a ship anchor
most likelly your mouse button is suffering from debounce or contact bouncei had this issue too  although my mouse was fine for every other application i run on my machine it did not work well in evemy guess is eve uses custom drivers for the mouse  and those drivers are not very good at recognising contact bouncebuy a new mouse this will fix your issues long before ccp does
this can be fixed by shortening your double click speed so two clicks not meant to be a double click are not reported to the game as a double click
unfortunettly no  if the double click pulse is being sent by a mouse button that is wearing out the pulses will only be milliseconds apartmuch faster than can be caught by the double click speed setting
then they have a crappy mouse and likely have any number of other problems in other software because of it eve doesnt need to compensate for that
i support ccp fixing the underlying problem instead of adding a bandaid
i agree with these changes  especially the bandwidth boost module if you remove the bonus drones controlled the bandwidth has nothing to do with the amount of drones controlled thats the drones skill that determines number but only the size of the drones we may see myrms with a full rack of heavy drones but they wouldnt have gunsthe helios is the most underpowered covops ship due to only having two highs  the 3 drones will help compensate for that a dedicated droneboat bs could be a new t2 ew bs with a bonus to drone control range and drone ew bonus as the t2 bonusessupported
a highslot 5mb module with medium fitting req and 10mb mod with large fitting req would be better more drones would probably not the ishkur does not need a buff 5 more drone damage defenately is a buffotherwise supported
making a more powerful drone boat than the dominix is pushing into the realm of carriers a fantastic inbetween could be taking the concept of the nuetvampdomi and giving bonuses and fittings to fit this playstyle but only if ccp can manage to make it an uglier ship than the flyingmutantpotato
not supportedhigh skill characters got tons of advantages over less skilled charactersreducing risk in pvp is the wrong way to gothis game is great precisely because losses mean somethingthose who dont want to pay high clone cost dont have to buy clones if they want to fly cheap ships they dont need more than 20 mil sp anyway ccp should not keep lowering the bar just so more stupid people can pass
i would prefer an older player dying and because of the cost going straight back into battle with a new ship they already have ready to go which generally carrys a heavier cost than the clone and helps industry then to just go ohh well cant justify another clone tonight ill log because of the fun of fighting you can justify spending more time to get more ships but justifying time for just a clone which doesnt directly relate to fun is a lot harder imoits about getting more pvp from a game that is about pvp and making it more attractive to undock in a game where people are already too safe the clone cost for a loss isnt really that much until you get to the higher levels and it blows out to ridiculous costs for those who say we want free pvp what about the ship mods and any implants this i get to choose at the time what im willing to risk not i need a 75m sp clone because i dont want to see the past x years gone to waste in training and paying for this game i dont want eve to be risk free its the whole reason why eve gives you such a good buzz when pvping and why its different from so many other gameson that note its a game not everyone gets to play heaps and its supposed to be fun with a good balance between risk vs reward its also an rp game and saying i should be forced to use an alt because of my age doesnt work well on me if ccp stated this was the punishment for being a long paying customer and i should stop training my character then i would stop paying my account for those busy periods in life where im not playing much im not sure ccp really like the idea of stopping people from progressing as that in some cases is the only reason why they are still aroundalso how does being old mean they should be flying expensive ships i think most that fly expensive ships do it because they are rich and flying anything less doesnt give them that buzz anymore as its too easy for them to replace this can be for someone quite young though if they got lucky are good at market stuff or even just have lots of time to make money being able to only play a few hours a week gives very different perspective than being able to play everyday for a few hoursit seems a few here also seem to think anyone taking risks is doing it wrong and i know some people think if its a fair fight your doing it wrong just because you die doesnt mean your being stupid or even risky sometimes it can mean you were unlucky or need more friends yeah everyone likes more blobs dont we want more risky behavior not lesssorry i got a bit rumbly therealso this thread is different to my proposal thread which i gave examples on what i could see it being this turned out to be a bad idea as everyone thought it was concrete and no one gave suggestions on how to improve it just proposing a change to make the high end not so expensive at least gives personal interpretation and ccp can do the same if they feel its important enoughcan only support the topic once doesnt this give the replies to support ratio a false indication if there is any discussionand now i have to wait 5 minutes even though i couldnt post anyway arhhh this forum is 
listened to yourself muchany reason why you feel compeled to always be on the negative side of any and all issuesdo you even pvpi dont grind im not interested in collecting rat tails for the store keeper i have enough isk i dont see the reason for clones locking high sp subscribers out of small shipsmatting is correct many times on tsvent i have heard people say oh well cant justify yet another clone tonight cyasget over yourself drake you are not all that
seems a reasonable request want this fixed for when i get to those insance number in 56 years
pathetic
i almost want to say thanks for the bump but seriously if you cant at least post something constructive stfu
supportedi cant think of a good reason why high skilled players should be restricted from engaging in pvp as easily as everyone else can due to having to spent so much time working to generate enough income to even afford the clones as some guys here seem to think they shouldthat approach is dictating playstyle to others which sucks if i want to pvp i dont see why i should have to spend 5 times as much time ratting or working on industry to afford it as anyone else
strongly opposed clone costs are one of the advantages newer players hold over older players older players are supposed to be able to compensate for higher clone costs with greater player experience and the advantages of better character skills in any case the absolute cost of clones is not actually very highif the op feels that his clone costs are too high he can always create a new character for lowsp activitieseve is supposed to be a pvp game with a harsh death penalty clone costs are part of that penalty
supported
supported because paying 30 mill per clone without counting implants is ridiculous
support
my immediate thought was no but after thinking about it i couldnt really think of a good enough reason for that and i can think of a number of reasons why it would be a good idea which have already been mentioned so it has my backing
if you have ever been involved in flipping a station to conquer a system you would be against this unless they release a super weapon to rip apart stations there should be a limit of 1 station to a system or people will begin putting a dozen stations in a system so it would be near impossible to conquer the system
there is always the option of emptying wallets to change sov or disbanding alliancesproven to be a well working way to take over systems and stations
lol too true metagaming remains the only way to win 00 wars in eve  even postdominion
i have been present in several cases of flipping or trying to flip station system ownership under the new system 49u failed attempt timezone pingpong dg biggest blob so far capital turkey shoot period basis many station systems without any real opposition i still consider lifting this ban preventing multiple stations per system reasonable if ccp is worried about someone dropping 20 stations in system then they can either tweak sov system to take possibility into account or discourage station spam thru other means  for example making number of stations in system affect sov bill
fair enough im just pointing out a major reason why it would be bad to allow multiple stations in a system in response to posts like theseandandas in spamming stations as a means of defending a system is a big reason why to limit a system to only 1 outpost
if eve history has shown us anything then it is that cost alone does not prevent activities that give edge to one side in the territorial dance however im fairly confident that if number of stations in system would cause exponential system maintenance cost increase after the first station one could station spam himself into bancrupcy if number of stations would cause increasing of bill then it should be however offline stations to avoid punishing whoever is unfortunate enough to conquer the system or you can just go easy route and make station hp in system shared so you build 2 stations fair enough but they have their hp halved etc etc when making multiple stations cost something ccp has stated on several occasions that they will not make stations destructible fair enough  how about offlining them nothing snappy ofc lets say 2 week timer to offline and 1 month timer to online a station offline station would be kinda like normal station just all station services would be disabled and you would not be able to put new items on the hangar floor in there as hangars would full everyone could dock there as its offline afterall saying that there should be only 1 station per system is like saying that there should be hard cap at 5 titans per system if allowing multiple stations per system would unbalance something then simple  rebalance it but damnit i want my sandbox
wft why the hell would you limit it lets limit amount of money you can have in your wallet so rich dont get richer huh same thing here
how about this  eve is risk vs reward correctso  when someone invades your system as soon as 1 outposts becomes vulnerable all other outposts in system become vulnerable toorisk you loose way more assets when the system is taken of course it means this system will be a more juicy target for invadersreward easier logistics as long as you hold the systemif we make the sov mechanics like that i would say  drop as many outpost as you want into the system and make the pinata more juicy would you still want multiple outpost in a single system with this mechanic
there is an artificial limit on how much dps you can bring to bear in a system whether it is the max dps a ship can do or the maximum number of pilots that you can put in a system before the node chokes it isnt a whole lot when you compare it to the defenses of stations again a dozen stations would probably make a system invincible as you would likely spend the entire day downtimetodowntime and end up unable to reinforce the last stationthats what im getting at

nah stations have only about 100 mil hp dread does 3500  6000 dps long or short range lets say 3500 dps 28 571 seconds for solo dread approx 8 hours for single dread 48 or more dreads will do a station in one siege cykle 10 minutes any territory holding alliance and many non territory holding ones can field that we have seen that you can stick about 1600 pilots in one system without node melting not very playbale ofc if every shot takes 5 minutes lets say 800 pilots with 800 guy in system you can bring about 100 dreads and 300  400 support dozen 12 stations would take about 25 hours for 50 dreads 2 hours of shooting and 30 minutes for warping around sticking 20 stations in system will not make it invunerable even now not to mention should the sov system tweaked a bit to take it into account actually i think that the idea that if one of em falls all become vunerable is also something that might even work stations alone do not defend space any better than putting death star at every moon did back in the day and unlike death stars they do not even shoot backhow many attacking dreads would be left if they would just shoot the station for 25hours0you should bring realistic numbers and not base on they wont defend anyway
if the defenders cant defend 1 station in a system how will they defend 2 or more shooting a station is what happens after the system has been securedseriously its a non issue if you want to spam stations to make your space a grind to conquer its hugely more effective to put 12 stations and 12 ihubs in 12 systems than it is to put 12 stations and 1 hub in 1 system
you are sure about the station thingfrom
the reason stations get reinforced without being defended is usually because there isnt enough time for a decent defense fleet to form up get in position and attack as was stated with enough dreads it only takes a cycle the longer you spend with a cap fleet in enemy space the more likely they are to start dropping titans in and popping you ships the more likely they are to start harassing your ships if not enough time to call every last friend they have and hit your fleet with a few hundred dreads thats what would happenso sitting in a hostile system logged in in siege for 25 hours this would be silly bordering on suicidal im fairly certain it would take far longer than that anyway ive been in fleets led by goons a atlas tcf and razer fcs getting from 1 tower to the next tower in the same system takes a lot longer than the 2 minutes you give it and thats assuming there are no problems thats assuming intel doesnt come that a hostile fleet is near and everyone has to safe up thats assuming everyone sieges and warps like clockwork which never happens in a big fleet thats assuming you can keep a fleet together for hours just to flip one system

im pretty sure this was taken to ccpcsm4 because even if it was handled by csm3 it still hasnt happened yet
this is where show stops sorryccp has stated that they cant present you these details without currently needed clicking one by one  or it will load servers too muchbasically when you open any hangar or container with bpobpc server sends you list this is bpobpc for insert name server does not make immediate full query for bpc type and details me pe runs according to ccp it is too big a load i dont know why but they are supposed to know that stuffwithout solving this problem any interface will not make wonders
you can get that information right away1 go to science and industry2 go to corp blueprint tab3 pick the type you want copyoriginal4 double click on the station you want5 you get a nice new window which lists all blueprints and their statsimportant if that hangar has many blueprints 1000 opening the new window can be really slowand if you keep the corp blueprint tab open it will reload on every job you set up for such big hangars switch the tab in the science and industry window to jobs or installationsthen it wont update the blueprint list when setting up jobs but atleast the client stays fast
if you can electronically transmit blueprints from one place to another place then you should be able to hack the communication and steal them in fact you should be able to hack an ingame mechanic comms too in fact theres a number of things that people should be able to break into that are protected by game mechanics bposbpcs have no reason to have the same kind of protection as other things like your hangar for instance
not supportedskill books which is a reversal of a previous position i held and blueprints both need to remain physical objects so that they are subjected to the same risks during transport as any other in game asset
oh its simply a lie as everyone can see by looking at this thread with poll 3346 88 ppl answered that they want these exploits to be fixed 4221 111 ppl answered that these are exploits but they dont want them to be fixed and 2433 64 ppl answered to lulz answer that theyre members of darkside and have a butthurt because theyre using these exploits themselves so the last group cannot be realistically taken as voters against fixing these exploitsthen go away dont disturb our dark and evil doings
does this thread help your discussion
sounds like somebodys ed that theyre about to lose there most used exploitthats because most russians are the ones who use it the amount of russian cynabal pilots who jumped into a gate camp in my last corp and logoffskid i stopped counting because it became a joke
just had 1 happen to mewarp in on two hulks and a mammoth in my harpy tackle one of the hulks get him down to 25 shield he dissapears i wait for him to come back online but being in a main system alliance brings in an archon and im forced to warp outi have the combat log but i dont know of any way to do anything about this situationatlas cowards ftl
when you stop your ship why does it settle to a level plane why is there a defined up and downthis seems like a minor issue unless youve flown a bomber
its not a minor issue at all for me it disturbs immersion a great great deal with any ship same thing with locking the camera into the same plain
supporting my own topic
for the same reason your ship has a maximum speed
because eve is a submarine simulator mkay
use the keyboard short cuts to slow down to 0 msec instead of stopping the ship it will retain its position without settling
any more votes on this lots of people have looked but only a few of us are giving feedback speak up people
im against smartbomb damage when sding the sd mechanic insurance was discussed with ccp in iceland see meeting minutes
whyso your point
isnt this a nerf to insurance scamming as well blowing up bss
i dont think it would add anything and may only introduce awhole lot of new bugs and exploits its not something that would have me going yeah eve would be a better game if it had thismy point is that its on the backlog already and a new proposal wont change 
lol ok dev sokratesz us not wanting changes for fear of bugs stop thinking you are a dev okso the eve community is not allowed to make suggestions if there is something related on ccps infamous backlog
opinionnoun1 a belief or judgment that rests on grounds insufficient to produce complete certainty2 a personal view attitude or appraisal but whatever keep thinking within your own sharply defined borders just dont expect the rest of us to care
im talking about this partso any new ideas are pointless
a new idea in this direction yes because its already been discussed and the smartbomb option was dismissed by ccp
this could have been sokrateszs original post this is the information csm is supposed to provide to the community
kind of like when the players wanted a training que and ccp dismissed it its a good thing the players didnt bother to keep pushing for it and waste their time oh waibut then they wouldnt be egods with the rest of the eve community worshiping them and begging for bit of information
or getting rid of pos bowlingor getting rid of pos warfareor the modular pos concept that players have been begging for since a few seconds after players touched poss csm has brought it up it has been requested more than once during fanfestcsm exists to push for the changes the masses want
funny what else was omitted from the minutes
i think this might have been in a previous csm as in before there was anything resembling an easy way for players to figure out what the csm has discussed or what the devs answers have been on different topics
take some time to think about that thenin be4 i get banned for nda breach 
theres a diff between hiring concord to play the game for you and letting new players hire concord to help cleanup the fail pvpers who can only canflip newbs rather than actually go outside to 00 where real players can kill themim all for it not only will it help to increase the population but it might also force these losers to come out to 00 and play p the more out here the merrier
wrong its the most boring and worthless job especially for new playersthis thread looks like my macrominer bot dont mine good enough because some bad people steals all the ore it mines
im all for it as long as it is also possible to bribe concord to ignore attacks on npc corp members
not supportednew players need to learn about theft and laziness i mined when i started and read about how jetcan mining was a risk i then moved to a less populated 7 system so i could anchor a huge secure container all i could afford after i bought a destroyer  several minersskill books etc paying concord to pop people for theft when they dont ever do it anywhere else is for lack of a more effective way to say it stupid the tutorials are an important part of the new player experience and if people would actually pay attention to them they would learn a lot about the game most notably is how you can leave a system to go somewhere else yet many new players decide to stay in the starter systems until they are prodded out the real problem is new players dont understand that after they do all the tutorials they should go somewhere else not start mining belts where half the timewhen i was coming up the roids were all eaten by some jagoff in a retriever or hulk
sounds interesting though it will need in game testing for balanceunforseen effects ectcautious support
id like to see the maths on how this would change actual combat scenarios before supporting i agree that your proposal is more realistic but balance  realism
its a good idea for close ranged weapons but wouldnt it adversely affect long ranged weapons like artillery and railguns
this reminds me of the issue where the hero tank drake or nighthawk  dont remember which it was flew to 0km on the hyperion it was fighting in the last alliance tourney and hugged it for a minute or so the hyperion basically was unable to hit it but the missiles had no trouble slowly breaking down the hyperions tank leading to the almost dead nighthawkdrake coming from behind for the win this mechanic should be fixed
comments it sounds like youre attempting to explain how something looks closer as its nearer or further away as its further away  and is subsequently easierharder to hit because of it i think it would be better for all involved if we kept it simple  perhaps by sigradius to perceivedsigradius  realsigradius  optimalfalloffrange this might scale for battleship or capital combat but it will definitely end up being a massive nerf to frigate combat with falloffs always being cut to 13rd what they should be there was once a thread in the game dev forum here search for gabriel karrade or wade through my own posting history which had many suggestions for how to change the tracking formula all of them were much simpler than this and there was a great abundance of graphs to illustrate how things would changeliang
please could you explain that i cannot see how frigates the ships with the best weapon resolution will suffer from this they will benefit from much bigger faloff and even more tracking while shooting bigger targets and will have no effect when shooting other frigates please explain what you mean i cannot understand that
the issue is simple eve calculates the chance to hit based on the radius of the object being shot m the speed it is traveling ms and the speed the guns can transit in radseve converts the speed to rads presumably but does not convert the size to rads to fix the math everything needs to be measured using the same stick either have everything converted to radians a measurement of plane angle or meters a measurement of length to convert the ship size to radians a simple algorithm is used that was sort of a joke that would likely increase server load in a noticeable way it can be simplified a lot though by just using the pythagorean theorem and a willingness to accept that it is close enough this would be a lighter calculation for the servers this would be a step back in that the server limit before they start smoking crying and quitting on us on how many people could be shooting at each other on one node would decrease
strongly supported because paying 30 million isk per clone without counting implants is ridiculousgah forgot to support

make the wardec fee 10b a week and ill support your proposaljust supporting to introduce more isk sinks into the game
so this is a fairly simple concept im just gonna throw out herewhat is itwhenever you achieve level 5 in a particular skill give the player the option to throttle the skill back down to a level 4 or lower if the player ever chooses to do sowhy would this be usefuli will give an example if you are running a dual or triple armour rep setup and you know you are not quite going to have enough capacitor to run them all permanently but you know that a quick downgrade to a level 4 repair systems skill would allow you to permanently keep running them and sufficently tanking the dps you could simply throttle the skill to achieve a stable capacitori admit it might be limited in scope but im positive there would be other uses for this optiontldr  it would be nice when you have trained a skill to level 5 to be able to downgrade a skill of a module due to capacitor concerns
or you could just pulse the second or third repperi do that all the timenot supported
skillpoints mean nothing without player skill your personal skill is to learn how to manage cap
requesting move to unnecessary features and stupid ideas forum
thismy guess is hes dualboxing in missions with a damage dealer and a rr so he doesnt want to have to keep switching back and forth as the cap gets low on the repper however there are all sorts of other ways of fixing this problem such as making a cap stable fit or using one high on the damage dealer to transfer cap back or any number of other solutions
this stop spamming this important forum
maybe ccp could implement an option to blank the screen during warp for those whose sensibilities are hurt by warping through stuff
ccp could probably solve this by using some kind of graphical distortion that bends everything around the warp tunnel however i assume this would cause weaker graphics cards to cry big crocodile tears it might be nice to have something like this implemented as a graphics option so most people dont see the clipping issuealso op needs spell checker

not supported as well if t3s should be scannable next in line would be my jag it is hard to be unscannable at least in a loki that in and on itself is a drawback
i see there was a vote against the localization of the csm logs im currious why meissa voted against not that its very important just curriousedit more elaborately if the worry was the increased workload on ccp and isd why worry about it when its a job and people get payed for it anyway i mean isnt that like complaining about garbage disposal because it sucks that its needed even though people make a living doing it
the proposal specifically stated to ability for player volunteers to submit translations and thus not increase the load on ccpisdthe comment about it being somebodys job isnt accurate in this context because this would be a new responsibilityrather than require ccp to commit more time to this and thus less time to other things we suggested that volunteers could be given the tools to do the translations instead of course if this system works there is nothing to stop ccp doing more official translations in the future but we need to start somewhere speaking of which i notice that the links on the wiki now contain en which makes me wonder if the wiki is setup for multiple languages
thanks for the quick responsethe solution is fine so is the outcome but it still had a nayvote and i didnt understand the reason

id bet you isk the ships lostsubscriber to pve will be much lower than those pvp figures id also bet my entire account that the isk value in a given month of ships lost to pvp exceeds those lost in purely pve pursuits how many people lose titans to mission ratsyou can point to 62 shipssubscribers and say its low but as you note the vast majority of accounts are currently in empire not to mention that a fair number of eve players have indy and pvp accounts the fact is that stat points out that on average well over half the accounts on the server experience a pvp ship loss once a month whether they are looking for it or not  and dont get me started on the numerous ways people avoid recorded ship loss in pvp even when they are on the losing end of an engagement docking games neutral rr self destruction and lets be honest empire supports a much higher proportion of macroisk farmerisk seller accounts than lowsec00wh space accounts which literally do nothing but npc see stats on unholy rageid say with less than 30 of accounts residing outside of empire raising that number to over half a subscriber indicates a high level of impact that would support the argument that the demand of that 30 is what makes the activity of the empire care bears worthwhilebelieve me i came to eve from matrix online where the only way items went out of game was gradual wear and tear through pve pursuits that economy was dead in like 3 months in eve you dont even have wear and tear aside from ammo consumption which doesnt even apply for drones and lasers the fact with eve is that unless youre still learning how to do we pve activity youre engaging in death is a rarity even c6 sleepers get regularly manhandled by practiced groups of pvers tune in to the planet risk show for evidenceyou are correct that really only ccp holds the definitive answer to this though all i can do is highlight the indications that show pvp to be a much higher and much more consistent source of demand than purely pve pursuits
i would like to see stats from ccp about ships lost in pvp and pve and their total values before continuing this itll be pretty futile otherwise
i suspect that the huge majority of non pvp losses are to concord and insurancefraud selfdestructsas it is 299000k subs with 067 losses per sub per month is 200000 pvp losses per month thats a hell of a lot of ships modules and rigs to keep the industrial side ticking overi would be very suprised indeed to learn that true pve losses ie excluding concord and selfdestructs were even a tenth of this figure if you disclude learning losses from accounts less than say 60 days old i would guess that the figure falls even further
even pure pve mission runners engage in pvp every time they sell their mission lootpvp is player vs player it doesnt require ship vs ships without ever firing a shot you can engage in pvp by trading reactions moon mining invention mining seriously you can go mine roids to stop others getting them all etcas more and more stuff moves from npc production to player production yay for planetary interaction there are even more opportunities for pvpand this is why eve is so much more interesting than other games
i never classed that stuff as pvp i use the original meaning of pvp which is combat between players causing a loss or two or more players fighting not this new definition some eve forum users like to useif you play on a no pvp server or in a no pvp zone you still have trading and resources if you buy a pve game it never ever lists trade and resource gathering as pvp in fact i cannot think of a single game not even pvp games where you list trading and resource gathering as pvp in the features if you look up a list of pvp games it always about combat only features about pvp are always combat relatedthe term pvp originated in reference to players killing players hence the verse bit of pvp why all of a sudden do we have to change its meaning to refer to pretty much everything pvp meant combat between players for something like 20 yearsteadaze said  pvp is player vs player it doesnt require ship vs ships without ever firing a shot you can engage in pvp byit does require a player to be competing against another player pvp requires a player verse another player when i sell mission loot i am not competing against another player so there is no verse another player when i am mining i am not competing when there is plenty to go around same for reactions and moon mining still even if you are competing pvp feels wrong as its a combat team not a generic cover all player competing against another player team and now i wrote far too much about something i shouldnt have responded to  thanks for the fun lets pvp on the forums some more
yes
yes
i agree font type and size should be adjustable i would like to have really big and easy to read letterseven better would be to get the option to customize your user interface like in other games that would outsource a problem of eve in a way
fixing rockets themselves would go a long towards fixing this problem not that im disagreeing with the motion for a fourth bonus it really is neededagree absolutely i also seriously think the wolfs shield and armour resistances should be swappedhere i agree as well the enyo is a much maligned ship in need of a boost
full on support i love flying assault frigates but theyre way out of whack balancewise
yes to this
what i only stated that most afs need a boost but the ishkur is not one of them balanced  equal would you think that a wolfs style would be even similar to an ishkurs style even when desirability would be similarcould you point out where i stated that afs should resemble one another other then in desirability
signed
projection much lets compare postsyoursmineim talking about dps and im proving that the hype is thoroughly outclassed as is and with the boost would still find itself quite in line with lasers for the damagerangethen stop bringing them upwe have done the proper analysis you apparently havent if you think 490 damage is all that extraordinary an output for a hype to be at a point that it would only reach after the 15 damage boost were proposing youre also continuing to fail to propose an alternative to more damage im open to suggestions and even new information but you have to produce some not simply reargue the same points that were put down pages ago myself i think that either a direct damage boost or a damage boost in the form of rof with some big reductions to cap use would be appropriate if you have ideas share them
you realise you are the only one harping about pulses right self awareness is good to have though i applaud your sinceritythank you for being so sincere and self effacing you have made your point i agree no need to bash yourself any more 20km is the difference between 170150km if you fly in sniper fleets you know what does that meanyou do a pretty good job of it yourself no need us to help you do thatwhere is that proposal you are talking about againi did my analysis and presented it therefore this wind bagging must be what you are up to rightthings like 10 more pg 15 more damage and 10 less optimal maybeour kb disagrees a scout does wonders support is an important asset and if you think that an rr fleet is going to be the absolute answer you are deluding yourself the only real problematic encounter we had in our sniperfleets was genos with nanoed macharielsas for stealth bombers 7 bombs are 56k damage if you see more than 8 bombs the sbs are fail and the bombs ineffective if you are there for the 2nd wave and havent warped out you are doing it wrong
ill take this bait just for a giggle ive already said a decrease to fittings and a change to capacitor use are the things id start with im not going to provide actual numbers because without testing you can never be sure of those until the actual patch i would also have a 3rd modifier on hold which i would use if those 2 changes didnt appear to do enough for rails that 3rd mod would most likely be a change in range modifiers on t1 ammos i would say changing all ammo for by an increase in 20 range would be a good 3rd option as a back up that means am would be 30 redux iridium would be a 50 boost to range etc that would help both gallente and especially caldari big time with both rails and blaster fits theres nothing in the books that says ammos have to be between 50 and  60 so this seems like a very viable fix to gallente weapons obviously t2 short range would really need a fix if this were to go in effectobviously you are eft warrioring and speculating about bombers if you really think thats how they work we warp 2040 bombers on top of enemies in 12 waves as do many of our opponents and have no problem landing 80 of the bombs if not more the reason that works is no matter what the first 8 bombs are going to hit also it takes 351 seconds of separation between bombs for 0 damage to be inflicted on by one on the other with lag and personal delay and peoples very slow nature to get into warp and to load grid this is virtually nothingi dont honestly know who ushra khan could possibly be fighting over there in napville in large numbers i do however know how badly it performed against goons bombers how most people fair against ch and evoke bombers and how the nc and russians up north have done with their bombers any sniper fleet is usually dead within about 15 seconds of landing on grid these days up north even if they use anti bomber tactics they lose a chunk of bs that are close enough anyways remember bombs have a 30km diameter of effect and for the record ive only brought up pulses because some deuche is trying to disprove my faith in rails because ive flow a ton of pulse ships lately i honestly love the sniper hype ive just seen 0 reason to fly a sniper ship in the past 4 months
which would do absolutely nothing i can already fit 8 railguns on a hyperion or 7 railguns on a megathron  how would decreasing the fittings result in any change whatsoever to their ability to output damage how would it boost the rokh back up to being a viable sniper againim not really following the logic here the only thing youd do with the extra cpupg would be to fit a bigger buffer but how does that help balance railgunshitting at 30km like a wet noodle is the same as hitting at 60km like a wet noodle the only time that changes is when the target is scrammed altering the ammo ranges would do very little to help their performance it doesnt fix their alpha their tracking their dps or their limited damage typesi love lady gaga but that doesnt mean people dont look at me funny when i tell them for a very good reason 
lol what are you suggesting it ever was a viable sniper it is hard to fit with an armor tank few low slots does jack for damage and cant track to support itself outside a blobif you love it you would fly it if you dont fly it then perhaps you only like the way it looks
i would like to have at least 2 orbit ranges that would be easy to access maybe right clicking the toggle is betterand then if you want to set it you have to ctrl click or ctrl right click same with keep at range commands

i personally didnt have the pleasure of running these story line mission but will gladly run one and see if its so hard the op said it was but just the fact that these things arent optional for the people that arent in the killing business eg pvp or fw that is just wrong and yes like is posted bfor u will discourage more players for the gallente fw by these missions as they will get whacked often by some pirates and other fw players  also pirates  so i hope that some of the csm will get this discussedgate camping is a fun part of the game removing that or putting a 200 km lol 10 around a low sec gate is just ludicrous people should first go in in something fast and cloaked or a shuttle or we cheap to check out a low sec gate also the map can shed some light on heavy camps and there are other routes to these low sec systems but they will take longer to get therebut supported to get this fixed optional is the best way if u wanne risk your marauder or navy ship on a low sec mission it should be your choice to do that mission and get somewhat more lp or faction standing then a regular storyline mission
over the last couple years i ran the idea of swapping out the map browser with a navigational panel by several people and they liked it and wanted me to post it here on the forums finally i have some time i am willing to spend laying it out visually the concept here is to streamline what we already have at our disposal reconfiguring so that information we want is closer together and as few as clicks away as possibleif you are a little confused about what each section does please read the description video may follow if it is still confusingthe conceptflag icon common destinations this basically takes places you have in your bookmarks and makes them easily accessible ideally users would setup their own groups call them what they want and have as many drop downs as they want planet arrow icon current routethis combines the information we have on the left with the information we can get from going to the star map four bars icon  solar systemtaking the only useful info from the map browser and moving it heregradient outline ball icon proximityfocusing on the system you are in gives you information about the system you are heading to and some additional information about adjacent systemswhycommon destinations  right people either use the note pad or their assets window for common destinations ive even setup specific chat channels with motds for common way points using the systems in place now works but being able to click drag destinations into a navigation specific window would be ace in my bookcurrent route  if you have several systems to stop in unless you are on autopilot you may skip right over them because the info on the left of our screens does not say when to stop the best way to see the info is in the mapautopilotway points tab even though you have your overview available you can not see the space around you and getting the sense of what is around you is even worse if you have a travel overview setting merging the mapautopilotway points tab with the standard autopilot navigation info on the left into a specific tab would improve the clumsy feel we have now of getting that same informationproximity  all to often you have to find an alternate route sometimes you have to find it quickly and fumbling around menus is extremely frustrating it is information that we already have it is just extremely difficult to get it all at once the proximity window solves this it gets most pilots who would need a navigation tab the info they want
this is most excellent thanks you for taking the time to make a spiffy ui mockup i can see this going places can i take out a box off the panel since you plan to remove the route stuff on the left itd be nice to let me take out the current route panel and place it somewhere i like also wouldnt the optimize and clear waypoints button be better placed within the current route panel
specifically like the proximity map
id definitely use navigation stuff more if eve had this supported
not a bad idea
being able to rightclick systems in the route easily would be huge fcs could set end destination and right click broadcast destination on systems along the way much more easily potentially the fc could see how many fleet members are in each system of the route being able to interact with the route more easily like that dramatically opens up all sorts of things that would be useful
agreed this is a nice proposition for the csm there is the proximity feature that is on itself a nice thing but will eliminate the scouts for a part and make things a bit easier in eve which is a good or a bad thing depends how u look at itsupported

yes something should be calculated to make the planets make sense this should be added before tyrannis after that is can no longer be feasibly done why then planets are more then just backdrops they are part of the active game changing them then would be a player nuisancei also support moving planets bookmarks would be more interesting but that is of less importance than a living universe

i lost multiple ships due to this issue one time i was sitting in a pos that was under siege looking around suddenly i was outside the pos and got popped within seconds before i could even turn around
 this thread
did it occur to you movement noobs that all you have to do is click the 0 ms spot on your throttle to stop your ship regardless of whats going onyeah not supportingalthough that idea de highlighted might be good
weve got a pro here everyone he read the threadthis idea is for people who have problems with their mice sending them careening off into space just because their mice are old sadly a perfectly functioning mouse for most things can still be a broken mouse for eve all this thread proposes is that you enable a way to prevent further movement input by pushing a button or somethingthats it
just curious  what stops you from getting a new mouse it seems to solve the problem for the other people
yeah unless the request is for ccp to provide a good mouse to each player to to fix this problem i dont think this is in the realm of bugs exploits proposed changes or general issues that need to be addressed as such this thread should be locked
supporting this more then the space anchor as that is a bit unrealistica space anchor mmh i cant imagine any sort of feature a space ship or station has for this all things in space are floating around the only thing that stops something in space is a counter force those stabilizer things
everything in this is awesome but the drone modules are contentious indeedthe csm argued in favour of boosting drone modules  rigs but it was declined due to gallente ships ultimately performing better than all others  your proposal gets around this by removing the general weapons dedicated droneboats are also a bit sticky being that your primary weapon can be destroyed or otherwise lost through logout  warp as far as the drone control  bandwidth  bay size suggestions go its worth noting that a berserker drone is approximately the same physical size as a heron frigateeven if its a little rp its illogical for a frigate to launch frigatesized drones so thered need to be controls on thatlove for the eos

nobody forces you to train sp without stop if you dont need all those skills to fly cheap crap why do you keep training how about training your alt to reasonable level insteadjust because many people are lazy and stupid dont realize the choices they have doesnt mean ccp should keep dumbing down the game for themeve is one game where the stupid actually fail and forced to quit ccp already made a lot of cuts and simplifications to gameplay as a result the average intelligence of eve online community has dropped significantly  as anyone who played from 2004 can confirmlets keep the average intelligence above 4chan level
because i want to fly the expensive stuff to i fly everything sub capital from frigs to deadspace fit pirate ship in pvp and have no intentions of training capital skills ever and im still far from flying everything sub cap and i have alts 9 of them in fact whereof 5 of them have clone costs before implants at 20m also pointing out again none of them have capital skills why the heck should i have to grind for at least an hour just to replace my clone unimplanted because i want to go roam in 00 in a frigcruiser or 23 hours if i dualtriple account at that rate it is cheaper to dualtriple account with t2 fit battleships in lowsec seriously unless this gets changed im going back to exclusive low sec pvp ccp wants more people in 00  see what increasing clone costs do exactly the opposite also how is more pvping instead of grinding bad
counter strike has more pvp than in eve you want counter strike in spacemaybe besides the free clones you want free ships and insta spawn in new equipped shipped why market grind when we could have more pvp if we simply spawned in system of death with new ship with same fittings wed have tons of pvp thenor perhaps what makes eve pvp so special is because losing stuff actually hurts people
sorry where in any of the discussion about clone costs has there been mention of free clones apart from those against the ideano one is asking for free clones just a rebalancing of their costs
he does that a lotfor many suggesting an adjustment to the rate clone costs increase is equivalent to giving everyone a  cmd prompt option and a list of cheat codes
i think that a change is needed is a no braineri can understand the fear of making the game easier which should by no means happen but the problem with the clone cost is merely a undesireable use of a money sink which restricts gameplay options the real benefit of a high sp character is its versatility this reduction in versatility is surely not intentional this will not make the game easier in any way or even have a strong impact on the wallet of the older players but it will result in more active gameplay how to adress the problem is something that should be discussed as well but i guess it would be helpful to know that the devs are actually willing to change this cost distribution in some waythis problem will become even more apparent in the future it is only a matter of time before it gets dealt with in one way or another
i have never ever heard that on vent i cant believe that any pvper would ever say thatand i certainly pvp and 95 of the pvp that i do is in 00 in the last year pod losess have cost me lets see something like 300 million isk and im not even very good at pvp i just pay attention and  whenever possible  stay aligned if i lose a ship i spam the warp button my pod usually gets out thats all there is too iti get my isk from ratting and missioning no mighty trade empires or pos chains for me im too lazy and not really smart enough to do stuff like that and yet  somehow  i manage to find the 600k a day that getting podded costs me
supported always entertaining to see drake draconis in these thread posting about pvp and clone loss
even malcanis agrees dr whinesmithand i dont like his stance on eve economics ironythis goes for all of you when it gets right down to it your just too damn lazy to keep watch over your walletsthis game is spreading lazyness like a cancer
balancing clone costs is hardly going to be counter strike in space just instead of 1 cruiser you can now use maybe 23 making people much more satisfied over their night of pvping there is no one saying clones should be free or perhaps what makes eve pvp so special is because losing stuff actually hurts people stuffships not making old players not able to have some nights of cheap fun every now and then when were tired of flying bigger stuff
i support this ideaand i agree with everything adriaans has said p 
supported unfair to casual gamers
you can blitzkrieg only the initial assault taking a system takes at best 45 days with all the rf timers in defenders prime time its not like your 50 dreads come out of blue when defender has 2 days of rf timer to stare at and organize defense fleet for particular time in his prime lets take for example dg in providence i would say that no matter what amount of stations would have been in the system the outcome would have been the same even without defenders inexperience dealing with lag as far as saying that 50 dreads cant stay around 2  3 hours that just silly i have seen dreads sitting in pos during 40u campaign for 2 weeks straight 45 h a day waiting for action if you are taking over station system where defenders do actually turn up you do not go home you stick to it until job is done the rf timers make damn sure that there is absolute max numbers present on both sides if defender cant bring that big blob he loses and if he can he wins regardless if attacker has to kill 1 outpost or 20

seems like it would make sense to divorce them from the item database then wouldnt it the server doesnt struggle to load all your skills what levels they are at etc they are just there either you do or dont have it and it has stats which are value it even goes one step further and shows you ones you dont have but qualify for and ones you dont at all if you so desire i therefore assert that you could do the same thing with blueprints it only needs to show whether you do or dont have one what its mepe is and that you have created y amount of copies for use as well all that would look clean on one menu each in its own row for the purposes of theft which you repeatedly insist this is avoiding an inside man who would be able to steal anything anyway could by clicking eject and take the whole thing whereveras far as the more conventional kinds of theft that occur when the inevitable mistake is made traveling around you could just assume that it is either located in your pod or in a little black box or whatever the pirates could then scoop it and remove the parts they are interested in and trash the rest when they get it home pretty simple no evasion of theft involveddi mulle thank you for the helpful pointers i am a big fan of the blueprint tab i think it would be even better if it were organized by manufactured item type and not location dropdowns the blueprint hangar is a terrible place to go for information and i continue to assert that it doesnt need to be therebagehi i think the idea of hackingintercepting player communications and inventory sounds especially appealing but even in modern electronic communications confidential data is transferred in such a way as to be almost impossible without performing an exhaustive search that would only yield pitiful amounts of data for more information you can read on aes cryptography 
you forgot to tick the suppport this topic box
this in particular will give us the best idea of just how many excessminerals are out therenevertheless it wont be perfect as not all ships built for selfdestructing have been selfdestructed so maybe it would also be helpful to look at the stats of tier 3 bs built recently compared to a year ago

thatd be good but just in case it doesnt go through maybe its the tons of exhumers littering the belts
quick question before i reply in full you say you have petitioned this and you insinuated that the petitions were upheld in some fashion does ccp consider use of these tactics to be illegal exploits for which they punish players for using
the only one that is being considered an exploit quietly is the deep deep deep space log off trickyou log in and log off log in log off log in eventually you end up in the ass end of the systemand thanks to grid fu you end up on the overview a kajillion au away from destinationwe caught some prick doing this in one of our systems the gm actually shoved his shiny carrier butt in the station because someone got screenshots to prove it of which we camped 237 until he managed to sneak out using the same damn trick right after downtimethey said they havent publicly announced it as such so what im saying is likely going to be disproved or mehd and still require proof not easy consideringthe only reason thats being even considered as such mind you is due to the fact its abuse of said mechanicdisconnections and logoffskiesas ive said before pull the ethernet cable from your tower and the server doesnt have a damn clue what your doingthe moment you get that figured out is the moment you understand that while this mechanic sucks it isnt as simple to fixall thanks to tcpipif anything there needs to be a change for when you log back in should be the exact same spot regardlessand perhaps the best solution for that is that the said location remains stuck until your session timer double it if you need to expires then you can write a new locationshould be warped in long before it times outbut they likely have already fixed that with tyranis on the horizon and i do mean specifically thatyou will likely never get a ultimate solution to thisso while disconnections and logoffskies will be around the logging on process will be nailed down as its logically the only rational solution to trackits impossible to track disconnections because if you attempt to do so on the server side you will likely get accused of misjudging and ccp will never take that liability onthe last thing they want to do is deal with ship reimbursement complaints on that levelhowever if you log back in your going to log back in in such a way that it is entirely predictable within reason and if people camp that spot they will get a all be it brief window of opportunity to pod said person
so basically 1 is a glitch 3 is an abused safety feature and 2 is a ccp error somewhere 2  almost impossible to prove and the time it was proven in your above scenario the gm placed them in a station which he later escaped from using the exact same tactic im going to assume a little something here that the people supporting this thread are lowsec nullsec primarily so i will reserve any vitriol for those i consider deserving of it as you said there really is not way to stop the logoffski trick wo punishing people who are not using it a friend was a victim of a dropout a couple of nights ago and ccp gave him the usual  we had no lag no our system so it was yours tuff luck i am going to surpise myself and support this proposal my first even though im a newb carebearmission runner right now ive been nailed in low sec 2 days into the game canflipped had some attempt to gank me and had ninjasalvagers in my corp mates missions these are people generally associated with pirates and low sec null sec dwellers im going to support this anyway im doing so really for one reason only its a flaw that should be fixed even if i consider other areas of the game to be broken some of which i cannot think of a fix for anyway not really despite the threads about them and im currently on the dead opposite side of you they should at least fix fix this so often it seems the dont want to fix or rebalance or even improve the damned font maybe if i can get them to setting people to fixing problems they will eventually get around to mine well that and i want to be able to use your own tactics against you in the near futuredone above poster was correct though this really should have found another way to raise this issue wo detailing what action is taken if i had the opportunity to use this against someone who had tried to gank me or ninja salved me i would in an instant just the thought of them spitting on their monitor in frustration brings a smile to my facegood luck with thisbloody pirates
just in case you didnt read the link  ccp will change that mechanic in tyrranis so the thread is already obsolete
1 the exploit is impossible to track because it usually occurs during a session change jumping into a gate camp and session changes are often when normal disconnects occur ever click undock and found yourself staring at your desktop instead2 im under the impression this trick has been solved to some extent current mechanic is that even if you do end up 700 au away it will warp you back eventually to where you started and there is nothing you can do about it however there is no reason the server shouldnt flag this and dump the character back at their original location for 2 hours just out of spite if it is done more than twice in a row3 not familiar with this but i live in the world where bubbles exist if this is the case it should be fixedso 2  3 should be fixed but 1 is just something we have to deal with until ccp finds a way to win at the internets and prevent disconnections from ever happening again

not supported in original formif there is no up an down how does one explain the obvious planar characteristics of a systemgalaxyuniverserotation  gravity can easily be incorporated into a system of alignment so updown is a matter of tasteperspective onlysince it is a matter of taste introduce an option in settings to turn it off but not as default
the planar layout is easily explained by rotational forces if the ship does not settle which i support it should be manually alignable to the plane and the everimportant checkbox to switch it on and off
does not work with ctrlspace the ship settles
supported because i would use this frequently ie i came out of warp within a giant veldspar cluster and therefore my manoeuvring options are rather limited i spotted a convenient opening right above me i dont want to get out of here just yet since the giant rocks make spiffy interceptors barriers i will want to get out fast if i have to i can double click right above me and do my best to manually set speed as near zero as possible just so i dont really move much yet my ship have its nose aligned where i want to when i need to get out of here i set full speed and right off i go laughing at the interceptor now stuck on a rockin short no autoleveling is nice because i can plan and setup an egress path without spinning the camera first see what i meanthe autolevel thing makes it an unperfect tactic since i can never really leave my ship pointing up without actually moving its bound to slowly move itself out of the cool hideout over time ill have to try the manual accelerate and decelerate commands it never occurred to me that it keep the ships heading even when at 0 ms its ctrl  and ctrl  respectively i think i never use this because i found it erratic in response and difficult to make it stop acceleratingdecelerating at will and at the speed i want hmm perhaps only trigger the autoleveling feature if you hit ctrl space a second time once the ship velocity is already or very close to 0 ms

i flew a bomber and as a diehard solo pilot bombing is one of the few things that actually work solo
it is done to make things pretty a real explanation is for ships to docktransfer materials etc if there is a set planeorientation absent that it is purely for aestheticsid support this if it makes warping faster otherwise i dont care there is no advantage to having the planet on my right vs the left etc
yes its ctrl and ctrl just hammer the ctrl until you slow down to 0 and youll keep your alignmentso not supported as the feature already exists
there is currently no way ingame to let others know that you have temporarily left the computer considering how important chat is in eve adding an afk button by which others can see that you are afk would improve chat functionalitythere would be several ways of implementing this for example it could be set per channel or global or only visible to corpalliance mates by default or customizable the exact details are arbitrary and up to ccp to decide in all its wisdom i have seen this mentioned in the past and recently have been poked about this again by friends hence this proposal sokevelopedia link
i find this proposal insightful smart and think it would totally make eve a better gamefakeeditwrong char
a commonly brought up issue was spyingand related to that  how do you address the issue how to configure those people can see it
how would spying be an issue if it is voluntary eg you can still opt to sit in spacestation for hours without letting anyone know youre afk like it is now
id support this if it were an option and not a requirement to make it global otherwiseno dice
so should i just go ahead and close this thread because it has already been discussed also what has not been or is currently been discussed between ccp and the csm so we know what we are allowed to talk about
i sent a mail about this to ccp cause its annoying having a discussion unfold thats basically had already in such a way that it makes me look like a douche because im not sure what i can and cannot tell yousorry bout that
well honestly not your fault if your bound by nda how can you possible talk about a subject that falls into thatat this point which will probably make a lot of people happy i just dont even feel like sharing ideas i have anymore as soon as an ideasubject comes under talks with ccp we cant communicate anymore with the csm about it nda thingthe system is broken
looks like you understand but miss the pointthe players in the hulks dont need the help to grab some isk to skill up and move off after doing the tutorials the players that jetcan need the help those are the ones who cannot fly the hulks but have to compete with them for the little ore available im glad you see my point but wonder why you dont support something even you see as obvious
what u fail to understand is thats the price u pay for this professionu want to reward the newbies for not using their brain to exploretry better ways to make isk besides the absolute easiest effortless way to do so this is not world of warcraft where the game is designed to force u to play a certain way u want better isk use a better way to get it
currently weapon damage and rof rigs take about 2x calibration points than all other important rigsconsidering that both damage and rof rigs are stacking penalized with ship damage mods is there any reason for their calibration requirement to be this highi have never seen any good reason for it and attribute this design flaw to damagephobia that ccp seems to be suffering from if it is a real condition then they should seek therapy but somehow find the strength to admit they were wrong and overcome their fears by fixing the issue
supported this is one of my pet peeves maybe cut the calibration of the t1 rigs to 150 and the t2s to 225
not supporteddamage rigs are fine they arent meant to be an omgwtf i can gank with my bc and 2k dps they can replace your damage mods thus leaving you with low slots for other important things they calibration points are high because they can be so effective in the right hands learn how to fit a ship other than maximize raw damage
as it is now the shield extender and armor buffer rigs are about 10x more valuable in pvp situation that a damage rigsjust 3 cheap buffer rigs are equivalent to a full grade slave set while it would take 2 damage rigs to achieve equivalent of 1 damage modif you are seriously concerned about rig balance in pvp and you are on the conservative side about how powerful they should be  you should also support changing buffer rigs to have same requirements as damage rigs am i correct
reducing them to 150 50 more than the utility weapon rigs would be near idealallows blowing two rigs in place of a damage mod and still have calibration for range tracking etc especially potent on small hulls and hulls with limited spare low slots if buffer module calibration is upped by 50 it still conveniently prevents faction hulls from being able to use 2 dmg  buffer rigsbuffer rigs really need to be looked at as well way too good for their meagre cost but not relevant to this thread unless title is changed
never had a problem here but then i tend to fit my ships differently fail fits perhaps but never encountered an issue with a short fall in calibration pointsperhaps you should start posting your fits to prove your case
agreeing on this
rarely see a reason to put a damage rig in regardless of the calibration points
it strikes me that giving damage rigs a boost like this would serve to further make active tanking more obsolete not supported
its quite the opposite actuallyright now pvp setups are dominated by buffer tanking rigs correctby making damage rigs a little more attractive it reduces the usage of buffer rigs which in turn increases the power ratio of active tank vs buffer tank
i cant think of a nonoffensive way to tell you how much that made my head hurt how would it affect buffer tanking worse than it would affect active tankingbuffer tanking is already preferable in any situation beyond small gang warfare where you have high incoming dps  more than an active tank can handle the more incoming dps the quicker the active tank will be overwhelmed and diein other words this would further increase the need for larger buffers to keep a ship alive long enough for either rr platforms to target and start repping or for it to find some kind of escape route or deal enough damage back in a short enough time to liveeither way it does nothing to promote active tanks
where do you get the active tank tangent from this is about a perceived imbalance of the fitting requirements of weapon rigs active tanking vs buffer tanking is an entirely different beast altogether with its own multiple proposals floating around
as i have said above sure you can make it completely lifelike if you want to and i will be all for that but what i am trying propose here is a compromise
i worry that frigates would be too easily hit by weapons when they are orbiting close this has merit in rl physics too think an xwing fighter flying between the death stars guns if anything it gets harder for a large ship to hit a frigate the closer the frigate is because it can fly between the big ships gunsdoesnt mean i dont like the idea maybe the signature radius increase would only occur with hulls of equal or greater size this would approximately take into account the fact that smaller ships could fit between the guns and ships of the same or larger size cant fit between the guns
i think it would be a good move to give corp management the ability to assign pos roles by size as smalls and mediums typically have less influence and utility than larges they should be opened up to more players the problem as it stands currently is that you cant offer someone the right to plop down a personal pos without granting them full access to the large towers as large towers are typically half of the equation in sovereignty atm due to the location of bridges high end moons and jammers most corps refuse to just grant access willy nillyso lets create corp roles that can be grantable specifically to the size of a tower or maybe even go a step further and allow racial designation of tower control to corp members ie player a can only drop a small tower or gallente racial tower as a manager of roles in the past i know this would be a huge boost to corp managements abilities and give players more opportunities to sink money into towers
sure why notroles  corp management is awful though and is already something that needs desperate attentionwhy not bundle this withinthered need to have a separate attribute on the ct that designates which size it is but if that were tied into role management itd probably be possible a lot of extra tables sure but thats up to ccp i guess
supported
with the number of abandoned towers i see floating about in wspace i think it would make sense to allow for seizure of an offline tower by another corp would make sense to tie it to hacking as well possibly new modules or drones to assist in the process
this topic has nothing to do with 00nothing to do with rattingnothing to do with how much isk is in your walletnothing to do with alliances or how they operatenothing to do with how many hours a day you play or how often you grindit is simply about high sp characters being locked out of small ship pvp by a mechanic that forces them to fly bs or higher to get value for money
an ingame brute force type program would be cool as long as it also takes as long or near as long as a real bf program the owners would then have an opportunity to notice that something is out of the ordinary and do something to protect his cargoas for people who do use the same password as their logins the game should easily put in some features to prevent this it could be as simple as a notation in the password field saying make sure not to use the same password as you login or as complex as actually comparing a players container password to their login password and denying its useon the brute force side players could be able to create a bf dictionary of say 100 words or combinations only that their bf program can use the user would not know which one was the proper one thus making it still a little cryptic only that they gained access players would have to fill in all 100 bf pwords to cut down on the chance of knowing which one it actually was yes i know not fulll proof to some of you script kiddies but hey what is
actually the devs dont think otherwise highsec was meant to be just that concord is supposed to protect players with a reaction time dependent on the security level of the region the problem is that ccp like most in the industry vastly underestimate the tenacity of players to find workaround to the game mechanicson a side note technically you can already get concord to babysit you with a full reaction force for several hours no reason to pay for anything or develop new skillspersonally i dislike ganking of miners only cause its like beating up puppies what is the honor in that however i realize that its part of the game and to some deviants its an enjoyable outlet to their add lifeif you take away miner ganking and gatestation camping where else would pirates be able to destroy other players the game would be too out of balance in favor of carebears and that would destroy evered
the issue at hand is not only pvp through storylinesthe issue islowsec missions gravitating around a few systems easy campablemissions take ages to travel to and from related to the formermissions are somewhat hard for their level but the ships you might be willing to take there cannot take that if you are newmissions are given out through l1l2 agents as wellloot does not reflect riskonly one faction gets these missionsif these issues are adressed i see no problem with the idea of low sec missions
interesting however this solution was looked upon and what i realised was that it would fix sniper issues only at the upper range increment how would you go when the fc calls for short range high damage ammo and how would this affect blasters when i suggested this same approach for them i was shouted down by most gallente pilots who were asking for facemelting damageby the way i bolded the contradiction with the rest of your post unless you provide numbers you are just doing wishfull thinking out loud better to have the balls and say i did the analysis and the numbers are in this ballpark than say that you wont give numbers and then proceed to do soyeah i am doing eft warrioring without any kills losses or engagements this is after all a faceless altoh waisarz is focused on guerrilla tactics hacs and recons we do more straight up in your face fights than sb utilization however we do have a very capable element specialised in this kind of operations i am one of the few that actually enjoys flying bs hulls to be honest as far as uk we initially lost a few fleets now we fare a lot better and use more assets than fleetbs to achieve objectives for more info we have to duke it out and see how it goes it could very well be that we have only faced failbombers but personally i have been bombed repeatedly and survived to comment on the failed bomb run many times

it seems unrealistic to the genre to allow live people to inhabit a cargo hold but not a container why would a cargo hold include life support heat light air its more than just silly its absurdinstead i propose that all livestock including people cannot be transported in a bare cargo hold and instead a specialist life supporting containers is required to transport people livestock etc there could be several type of container for each class of livestock basic for animals coach for slaves economy marines the homeless  refugees first and vip etconce tyrannis is introduced moving colonists around could become much more important

this game should not become just another casual gamer space fpsin this game losses should have meaning losses should hurt
this argument is stupid stations are a logistical backbone not defenses if you whant alliances to be able to concentrate their logistics you will need more then one station per system obviously taking the station over takes time what you whan to get it for free if someone invested money into building multiple stations it will take more effort to take that away from him that much seems obvious to me there isnt an artificial limit on amount of people you will crash teh server thats a technical limit they are two different things
allow stations to change hands but disallow any station management unless sovereignty is held ie anyone can dockundock until system outcome is determinedor go even further and disallow access to services entirely unless sovereignty is held you can dockundock providing a beachhead but not much elsewant to take a multistation system make sure you have the logistics in place and the manpower available because it is going to be a long slog
the point is that it takes multiple days for a system with a single station alreadyso having multiple outpost in one system and having to take them one after each other is just stupid
this argument has already been dealt with why are you still going on about it
it seems that you finally will request a big code rewriting for some minor rp purpose  if every basic mechanics stay in place btw some good technical discussion about technical topic one of the many in recent years ofc is here not the op himself he is rather hysterically ignorant but answers are quite explaining
hi mulle thank you for the link it lead me back to a thread with more official responses then the usual speculative rebuttals industry requests attract im assuming an unfair amount of insight into the games code but i dont think it would be the most difficult rework ever put on the table that few of the core elements need to change would be a big help the industry process works very well and i would like to keep it as much as possiblethe rp element of the proposal why would super secret blueprints be carried around on disk when ftl communication is safer faster and cooler has its own merits i dont think that merely citing it as an rp change means it should be discounted it is however worth suspending until someone has a good idea how to preserve the occasional theft or disastrous loss of data good chance to add some sort of carrot that would entice players into willingly moving them around or risking them would make for great lulzregarding the other half suspending the blueprints from the item inventory that has technical merits if i correctly understand ccp lingorm from this thread i think there is some ground to stand on removing the blueprints from the item hangars could result in some performance boosts in that it would reduce the number of inventory queries to a tiny fraction and possibly even the number of calls to the relevant differential tables as well that differential data is what is important blueprint queries should go directly to itill come back later with an awesome ms paint flowchart and a photoshop concept image perhaps that will help
1010 would support again
1010i am concerned about the ability of ccp to accurately come up with figures regarding meta0 items though i am not saying it cant be done but knowing if a melted 425mm railgun i came from a mission was built using minerals from a different melted mission item or built using minerals from a different item that was originally built using mined material is most likely a nightmareplease please please include a full disclosure of the methodology employed in determining such things so the player base can have meaningful information we all know the results of data can be heavily scewed by the collection method used aquiring it

ship alignment is a critical component to the game add an option to turn off autolevel ship would be helpful
i think this was mentioned bfor somewhere on a live dev thing but a long time ago and like it goes it gets forgotten so yes eve needs a afk button
i deliberately left the details open and let me explain why if we bring an idea to ccp their response will be either no no but or yes but followed by argumentation based on game design game philosophy and technical limitations it is impossible for us to completely anticipate on their answer in advance hence bringing forth a proposal that is final eg that wouldnt have gotten support if it wasnt for all the fine details that have been worked out already servers little purpose as ccp wil always be giving their own spin on it before it makes it into the game
i think beeing able to anchor a pos anywhere in space at a safe spot for example would be realy nice no looking for moons if you just want a mining pos or a lab posit also will be harder to find you realy have to scan for them instead of just flying to moons and check
imagine what would happen to high sec
who the hell said eve should be nice no terrible idea plenty of moons out there
i hear there are about 2500 wormholessix classesthat leaves about 400 holes per classwe live in wh space for a long time now and we have noticed the holes getting more and more crowded to a point that 9 out of ten holes are occupiedthe point im getting at is we need more holes to be able to make it all still worth the risk and effort of staying thereit used to be great in the wormholes but the fun is subsiding fast if you get gangked every day of the week
you live in a c1c2 with regular entrances to highsec
i think a lot of people would agree that the amount of titans in game nowadays has become somewhat absurd and if this trend is to continue eventually fleet combat will be entire fleets of titans one shotting each other with doomsdays i have a proposal to reverse this trend that i would like some constructive feedback ontitans were originally meant to be so expensive in mineral cost that alliances could only possibly afford one however this is not the case as alliances seem to make so much money that the cost of a titan is almost trivial what i suggest is a concept that will not be unknown to strategy gamers and is quite apt as a titan is a strategic asset i am of course talking about upkeepi propose that to operate a titan an alliance should need to pay a monthly upkeep cost the price of which should be high enough to make it economically unfeasible for an alliance to maintain an increasing amount of titans and still manage to remain solvent this cost would have to be dynamic to stop it becoming trivial to afford over time
why dont we wait and see what until the full effects of the dominion changes have rippled out titans and motherships are being used a lot more in much more dangerous situations than before and many more have died in the past months than in the time before the changebesides upkeep costs for a ship that is permanently in space would be silly what if the pilot goes afk from game
we are aware of the effects it failed supporting
oh reallyi saw more titans die after dominion than before
derp
the cost would be optional failure to pay would simply stop that titan from being able to move that month which is just the same as the pilot being afk from evei dont see a problem with alliances having reserves of titans but only being to deploy a selected few
there have been like 5 legit titan deaths in about 3 full months of game play thats not out of the ordinary compared to pre dominion numbers of those 5 not counting the server  up on pl i think 4 were acting solo and stupidly that was a similar problem before the change and an increase in stupid people or people just doing stupid things seems to coincided with an overall increase in active titan numbers in game so its hard to credit any of these deaths to good old fashioned killsas for the op idea no i do agree that there needs to be a wait and see approach atm hopefully the devs will make some major changes to titanmom mechanics that will prevent a lot of this gayness from continuing go figure my prediction was right its becoming far to common to siege towers with just super capitals and a large support fleet rather than use dreads that can be 1 shot and get stuck for 10 minutes and warp scrammed by towersthanks ccp really show you thought this one out
regardless of the circumstances thats 10 titans lost in three months and there have been many occasions where titans were fielded got tackled but survived due to hax luck or skill motherships are once more useful and 2 died just yesterdayim sticking to my original post the effects still need to ripple out people are still adjusting to the new situation
but lets be realistic in the same time way more new titans were most likely produced than destroyed
thats probably true but its become less easy to build them with the new sov mechanics many titans are however never used in combat and thus are no problem for anyone
tecnically correct but now that those wars are decided and the large blocs are at peacewith pl and goons gone a being on friendly terms with atlas and it and the nc doing god knows what there is nothing left to kill the remaining 300 titansit will probably be years before the power structures are shaken up again which means that supercapital numbers will increase just like they did during the last lull in large scale war between delve 1 and 2maintenance costs on what was supposed to be rare bordering on unique ships is pretty much the only avenue left to stop the numbers from increasing even furthersupported until ccp gets their thumbs out and makes sovereignty bills matter and discourages the vast empty spaces in nullsec sphere of influences
to reduce number of titans ingame simply fix the logoff timer on themhappened countless times that a titan was tackled but could logoff before enough firepower could arive to kill him in time thanks to the hp buff
bring more friendssay you got a well fitted shieldtanked titan with 50 mil ehp and you tackle him when he hits half shield he decided  this and logs off you now have 15 minutes to kill 25 mil ehp something that 4 motherships or 10 dreads can easily accomplish and thats not even counting possible dds of your own
as progression in the game continues balancing is necessary it would be far more practical to introduce a super expensive mobile titan killer that has the upkeep you are looking for but does not rob players who do not yet have a titan of the chance to fly one dont kill the dream kill the titan
imagine this titan logs off as soon as he is tackled
sounds like a good idea i likes

ive made my reason clearer and youve missed my point since i have to make it clearer and explain that i know the hulk pilots dont need help im saying they are jerks many of which are no longer noobs in any sense but mine in noob systems due to being afk poor skills macros etc a new player should see those jerks and the dwindling ore if there is any and realise i should go somewhere else to mine since a this system is lame with ore and b my tutorial agents have no more work for me those things added up yield no need to make concord into your personal mercenary when that isnt their mandate and as ive said before is something they dont dopunish people for theft your proposal has that change for a special reason i dont see warrants it if i can pay concord to protect the ore i jet into space why cant i pay them to protect my wrecks my unpiloted ship drones etc they are now for hire as npc mercs
i do understand and see your point however you are not looking at this for the perspective of the new player there is a lot to learn and time is needed to skill up for the move to unsafe space yes there are other places besides the initial system tutorial agents operate but if you notice i said 08 and higher this is a slight adjustment for the newer player to provide some cover even if its only for 30 to 60 days its better than having to put up with the jerks be they in a hulk fast striping or assault ship flipping and get some isk and encourage them to want to stay and play more as i have said before mercs are not always available for new players how long after you started playing did you realize that there were mercs available and how long before you could afford for them to come watch your back the idea of merc corporation to protect a new player is insulting everyone here because we all know they cost too much for a new player to afford even if the player were to hire someone in the system to look out for them flags are not transferablenormally i would dismiss your nonconstructive bantering bringing wow into this conversation but you are the type of person who is so far removed form the problem that you cannot see that this will allow people to play the way they want this proposal does not force anyone to play any different that what they already try to do now but are thwarted from by players like yourself new players have 2 ways to raise isk missions and mining if you canflip the mining method they you are the who is forcing them to play your way sorry if that robes you from your power trip but i want the player base to grow without people like you running them off to other games
its hard enough to justify using damage rigs over c3stank rigs as it is without making them hard to fit as well their power doesnt justify their excessive cost supported
this man speaks the truth yes i am grad you realised that more damage hurts tanks all kinds of themequally so active tanking needs adjustment
u are coorrect id sayi support this thread if i can get 3 armor rigs on ship i should also get 3 damage rigs on
some boards still cant take russian maybe german too killmails or fail at adding while trying to get it with wall of error textso might be good to use english for killmails in localized clients or add an options for killmail language
maybe report that to the killboard authors instead
interfaces and parts for making them drops in radar sitesjust fyi
you do realize how much dps a t2 cruise raven does right highest dps of all bs past 150km just takes all year for the missiles to hit at about 500 dps you would have to increase the damage of rails over 100 to compare potentially you misread the suggestion as a 100 increase it is in fact only 15 kind of a big difference
wouldnt a simple ammo fix like was done for projectiles solve this whole problem1 15 damage boost to hybrid long range ammo note not t22 15 optimal boost or 15 less optimal penalty to hybrid short range ammo again note not t2
we need moar o
ive been pulling for this for a while although instead of having the ships as tech 2 freighters i figured when i was pondering it why not an interbus or other neutral faction that does alot of transport carrier same stats as above but just a single new ship entering the game instead of 4either way i would love this addition to pieces 3

not supportedif the older chars were saved that much extra isk to get back into battle asap they forget the combat sp advantage they have over newer players who r much less effective and wouldnt be able to bounce back as often as the older chars because they dont make as much isk let alone have enough to stack a ton of backup ships in their hangar the older chars bouncing back that much more often would eventually kill off the newer players that much more often because of their higher sp and combat effectiveness and its already this way because keep in mind u can still have your ship blown upjust dont stay around and get podded simple as that
not supported eve needs more risk not less
last i checked if youre in a bubble you cant leave you dont make more isk by having 100 mill sp than having 20 mill sp either nor are you better in combat you are only more versatile
you got 100m sp that means you played mostlikely played much longer unless you bought the toon and player experience is worth much more than any spand if you played that long and still havent sorted out a stable source of income and there are plenty sorry but then you have to take the risk of undocking without an updated clone or you are out for the night dont fly what you cant afford to loose
geeif only we could take the risk out of 00 warfare for uoh wait then wed have to take out the rewards too to balance it go back to low sec or even high sec if u cant handle a loss
and guess where i and most others end up pvping regulary oh thats right its low sec while people whine that there is no pvp in 00 not only that but as clones dont need replacing after pretty much every ship loss due to bubbles one also flies more expensive stuff in lowsec rather than 00 and to the poster before after a certain skillpoint around 20m you dont make any more iskhour yet you end up paying much much much more to replace losses in 00 if i am to spend say 3b during a month in pvp in 00 id pretty much guarantee you that 1bill of that would be buying new clones not counting implants while if i was 20m sps id maybe spend 200 mill for new clones if even that for exactly the same performance ephemeron you got way to much isk and far to little clue on how to fit pvp ships going by youre fittings and balancing clone costs for older players is hardly going to make risk free pvp as you keep shouting out if clones costing 30 mill gets lowered to 20 mill to have a balance just what is the apparent huge issue you seem to have with it its not like mauraders are suddenly costing 5 mill isk

not supported i like the idea but the functionality already exists as it stands you can buy station containers which hold 1 million m3 and these containers can have a password put on them the station containers costs are next to nothing as well now if you wanted to lock down a station container after a preassigned number of failed attempts i could go for that
you do realize that all it takes to get the password for the station containers is hitting the retrieve password option right
just repack it and you get the contents so nope doesnt work as i didnt really understand the idea ill stay neutral for now

i think one should get tagged as afk after nothing happens in his client for 5 minutes gobally tagged i mean would sure take care of the afk cloakers also as you could see if the guy is moving or not
supporti think that there should be a similar flag for other things like fleet comunications
we can place pos strategically around 00 stations till you can even see them anymore cant see any downside to this idea pos right above jita 44 anyone
its shocking the lack of thought that went into thiswed have one pos shooting another pos pos guns camping war targets in jita 44i could have gone for anchoring a pos at planets before tyrannis thats about it
so can i anchor the pos on your maybe outside of jita stationdid you take the time to think this out or you just whining to whine
i would love my pos in an ultradeep safe to be indestructible because noone can find itbut i dont think thats fair to players that wouldnt like my pos to be indestructible
every now and then an idea comes along that is so terrible i feel like ccp should just shut the assembly hall down to stop the crazy from spreadingthis has been one of those ideas
wrong 910 of the systems not holes why can people not make the distinction calling a wspace system a hole is like calling jita a jumpgate that you see are inhabited perhaps you should look at other classes of systems if you want to profit that or start killing people in systems that have resources you wantit seems ccp have set us wspace in such a way as to force pvp over resources this is good if you want a stable and secure source of income then theres plenty of those of that in highsec wspace seems to be here for carebears with guns either get guns or get out before you loose all your investments to an attack
then he might well not have been there in the first place the dd as it is now is just an extra its the weapon dps that matters so a titan is only worth something when hes on the field shooting stuff
its funnyexcellent yes more titans died and no more kill all buttonwhich is what we wantedhowever the problem remains is that the big alliances have got sooooo much cash and resources that they can build 10 for everyone they loseim mean look at the last turnout 32 titans in a fleet  jeezzzz2 titans max allowed in system  simple
oh reallyi saw more titans builded after dominion than beforeyou see what i did here 
why do people think having lots of titans ingame is a problem only if they are being used can they be of any advantage
they might be still butthurt because they got one shot in their carriers
non of my characters have ever trained for a capital ship to be honest the whole capitals thing bores me however i played star wars galaxies back in the day and the same thing that is happening with titans happened with jedi if you create a top tier itemweaponclass that is supposed to be rare over time the player base will gravitate towards that goal because in mmos its all just a matter of time
you make it sound as if only alliances pay for titans i know several titan pilots that paid for their titans out of their own pocket and what about those titan pilots who arent members of space holding alliances or corps how did they get their titan there are a lot of those out there

while this idea is not perfect it is kinda floating in reasonable direction tbh i would ofc prefer fully dynamic mission generation and rewards
1 the learning curve involves being selfsufficient as in no mercs necessary if your jetcan is stolen from use your brainsecure container2 im so far removed from the game and yet ure not putting this in perspective ure just catering to ignorance and stupidity when a simple measure of using a secure container is all that it takes to make it 100 safe3 eve doesnt cater to either of the two and thats why its not wow we do not need more wow clones by implementing what ure suggesting4 u mentioned a move to unsafe space like its every newbies goal u do realize that not everyone wants to be easy cannon fodder like how u want them to play as well oh thats rightu dont want a sandbox eitheru just want it your wayagain5 technically ure still able to jetcan so u can still play the way u wantjust dont be surprised if someone finds and steals from it because u were too stupid to take precautions6 whats stopping a nearby hulk with his throwaway 180day alt from depositing his ore into his alts jetcan well thats not really helping the newbie at all when his competition with a much faster ore rate to begin with can mine even faster with less hauling see what happens when u dont think oh wait thats what u wanted in the first place because ure in that hulk haha 10 min of iskmaking afk time isnt enough for u so now u want 30 min u dont really want to help the newbies and u know itu just want it your way by coming up with a flimsy and utterly fail excuse because ure too lazy to make a couple of extra hauls im not on a power trip ure just lyinghorribly
well i just want to know if csm can ask to ccp devs why the old content abandonedccp created faction warfare than fairly abandoned what they did  few news some faction items after a lot of whining from player base and some medals to caldari side than forgot it once againccp created worm holessleepers talocans than abandoned what they did  some drop adjustments than nothing ccp creating tyrannis planeteray interaction pi im prtty sure after expansion and few fix patchs they will abandon that toowhats the point of those expansions just giving an apple candy for shutting up us  half baked stuff aint good

if you dont fix t2 ammo you arent fixing rails t1 ammo dosent play a particularily large role in long ranged weaponry unless of course a massive reduction in t2 ammo damage is proposed

this is one of the better ideas i have seen in a long timetoo bad csm is mostly carebear so your idea would get squashed by csm and ccp
alekseyev karrde and teadaze have both expressed an interest but really theres not much to show at this pointim speculating here but it would make sense for ccp to look at balancing frigate class weapons and ships at the same time as inventing the stats for t3 frigsgiven that ccps usual approach towards expectation management is to gag their employees until stuff gets to sisi i expect its all nda at the moment and any csm leaking info would likely be shot at dawn for a weekthat said it would be nice to see some participation from the csm in either this thread or the af one let us know what they think of the issues involved and how exactly they are prodding the devs
yes do this

faction standing hit went from 6 to 5 in gallente standings not really an option15 jump route half in low sec for a pitiful reward especially for a level 4 storylineit was not possible to do in a af a sb would of worked however lost that to a smartie bs on route  the reward was not worth the hasslethese are very badly thought out storylines that need to be binned asap it would of been more bareable if all factions had similar storyline missions however they do not back to doing soe missions until gallente are fixed
i would support points 2 and 3 but i dont support point 1 for the reasons stated here quoted below for those who are too lazy to click the link i would rather see ccp fix the missions than bin them entirely

signed and agreed after waiting for years for a all out war in eve we got a half apearsed faction warfarenow after waiting for years again for first person enviorment we get a kick in the balls go buy a xbox treatmentnext ccp will want everything to buy a ibm blade cause you have to run your own mini cluster at home to play

lul wutnooooo
i agree in principle but wars are quite useless for that experience undock in something even faintly threatening and the plated stationhumping command ship or bs will deaggress and dock up assuming theyre not playing in easy mode with neutral logistics of coursethe thing about wardecs that doesnt work is theyre very effective against noob corps without much experience and virtually useless against everyone else hey wardec coming in time to fill the shell corp  move out to lowsec  break out the npc hauler alts
corps of noobs and mining corps are worthless anyway people driving them to close render all members but the often egomaniac ceo a service as it is likely their next corp will be something more integrated with at least a combat wing and older players to assist the younger oneseve is a huge food chain while would you position yourself in the plankton roleif you just want to play with your rl friends guess what a chat channel is enough no need to make a corp
dude i totally suck at pvp but if i were to get wardecd ide take the minerals ive saved from all my mission running build a couple of rupturesrifters from the bpcs i have fit them with loot ive found and go have fun for a few days if it stopped being fun i would leave my corp in the capable hands of my alts and just continue on i mean cmon there are ways to get around this and yeah i pretty much suck  pvp but its not impossible either
i support this 100
youre losing 100m a day dude take an agony class or something
its called reckless rampages only way to get wicked fraps footage for vids
uh well if youre deliberately choosing reckless pvp then you have to deal with the consequences
coward pvp is as fun as doing missions or mining and a t2 fit rigged bs  100 mill heck sometimes i use more than 100mday in combat boostersand reckless pvp has nothing to do with this topic which is mostly do in lowsec anyway due to said clone costs
sorry but you you are full of i use combat boosters all the time they cost 35 mil a pop in a days worth of pvp you may use 23 tops thats 15 mil tops theres no way you can reasonably spend 100 mil a day on boosters  there are unreasonable ways tho such as using multiple improved boosters but if that were the case then clone costs would have been no concern at alli pvp in 00 all the time and on some days i lose 2 battleships a day and even so more than 50 of the time the pod gets away pod losses are less common than ship losses in both low sec and 00to say you choose to pvp in low sec simply because of clone costs is very dishonest clone cost may be part of that decision but only a small partanyway pvp is exciting precisely because losing stuff hurts people the cheaper pvp becomes the less different it is from counter strike in space the less excitement to be had
ohh the pod usually gets away when the ship dies the problem then is the 2550 jumps back to high sec thats usually bubbled and 4 strong boosters  100 mill on a 10 hour pvp day thats not too unreasonable especially if including the alts consumption also note the sometimes part as i quite obviously did not say per day and as an example of balancing that im quite sure wont make this anything closer to counter strike in space 30 mill to 2022 mill to balance the graph instead of an exponential growth thats what this topic is about
how can you justify spending 100 mil on several strong boosters where 10 mil worth of standard boosters does almost same job and at same time be critical of 20 mil clone costsif you like to spend big of the smallest of advantages then dont pretend to care for spending a little extra on high sp char clone those 71 mil sp are just the extra edge you willingly buyjust take comfort knowing that everybody plays by the same rules when you kill them they hurt too just try to kill them more often than they do you and then its all good
the difference is quite huge on some ships actually up to a few hundred points of eft tank compared to standard so for the cost of strong booster you get the effect of fitting factioncheap deadspace mods the boosters pay for themselves so to speak on most common shipssetups i agree its not though doesnt seem like this will change though so doubt you have anything to worry about 
idk about thatafter all alliances do need to defend their assets did u ever try stepping into their territory oh wait u mean pvp u can handle well in that case there probably isnt any doable pvp in 00 because news flash its not because of clone costsits because solo pvp is dead in 00 and low sec unless u dont mind spending hours roaming for a rookie ship deal with it
i would like to see that
the server does an awful job of detecting real network issue try it with a corpmate watching you  unplug your cable and ask him if he saw you ewarp the time the server will take to detect you are gone is more than enough to get you killed network events triggered ewarp dont really protect anyone in pvp but do a decent job in missions where the dps is usually much lessotoh ctrlq is acted swiftly upon making me support those issues a thousand times

my friends who need to know that im afk find out when i tell them in the chat channel no one else needs to know
there should also be an afm option in case i am away from the mouse but not the keyboardmy suggestion should be for corp chat and possibly alliance only leaning towards corp only since alliance is delayed
thats why i think it should be optional 
it would be great to have an afk button for each channel and another button to turn them all on at onceeditforgot to support
i find that logging out meets the requirement quite nicely save some wattage when away as a bonuswith the whole spaceblobbook thing coming this summer the whole idea of being afk becomes a moot point so no reason for this
afk cloakers will just use a macro to prevent any sort of automatic afk tagging theres no way to make them obey the rules of the game and ccp is not going to force them toi like the idea of an afk flag and support it
what are you telling me that you dont think a deathstar  undock point of jita 44 is a good idea come on thats has got to be the best idea ever however im a bitter vet and i want eve to stay the way it is so everyone is forced to endure the same amount of misery that ive suffered all this time so i wont support this proposal edit omg i cant do anything right today

you realize thata many titan pilots bought the titans from their own pocket and not from allianceb that moon mining got a nice nerf bat in dominionwelcome to dominion
dominion nerf nothing about moon mining before dominion its was passive income now its also passive income after my proposition its always possible than some pilot buy their titan but if some alliance must be began to work to buy their capital fleet that will be better because now its stupid some alliance loose 45 capitals one days and the days after with insurance un moon mining are the money to buy all of the lost
maybe ask the dyspro and prom moon owners before doing such a statement oh and while you are at it  talk to nc about all the nice technetium moons in the north

i tried asking for this earlier when the direction fw was heading became apparent with very little luck i might add  best of luck with a most righteous campaignmost societies have laws against murder speeding robbery etc all well documented acts and i doubt even you believe the existence of those laws or the documentation of what they cover are actually the cause of people breaking themfull support

id like to see no claims bonuses added to the insurance system just like in rl perhaps to be exhibited as a standing with the insurance corp cant remember its name atm similar to the way in which ratting affects concord standing  sec statusyou make lots of claims you pay more characters could have an insurance risk rating possibly mofifiable via a skill which decreases over time poor rating adds x to insurance cost low risk players may get a discount possibly only applicable to t2 ships where insurance is pointless atmthis would mean that new players have insurance access if they genuinely make a mistake insurance fraud rapidly becomes unviable as you get black listed by the insurance firm suicide ganking while initially effective destroys your insurance risk standing as well as concord standing
it is not the devs seeing it different it is just very difficult to find a solution that does not afford to change big parts of the game or the game play itself highsec pirating with 2 accounts is not a planned thing if it wouldnt be that dramatic for audit trails the most easy way would be to track down the items with their serials and simply ban the owners for exploiting with their accounts but well it is just a game and the loss of a vessel truely is sometimes dramatic but so far the gankers also are paying customers and ccp does not want to loose a single one maybe that point of view changes somewhen i would welcome it it is more easy to handle it that way than keep a char with cloaked bs in range and nuke the gimpos away when they attack but again u need to have 2 accounts for defending yourself properly since this again generates income to ccp i guess they will consider to leave it as it is for the gain of profitcheers
pirates are supposed to be in the lowsec problem is that even an ant has too much brain to fly into lowsec for pvp interested players 0sec is great no faction hits great to roam around and kill stuff lowsec is kinda worthless since the only prey there are pirates they dont have loot worth mentioning they dont have the guts to fight on skill just on numbers lowsec is as today just a difficult part of the galaxy you have to pass when you flying into 0sec on the other hand only skilled players pass lowsec since 0sec is the thrill so i guess there isnt much left for pirates orby trying to exploit game engine weaknesses in form of abusing trial accounts for ganking this is the last chance for pirating this kind is not pvp it is pking pks are the kind of antisocial individualists in each community who are not needed or wanted it is the same discussion as trying to make psychpaths being logical necessary for all mankind though those freaks existbut since they are only able to attack new players and unexperienced players it might be considered as existing and annoying if there is a solution one day great if not well i can live with it cheers

a crap ton of clueless people aroudn for gods sake you cannto balance thigns only on a 1 type vs other type of weapon you need to find flavorrs for each type of turrets proj hybrids and lasers just pumping out admage up and down solves nothing but to push the inbalance to other weaponhybrids i think must be balanced with somethign different what i proposed a few times make each range of t1 ammo have 2 ammos with same range example plutonium and am one having a bit more damage  bit more than now but less tracking other less damage but quite more tracking because you need more than 10 tracking to compensate 10 extra damage that solves most of the issues that blasters have been suffering since web nerfthe rails are more complicated you cannto comapre rail platforms only to the apocalypse because its the king if you balance to it then again arties become crap  best way to balance large rails push locking range limit to 300 kmrails already have one advantage that most are forgetting here they are way easier to fit than tachyosn and 1400mm on their main platforms so if you want 425mm to have more damage then you also have to push up a bit their fitting requirementstachyons can and should get some light rebalance simple one is increase their cap usage so that even an apoc cannot fight for tooo longother more interesting one give mega beams and tachyosn different roles make tachyons keep current damage but drop to mega beams range make megabeams keep current damage but go to tachyosn range so now ammar have to choose between 2 weapon types and not always automatically select tachyons
yeah but people like you just keep on coming eh how about we keep the generalized insults aside and stick to facts and figuresgreat suggestion for the blasters 20 thread i suggest you post that there since tracking isnt a major issueif the apoc is so good that it cannot be used in a comparison then it needs to be nerfed until it can be simple as that there is no too big to fail furthermore the strength of artillery is alpha and what were proposing dosent threaten that one bit and pushing the lock limit to 300km would be nice but is very very unlikly due to technical difficulty also it would still leave the megathron and hyperion in a very bad way and the rokh not that much bettersure if we start looking at a 2030 boost to damage i think making rails harder to fit would be reasonable though with that wed still have to address cap usage issues and ammo usage issues tachs and 1400s may be harder to fit but theyre much easier on the consumables in situ put some facts and figures together to show where youre going with this and you might have a reasonable alternative to boosting rail damage though other issues would still have to be addressed

hey i am allowed to give support to my own idea xdsolar system map if you guys take a second look at the image it is still there just collapsed as i did not feel it needed to be demonstrated if you notice the systems that are displayed in bold letters in the current route section those are the current way points i do like the circle around the dots idea thoughthanks everyone for the support and feedback

didnt read your post or the threadbut kindly  off
im sorry i did not see that before you made my day
maybe because he isnt blinded by his isk and can realise there is an imbalance with how the high end clones increase in coststbh what you say just confirms to me that you still dont understand this topicit seems theres a lot of people who really dont like solo pvp or want it to be dead people do like playing the game differently and some dont like being forced in to blobs which make risk lower and like being more risky solo the costs for doing this are much higher in general and we should encourage risky behavior so everyone gets more pvp there is a balance of course and i dont think anyone here wants wow in space
i understand this topic very wellpeople want to reduce costs of pvp for high level chars thats the bottom linei simply happen to believe in the idea that the advantage of having high sp in combat should come at a price and 20 mil a pop sounds very reasonable even 40 mil per clone is still not too badevery high level advantage in this game costs lots of isk  the difference between strong and standard booster  like the difference between 50 and 80 mil sp char nobody forces you to use those its your choice
what balance is there with ppl r starving for killmails when more potential pvpers cant pvp cause they cant synchronize their changing schedules to match 5 other ppl assuming theyre willing and able to find and catch even 1 target before they have to retire for tomorrow assuming they dont get blobbed both sides end up losing here whether its dying for nothing wasting hours of play time or bothwheres the balance when the biggest fleet always steamrolls a smaller fleet 100 of the time setting in stone that if u have the bigger fleet u automatically win wheres the balance in risk vs reward in the largest and probably the most important facet in this game
the rate of increase for combat advantage and clone cost is in no way complimentary of each other if it was i would run around mauling low sp ppl in my solopwnmobile bsit should cost we agree there in my gd thread ive tried to relay logical arguments on what i think would be balanced others suggest their own what they are suggesting you dont understand is the divide between shipfitimplantboosterwhatever costs that have a clear and distinct combat advantage and the completely different see my first 2 sentences here that simply having sp somehow gains you a near exponential combat advantagei do not understand your adamant hatred towards the topic we agree almost completely across the board but you have this idea that pursing balance the name of the game in development is evil and whining some people just lash out at change i suppose
i solo everywhere and i dont gank people i only hunt pvpers i am also not the only one bring youre usual 25 hac gang vs my cruiserbc sure but im taking down 12 of youre pathetic sniper hacs before you kill me anyway or you loose half youre tacklers vs my ceptor  usually where most of my clones in 00 go to compare my low sec lowgrade slave set is now 2 years olddont come and tell me of pvp i cant handle as everywhere in 00 i roam youre elite 00 pvp alliances either dock up or form massive blobs and still loose isk wise 90 of the time again this is not and issue of isk but an issue of balance the cost should not grow exponentially as the gains do not the gains are diminishing in returns the higher in sp you go i believe the clones should reflect this that is what this topic is about
1 solo anywhere most of your recent kills were certainly not solo looks like any other pvpers killboard to me and i dont see a solo hac kill either might wanna fix all that so u can brag about internet spaceships some more2 what hac gang im not even trained to fly one so wtf r u talking about and what tacklers its only me unless ure gonna count me as a tackler and dps or whatever well not anymore since i dont have hours to kill roaming for 30 seconds of pvp3 l2readim not in an alliance and i dont blob either bad enough i had to spend 99 of my time roaming but i guess u have that much time to kill anyway4 hmmdiminishing returns as u keep training for gainsthat sounds familiar its kinda like everything else in eve faction mods faction ships and even the implants u use obviously if u cant handle the costs maybe u should train an alt like other ppl suggested id think ppl whove been playing for several years wouldve caught on by now whats next insurance on implants and t1quality insurance on t2t3faction ships
i support the motion some people are casual players and do not whant to grind isk for hours in order to come out and have some pvp in their frigates or smth
so all i have to do to deserve cheaper losses is call myself a casual player i would have thought that casual players would also lose fewer ships in proportion to having less time to make isk to pay for them but now i know that what it really means is that they shouldnt have to pay the same cost for their losses as non casual playersperhaps we should just issue a casual player discount card just answer a simple poll and your discount will be determined1 i am not casual 0 discount2 i am a little casual 10 discount3 i am somewhat casual 20 discount4 i am very casual 30 discount5 i am totally casual 40 discount6 i just dont log in 50 discount
maybe you should learn to read 1 i mentioned earlier that i have several pvp chars as im also the one to make roams for my alliance this char doesnt solo that often and if thats youre pvp char you really shouldnt even talk about pvp2 i was talking about the general 00 alliance which you mentioned in youre other post 3 read nr 2 and what the heck is wrong with 0 hour roams i find that much more fun than any other activity in eve 4 again i have 5 pvp chars total of 9 the lowest sp of any of those is 25 mill and thats a trader char are you stupid this is about balancing clone cost from cost increasing exponential to cost reflecting the diminishing returns of high sp counts we are not exactly asking about marauders costing 5 mill etc get a clue and i agree with malcanis on the casual player thing that also has nothing to do with the argument of these clone costs
well i find it curious that ccp provide a skill system that does not require any particular participation rate to advance and then go and impliment a medical clone mechanic that requires us to participate as soon as possible  did they figure any casual players are only going to be around for 5 years maxi agree casual players should not be babied through the game but i think casual players are plenty disadvantaged through lack of knowledge without putting the pressure on them to get in the game before the clone costs start to bitesupported btwthe medical clone cost regime is arbitrarily applied with no decisioncontrolchoice from players the most important point by a long way not reflective of advantage gained as far as i can see  although i have done no math on this so if ccp have the figures that debunk this i would assume they would have something then by all means strike this one discourages participation in 00 encourages metagaming and multiboxing through alts1 toon with 100m sp  30m isk medical clone2 toons with 50m sp each  78m  78m  156m isk total for both medical clonesalthough im not a fan of alts or multiboxing i do concede they are a part of the game however i do not think they should be a cheaper and therefor an easier option than playing with only one main toon because they already provide a far easier way to play the game as it isas an alternative i like the idea forwarded by digitalcommunist in the thread linked from the op of medical clone value determining clone cooldown periods after podding  the more you pay the less time you wait although i dont see ccp being too keen on an idea that keeps people from playing but then again thats basically what the current medical clone mechanic is doing so maybe theyll have no problem with it 
not supported own a 42m sp clone myself and i like the mortality in eve
supported its hard to justify flying frigates when your clones cost 30m each yo
yes stupidity is always hard to justify ccp should not make discounts for retards
1 u did not mention u have several pvp chars at all so which other 4 r they2 oh im sryi dont have the time to fleet much to rack up hundreds of kills for even one char so by this logic thats why i shouldnt talk about pvp cause that would mean u cant solo pvp then which is really my point in the first place3 u find spending hours flying from system to system fun r u just trolling now cause that 0 is a typo 4 the way u talk about the supposedly unbearable costs of high sp clones when a simple measure to remedy it think about itif ure not getting returns that r worthwhile to u why would u dig yourself a deeper hole by continuously billing yourself a higher clone cost so if u cant afford it use an alt not my fault ure too stupid to adapt5 the solo00 pvp thing may have nothing to do with the clone costs but it was merely in response to what u stated that ppl whine that theres no 00 pvp

well seems like my doubts have been already addressed and this idea does seem reasonable
wow has something like thisyou would get something you would fit onto your key chain or keep somewhere safe at home every time you wanted to log into wow you would press a button and the password would only be valid for roughly 15mins i think it would be a 8 digit long numberit looks something like this
it would be nice to have this at certain stations but not as a blanket thing every time i wanted somethingalso even if the container system were improved  i had no idea the pw could be retrieved so easily lol whats the point it doesnt protect rigged and fitted ships which for me at least is where the vast majority of my wealth resides
clickable pin pad yes pleaseallow everybody to set their pin of 46 digits and allow them to set what and where they want locked down specific station hangars all station hangars corp window wallet market transactions etc 5 failed pin entry attempts in a xhour period will send an email to the account owner and lock the pin pad for y hours corporation ceos can see whether their directors accountants other sensitive jobs have a pin set to their corp and wallet windowsthis is a very smart way to go about helping us help us keep our accounts and assets more secure without babysitting us most unauthorized eve account use is a result of phishing and keylogging the clickingonly pin pad makes keylogging completely ineffective and the locking of the pin pad and notification of the account owner upon multiple failed entries makes bruteforcing impossiblealso the point of container passwords is so that other people cant access the container when its in space or what have you i dont know why you can passwordprotect a station container maybe station owners can access visitor assets
even if i call out on ts or in alliance chat that im afk anyone who logs in after that or a friend not in my alliance wont know im not there unless someone tells them like the voice icon that shows on your pic if you have joined a channels voice chat ccp could also add a small icon to show over your portrait that symbols afk me takes a bath after agreeing with a p

small idea for missionsthis is not so much of a nerf but a changeas we know it takes pirates resources ect to sneak past faction police build outposts and smuggling routes for some peoples favorite goods first try is always free anyway these routes and outposts are not numerous in high sec same goes for about any mission only so many drones can become rouge in a time frame pirates can only get things setup so fast and so onwhat my proposal is to set a mission pool that an agent can draw from so lets say a single agent like in motsu can only give out worlds collide x amount of times during y duration than it is exhausted the agent wont get informed about new possible missions until y so like belts high sec would be the easiest to clear out than low sec finally 00 missionsflame or support away

so basically you are saying that you are getting tired of running the same missions over and over rightif thats the case then yes i think that the randomizer could use an update missions such as disgruntled employee should be once in a blue moon or something like thatnobodys going to like my idea completely but i would like to see missions take longer such as the blockade where fleets and fleets of battleships keep coming in constantly for like 20 or more waves i like killing lots of stuff so i think it would be fricken awesome to see missions like that instead of doing the same missions that we have over and over with a ed off employee why not get more combat in the missions let the npcs flowedit this would be like a filler mission but maybe optional for those who dont like long missions there just dont seem to be enough npcs in each pocket
lets look at it this way we have lets say for a given agent we have 5000 nemies abound 15 that can be drawn from lets say 3 days once the agent gives out 5000 of that mission he or she wont give it out anymore so if the agent is so farmed he or she will stop giving the top end missions ect if you still want top end just simple move to another agent and wait for the next time the agent gets an update lets say every monday and friday something like thatnumbers would need to be played withidea is to put a little competition between runners maybe add a few more high sec agents ect to make up for the change if you dont like to move around a lot go to an agent that is used less so lower ql since there would be more missions from that agent that are not being done so compete on the ql 18 or 20 agent in high sec or the 16 idea of a few extra agents there in high sec would be there to makeup for the change in how missions worked maybe add some more low sec 00 too
you are walking on the very edge of mission farming hellall we need now is people spamming the agent after dt much like plexs and exhausting them until such time conditions are metunless you mean otherwise your implications do not indicate soid be more inclined to make sure missions do not repeat within the last 3 to 5 missions and not so much exhausted conditions
id support this but it would be prudent to say that it should be limited so that poss can not be placed on the same grid space as another pos station gate belt or planet they can only be placed in open space that hasnt been claimed yet or on a moon thats not claimed really u would think that this would be common sensethe reason i support this is because i would really like to see someone actually work to find a pos instead of just scanning around a planet and saying hmm thers some structures here i should warp cloaked to the moons and find out which one it is instead of finishing that scan on a side note poss would need to be changed so they can be scanned down with some varying difficulty depending on the poss sizeto wiersma you really need to put more detail into your proposals
players can not perform any form of remote repair on a players ship if they are not logged in unpiloted ships can be remote repairededit because i failpr0s no more capital ships getting remote repaired till they disapear because they got in over their headcons i would say if someone had a legitimate disconect would suck for them but they could simply log back in and start getting remote repaired again
i am sorry but you have to explain thatand congratulations to your new alliance
yes please that is really annoying please fix it
updated
as sokratesz said now that is something i could be in favour ofps richard there is this little checkbox check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on you might want to hit that 
if a pilot logs of the ship is still associated with it thats something totally different from repping an empty ship in space
irrelevant why should it be possible to shoot a ship when its not possible to rep it as i said i am in full support of a ship thats tackled never disappearing from space until its no longer tackled and then maybe give it a 30second timer or something else just long enough that it can be retackled if that were the case the logoffsoidontgetdead tactic will be completely neutralized in such a way thats not some mindless nerf and actually makes sense removing the ability to rep a loggedoff ship while retaining the ability to shoot it is utterly mentally handicappedthe problem thats being addressed here is a legitimate one the proposed solution however is not
yay i made a suggestion that was not full r3trd and got a thumbs up from darius mclever and hopefully a thumbs up from sokratesz soon my work is done
next goal posting the proposal without editing p scnr
this  can shoot it but not repair it wtf
supported as long as the ship is piloted and the pilot logged off empty ships should still be repairable
this is a serious navigational hazard placed approximately 15km from the gate in line with most of the other gates in system its bad enough that one is consigned to flying a freighter for certain tasks doubly bad when this station seems to exert some sort of magnetic resonance field and 50 of the time when i jump in i get stuck in the geometry of the damn station and have to spend 5 minutes extracting myself any chance it could be removed or at least shifted to say 20km behind the gate
how about just move it to 100km from the gate
posting in a larkonis gate threadmore seriously though supported scenery is supposed to look pretty not block travel
move it

these kind of objects bring knowledge of local conditions into the pvp equationgates are different sizes and sometimes have objects in awkward positionsif they were all the same size with no objects around them it would be too homogeneous
you really need to upgrade the class of wh you live in cause after living in a cl3 myself for a few months i can assure you there were about 34 times noncorpies came in our wh and only 1 of them resulted in a kill and that kill would have never happened if it wasnt for me paying someone to take down a pos from someone who stole from me the higher classes of wh are as empty as they ever were you simply need to look for them in low sec and 00
i live in a c5 i havnt had anyone come in ours so far and iv been living in it for around a month now and as for connection wh we have had around 110 having someone in it and even then if you have enough guys or a cap ship u just get rid of the hole easy so yes my point is move to a high class instead off sticking with the pusy areas 
bc so many baby titans have perished since dominion right more titans and moms are being produced now than at any given point before the dominion patchwhile the patch gave these ships the roles they so desperately needed ccp did not take into account that it would only be a matter of a year before all 00 fleet warfare is a cluster of titans and motherships battling it out if you thought the whines were bad when eve began its trip down the path of capitals onlinewait til the game turns into supercaps online edited for support
you know hes got a point there
i have never sale so much bpc of capital parts if that continue that will be posssible to see some fight with more 200 super capital on the fieldsome big alliance now began to build more than 10 mothership per monthsfor me they are really a big problem
in other words alts online since super caps pretty much forces you to use altsdont think this is perfect solution but something needs to be done
if you think something needs to be done but do not agree with this proposal  then why are you supporting it
something is better than nothing
in before godwinthats what germany thought when it voted  in during the economical crisis of the thirtiesin after godwinif you want something to be done about it write up a proposal that you agree with rather than supporting some ty rant like this
i would be for thisa players ship can not be remote repaired if they are not logged incarriers rring titans till they disapear is total bull
now that is something i could be in favour of
bull why shouldnt i be able to remote rep a ship sitting in space it doesnt matter if it has a pilot what we need is to make a ship thats tackled not disappear then while you have the titan tackled you shoot at the rring carrier until he pops or goes away and then go back to killing the titan also the way i understand cynos is that you can still jump when youre tackled maybe make it so that you cant jump when youre being pointed by a scrambler these two mechanics would greatly reduce the use of supercapitals and we wouldnt need these stupid upkeep cost rules put forth by people who dont like having their carriers and battleships oneshotted by a roaming titan
well any counter you put in shouldnt mean less use of the ship those ships had been pos blingbling for long enough one could argue about tackled ships not disappearing sounds like a fair deal aswell but jumping to a cyno should be only blocked by bubbles you cant point supercaps anywayabout headshotted carriers and battleships  with the locking time of a titan you should atleast be able to get your battleship out and most carriers that got one shot did either do station games or were travel without support no sorry for them 
some would say that all capital ships already have a maintenance cost attached to their use in the form of ice products consumed through out their usea titan that never jumps and never uses it jump portal or doomsday doesnt cost money to maintain but then isnt really a huge threat to anybody eitheri would only support a maintenance cost for a titan if there was a maintenance cost for all shipsprovisions and reactor fuel built from npcplanetary resources that are consumed per hour at various rates dependent on ship class
i am all for maintnance cost for all capitals and supercaps
i would like to propose ccp make a module for pos that allows storage of jump clones kk thanks
buy this
that is exactly my point i am not and will never be a miner hence i will never have or ever think of buyingtraining a rorq the mothership used to fill this role nicely for strickly pvp minded individuals and is now gone add pos modulei aprove this message
i hear you can build your own outposts out in null security space which are kind of like the npc stations in empire they can have cloning facilities too
i agree with idea though a titan can fill the role a mothership had in this carrying pvp fitted ships this would be an interesting way to keep skirmish fights in hostile space interesting also posting with untagged alts is lame jadeupdated to show support
can you build them in wh space
fail you can not clone jump fromto wormhole space try again 
now its very difficult to found some good use for the carrier you have the possibility to make some remote and that all mine new bonus will be on the capital ship lvl50  bonus on the capital neutralizeri dont would like to put some value on the capital neutralizer  ccp will make that better than me
first problem  there are no capital energy neutralizer and they would be just overpowered if introduced especially with your 50 amount bonusatm smaller ships got some chance to manage cap under cap war pressure then you would just one volley their capif you want insane cap warfare bring an archon and a talisman bhaalgorn with all neuts
i propose a new module who could be fitted on bs and supremote cloaking devicerecalibration delay will be apply on remoted ship scan resolution malus on both ships remoter and remotednice to set traps
no
id use it to shut down other ships
if youre a miner like me you generally one day yearn for the chance to grab a rorqual and along with your fleet of barges decimate system after system of their beltshowever the rorqual while a grand vessel could use improvement on the following ideas 1 indy core  why is it that a capital ship that lacks any hard points or complex fighter drone control systems that also diverts in engine power needs fuel to run assembly lines i could understand if the ship was super powering a capital mining laser or repairing a ship 200k away but for lack of a better word its just powering up an assembly line or 4 to be specific while rerouting all the power of a giant engine core to said lines in short i dont think the rorqual should need fuel to switch modes 2 mode switching  ok this is more of a why does it work that way kind a thing why is it that the ship must remain in build mode for 300 seconds and then stop i think it would be cool if the ship worked more like cloaking does ie if i move to an ore field and hit the indy core ship comes to a stop and after a minute finishes its transformation should i want to go i hit the module again and in 12 minutes im back in ship mode any ore not fully processed would be ether lost or placed back in the hold note transformation times guessed by watching a youtube vid of the ship changing could be extended to compensate for the suggestion i have made3 ore compression  to me having to have a bpo for every ore type seams rather silly i know there generally cheap but it seams like such a hassle to make sure you have every bp or what not and its not like the rorqual is easy to turn around should you forget something why not change it to something more like the following when the rorqual changes to build mode it gains 4 low slots that contain 4 irremovable grinders in a similar fashion to how the zephyr always has that proto type probe launcher to be fair to those who have collected all the ore bpo simply change them to skill books each skill book covers a ore type such as veldspar and each type covers all of the variants when lvl 3 is reached ie industrial  veldspar grinding lvl1 allows grinding veldspar 5 grin timelvl2 allows grinding concentrated veldspar 5 grind timelvl3 allows grinding dense veldspar 5 grind timelvl4 5 grind timelvl5 5 grind timeonce you have these skills you can right click on one of the grinders and load an ore into it of any type you knowa grinder can hold up to 250k worth of ore just like you would with ammo into weapons once loaded you click on it like any gun and after its cycle ore is removed from the grinder and a compressed ore is dropped into your cargo hold
so id need to train both veld refining and veld grinding no thanxthe fuel consumption for industrial core is minimal it even makes compression of empire ore cost effectiveno mode switching but it looks so coolthe blueprints are a hassle especially because the large number will lag a rorq corp hanger to deathnot sure that removing them and replacing with yet another skill fixes anything tho
we never see rorqual in belt cause the comparison between proximity advantageisk risquingtanking is not favorableto rebalance this i propose a new additional bonus  10 shield boost bonus per level when in deployed mode per level of cap indus ships skillthis will simply give almost the same bonus as one shield boost amplifier its more logical fuel consummation and immobility when deployed and will encourage those ships to go out of pos
o pantorusno supported because that will be not a big difference and the role of rorqual is bonus and compression not tankingi prefere to have the possibility to make the compression from the ore bayand if its possible to increase them at 500k that would be perfect
or maybe a 5 capacitor recharge rate bonus per level when in deployed mode
silly idea for silly peoplethere is no need for it to be a belt to carry out its prime function boosting and compression which is always done within a pos shieldcollection ore is only its secondary function and can be carried out every few minutes every hour or so and larger mining fleets should have an orca racing around doing the collection anywayanybody who thinks its a good idea to have their rorquals deployed and compressing within a belt please convo us we would love to pay you a visit
i understand your point but do you seriously think people want to sit at a pos 365 days a year if you seriously think this is what should happen then i suggest ccp gets rid of the rorqual altogether and create another pos structurei play eve to play a game not just run a session that wastes my electricitybandwidth and bores me to deathdumb design  fail gameplay
came up with a new ship idea over the week end and figured i would try it out the electronics superiority ship is the next line of electronic warfare vessels to hit the battle fields but in a unique way unlike current electronic warfare ships the ees forges ahead in information gathering and distribution and fleet supportive measures the ship itself is a bs sized platform but lack any real firepower capability its primary strength is in helping fleets and performing tasks that regular ships simply dont have the ability to do though base stats very each ess has 8 high slots 6 medium and 6 low with each ship varying with 4 slots weaponable ie caldari would have 4 missiles ammar would have 4 turrets etc the ess is also fairly faster than most bs at a rate thats nearly twice that of regular battleships it is however not able to field the same level of tank that regular bs carries each ess is capable of fitting special ess only modules each one is listed belowsubspace relay scanner passive the subspace relay scanner is a ship system that equips a very large sensor array specifically set up to locate every ships beacon and link it in a local network thus when a ess is in systems that dont normally have a local channel one is provided this system also functions in systems that normally or used to have working networks but for one reason or another they have been shut down module for it lownull sec has its local channel removedtactical defence analyzer activethe tda is a module that runs a structural scan on the targeted ship to determing its current defensive capabilities it then encodes a set of instructions over the fleets com system that shows up as a shield icon on the right side of the ship in question this icon shows a color that indicates the targets current resistants level that is the lowest if the target ship has no damage at all this shield has a bubble around it as an example a ship has a resistance of 50 em and 75 everything else for shields and 20 thermal and 50 everything else for armour when scanned a shield icon with a bubble around it appears to the right of the ship and is the colour blue for em after sufficient beating the ship shields drop and the bubble around the icon is removed and the icon itself turns red for thermal red thermal blue em whitekinetic yellowexplosivetactical offence analyzer  active the toa is a module that runs a detailed scan on the targeted ship to find out what ammo is currently loaded and firing this information is displayed as an icon to the left of the ship and like the defence analyser is color coded this icon displays as a circle for short range and a filled circle for long range like all ess analyzers this information is displayed to the whole fleet that the ess resides insystem reserve analyzer  activethe sra is a module that scans the ships power reserves and displays it as an icon below the ship the icon is similar to the capacitor read out aboard a pod but simpler for easy display like all ess analyzers this information is displayed to the whole fleet that the ess resides inaction analyzer  active the action analyzer scans the target ship and determines what if any none weapon effects the ship is producing  receiving if the target is webbing a friendly it would show up as a small red icon above the ship if it was being webbed it would show a green icon like all ess analyzers this information is displayed to the whole fleet that the ess resides indirectional control projector  passivethe directional control projector is a high end processor that takes in all the fleets nav data and renders it real time for all ship in system the result is that any grid a fleeted ship resides in appears on screen as a warpable location that is visible from any point in system right clicking the icon for that point can give you a warp to location text or tell you whos there

comparing close turrets i see blasters need lovelasers  they can deliver good dps at very flexible range for example medium pulses can shoot from 6km to 23km at their optimalauto cannons  does not eat capacitor have tiny pg requirements very good tracking switchable damage type it is very painful to hit in resist weakness t2 long range ammo allow to shoot near 20km for medium ac high speed of minmatar ships allow to dictate tacticsblasters  consume cap fixed damage type kinetic and thermal are not resist holes tiny optimalfaloff even with null it is like pulse with high damage close ammo tracking speed is like ac for example about medium ac and blasters 1nd and 2nd tier ac even faster comparing appropriate blaster analog 180mm vs electron 220mm vs ion it is strange is itso what have i missed oh gallente drones do you realize it is limited use do not play with eft dps figures drones need time to reach target they have speed sometimes target is faster then drones they have hp it means they can die not only gallente ships have dronesso gallente have largest dps only in eft all disadvantages of blasters do not cost this dps differencemy proposal blasters should have more damage and more tracking speed caldari should gain less blaster bonuses because their ships are faster see bellow gallente ships should have more basic speed i will explain why gallente ships are armor tanked so plates eat agility armor rigs eat speed  how can slow ship to reach optimal minmatar ships are fast caldari are faster because they do not need armor rigs and plates amarr ships have more chances to deliver their dps due their flexible ammo range  instant change
supported gaylente are totally broken atm
says the person who is bringing up again increasing the locking range it doesnt work this has been debated repeatedly even if ccp was willing to rewrite the code it still wouldnt work here is the beginning of the discussion on that topicwere not saying railguns need to have the same damage as anything were saying they dont have a niche with the exception of the eagle cant track and dont do damage  so they are the most worthless weapons in game
because unlike other ships carriers and supercarriers only weapons excluding ecm are dronetype weapons next to that they are supposed to be logistical platforms used for fleet warfare they can repair other ships yet have no capability to easily repair their defensive capabilities except exposing their weapons to destruction in space this doesnt make sense from a gameplay and a ship designers point of view
a great concept imo some interesting ideas too i like the idea of turning lowsec into the seedy underworld of new eden make real miniproffessions out of drug dealing and smuggling prostitution and gambling the serpentis are supposed to be the drug smugglers of eve how about adding some serpentis npc drug labs in lowsec where you can take drug courier missions even negotiating larger buy quantities for lower unit prices for greater profits at higher riskperhaps even throw in some proper evecasinos it would be awesome to lose a couple of billion isk to someone inside then wait outside for them to undock and gank the erprostitution i dunno how that would work but im sure someone has a good idea
great ideas supportedmilk run style missions that can randomly escalate into a combat scenario
fantastic ideasbut i think it should be kept in mind that the items that would be on the black market would need to have a great demand to get people to come to lowsec just to buy them boosters or other illegal items would need a great boost to do that effectively imhoi didnt read the whole thread so maybe someone already said that
totally supported as a wh citizen it would make so much sense 
i dont understand why nothing has happened yet these problems have been going on for a year please do something ccp

supported although i was previously unaware of this mechanic and came back after a 6 month break to a nice suprise i had figured it would stop as well as my training since they are timebased accumulationtherefore in support of this i will be donating all proceeds from these datacores to the sashi yatar foundation for sashi yatarin all seriousness it is a far worse problem than training while inactive was since it can directly affect markets
i can nothing but support this threadhere a few facts comparing the supercarriersnyx 35mio ehp with slaveset and a bit complex stuffaeon 38mio ehp with slaveset and a bit complex stuffwyvern 25mio with lots of pith xtyp stuff and 15k dps tank for 11minhelarmor 15mio with about the same complex stuffhelshield 15mio with lots of pith x type and 9k dpstank for 11minhope that makes clear how much inferior the hel is with 30k dps it will take 19min to take down a solo nyx  for a hel it only takes half and the 9k selfrep doesnt help the main problem is that the slave set has a effect on a supercarrier while the crystal set does nothel needs a balance between shield and armor amount and the proposed 766 slot setupregards numinos
comparing the nyx and hel as neither have a resist bonus and the same number of tanking slotscalling bull sht on this one not taking gang boni into account here the only way to get 36 mil ehp out of a nyx is with more than a bit of complex stuff you require a quad xtype hardener set and 2 atype eanmsi just plugged in a hel fit into eft and was able to pull out 26mil ehp with a similar resistance profile to the nyx in fact each cap shield rep on it is around 20 more efficient than a crar on the nyx it also aligns 50 quicker and is twice as fast you can get the alignment time down to 10 seconds if you forgo pdus at the cost of 4 mil ehp for istabs crazy i know also who the hell fits a local rep on a milf these daysif fact i think the issue here is more to do with slaves than the slot layout however you have the advantage of being able to use nomads on the shield tanked milfs crazy i know and you can squeeze more effective rr out of shield tanks than armour tanks id be more inclined to get slaves nerfed for caps or crystals buffed than giving in to the demands of the must armour tank all capitalz crowd
i actually havent thought about going passive shield and armor tank the same time ure right that pushes it up to 24mio ehp but u need all slots pressed full with complex stuff to reach only 23 of the nyx the nyx on the other hand has still all its medslots free for caprecharge or ew or whateverand i dont really see aligntime and topspeed as the advantage in a badass capfight
good jobsupported a very well thought out proposition

you are either a troll or really stupid 1 not my job to tell you is it i have reasons to not wanting them associated with each other 2 you have 22 losses and 7 kills where only 3 of them is solo and 1 of those is a hulk bar the dramiel bombing and sabre bombing there isnt anything that shows proper pvp unless you count 5 ganks compared to this character that alone that has a few hundred where pretty much all are either solo or duo with a few small gang mixed in no where is there any mention of blobbing up and farming kills 3 meant 10 not 0 have you ever even been on a proper roam because if you had you wouldve known that a 10 hour roam is way more than mindless jumping from system to system its a cat and mouse game with much larger entities that one try to get at a disadvantage to take advantage of also known as solo pvp fun and player skill 250 jump roams finds you a lot of entertainment if you know how 4 i have said no where that clone costs are unbearable i said for god knows how many times now that clone costs should not grow exponentially when the gains are diminishing and that they discourage pvp in 00 after a certain point in smaller cheaper ships 5 well people do whine theres no small gang or even solo in 00 guess why because most people who do that prefer to fly smaller cheaper ships which becomes unjustifiable at higher skill point levels thus they all go somewhere else or quit
quoting for others because this is pretty fail
how is it asymptotic
1 fair enough but if your other chars have mostly fleetinvolved kills then ive made my point but now theres no way to tell2 so what do u consider proper pvp everyone agrees that outnumbering your opponent is okay as im sure u do as well but to u if a kill hurts someones wallet its wrong oh wait maybe i should fleet so someone else can leech the killmail and that would make it okay again right3 so u waste your own time as well as the blobs as if that wasnt the case already by running around not killing anyone because even the slightest engagement would allow the blob to catch up4 if u have to avoid it its unbearable period5 so by your logic 12 year old chars dont existmatter not everyone in 00 is a 2003 char
where on earth do you get the idea i fly with blobs the biggest gangs i ever fly with are 810 people and the most common is 34 or solo i wont even waste more time typing to you as youre simply to stupid to understand anything ive written at all as proved by youre own posting i honestly dont care if this gets balanced or not if it does great ill fly a little more in 00 and i do believe more people would if not ill stay mostly in lowsec which funny enough is getting rather overpopulated lately
can you imagine what providence would be like if you could have multiple playerbuilt stations in a systemanswer my worst ing nightmarenot supported
i dont think providence would have been any different than now with 50 dreads a station is only 1 siege cyckle and with the upcoming insurance changes dreads will get even cheaper so supported
no it really hasnt as was said it takes several days already claiming that additional stations in a system wouldnt make it more difficult to flip is just plain sillyyou hit the nail on the head right there in between each attack caps warp off to a safe pos so again i point out that even if a single station can be flipped during 1 siege cycle the actual attack takes more than an hour multiply that by a dozen stations add an hour for formup add an hour to get everything in place add some cushion time and you cant do it in a day while you are taking down one defenders can easily be messing with another oneone important thing to remember is the idea of hitting a station just before downtime so you dont have to worry about it being reflipped if there were multiple stations you would have to have 50 dreads and 50 carriers repping a station back up so it cant be flipped by a wing of bombers isnt a minor featbottom line  the more stations in a system the more static sov will be
the additional difficulty is trivial and its far far less than the difficulty of taking those same 12 stations in 12 different systems1 station in the same system  add 12 siege cycles per station reinforce cycle call it an hour tops1 station in another system with another ihub  add 3 more station reinforce cycles and 2 more ihub reinforce cycles call it another week minimumyeah an hour vs a week which to choose so difficult
dreads warp to pos when stuff is reinforced and they do not have any more reason to sit around in space not inbetween warping between locations that need shooting at least in my experience we go to system drop sbus then dreads go to ihub rf it then after they exit siege they warp to station and rf it if there would be few more stations then they would be warping there and rfing those also reason why taking a system takes several days is rf timers not hardship of ganking few hundred mil hp structure or two from your replys tho i get impression that you might have not been involved in sov warfare recently if you are then my apologies  in that case our game experience differs quite a lot you do raise a fair point tho  at what moment will the station be reinforced so it cant be repped up again when there is many stations in the system then again all this fuss about so hard sov warfare is relatively easy to cirumenvent by just letting owner of the system point one of the stations as capital of the system and making all stations in the system flip when capital station flips exactly the same sov warfare system as currently just with multiple stations in the system
if putting multiple outposts in a single system would make it too difficult to take over then you simply need a mechanism where you only have to conquer a single outpost which would make the rest flip to the attacker when it falls lets say a system capital upgrade that must be installed on an outpost before multiple outposts can be deployed if the outpost with the capital upgrade falls so does the system no need to go attacking the others

good idea 
apparently it doesnt since as you said require station containers which are not transportable in any average ship which means you need to buy the container at the location you want to store your stuff to be protected which is hardly possiblestation containers do not provide the function suggestion and even then two different people pointed out two different ways to bypass the security lock so it actually provides zero functionalityso present a valid reason to not supportthe security pin would not accept keyboard functions only input from the 9 keys this entirely avoids keyloggers altogether
this has been posted and weighted by me under alt in features and ideas discussion where it recieved a positive responseit would be more realistic when jettisoned containers jetcan would expire ownership instead of destroying themselvesmore realistic as i never left an explosive charge with my jetcan but still they explode after 2 hours must be amarr crap lots of shiny silver and but crappy metala set timer in seconds so you can decide on how long you want the cans ownership to be yours before it turns blue and everyone can loot itfor miners then there will be less people able to tempt them in shooting at a can flipper for mission runners they can make people happy by leaving the lower level missions or if nuts lvl4 missions loot available for everyonei could imagine that in certain cosmos missions i would set timer very low and the higher the mission level is the higher the set timerthis would also solve a problem of people trying to lure new players in opening a jetcan and getting shotof course adding the option to add an explosive charge besides a timer would also be more realistic to the current situation and acknowledge its crappy amarr metal feedback suggestionsjerid verges heliosgal demoirias eva dray megayunti for more feedback please see the topic itself

face it if you make dust 514 on pc nearly all of the eve players will invest in it if you make it on console they will be hesitant because they have to buy a console buy the online service for it and then buy dust 514 i wont be able to get it for console if you do this and many other lessthanrich people also wont id pay an extra service fee or maybe 250000000 isk xd a month to be able to play dust but like 300 for a console and 2000 a month for internet service is ridiculoussign if you want dust 514 on pc
sign
neither
or you could have just supported the half a dozen other put dust on the pc plox threads in various places on the forumskeep in mind that ccp isnt trying to convince eve players to buy a console theyre trying to entice console gamers into investing in eve read ccp by expanding into a new market sharemy supposition and this is purely theoretical based on what happened with other games like halo is that it will come to the pc  eventually

yeh umno ships in space should be repairable get lost with this  idea
whatever happened to the most abused counterargument since prenano bring more dudes surely it is applicable hereecho stands to reason that if damage can be applied then damage can also be repaired  unnecessary and arbitrary change that is meant to affect only supercapitals with their stupidly high buffers soapply to supercapitals only everything else can be killed by frigate swarms with time to spare
signedlark has a valid point on this one ccp
in high sec i can support this in low sec itd make things way too interesting to take out
not supported for exactly these reasons
p good troll herebut you do know the station is noncollide right
i like your thumbs up therei also dont support this the station is something nice to look at while i have my autopilot chauffeur me around when im afk
meaning you can fly straight troughthen no i dont support it be cause the scenery at that gate is awesome
yeh one thing youll find here is that larkonis is one of the bigger forum trolls on these boards i tend to ignore most everything he posts
u madalso the station is not noncollide far from it in fact it is huge and very much collide how about you fly there in a freighter and get stuck in the thing to see for yourself
if that is the case discount my support from this thread
funny stuff is happening call me crazy but i gave lark the benefit of the doubt jumped onto eve on my netbook and flew a jita alt out therethis is what happenedi flew through part of the station however just before i got back on here embarrassed for having taken a troll seriously i bounced my ship hit a brick wall in the middle of space near the center of the station i tried flying into this area again but the ship changed course like it does when it occasionally doesnt get stuck on an asteroid larkonis surprisingly enough is telling the truth you can get stuck on this station at 15km away from the gate
whats the story on that station anyway
localised conditions i can deal with some cosmos systems have jumpgates in deadspace or clouds which prevent cloaking however this is a clear obstruction in possibly the worst possible location on a gate on quite a well used route which sees little to no pvp activity outside of localised wardecs
this should also be addressed i mean there arent any other stations right on top of a gate like that why is the only one like it dead theres gotta be a story if not there should bealso support
im so very madso mad that larkonis troll is worst troll ive taken several ships out there and havent collided with it you should rly look into another profession aside from trolling
stop making a fool of yourself that other fellow has already posted proof in this thread i really dont have the energy to devote to trolling you bunch of mouthbreathers anymore anyway and if i was going to pull off a troll i wouldnt do it here as the csm is still in my mind at least a srs bsns section of the forum i propose that it is you who is the troll
implimentation of member assigned walletssome time ago i started working on a proposal to have members assigned to wallets in the corporation at the time i was asked to clarify what exactly i meant and how it might be done so after some thinking i am reproposing this idea problemscurrently in my corporation i am unable to assign a wallet to a member by default all members pay into the master wallet unless i was to give them an accountant role or director rolethis restriction prevents me from assigning my members to wings which pay into a wallet and then pay out dividends personally calculated from the wallet i am not currently proposing a dividends by wallet setting approach although the lazy part of me likes this idea based on that wings performancei am unable to assign or calculate the returns on investment that my wings are currently making in effect i would like to be able to invest in wings that are bringing in a solid return consistently and leave those who wish to be packrats to retain their individual wealth without rewarding them for the efforts of the more focused corporate operationsproposals1 allow members to be assigned a specific wallet that automatically accepts the tax from bounties  mission rewards2 allow members to be assigned a specific wallet that automatically accepts the tax from bounties  mission rewards and create a role specific to this wallet that would similar to accountant role but specific to a wallet3 allow members to be assigned a specific wallet that automatically accepts the tax from bounties  mission rewards and create a role specific to this wallet that would similar to accountant role but specific to a wallet allow dividends to be paid out on specific wallets so that only members assigned to these wallets receive a reward for their wings efforts yes i can calculate this myself however with a wife and 2 young kids i like to be able to actually do something with my game time that doesnt involve sitting down and calculating returns on efforts for the members of my corppotential issues1 may be non trivial to organise as you are increasing the lookups on the database something that the need for speed initiative wont like much2 additional workload in addition to point 1 also requires touching on the roles for corporations that has not been retouched since i started playing several years ago adds a further level of complexity on role management which may not be well understood3 additional efforts which will compound the code change effects and the risk with implementing thisconclusionsmy personal preference as a player is 3 as i get the most bang for my buck with this however i am enough of a realist to be very happy with option 1 it massivly simplifies corporate management and returns for members for those corporations that give a damn about these sort of things granted there are organisations that quiet frankly dont give a damn about rewarding their members other than to buy stuff  and do more stuff with it however i would anticipate that the concept of setting out a reward structure for your active members is likely to increase the use of this functionality as it would breed loyalty to your corporation and theoretically increase the amount of money people are willing to invest in the corporation granted it does nothing about taxing miners or loot drops or market traders but those are issues i do not think can be addressed as easily as thisi would like to thank dek kato and tellenta for their responses on my first draft of this subjectsupporting of your own topic ftwedit there is more than one proposal proper proofreading only works after coffee
i wouldnt mind this but i think very few would use it and as such it is not worth the developer time required to code it especially since you can allready keep track of this on your own by simply making an api program that pulls that data from the high sec api of someone with access to view all wallet divisions and then calculate it youd just have to store who is in which groupwing in a database and then each transaction to the master wallet from from that person gets added to the group total when the api is run
the problem with the feature request is that it is highly specific to your corp structure i expect that the number of corps that would use these features is fairly small but the amount of developer time needed to impliment them is likely to be largeit sounds like most of what you want can be calculated automaticly using a custom application that get the data it needs from the api you could then copypaste amounts to be transfered from your custom application to the game client to complete the needed isk transfers the api can even access corp rolestitles so even wing assignments can be automated
this isnt highly specific there are many other cases where it would be useful for certain automated payments read taxes to go into a wallet of your choice for instance a corp op where all proceeds go into a certain fund rather than having to go back through the master wallet and do maths to separate out the amount that should go into the fund after the fact it would be far easier to funnel the funds into that wallet for that day or however long additionally it can be useful to have funds automatically divided among different wallets constantly it could be useful to have a 2 tax going to a ship fund a 4 tax going to pos management a 4 tax going to alliance fees etcfrom a corp management perceptive it would be nice to have better control over automatic distribution of corp funds plus it would give corp members better oversight of their leadership it would no longer be really easy to siphon funds out of a corp i mean people do it make them actually have to put some effort into it
you already have the tools needed for this api access to transaction logs etcwhat you are asking for is highly specialized features that cant really be expected to be done without outside tools
it can be tracked by corp leadership with outside tools this is not the same as being taken care of in a transparent fashion by the game
if isotope cost andor volume was increased substantially then perhaps that would applywe see an approximation with dreads and the stront they use expensivecargo hungrymaintenance cost does not necessarily have to be isk based making it a time sink by requiring more logistics to move stuff makes for a similar drawback benefit is that a volumeisk increase rather than just isk incorporates a sort of scaling on its own since the fuel needed to move 2030 titansmoms would require loads of hauling  manpower  might actually be a better solution altogether since moving stuff can not be bought or printed in empire
i find it funny sok has zero reply for my well thought out argument
the main problem of t3 ships are that you receibe 18m for the insurance and the ship cost 300m with 5 subsistems and the ship but its so funny because 200m of this 300m go out only in melted nanoribbons the t3 ships are a really good ships but its a cruiser just a cruiser 300m for one cruiser and 200m only in 40 melted its should be rebalancedonly if ccp change how often the people obtain melteds and the price of melteds change between 5m to 1m the shipsll cost 125m not 300m only with this 125 its a bit more affordable for one cruiser and its still more expensive than t2 ships
uh thats the pointits supposed to be expensivemight want to get a bandage for that foot btw
prices are defined by players not by ccp
there is no such problem because no one of devs ever told that t3 ships must have insurance want insurance  fly t1prices are defined by players not ccp so if players are paying 300m for cruiser it means that its not just a cruisers but a very very good ships compared even to t2 hacsship will not cost 125m because its price are determined by market demand and not nanoribbons drop if you boost drop of nanoribbons then others kinds of salvage will get price highyes you can boost drop of all components but no one ever told that t3 must have price like t2when was the last time when you looked at t2 hacs price in jita
the op is based on so many false assumptions that its hard to know where to even startso ill simply say  this is working as intended move along
troll or ignoranttake your pick
i dont think so if 90 of the ships price is contained in a single resource out of three dosens the drop rates need to be configured so that they are more even currently all sleeper salvage except nanoribbons is useless
this might be true it seems to be a large bottleneck in the supply chain however i think this is the case throughout most production in eve perhaps not to this extreme but there are rare materials that make up a large part of the cost of all ships perhaps the cost should be better distributed by making some other drops more rare and making this more common but the end result shouldnt change if anything t3 cruisers should be a bit more in price
ccp can change the price what happend with the last patch and the technetium so many t2 materials grew up his price if you change the drop the offert ill be more than now and the price fallok you want the same price than now but its unsuall that all the price its for only 1 item like one says its a bottleneck for me its ok if ccp rise the drop of melted and fall the other drops but it have more sense that all the salvage items cost more or less the same not this differences 20k isk its the normal price compared with 5m you can undertand that its unbalancedthis is not a post for trolling i only ask if can be possible to balance the t3 prices i read the coments and i dont undertand completely are you agree or notand ok its not a good example the insurance and the price but no one use t3 ships for pvp its a fail for ccp work so hardly for make exposition ships strategic cruiser is not a navy cruiser that its exclusivei hope i explain better now 
that a factyeah right
with a mix of bad english and crazy ideas you have lost me i wondnt want a increased drop in nano ribbons anyway yes it is a bottleneck but it makes it so the prices stay at a reasonable level so whs are worth staying in andor the market isnt flooded with cheap t3 ships if you want cheaper go for a t2 or even better a t1
yes it only makes sense the tech is there on a ship why not a player owned station clone vat bay is only 4k m3 that would fit in almost any t1 haulers hold
scenarios1 i have a ship with damaged mods i want to contract it i cantfair enough so ill repair it however its stuck in an outpost that i no longer have access to so i cant repair it or now even sell it so its stuck there forever2 i have lots of items lots damaged i want to sell them all and contract it same as abovecan we please add either a new skill or a way to remotely repair damaged items so we just dont have our stuff stuck in stationsta
fair enough that or allow contracting of damaged items that are clearly marked damaged

if youre having problems findings a good use for a carrier youre either really new to flying it or really not doing something right
yep now the carrier will began to be only logisticsdepending on the fitting of your carrier but must of the time one shot by titanyou tank during about 1 minutes some mothershipnow if you use 10 carriers again one mothership its not sure you can kill themyep they are some problem with capital nowperhaps the good way will betitan same then nowmother same then nowdread same then nowcarrier same there are only the carrier can fit the capital repair module or cap transferremove all insurance on the capital
a triage carrier can turn an impossible to win fight into a fight with no losses or very quickly rep up a pos so it can be stronteda pantheon carrier fleet can easily tank an equal number of dreads while still taking the impossible to rr dreads downstandard old style combat fitted carriers with neuts and smartbombs in addition to their rr can easily hit sub caps with their drones while keeping hostile drones off themselves with smartbombs and tackle get neuted downon stations carriers can provide extreme amounts of support for a fleet without ever taking aggro so it can redock at any time 5 highs for rr 47 mids for remote sb and eccm 47 lows for a minimal tank so it can take sentry gun fire and for cap recharge also enables you to instantly switch ship and bring the most suitable ship to the next fightlogistically they have the best jump range and despite the cargo space nerf they can still take quite a bit of stuff and allot of shipsin short youre a  and should stfu
you really dont know what you are talking about
its only now you have some hotdrop with 5 ou 6 super capitaland this super capital use ring capital remotehp buffer  capital remote on this super capital is too much the idea will be to remove the possibility to use capital remote shield or armor on the super cap the buffer is enough
hotdropping 56 supercaps is a choice based on wallet sizes and the roles of the ships as pointed out putting triage carriers or a pantheon fit on the field works just as well for hotdropsthread
so what i am getting is the op boughtbuilt a carrier and wants it to have an i win button not even titans get an i win button if you have ever neuted a ship with a few large neuts you would know that a rack of large neuts can finish off most ships so fast and completely that it is bordering on being overpowered if capital neuts existed one capital neut would likely instantly cause the death of subcaps ships wouldnt be able to warprep and most wouldnt be able to use weapons it would also become the way to gank cap ships drop a carrier with a full rack of capital neuts on enemy caps drain them doesnt take much so they cant jump and you suddenly have a supersized hac that is far more difficult to kill capital neuts would be an i win button  which should not exist in an mmo
the alpha release of evegate has the sharing of your characters list set to visible to everyone and there is currently no way to make select a private option this means that if you have a character set to 5 or greater and they add you to their buddy list then all the characters in your address book will be available to them as well there is no option to optout of using evegate or sharing your buddy listit is true that the data on sisi is 2 weeks old however it is also a copy of productional data and is therefore compromising the annonymity of characters buddy listif any character who runs a spy network has someone any character set to greater than 5 all of their contacts are available to that person this is extremely damaging and valuable informationthis has been brought to the attention of the developers 18 hours ago but they dont seem to be concerned about it so id like to bring this to the attention of the csm this issue needs to be fixed immediately and i dont know where else to take this as the devs dont seem to care
now is it not only possible to view another characters contacts you can also view any contact information you want to know the above info about anybody just add them as a contact and follow the instructions above will somebody bring this to the attention of someone who can do something about it or could people start petitioning ccp i would but im at work until they start listening evegate needs to be turned off immediately until this issues are resolved
there is an official issues thread here
it seems evegate is down possibly to sort this out anyway good catch
looks like they fixed it they really need to decouple in game buddies with out of game buddies most of my in game buddies are enemies i am tracking very few of my friends are on the list
i think you should post to features and ideas discussion to discuss this idea and see if you and the community can find a way to make it into a workable mechanic that is worthy of consideration for my support
dont drink and post please
question how would you keep the cloaked ship locked to continue running the mod
lol uk propose remote cloak
too much crap is cloaking in the game as it is not supported
you gave no reasons for these changes unless you have something beyond i want this ship to be easier to use for me then this topic does not deserve supporti would support ui changes but no mechanics changes eve is harsh and should remain that way dont forget bpos
never said anything about no mode swithing as far as i know as i dont own one yet you hit the indy core the ship does its nifty transform and roll out and then you have 10 minutes before the core stops and the ship referts to normal   if im wrong please tell me   i simple think it would be better if you could have it change for the 7 minute you need it or for the 3 hours your corp needs itthe main idea with the new skill books was to give those that bought them something to have as they would no longer be needed i guess that you could simple use the current mining skills instead but i do like the idea of the 4 grinders and how ore is loaded like ammo and after its done its cycle a compresed ore is placed in your cargo holdand lastly im pretty sure i gave a good explenation why i didnt think the rorqual should need fuel
i support this rorq killmails would look pretty
would be a nice bonus for those who do use rorquals for stuff other than chilling behind pos shieldsomg we dont use a rorqual outside shields and therefore no bonuses should be added to boost that role is kind of close minded imo
hi meet mei fit tech 2 rigs on various shipsnot all are as insanely expensive as you may thinksome tech 2 resists rigs are actually decently priced for eg
they already have one of those for your cargo hold its called a cargo container
fair enough butfirstly a cargocontainer too reveals a certain amount of information max volume of the cargo inside the container which allows an experienced pilot to draw conclusions fromand secondly not all items in eve fit into a cargocontaineri know this is certainly a minor sidenote but personally i think ther should be a coutermeasure for everything in eve like thos pesky afk cloakersdont get me wrong i wouldnt want this module to make ships entirely unscanable that would encourage the hauler autopilot toursim too much it should just lower the chance of a successful scan
hows about instead of suggesting modules to reduce the risk to your afk gameplay experience you equip yourself to deal with the threat accordingly using the more than adequate tools provided
this module is a logical development concerning the eve universe and the backstoryits not meant to be an addition to afk gameplay experience its a mean of passive protection for any pilot afk or notif i may add your signature doesnt help your cause larkonisplease resize your signature to the maximum file size of 24000 bytes zymurgistno larkonisregards lax
your module idea has no drawbacks for the protection it provides it needs some kind of risk vs reward i suggest that it should be a lowslot module thus reducing the amount of cargo expanders you can fit as well as reducing the base cargo capacity of the ship for the extra strong bulkheads required to shield the contents from scanning in this way rather than it just being standard module on all haulers people would have to decide between safety or capacityof course this could also backfire as anyone scanning the ship would see this module fitted and thus assume it was carrying something juicy if you want to proceed with the idea youll need to raise it as a proposal in the assembly hall so people can vote on it or not
making it a lowslot item would certainly be a good idea to balance the module it might add some depth to the hauler bsuiness although i fear that most people will regard it as unnecessary and complicated from a rp standpoint a scanblocker should definitely exist in the eve universe ccp might aswell reintroduce the smuggling skill alongside with the mod pilots could use the module to smuggle contraband under the eyes of concord im not uptodate with smuggling and therefore do not know how valuable blockaderunners are for that job last thing i heard was that concord scans your ship within the fraction of a second in that case the cloak would ultimately be useles dont know if that is true toughregards laxps and thank you teadaze for your constructive criticism
explain your reasoningbut mainly afkwow if thats the best you can do to insult me im guessing youre new around hereid be more open to this if it scrambled scan results in a manner so that they appeared like the results on a ship scanner ie incomplete with some duplicates as opposed to a blanket blocker seeing as if everyone fit one which blocked scan results completely i wouldnt know who to gank
something tells me that even with this much support the next meeting minutes will completely ignore this issue outright
yes
how did i miss thisyes
not even just deimos brutix rannis etc blaster boats in general are not worth flying to an extent if you have minmatar0 cap use or amarrsick dpsrange hell id almost rather fly a caldari missle boat and start training at ground zerojust look at a autocannon myrm as a prime example theres no way in hell someone would give that up for a blaster myrm the real problem is lasers autocannons and even the assault misslesto an extent are also short range but all of these have a realistic damage potential when being used around 15km away blasters and blaster boats fall far short
funny how i attempted to raise the tracking part of this issue a year ago and the csm voting it down back then strongly supported
i use to fly solely gal but now i mainly fly ammar because the range bonus for the ammar compleatly out weigh the damage of blasters in relation to how slow the gal ships are
i will not berate you for the slaughtering of the english language you have perpetrated since i dont give a damn its not my native language anywayevery single bit of your quote demonstrates how little time have you devoted to read the thread every phrase you have put in writing shows that you dont understand the issue heresince i dont want to repeat myself go back to page 1 start reading take notes of the arguments used compose a legible and logical argument of which parts you disagree with and we can discuss it before you do thathowever do read up on benchmarking and performance comparisons it will let you realise what are the faults in your line of thoughtjust to let you know i do think that the ammoweapon system interaction and the coefficients that define the turrets performance are indeed the crux of the matterfurthermore i hold that the solution must be simple and elegant with as few changes as possible
well only issue i have with this 15 damage fix is it does close to nothing for the rokh people will still tell me to get gallente bs 4 to take advantage of my t2 railsrokh will do less damage than a mega at pretty much every practical range the bit more buffer it gets isnt worth it
unfortunately the rokhs problems vs the megathron stem in large part from t2 ammo which is another larger and more complicated issue as well as the whole armor vs shields debate the fixes proposed here may not make the rokh excel particularily but it will put it in the ballpark at least
well the way i understand it this 15 damage boost will give gallente ships comparable punch to amarr ships but this will still leave the rokh out in the coldeven the proposed adjustment to spike range wont create any kind of niche big enough to squeeze a certain caldari tier 3 bs in
the reason that the proposal also includes a reduction in the optimal bonus for spike is to prevent mega being opmoving spikes optimal bonus from 80 to 70 will allow rokh optimalmega otpimal 12 falloff so even if rokh dps85mega dps they will have equivalent performancethe 15 damage increase is enough to put both ships in the same ballpark with pest and apoc
im not convinced its nessesary to mess around with spike sure the mega will be doing damage equal to a tach apoc but it will be doing so at considerably less range 403dps  183km the rokh by comparison would do 369dps  249km a fair tradeoff in my mind fixing the rokh would require making tungsten ammo  197km do equal or greater damage then spike currently spike does 33 more damage leaving the rokh and all other long ranged weapon systems with little reason to every switch up from their t2 ammo and thus leaving the rokh unable to trade range for damage until youre dealing with thorium the first ammo type to do more then spike and that sits at 123km hardly even sniping any more

lol failbong cant speak for himself right maybe because he doesnt even know how to fit an eagle he flies amarr anyway and doesnt understand benchmarking or is he banned and can only post in shc i wouldnt be surprised last time he tried to counter my arguments he ended up postingor is it because he fails even at fitting apocsconveniently forgetting to divide by resources required to build either ship in isk invalidates everything else you said go back to shc and cry some more maybe post a few nice pics too you just claimed that apoc is worst than rokh and that all the people that field apoc in their fleets are stupid law of large numbers says otherwise while statistics show that the favorite ships for fleet use is apoc mega pestrokh you are lucky if you see 4 or more rokhs in a fleet anyone that has trained hybrids flies megas for the armor tankingthank you for doing such a good work to discredit yourself i could not really match up to the clarity of your own arguments how can i not disregard anything you say if i take that fit into considerationps bolded the parts where you failppsefficiency performanceresources allocated dpsehpperformance get itedit my dyslexia strikes again
i would also think that ehp is only equal to dps in one on one engagements in total value since primary tactics mean ehp is only needed as a buffer to keep you from being popped before remote repping kicks in so total dps output of the fleet is vastly more important than total ehp of the fleet not to mention the obvious preference in fleets for armor tanking that negate those fittings almost entirely
strongly disagree whats next they can repair ships in hanger arraythe mechanics in place work just fine and should stay as intended as you have pointed out there are options to repair the drones without docking in a station what more to carrier pilots need autoeject when below certain  shieldsarmor

supported this is a hideous exploit that makes me cringe to think of the time i spent training up the rp skills on my main when i could just have made a few extra accounts and would have been swimming in isk 6 months laterthis exploit and i do think it counts as one is damaging to the game economy and makes a mockery of people who use rp agents legitimatelyplease fix this asap  and it would be nice if you could strip those accounts whove been inactive for over a month of the rp they gained in that time

im gonna assume you mean ui font and would have to support that along with a font change but if you talking about chat font size look at the top left of the chat there should be a and a a icon those decrease an increase chat font size respectively
bigger fonts are not always better fonts but an option to change size would certainly make the game more enjoyable or playable at all for many people you have my vote
entirely agreed at 1920x1080 very common these days i already have to start squinting my eyes or place the screen closer costing me lots of desk space chat can be sufficiently enlarged but the ui fonts remain extremely small
yeah being able to move font size seems like a useful thing
this poster sumed up my feeling on this issue exactly
yesor at least just let us use the font from the russian client it pwns the english client font p
signed a no brainer the most brutal font sizing in any game i have ever played in my 45 years of age
100 agree the font is too small on modern highresolution displays and its also hard to tell 8 from 9 from bpersonally id like to see the ui fully scalable like other mmos the ui needs an overhaul anyway and i think if it is ever done it should be modernized to be fully scalable among many other improvements

i suppose its all subjective i suppose but not everyone takes their supercaps into 00 and being able to avoid trouble and not get caught or being fastermore agile is more of an advantage than a massive hp bufferbut yeah its not so much an issue with the slot layout and i refuse to get into a debate on the merits of sheild vs armour tanking more a problem with pirate implant sets and their effects on capitals
i do own almost every console out right now including the old atari lol yeah im a diehard gamer what can i say i also build myself a new computer about every one to three years to keep up with the pc gaming world dust514 on a console is going to be a little difficult to swallow i play counterstrike well all of the halflife games really but mainly counterstrikesource i used to play counterstrike competitively and i still keep ties with teams that do by running a gaming community that sponsors teams in cevo and other leagues some of the pc gamers play with console controllers rather then keyboard and mouse simply because they play both online console fpss and pc fpss its easier to switch back and forth some lan tournaments my teams have gone to offer both controllers and keyboardsmouse setups on theyre tournament pcs ive only been to two tournaments that used consoles one was a halo tournament and the other was a old school golden eye tournament back in the day console just isnt used that much for fps game play i know there are a lot of console fpss out there but compared to pc its nothing now with the release of mag the number of fpss for consoles may change but if you think about it dust514 is going to be directly competing with mag which from what ive been reading about both games dust514 vs magis a very very bad idea and dust514 even with the support of a great mmo will likely fail so personally i think what really happened is ccp didnt do theyre research on fps players and just decided to make an fps game for an mmo that would attach itself kewl idea but ya really need to put your feelers out to actual fps players not just your current eve mmo players just a guess but they are prolly hoping for eve to carry them not to mention the fact that im sure a number of eve players like to play fpss as this thread clearly shows so more then likely a number of eve subscribers will either a keep theyre accounts on eve and create an account on dust514or b drop theyre account on eve and switch over to dust514either way ccp could have easily fixed this by releasing it on both pc and console though more expensive they would have a larger play base to work with and a bigger market then again they would be competing with every single fps out rather then just a couple however if they really wanted to impress the world pull a reverse on the pc gamers set it up so you can run keyboard and mouse controls on the console though i dont know if that would work for xbox i know it would prolly work great on ps3 lol oh well hope ccp doesnt screw this up and sinks all kinds of cash into dust514 in so doing loosing players on both eve and the new dust514 having to sell the games to a big game company like ea that will ruin everything lol but who knows dust514 might kick everythings but and become the next counterstrike with over 15mil players online playing on various servers all over the world at the same time
there are many long time players in eve who dont enjoy the risks of lowsec but are looking for more variety and challenges with our eve experience it is getting stale in hisec name me a mission ill tell you what ships to expect what damage type to deal and defend against etc not fun at this point with no mission variability adding lvl 5 agents in hisec would add a significant challenge for such players and before you all start flaming because of the lower risk lower the rewards from running in hisec vs lowsec make the most rare loot drops in lowsec and lower the isk pay outs in hisec kar
the only reason this game is stale for you is because you lack the balls to actually go out and have risky funlevel 5s in highsec wont change  also highsec doesnt need people making even more riskfree iskh
pretty good when you pull facts out of your  to come up with pathetic excuses to push a stupid proposal outgrow a backbone move out of high sec
thisalso inb4 matrixskye
this guy sounds legit also i have recently discovered a need to post in memes
what is more variety and challenge if not increase in risk low sec is the answerhow can something with more variety and challenge not be more risky if it has no risk its not really challenging is itdont lie to yourself if you dont want to brave low sec you dont want more challenge you dont want more variety you want more repetitive predictable actioni recommend seeking professional therapy to help you figure out what you really want and address your hidden fears
nice troll broall the cool kids are already running level 5s in hisec anyway
this is about the third thread youve trolled today but here it goesthe op said and before you all start flaming because of the lower risk lower the rewards from running in hisec vs lowsecmake the most rare loot drops in lowsec and lower the isk pay outs in hisecessentially he wants to nerf highsec mission payouts at least level 5 so that its more profitable to do them in lowsec its quite different than him being some carebear who wants even more riskfree isk faucetsi dont support this because i dont think any wellpaying missions should be in highsec the relatively safe isk faucets should be moved toward more interesting things like exploration but thats for a different thread but if ccp is going to keep highpaying highsec missions they might as well make them fun
1 810 is a blob fyi2 its actually pretty understable because all uve written r variations of i cant handle the clone in which ive trained worthless skills for knowing full well its gonna cost too much and even though i have all these alts to fall back on i want the risk out of my rewards3 but the part where u somehow find fun to roam for 10 hours to find a blob to play cat and mouse with if u wanted to do just that just go into alliance territory and save yourself 10 hoursthat way u have 10 more hours of cat and mouse playtime im just putting it out there but then again i have a need to make sense so maybe its just me4 even so it still wouldnt be enough because it requires a fleet unless uve got that much time andor desire for 3
this is plain stupidmore sp mean more varietymore ships to flyguns to fit etcthis way u can adapt at ur enemy tacticsthat doesnt make u invulnerable and to be forced to pay for itwhatever reason ccp has in mind is wrong clones arent expensive modules andor shipsthey are basic game mechanicsim not saying u must be a complete noob at 100 mils sp but there are situations u cant control and u get poddedagainand again
it doesnt make someone invulnerable but it makes him a lot more useful and effective when 1 his dps ewar and tanking is maxed out 2 he can overheat for the longest time possible 3 can whip out the hac of his choice or even a capital ship to adapt compared to the newbie who is stuck with whatever limited options he has and this added effectiveness follows u no matter what ship ure in whether its a frigate or a titan in many ways it is almost exactly like an expensive modship because if ure still refusing to use an alt then ure only confirming how the added effectiveness does make enough of a difference to warrant this cost
this is last time then just to clarify some things 1 810 even low sec pirates agree is a smallmedium gang and if you check the few times ive been involved with that many the opposing side has had at least the double thats only shown in the cases were we loose ships though keep that in mind2 i believe you should reread 3 those 10 hours are used to play exactly cat and mouse with alliances 4 does not require a fleet fully possible even solo and without boring cloaky stuff and yes i do its the pvp i find fun and to youre post below the one above this one at 100m sps i can still not fly capitals nor have i even maxed out every sub capital ship yet ill still be on sub caps for a good while more also you seem to think that old chars magically gets wallets capable of throwing around billions like its nothing that is wrong past 20m sps you iskhour or iskmonth abilities do not increase by anything more than a few less than 58 unnoticeable  neither does youre ability to live as by 20m sps you pretty much have everything within isk and survivability covered what you do gain is versatility and eventually should one bother capitals the clone costs do not reflect this thats with this is all about not cutting costs not lowering pvp risk making costs not grow exponentially but instead linear or a curve that slows its increaase the higher it goes are you able to understand that if not what are you doing in a topic you quite obviously are incapable of understanding
i agree there is no reason why a player own 00 system can not have several stations come on ccplift the ban
i like it
yes   in particular make specific corp assests have individual access permissions that can be assigned to specific members ie corp hanger in 612 pos can be accessed by players set with either global corp roles or players set with individual asset access the idea being that different players can have specific assest access while not having global access to the entire corp
need
yes
bumpage before the lock
i will definately support the request for information on this matter
i can see both good and bad things happening with the release of informationon one hand seeing this information can give one an understanding as to what forces are dominating the current game market and help one decide on what skill points and effort to invest in on the other hand with the release of this data people here in the assembly hall can better articulate their points for or against ideas by virtue of having facts rather than the usual most people sayfeel or  in my experience being thrown around allowing for more meaningful discussions and a possible cutdown in ed pseudoeconomic bull petitions probably not so much the lattersupportededit spelling

yep more info is good

 good idea perhaps let executor corp have fitting manager role or it ends up with a lot of garbage already in by use of context menu view market details batch purchases are another thing entirely huh with the above direct access to market detail
heres the thing i know some people want to have addins for eve online the way you can have them for other games like wow for example i know ccp said no to this because they have concerns about security but ive been thinking about an alternative that should satisfy those concerns and at the same time bring more flexibility to the game client and what id like to have is a way of integrating web applications with the gamewith the new and quite powerful igb the number of web applications created for eve will be going up theres all sorts of things people will be creating in order to get functionality that the client doesnt have or will never have tools for coordinating big scale logistics mining operations trading and so on but all of those goodies have to run inside the igb which means you have an address bar that you dont really care about and tabs and all sorts of things that arent really useful at the same time you dont get the useful stuff like having those applications behave like any other window meaning theyre not part of the layout if i create a tool to help me plot a course through null sec using a jb network i might want to have that open all the time on my screen since the moment i log in i dont want to sift through my bookmarks or my open tabs for it or maybe a tool for wspace exploration to help people coordinate their scans when they try to find an exit or map out that exit with intelligence information those and more would greatly benefit from better integration both in terms of look and usabilityso my proposal for ccp is this give us the ability to register web pages as applications with the client once that is done i would be able to open those applications and they should behave like any other window you would have the name at the top and the regular controls for minimize and close window and everything inside would be just the html rendered one step further would be to have some css classes to match the client look so that i could make a button in my application look just like any other button in the client also the scroll bars could be rendered like the scroll bars in game rather than like the html onesplease let me know what you think and help me get this on the table with ccp
well this is something i can wholeheartedly support  being able to integrate web apps into the uiwindow structure would be very cool 1
i like this gets my vote
1but it would need some kind of indicator that it is a web application so it wont get too easy to scam with it eg
supported
it could work something like thishave a create custom windowbutton somewhere in the clientclicking that just creates empty window canvas object with normal eve ui window controlshave a import web contentfunction in the custom window that basically just brings in a instance of the igb tab tied to certain url sans windowframe toolbars etcthis way it would be up to everyone to decide what apps they want to import into the ui without it having to go through ccp approval processes etc essentially it would just be a browser window embedded into normal client window framesso securitywise for ccp it wouldnt be any different from the igb because everything would execute in the igb for us players it would bring less cluttered and more unified ui experience
darius mclever  what charney said but actually i was thinking of something even simpler something more like a button in the igb to say add this to my applications of course the site would have to be trusted already once you hit that the applicat
yup this sounds greatsigned

eves security blows this proposal would help if hacked but why not implement a 5 times wrong password and you are locked out for x hours or it at least generates a warning email to my account to let me know someone is screwing with the account i had an account hacked with an 8 digit alpha numeric pw and lost a lot of assets myself along with a couple weeks locked out while they investigated and no i dont buy isk dont click on unknown links give out passwords or reply to random emails and such im not a child i now use a 64 digit alphanumericsymbol password administered by security software i purchased i dont even do that for my online banking or stock trading accounts
despite your mention of runescape making me visibly shudder i shall support this awesome idea

dust will not be a pc game as its primarily a shooter and ps3 internet is free and xbox is 3 a month and xbox is also like 150 so no
im sure ccp has taken the time to consider making dust 514 availible on pc theyve also probably weighed the advatagesdisadvatages a console player has compared to a pc gamers the fact that a pc gamer can more easily cheatbot than a console player and that different protocals would need to be implimented to connect a pc client to the ps3xbox clients a la tf2just buy a console
why did you have to create a new topic about this when you have this topic here
noreleasing multiple mmos on a single platform is a dumb trap that many mmo makers have fallen into it causes cannibalization of the market that is to say eve would lose at least some membership to people jumping to dust instead they release it on consoles a totally seperate market gain some people who like console shooters but have no interest in the more in depth nature of eve as well as hordes of players who can just mine on eve while killing in dustin short its a smart business decision
i was thinking so many other social groups and work places recognize brest cancer awareness day why doesnt eve well this would require programming and one day patch updates only to be removed the following day so why not a minor long term solution that would only need to be implemented once  we already have one pink ship the phobos that is pretty ty compared to the onyx and broadsword and kind of resembles a  well why couldnt it resemble a boob  could edit jita 44 slightly so it resembles a boob or put a pink brest cancer awareness ribbon by the undock point  we donated gtcs to a natural disaster why couldnt we have a campaign where we donate to valuable research to save more livesthough if the above is false about the one day change and it is not a big issue to simply turn the ship templates pink we could have a pinkonline day to represent our commitment to finding a cure and to bring awareness to others

i 100 support this message pink smilie
sorry im an ass man
save the tatas
a world without breasts is not a world i want to live in
i recognize the issue but i dont support this solutioni agree with this if you get disconnected your friends should still have a chance to repair you while you try to reconnecti suggest that the better solution is to address the root of the problem dont let the ship disappear if it is the target of a hostile module
supported intentional disconnecting should be discouraged in any form or way you should up the ante infact instantly deplete the capacitor when a person leaves the game doesnt make sense that his defensive modules can continue to run without player input
not supported just make a proposal that disconnected tackled ships do not disappear as long as they are tackled this change is extremely counterintuitive and makes no sense lorewise
thank you bagehi you pretty much have hit the nail on the head while i already grant all my full corporation members the junior accountant role to let them see what is going on i dont see this using a external tool as a particularly good way of building up trustrakshasa i am curious as to your phraseology i am assuming you are refering to the dev effort involved in creating the tool rather than the difficulty of creating an extra function inner joins and lookups for database queriesfurthermore if we use an internal to the game tool  method to do this there is less chance of someone developing a tool to do this and accidentally harvest logins and passwords to be reported back when the tool checks for updates yes i know there are those on here who are exceptionally good at coding and are able to design this tool without too much effort or analysing the code to see exactly what it does i unfortunatly tend to be able to test code and get a rough idea what it does while being able to write hello world scripts on a good dayone of the reasons it may be that more corporations do not do this is the amount of effort involved in executing this as well as implicit trust in the person who develops the code i am going to have a bash at throwing something together but the key point is that an internal ccp tool that actually helps corp managment or industry hasnt been delivered in a significant amount of time furthermore it simplifies director  ceo workload which is already high enough as it is yes the vast majority of the great unwashed who have no exposure to this wont give a dn either way but it certainly would make financial tracking and investment planning a lot easiergranted i understand the if it aint broke dont fix it argument but just because we could use flint and steels and an open fire for all our cooking i bet theres a few of you who like using a microwave occasionallyincidentally by default i would anticipate the default wallet would remain master unless otherwise specified as stated earlier i am aware that this would probably not be a trivial thing to address however eventually a sprint team may possibly look at wallets roles and industry hence proposing it anyways off to vs to see if i can remember how to make a function
thats a good outline i can certainly understand the use of this especially as corporations start to scale up in size this could certainly go along with a more generalized overhaul of the corp management system which imo is already needed your current proposal is actually only specific because youre stating your specific use of this potential function you could use it for example to allow investment on a specific thing well use a bpo as an example and then pay dividends only based on that investments performance by using a certain wallet for the sales generated by that bpo in general just allow more control of what money goes where and allow dividends to be paid to different groups from different wallets supported

the main barrier to entry in 00 are players so unless you change the playerbase you will get very little with your change people dont want unknowns in 00 and people getting to 5 millions sp after 2 month playing will be unknowns you need player skills to survive in 00 and the 5 million sp is more an indication of time spent playing than a needed level of sp so unless you know some 00 player or can show some kind of curriculum people alredy living inn00 will see you as some kind of liability even if you have half a zillion sp basically it change little beside having faster training alts
training has nothing to do with itits a matter of where why how what dont matter how many spsthe barrier into null sec is low sec once you get past that then you got alliances that control various areas of spaceexcusing it for lack of training is just going to make the alt problem far worseso basically youve wasted your time
youve better stopped your hard work at this pointi do not wonder that you heard something like this because it is widespread myth  what does not make it less than pure bs pvewise you can start from 1 mil sp in real skills not learning or even less or right from the day one there is no game mechanics to disallow this no skilllocked dungeons you knowif you talk about 00 corps requirements then  they may vary a lot  it is not sp corps are concerned about it is real player experience sp here is used as a convenient measurement tool for game time spent and real player skills assumingly acquired established corps do not want many clueless newbs no matter how much sp they formally haveyour nullsec entry barrier is social and psychological thing not something directly implemented in game mechanics as you are prone to believe

what ever came of this issue raised in csm 2ccp xhagen noted that what they were trying to say is that a mistake was made with the renaming a mistake that was corrected for better or worse he felt that from the discussion that the naming policy is good following it is now the important part he also thinks that csm could forsee a name changing mechanism within eve however it would always keep a public record of those changes he wanted to know if ccp should move forward in assessing whether it was technically possible to do this the csm generally agreed to ccp seeing if it was technically possible and because ccp xhagen asked and hes scary this is a check of technicality nothing has been decided about actually implementing anythingreference link
i dont have any experience with nonlatin alphabets or languages that have local and latin equivalents so im unsure on how this would work it would have to go into a new issue in any caseas to this proposal any further comments id like to raise it as a hopefully simple fix losing links when copy pasting stuff from one channel to an intel channel is annoying at the moment
doesnt everyone hates when someone buys a piece of tritanium for one million and the price charts becomes unreadable because it scales between 0 and the highest pricei propose to add a checkbox that allows to filter out all the prices that are highr than the 99th percentile or in alternative two textboxes to define the low and high values to which the graph must be scaled
in the market window under settings you can filter out prices which are too lowhigh already maybe that affects the graph aswell
problem the chat filter on the eveo site and forums is very strict while the chat in the game remains unfiltered but you can get pwned by gm for even sayin pen15we need user settable chat filters in and out of game and as a side benefit the gms no longer have to waste their precious time smackin ppl for pen15ing in local meaning the gms have time to do more useful things
im never gonna fly one of these or pretend to know all the mechanicsbut to me it only seems logical that titans are sorta like the real world equivalent of suvs at a certain point gas is gonna be more expensive and smart cars and hybrids become a viable option to get to where you want to go a titan is bigger than a pos and for some alliance members pos upkeep is a full time occupation in eve not to mention that it does cost a pretty penny every month to own and keep a pos network online i dont give a flying f if a titan uses weapons or not it is an important fleet asset to those that have them  even if it just sits in a pos like a rorqual all day and bridges fleets across space the majority do just thisthis aspect is being ignored to a large extent in this discussion a ship that is as big as an outpost and in the vast majority of cases more important in a battle even without firing a single shot should cost a considerable amount to crew and maintain on a monthly basisedit  to argue otherwise is like saying the light dictors bubble didnt affect the outcome of a gate fight when the guy decided not to try warp off after seeing it pop up
this is why titan and supercapitals in general really proliferation is a bad thingit forces people to blob up to kill them for people who cantwont blob up it makes it untenable for them to deploy capitals against a corp or alliance with a supercapital pilot online which makes committing to major subcapital battles in the presence of a threat to capital escalation untenable purely on the basis of that single supercapital pilot which since no one likes constantly losing andor being denied fights encourages people to attempt to blob up furthermore they create an insurmountable barrier between the old rich and the new andor poor unless the latter join a massive blobthat you somehow seem to think this is okay is why you dont get the problem and the threadoh supported
usually when you use broadcast you gotta have it up and look at it sometimes shinny and other times blinky but not everyone like me likes it because its another window openedso how about when you broadcast an order like broadcast align to it uses your fleet chat so the whole fleet can see it  that would be great for small fleetsprobably for big ones tooi dont usually use the broadcast window to look at the orders being displayed for an fc that would be a great tool in its asset
sorry for my english and my crazy ideas for my english i cant do anything atm but why is it a crazy idea meaby i dont explain correctly again i dont say make cheaper t3 ships im saying that a more balanced prices in salvaged items should be more correct meaby you dont understand very well but with balanced prices the final price of one t3 ship can be the samewith my example i tryed to explain that 23 of the price its caused by only one item its simple isnt i hope you dont lost again
yes i would support of making price distribution more regular after all melted ribbons are supposed to be common salvage but it costs thousand times more than rare talk of lack of simple math somewhere in drop tablesjust i have growing suspicion that it is hard if not impossible to make the hypothetical new equilibrium anyhow stable just a gut feeling i would like to be wrong here
while nanoribbons are indeed the bottleneck in t3 production and quite a large one at that their distribution is random and you find just as many proportionally in a c1 as a c6 t3 ships are at a reasonable price right now mess with the drop ratestables and you really risk upsetting the balance and potentially sending the price of t3 hulls all over the place
i was talking with my corp mates cause we just moved to 00 and alot of the industrial core has been complaining that cloakers specificly stealth bombers have been coming in and afking in the system which puts a big stop to industrial activitys cause no one seems to want to waste time gaurding them and they could get jumped at any moment well theres no real way to catch them eather so heres my ideahave a sovernty structure like the cyno jammer that allows you to ping or flash a system that will instantly and temporarly for like 510 seconds decloak every ship this allows players to scan down these pesky afk cloakies and kill them and scare off active cloakies to make systems saferi know your all going to say oh this isnt fairwrong heres whythe device will be placed outside the pos field and is open to attackthe device can be used every 30 minutes to an hourthe device can only be placed if you own soverntyyou have a specific leveltype of upgrade to your hubsany one out in a safe spot not in a common spot like outside a station belt or gate would have to be scanned down giving the player time to come back and recloakor my other idea is very simulara system that sets a timer for cloaking devices when this system is placed and online all cloaking devices in the system depending on which device t1 t2 and so on will be active for 1 or 2 hours before shutting down for 5 minutes of course you would have to have a log or something so they cant just jump out and jump back in and be poof instant reset kinda thingso yea tell me whatcha think and be nice poh and while your here cheak out my other postspaintshop
i think its better than the other idea meaby with a bit retouch but good idea
so you want to live in 00 and be all cool and stuffbut you dont want to defend or guard anythingand you dont want to be jumped or be involved in any nonconsensual pvpyou think you need a device to counter something that cannot target shoot kill or do anything to youi think you need to go back to high sec or possibly back to wowthis topic only reaffirms how broken the local mechanic is why should you be able to know if their are cloakers in system isnt the whole point of cloaking is that you are not detected if anything cloakers should be removed from local so they can actually be used to surprise opponents and while we are changing local lets scrap it all and put in a new mechanic no support for this kind of proposal ever
stop whining is that all you trolls doi am trying to level the playing field between cloaking and non cloaking ships as far as nonconsentual pvp thats what the timers are for duh have some one come in if their really active or stupid they will ping that one person then a fleet of sbs can come in and reak havok for the next hour or so with out getting caught unless the pilot of the sb is stupid oh and just so you know i would gaurd some one but im kind of broke at the moment for helping the move to 00 so once i get my pvp ship back ill happily gaurd but i cant gaurd an entire mining op and possibly even rorquals by myself people dont want to do it cause they dont see it as important cause they would rather be running plexs and making money but  cause theres very little or nothing on the market cause the industrials are struggling to make stuff for you to usenow why dont you come back with a convincing argument as to why we cant do this other then im a noob or this is unfair to every one who pilots a cloaking ship about your only convincing argument is the part about them being stealth but like all stealth anything theres always something thats not covered for example if we had it in real life cloaking would only hide you visualy a device that sees magnetic fields electronic signatures or thermal signautes would see right though it and no matter how quiet the stealthiest sub in the world is you bounce a ping agenst it its gonna be foundoh and considering that ccp doesnt make it so that cloaks drain a huge ammount of cap or have a timer you guys allready have it pritty easy

no have someone in your corp train for a rorqual its not that hard and its a surprisingly capable and versatile ship00 logistics are already far far too easy as it is and this could have wider effects than that
no no no no no you do not get any hint on what the password was only that you cracked open the cargo you get the same agro as a normal can theft and as a response to this we get an encrypted secure container that takes 10x longer to hack but it also contains 10x more stuff also adjust its volume so it cant be used by haulers as a way to get free storageimho a basic hack should be like the in game mission style where you have to sit close and wait sometimes you get it right away other times you can be sitting there for an hour or more which sucks and would leave you very vulnerable to any sort of attack if someone was in systemasa for notification an after the fact type would be alright but itd be nice to know instantly in game that a cans being hacked into the risk should be purely that you find out and come after them though second they begin to attack your can they are painted by the owner and possibly the corp as well
first off that was no insult i dont need to insult anyone it just seemed odd to me that a person who talks that way to a forum admin wants to contribute somethign to that thread but i see you actually can contribute something useful no offenseok my reasoning i regard that from a roleplay point of view if you like eve is a gigantic hightech universe with more scammers and scumbags than inhabitants sometimes its just logical to me that some of them or at least one invented a mod to ship contraband through highsec without concord noticing itfor the afk issue well i cant force people to stay on the pc while playing eve but neither do i think that this mod would encourage afk travel as teadaze said there should be a downside one could be to make it a lowslot module so that haulers would have to sacrifice cargohold another one could be to give the mod very steep fitting requirementsi think that smuggling should become a mini profession again if you looked at eve with my eyes you would see that there had to be such things like smuggling and maybe scanblock modules  regards lax
maybe you shouldnt be a lazy ass gate camper stop your ign abtou peopel being able to play the game afk that makes it easier for you to lock on lock down and pillage it makes your job easier when you try to poke your nose into the trunk of a ship and get told no hmm no addimtance huh must be something worth me shooting them for then in thereheres a thought make it a highslot make it active and make it use a ton of cap so using it is the difference between say making it across the system in 2 jumps or having the gatecampers see whats in the trunk also if you have it running and someone tries to scan your cargo they get told flat out you are running a scrambler theyre faster they can beat you to the next gate unless they too are afk
how many days in advance issues should be put in this list the most dutiful csm member is teadaze that has at least reserved a space there is really nothing to discuss at this time
ofc there is we are talking about issues unofficially between meeting all the time then post the agenda day or two before the meeting its a process we adopted in csm 40 and it works gave pretty good solutions for most issues so faralso we are discussing list of fixes and features for development assessment as part of the new process for csm that we agreed with ccp last summit explained in last devbcsm 40 is still in the office and working hard
so we will know what will be discussed too late to try to convince a csm member to add a topic to the list sorry but the new procedures you are implementing seem to put more and more distance between the csm and most eve players
as i understand it if you want a topic raised on a meeting you promote this idea before the csm members decide what they will pick up this list will allow the other csm members that didnt raise the topic to have a few days to read up before the actuall session it doesnt put any distance between csm and regular eve players instead showing us whats going on before the meeting
fixed it for you if you are very concerned that topic be included make that known ahead of time instead of waiting like a lazy troll to see what isnt on the list and then complain that whatever isnt on there should have been if youre trolling try harder if youre not trolling try harder
great brain alekseyev a b normalthe issue should be in the assembly hall at least 1 week before the csm meeting so there is no way to add something at the last moment what this change do is to make impossible to try to contact a csm member to get him to support a argument if you see that is passed over again after several csm meeting not that it will make any difference as the arguments are chosen at the total discretion of the csm members seeing how forcing a discussion require 5000 voters in 1 weeki am very curious to see what crucial topics will be in the discussion this time
problem the chat filter on the eveo site and forums is very strict while the chat in the game remains unfiltered but you can get pwned by gm for even sayin pen15we need user settable chat filters in and out of game and as a side benefit the gms no longer have to waste their precious time smackin ppl for pen15ing in local meaning the gms have time to do more useful things
been awhile since i looked at aff im not sure theyd like ccp plagiarizing their stuffs
mephistonover the past four csm periods this issue has been raised several times already factional warfare the industry expansion epic mission arcs and just generally old and abandoned content has been mentioned to ccpwith csm5 becomming a stakeholder in the csm process you might see the csm being taken more seriously i hope this will bring about a policy change as you are absolutely right that too much unfinished content is being rushed out of the door and then abandoned with every new expansion

god yes please betterbigger fonts i play at 2560x1600 and the eye strain is awful
yes because the rokh is the only ship that uses railguns
what you say is true only if both sides have equal numbers of ships deal steady streams of dps without alpha lock times and other such things and remain until every last ship is gone as is its not uncommon for ships to be killed in a single volley as fleet sizes increase making ehp less and less important and dps moreso also this ignores all the times where youre shooting at a target thats either unable to shoot or unable to shoot effectively at the range youve chosen where dps is all that matters put simply in any sniper ship doing damage at range is the core purpose of the ship and thus must be weighted more heavily then secondary capabilities such as survivability furthermore the entire issue with a shield tank in fleets was mentioned by the above poster i dont need to add anything other then hes rightfinally if were to believe your concept of fleet efficiency then not only should there be more rokhs but there should also be more abbadon snipers about since theyre much much more efficient with their 446dps and 87k ehp tanks while we all know that there are reasons that preclude such a solution from being popular or effective this dosent show up in your preformance chart and fairly effectively illustrates why the chart presents a thoroughly flawed persepective on the idea of sniper preformence
the larger the gang the more dps  ehpthe larger the fleet the more alpha  dpsalso as has been said repeatedly if the rokh is worsecomparable to the apoc but costs more then the rokh is worthlessthe way i fit the apoc was simply to prove that it was better as an ultrasniper than the rokh even though that is the rokhs supposed niche you have to compare ships in the same element or it isnt a true comparison you could put pulse lasers on the apoc and say see the rokh is better at ranged combat you have to compare them in the same element if you want to claim railguns do not need to be fixedthe hyperion and mega are also supposed to have a strong closerange niche which they dont really have compared to pulse lasers because they certainly dont have a longrange niche because those ships are mediocre to bad for ranged combat this is the point of the fits to show that large rails do not have a niche in the game medium rails also do not have a niche the only ship they possibly work on is the eagle and thats only due to the bonuses on bonuses on bonuses to range for that ship small rails are just a joke like small arties  they cant track the stuff they are supposed to hit ie not battleships or battlecruisers
everyone keeps talking about the flavor of rails needing to change and not the dps so if my memory serves me correctly rails used to have a chance to bypass the first layer of defense and strike the second layer that would make things interesting no doubt
field command ships upgradetldr field command ships severely lack any staying power and or dps and or fitting in the current eve environment since their introduction much has changed making field commands very obsolete for pretty much everything the field commands were designed for for people who still dont get it this thread is not for fleet command ships only for field command ships the ones that do not give bonuses that said i believe some small tweaks to them could be welcome particularly eos and if you want me to make a thread about those too id be happy too same for tier 1 bcs having had the skill command ships at lvl 5 for well over 2 years now and when people ask about command ships everyone always tells them to just fly a bc or t3 instead or a bs if mobility does not matter i thought it was time these got its long deserved boost and make them more viable i have been careful to not over boost them field commands have become more and more obsolete as the years have gone by thus i am proposing this upgrade to them general boost to all 4 of them absolution nighthawk astarte sleipnir make them all use base hps from the tier 2 bc class instead of tier 1 this will help them have a little more staying power on the field but still not enable massive buffers a small agility boost they handle almost like a plated battleship 3040 sensor strength boost this will place them not as high as recons and certainly less than an eccmd battleship and is something they really need as they are far too easily disabled ship boosts all of them 1 slot all fitting increments are base values thus skills will boost them further absolution 1 med slot  15 cpu it is still unable to make much use of the last high slot bar a small neutnos but it can now fit an eccm making a harbinger not outclass it in every regard bar pure ehp harb still does more dps this will enable it to work better solo or in gang situations in a fleet youd use the damnation after all for being so reliant on capacitor it has a very small cargo bay a small boost there could be helpful i was going to ask for a 25 m3 drone bay and bandwidth but that might be too much alternative boost 1 low slot  26 cpu if possible additional powergrid to make last high slot able to fit something be preferred too like gang link needs 120 pg conclusion this will make the abso much more viable as either expensive solo or actually more useful than a harbinger in gangs due to sensor strength and a bit more staying power harb still does more dps though nighthawk with the tiny hp boost proposed above this ship will still have ehp comparable with a drake pvp fit as with the absolution this ship needs another slot and this ship really needs a mid slot in regards to pvp 1 med slot a second thing it lacks which has been said countless times over the years is power grid and it lacks a lot of it assuming 5th low as a reactor control 80 pg assuming power diagnostic 150 pg that is up to ccp personally id recommend the 150 pg with the hp boost and 1 med slot some people may be worried about super passive tanks id like to point out that a rattlesnake would still be better and that such a fit cant do anything but lol dps or lvl 5 missionded 10 plex tanking should ccp not like it simply increase its shield recharge base value somewhat to make it have the same passive tank as before its boost conclusion you will have enough fitting for an active tank or a buffer tank buffer tank does not fit cap booster as i believe giving it fitting for that would be too much it will now no longer be a worse and more expensive drake but actually be viable mostly due to sensor strength and another med slot like the abso it will still be an expensive drake just like the abso will still be an expensive harbinger but it is no longer outclassed it every way
astarte this ship is a bit difficult for being a pure gank ship it has too little dps over the others and to little fitting for a proper neutron fit to make it more ganky to keep it in its role 1 high slot  1 gun hard point  295 pg this will enable it to fit 8x netron blasters ii and dual rep assuming 2x dmg mods dual rep config with neutrons this will be the stats 480 tank 5x medium ecm drones will make that more effective 856 gun dps a small cargo bay increase for cap boosters just like the abso would be helpful too edit alternative boost 1 low slot  165 pg it would give it more survivability but it would be less ganky a sleipnir would do the same dps before drones some people prefer this over the other proposal though but in the end this is up to ccp conclusion a shield buffered brutix no longer is more or less better than this ship it now has its role as i believe the astarte was designed to have a proper gank boat but now it actually has a semblance of a tank and it has finally a dps advantage over the other ships in its class sleipnir usually considered the best of the field commands does not say much though giving it another slot like the others is a given and a tiny cpu increase for those who like xl booster configs 1 med slot  45 cpu this will enable it to keep its niche as a heavy vagacyclone depending on what you prefer buffer or xl booster configs will now be a little better conclusion the sleip will be like it has always been but now a little better in its niche roles the xl booster fit will still crumble under any form of neuting or fights lasting more than a minute and the buffer fit is still slower than hacs or shield bcs overall conclusion the field commands will now be more than just expensive battlecruiser and have a place in solo and smallmid sized gangs like they should fleet commands like damnation are for big gangsfleets if you still havent gotten it theyre severe lack of slots and fittings will no longer be such a huge issue as it has always been they will not obsolete the battlecruiser class and in a straight 1 vs 1 a battleship rightly will still beat them just fine they will certainly not be overpowered as some people keep fearing i believe the small hp boost and agility boost should also be applied to their base ships prophecy ferox brutix cyclone but that their upgrading to be comparable to tier 2 bcs should be different than the changes to these field command ships agree with the above idea hate it changetweak it somewhat post about it and remember to check the i support field if you do and remember to keep proposals balanced
i am not prepared to discuss what exactly must be done but something must and yeah save eos from being uselesssupported
they are generally not used in pvp simply because the risk outweighs the benefit the price is higher than a battleship but a battleship brings more to a fighti mean if they are meant for mission runningratting give them a more carebear name and get rid of leadership requirements
i support this idea especially the sleipnir always wanted an extra med on one of those p dont really know about the other field commands apart from mission nighthawk
i like thiswell i think the astarte is still problematic because of rep bonus and the fact midslotslowslots are generally more valuable but its still a huge improvementnow if only the sleipnir looked like a t2 hurricane
seeing as this was my original proposal i support this greatly taya out
im unqualified to decide on how appropriate those specific suggestions are but im definitely all for game balancing so 1up from me
oh yeah definitely supported  the amount of time spent fiddling with the bastards trying to get em to fit  not suck could have been so better utilized killing someone with one honest
ccp  please acknowledge these ideas
im in favor of this fix o
yes i would like these to be fixed please as even 51 serround still dont work right in eve

that this issues havent been attended to yet is the most pathetic thing in the gaming history ive ever witnessed
neato
more in game stuff less out of game stuff except the upcoming evegate
support this it is the next logical step1 make it easier to find a corp to join2 make it easier to find a fleet to join3 make it easier to find an event to joinanything to smooth out the learning cliff

please do it 
great idea 
you are correct gas giants can appear anywhere in the starsystem as long as they are able to condense fast enough before the star starts its reactions and blows away the gas and dust from the centerwhat i was poking at however was the mass of those gas giants as it was a bit too small to be gas giant to be gas giant the planet should have enough mass to keep some of the lighter gases helium would be good start although i do not know where the line is drawn usually then again this issue has already sorted the best possible way in my opinion by ccp hiring the astrophysics guy from local university to take a good look at their planets and stars
1 thats because low sec pirates rarely fight with any less than those numbers and yes being outblobbed when ure in your own blob does suck doesnt it2 i hope u can come up with a better excuse than no excuse at all3 4 to each his owna slower increase in cost the higher it goes is not how diminishing returns work especially when the skill training rate stays constant what ure asking is more rewards by levelling the cost off the higher u go so yes u r asking to cut costs and as a result lessen your risks r u understanding this at all cause for the millionth time u willingly bill yourself this cost claiming it doesnt give enough returns yet if that was the case u would not do it in the first place of course thats assuming ure not that stupid but of course what ure not understanding is ure not entitled to easy mode just because ure over the newbie hump theres no special treatment for u no matter who u r welcome to the nth year of eve adapt or dieso whats your next last post gonna be
you lose standing til you cant fly any missions anymore obviouslysupported it would be nice if at least the next mission after declining could be a different one under all circumstances
read the above post  there has already been a fix so that if you declined a given mission eg gone berserk the next mission you are offered by that agent will not be gone berserk if this doesnt happen then bug report it it doesnt need to be raised by csm  its a bugif the op is asking for something different then you need to rewrite your idea so it is more understandablekithran
wait wat i never said the idea needs to eliminate all missions you dont wanna do i simply said when i deny an attack of the drones mission i shouldnt be offered the same mission when i convo the agent for another mission where did i say i want it to eliminate all missions i prefer not to run actually i have run every mission in the game but sometimes im not in the mood to run a certain mission
please provide a link to a changelogdevblogpatch notes that says this is the case as of yesterday im still being offered the same mission immediately after declining
i already provided a link to the patch notes that says this change should have been completed years ago with the release of revelationsas has been stated if you are having this problem the correct course of action is to file a bug reportps also be sure to check that they are the same mission there are plenty of missions that are very similar but could qualify as being a different mission break their will verses blood raiders is not the same mission as break their will verses guristas
i can definitely confirm that agents will quite often offer the same mission that has just been declined declining a mission doesnt seem to have any particular effect on what mission is offered next
i endorse this product  servicehaving a refinery and a factory in the same system would be absolutely charming  especially if their undocking ramps are pointed to each other 
proposal webbers scramblers jammers neuts and other modules should have approprate effects for ship size no more frigates webbing battleships or cruisers warpscrambling battleships
you just killed the bigger and better half of eve what are you smoking 
wow you really didnt think this one through did you you realize why frigates web battleships rightthat aside why does ship size matter to these modules what does hitting a ships engines with a graviton beam or whatever the backstory is have to with the relative sizes of the ships until you explain why you feel this is an issue youre going to get flamed heavily
so lets look at it from your point of view if two fleets one of 25 frigates and 25 destroyers goes up against one of 50 battleships the fleet with smaller ships should be able to 1 web all 50 battleships 2 concentrate all 50 ships firepower on 1 battleship and 3 be able to defeat them in detail ie one at a time not talking about drones they are easy enough to kill the battle ships wouldnt be able to hit the frigates due to their speed and tracking and the frigatedestroyers could pick away at the battleships and kill them one by onewhere does that make sense to you
of course and it is one of the corner stones of eve bigger is not always the bestyou probably are posting for the sake of posting as apparently you have no clue about the game whatsoever
no i am trying to make the game relevent to real life this is supposed to ships a thousand or more years in the future there is no way that a frigate destroyer or cruiser should be able to defeat a battleship period its never happened in history and it wouldnt happen a thousand years or more in the future and yes ship size would matter when it comes to module effect and battlefield dominance due to power considerations and their ability to project they size and amount of distruption beam it would not work as currently envisioned otherwise why would anyone build ships bigger than frigates
are you trying to troll assembly hall today or sowith your idea basically all tackling specialized ships would be almost obsoletebe it interceptor heavy interdictors oh i would be really interested how you try to solve that capital warp disruption field generatorall in all  not supported
actually you can kill frigates with battleships it happens quite frequently its not easy but then hey nothing worth doing ever isaside fromt hat your argument is ridiculous a 50 ship fleet of battleships with no frigate support an fc that incompetent deserves to loseafter reading your posts from the ah today its becoming readily apparent to me that youa have no clue what youre talking about andorb youre a troll
 period hehenot even speaking that relevant to life isnt always a best way to make a gameyou have no clue about real warfare eitherabsolutely clueless or troll most probably both at same time
im guessing you have never flown a dictor when 50 ed off battleships launch drones and declare you primarytrust me the drones from 50 battleships will vaporize yer lil frig and destroyer gang no problem

youre a pretty good troll m8 5 terrible posts that have got the regulars riled uphowever this is the assembly hall and really should be for srs bsns onlyall in all going off all your posts i give you a 710
to take the bait neuts already have less effect on a bs if used by a frigcruiserthe other modules are exactly the same because theyre the same module if you fit a point to a bs or a frig its the same module and it does the same joblet me know if you want to buy a clue  i have several for sale at a low low price
some people just cant equip that lack of slots

just because you found the assembly hall doesnt mean you get to spam it with stupid ideas for the entirety of your first day just because you cantldr  nostop posting
actually as long as i am civil dont insult others and actually make proposals i can post my ideas here that you dont like those ideas is irrelevent
why dont you go the features and ideas forums where you can actually discuss and figure this sort of garbage out before spewing it all over the assembly halli dont know have you ever actually thought of doing the slightest bit of experimentation or research so you actually have some knowledge about what you are addressing you might want to try that outnow you got me wishing there was a block list for the forums

the author must understand that the freedom of speech comes with freedom of listening
small things can kill big things one airplane destroying an entire mock fleetyour post had to do with webs scrams and jams as i pointed out throughout history big ships are damaged by small ships so other big ships can come in and finish them off destroying a ships radar damaging their engines or jamming their rudder are not possible in eve cant do targeted damage so we can scram jam and web ships which accomplish the same thingif a battleship is killed by only a destroyer or frigate ingame they are doing something horribly wronghowever here is a historical case of a smaller ship defeating a larger ship el gamo vs speedy another instance in history is when the confiance 18 guns defeated the hms kent 38gun 820 ton point is it sometimes has happened irl and ingame usually light ships are used in both to harass a larger ship so heavier ships can come in for the kill
fi is already filled with these underaged heroes please no more
the issue is that what differentiate a bpc over a bpo is an attribute among many of the item to the database they are the same items with different attributes thats also why the only surefire way of knowing bpc from bpo is to pull the show info windowab and mwd are entirely different items they belong to different trees therefore no database melting issue here i cant see how it would take longer than a meagre few minutes to implement just play a little with the hue slider in photoshop
drake please stop going around making yourself look stupid keyloggers cant decipher mouse clicks which arent keystrokes if you even looked at the op which you didnt you would see what the real suggestion is
good idearemove the retrieve password from station containers and make them able to store fitted shipsthey already cant be repackaged if there is a 3 week old log entrythis gives ccp and you enough time to act if your hacked
at discussion is a 9digit keypad that is a part of the pin window that you click on this is the onscreen keyboard that you yourself said would be best please read before respondingalso i would like to point out that it is possible to record clicks and mouse position which would make it possible to determine what somebodys pin  no matter where the pin window is  based on the pattern of mouse positions probably the best way to avoid this would be to randomize the number positions every time the pin pad is opened it would still then be susceptible to taking a screenshot along with capturing the mouse data but with this kind of complexity you all but eliminate wouldbe account thieves spending this much time trying to trick people en masse and it would turn into a much more targeted attack and as long as people who are worth anything in eve are competent and know not to download and run suspiciouslooking things they will be safe
then say onscreen buttons moron keys are keys on a keyboardand also you should be aware that screens can be recorded
dont be such a bloody grammar  you know very well what he meantas for the topic you dont get anything for free in eve so why should mission hubs be endless fields of free loot and salvage if you want it so bad pay someone to fleet up with you and let you take care of his breadcrumbs
all the learning skills except learning itself has a companion skill ie instant recall has eidetic memoryproposal add companion learning skill to the learning skill call it advanced learning or university learning it doesnt matter the name just the result make this skill on par with other advanced companion learning skills 3x learning time multiplier 2 faster learning per level
learning skills are widely including ccp itself recognized as a wrong step which unfortunately is too late to take backbut why on earth you want to make that mistake even bigger
while i dont necessarily think that learning skills are in and of themselves a waste of time adding another learning skill is defiantely not the way to get faster training we have enough learning skillsif you want faster training id rather see them open up an advanced cybernetics skill that allows for better attribute implants perhaps all the way up to 10
not supported eve would be better without learning skills at all not having more of them to train
you already have your learning skill at 4 or 5 dont you so how is this any skin off your nose
you want faster training get a set of 5snot supported and yes i got all existing learning skills at 5 helps when you get podded now and then
thisand thank you op sooo much for opening up a can of worms topic here comes the learning skills suxxorz crowd
i finished my learning skills 2 years ago if you make me train a new one i will fly over to you and pod you back to the character generation screen
i have a better learning skill for you how bout a skill which you train that would make it so you didnt have to train learning skills thatd be awesome
iow you have yours screw everyone else
put the 6 and 7 implants into the game they are already in the database
how on earth is adding more learning skills going to help you lower the amount of learning skills you have to train
i would rather lose the million plus sp i have in learning skills if it meant the removal of all learning skills than have another learning skill addedskin off my nose i dont want to have to waste time training another skill that has no other purpose ingame than to create another hurdle for new characters to work on it provides no benefit to new players who will have to spend more time training skills to train skills and no benefit to existing players who have spent time training skills without it
make training time 10 faster for new players are you dumb or something they already receive a 100 skill training speed bonus until they hit 16mil spstop ing posting
that would hurt you how you would get the bonus as well if you wanted it its zero sum at worst
i support this as long as i can fly around and shoot people while im supposedly still afk
i want this
makes a lot of sense but mostly in your friendly ie corp channels
it would be really nice to be able to optionally set an afk status this possibility need to be completely optional and without any autoafk mode like in some other games
make it engage targetmine repeatedlyi dont see why miners shouldnt be able to hotkey control their drones
i support this idea the engage target shortcut should start a mining drone mining when there is an asteroid as the current target
remove targeting range penality from warp stabilizers so pve players and mission runners can chose to enter combat with pvpers or not in real life i can avoid fighting if i dont want to same should be possible in eve
how about you just dont put stabs in
so basically undo the nerf they specifically put in a year or 2 agodont see this one going very far
a big no this will lead to people sitting at 100km from a gate instapopping ships like was so common before the nerf 12 stabs in low slots to prevent anyone from being able to kill them or carriers sitting on gates ganking people with a bunch of stabs so they can escape before enough people show up to tackle them this was what low sec choke points looked like prestabnerf you couldnt travel between the different sections of high sec space and have a reasonable expectation of survivingthe warp stab nerf helps carebears more than it hurts them dont ask for changes until youve fully thought through the ramifications often the nerfs are heavily for your benefit like in this case
you really didnt put much thought into this did you
facepalms you will definitely break the record for most stupid suggestions in a rowbenefit less likely to be warp scrambledprice targeting range penaltyseems balanced to me
anyone but pee v peeers want to comment on here
actually we are industrialists sorry to burst your bubblealthough we do pvp a little bit not sure about darius likely would be mean in a fight
agreeing with darius hereand damn you op ive had to wait another 5 minutes to describe how blisteringly stupid you are since i just posted on the web threadthe uncatchable carriers snipers etc that plagued eve before the nerf to stabs is not something you want to return toalso your probably suffering from one of the followingdesiring to ratplexmish in nullseclosec in complete safetyyou have been wardecd and want to mish in empireyou have not yet considered the implications of the infinipoint on a heavy interdictor yet have youalso stop posting
yes i would love to sit 130km off a gate with a sniper battleship raping people in the face while being able to get away from every interceptor that comes to pin me down for his fleetsupportedoh and congratulations on the first thumbsup youve gotten for any of your suggestions today
there is hope that ccp will release it on pc once the console noobcakes get modern warfare 3 or something similar and everyone run there  which they inevitably will but for now have patience and give them some time
console fps  pc fpsbut please keep making these emo rage tear threads they taste delicious
allow ship target to be marked by user as friendly no fire to prevent friendly fire instances in combat we are talking advanced computer system in several thousand years in the future that type of marking would be standard on such advanced computers will allow ships to be targetted for rr purposes and keep you from accidently attacking them real life illustration of this is infrared strobs to mark friendly troops in combat today
its called setting them to blueduh
before ccp added those nice standing icons to the locked targets i would have said ok maybe but now that issue is solved if you cant differ between friends and foe now well then you will shoot your friends lets just hope you notice it before you blew them up
this it has already been fixed
also please do not attempt to make eve idiotproof which is really what youre trying to do herein eve mistakes have consequences  just like real life the correct response is to pay attention to whats going on around you
you dont think the us military is currently working hard to prevent friendly fire incidents and if mistakes have consequences why doesnt theft and destruction of others property have consequences in eve ie suicide ganking where the person buys a cheap ship buys insurance blows up someone elses stuff gets concorded then gets paid back the money and more from insurance your inconsistant here
this is not the us miliary wts  spellingreadingcomprehensionthis is eve online adapt or diesuicide ganking has nothing to do with standings either what are you doing pulling ideas out of your  todaystop comparing eve online to real life this game is not real life if you think it is time for you to leave and get a reality checkccp puts standings on your overview hud to make it clear if someone is blue to you or not if your even capable of understanding such a concept as i suspect your just a nooblet fresh out of whatever it is you came fromand even then standings mean nothing when anyone and i do mean anyone can shoot you anyway
you are supposed to be arguing that your idea has merit we said a fix already exists and you havent given a reason why the existing fix is not enough of a solution imo friendly fire in eve usually is attributed to drunk playerstroll quote removed zymurgist
if you can mark a target as a fleet or squad commander and transmit that mark to other pilots so they can fire on it first individual pilots ought to be able to mark targets and mark them as friendly target and not allow their guns to fire on them
i as an fc can mark a target that tells people what they should be shooting at i as an alliance director can mark standings that tells people whom they should and should not be shooting at i as an fc cannot force a pilots guns to fire upon a specific target i as an fc or alliance director cannot force a pilots guns to not fire upon a specific targetthe functionality you are proposing is whats called dumbingdown the game if the logis in your fleet keep shooting friendlies then its time to say hey stop being an idiot or youre out not hey you cant stop being an idiot so im gonna make it so you cant be an idiot
if you can point out targets for yourself you can tell your ship not to shoot at those ships if you so chose if this was accruate representation of space travelcommerce
i can actually see a situation where the proposal would be useful even given the current featuresif you have multiple targets locked some friendly maybe youre spider tanking and some hostile then imagine that youre about to try to activate a harmful module on a hostile target however just before you press the button to activate the module you lose the lock on that specific hostile target maybe it just jumped maybe it just warped maybe it was just destroyed maybe it just docked maybe it just flew into a pos shield your interface automatically selects a different target that you already have locked because as long as youve got at least one thing locked you must have a lock selection and it brings up that different targetlock just a split second before you activate the module the result then is that youve now activated a hostile module on a target that the computer switched on youan alternative proposal would be to add a confirmation dialog youre about to fire on a fleetmategood standingcorpmatealliancemate are you sure ok cancel   do not ask me again like all confirmation dialogs the user could turn it off permanently and turn it back on later from the main menu if this were to be implemented then the confirmation dialog might be the fastest method of implementing it instead of a completely new tickbox somewhere
notice you cannot activate module your targeting computer just lost a lock and is still confused please wait one secondfar superior solution than a confirmation dialog which anyone would have disabled anywaypersonal attack is not allowedapplebabe
make the amount of loot that drops related to the number and type of ships attacking so if its a solo fight of equal ship class all or close to all of the loot will drop if you have a frigate getting ganked by a whole fleet not much if anything will be lefti suggest that this makes sense that less equipment would be damaged if there were fewer and less powerful attackers in fact it always seemed odd that you could have just as much loot drop if you were killed by 60 others as you would if you were killed by 1 btw i dont think it will fix blobbing but it will be something to mitigate against iti discussed the pros and cons in the features and ideas thread before posting you can read that here
definitely the way to go after you got all that positive feedback in fid
the blob does not care about your loot it simply wants you dead
supported will definitely need some refining but its worth bringing up to the csmccp
someones been reading scrapheap i seeits a nice idea and may well incentivise small gangs and good fights but it wont stop the blob oh how i hate that term when large fleets go out do you think they rank and file care about or expect to see any of the loots anywaysaying that reducing loot drops to near zero for ganks as you call them would be a bad thing imho many alliances do fund replacementreimbursement from the spoils of larger battles and under your system there would be little left from a legit fleet engagement where both sides are equally matchedid be more inclined for agreeing with a near 100 drop in a 1vs1 with it scaling up to current rates and capping with say a 5vs1 situation
so let me get this straight you think loot is going to dissuade people from blobbingdo you even have a inkling of an understanding fleet tactics do you even know why they blobsorry to say you have no business coming up with ideas for something you quite clearly have no bloody idea what your talking aboutloot is the last thing any fleet will consider loot is just a consolation prize the real prize is kicking your ass to kingdom come with all due respect
i have been reading scrapheap challenge  its a great resource  but i did not see this issue brought up im not very thoroughyour idea of ramping up the loot drop for smaller fights but limiting the damage to the loot at a certain point whether current levels or whatever is certainly something to be considered that would mean there would really only be a pvp boost it would likely hurt industrialists though how this balance should be struck would need to be considered perhaps if we had statistics that would show how many and what types of ships are involved in kills we could better gauge the impact of these changes but even if we dont have that information ccp could take small steps in this direction and sort of learn as they go
trust me the gank fleet was just as disappointed as you were that they found you they definitely were looking for something more substantial to kill possibly something that actually shot back at them changing the loot drop isnt going to make a difference theyre just shooting you to get out the frustration of not finding something better to kill yet i mean people shoot pods noob ships and shuttles regardless of loot in fact gangs will shoot the wrecks destroying the loot so they can keep moving without leaving a trail
thanks for giving me due respect to answer your questionsfirst question im not saying it will fix blobbing i think i said that in the op it will provide a perhaps small disadvantage to larger fleet fights and a small advantage to fighting in smaller gangs second question yes i think i have an inkling of an understanding of fleet tactics third question i would need to know who they are in order to know their motivation for blobbing so right now i will answer no i dont think i know why they blob
right now the largest anchorable container is the giant secure container or gsc for short it can hold 3900m3that is a pathetically small amount of space for any real kind of usethe main reason i see gscs used is for mining ops to be able to transfer ore from a miner to a hauler without using a container accessible by a can flipperhowever the space inside a gsc is so tiny that i literally mine more m3 per cycle then there is space in the gscwhat i am proposing is something that can be anchored with at the very least 10000m3 however such a container would also have at least 10000m3 volume to prevent storing them inside industrials to augment cargo capacityarguements against and why they are sillythis is really just a request to make mining easierno it is not mining into a gsc is an incredibly bothering task it is much easier to mine simply into a jetcan mining into a gsc is however the only way to safegaurd ore other then leaving a belt get an orcaorcas take months to train for and cost hundreds of millions of isk it is simply not feasible to just get an orca even if the corp you are in offers orca services they will not always be able to play to your schedule have your hauler nearbydoesnt work if there is somebody hovering over your can waiting to steal
just to save people to post the same arguments against it again features  ideas discussion thread
you have 3 choicesa mine into a jetcan and deal with the possibility that your ore can be stolenb mine into a gsc and be absolutely 100 secure from ore thieves but with less capacityc mine into several gscs and be absolutely 100 secure from ore thieves but have to take the time to set them upi dont see the problem here eve is a game of teamwork strategy and skill i dont want to see people making a fortune on their own without the help of somebody this is what corps are for corps have mining ops corps have orcas and rorquals if you cant be online when your orcas are online then you need to find a different corpnot supported
this is exactly what i am facing i really cannot see a problem with creating a bigger secure container makes life easier have never in my life seen a single valid reason why you cannot make a big box with a lockbecause then they introduce a 1k m3 secure container everybody will suddenly be making fortunes your argument is silly rorquals and orcas are ships this guy is asking for a big box to put stuff into i cannot see any reason why we cannot give him one
then maybe you should read my post again he has a big box he can put stuff into its called a cargo container that box is insecure and lasts for one hour if he wants a longterm secure storage container than hes going to have to put up with the low capacity its a matter of balance
jetcan is constructed in your ship it can exceed your cargo capacity you do not have to anchor it and place itthe giant secure container you doand its volume cannot exceed your ships cargohold capacity i still cannot see any way this would unbalance the game
the balance lies in the ease of use vs the security from thieves if security is more valuable than ease use a secure container if ease is more valuable than security use a jet can those are your choices that is the balance
fixed it for you nobody steals ore  or nobody does it in order to get the value of the ore that is impracticalplayer annoyance in having to click 20 containers instead of one is not called game balance it is called player annoyance it is same thing as with having a limit for fleet size
no as much as i like the subject matter  nohorrible ideaspreading awareness is fine popping up one of those onetime logon ads and link to where you can donate moneyisk is enoughtheres probably enough worthy causes for a new popup for each day of the year disease conflict and misery rule our planet after allbut please once im actually in game let me escape into world of internet spaceships  without having to fly a goddamn pink boobphobos to hammer me with this awareness
this topic is mainly for regular non wh exploration however it can still be applied to all1 set approximate minimum isk return on radarhacking and magnetometricarcsal sites based on system class hilownull secreason everyone knows that exploration is random however i find it pretty disappointing that sometimes after running 5 radar sites in a row only one gives off good loot and the average return can be around 30 mil for 00 sites some sites drop 1520 milconsidering the time it takes to scan down time to travel and run the sites running hi sec lvl4 missions can be 2x more profitable with only using one character magnetometric averages to be even less and more disappointingsuggested null sec hacking and arcsal sites should drop minimum of 40 million random or not 40 mil is minimum 2 radar sites materials for building datacores need to be reduced in m3reason after running one radar site your cargo runs out of space from materials collected each one is at 1m3 basically if there is another radar in system or one next door you have to travel back to unload cargosuggested reduce size to 05 m3 this would give better flexibility3 magnetometric sites should be more fun and have a chance to drop faction ships bpcs and faction mods bpcs4 magnetometric sites should not only drop bs sizes tech ii bpc rigs and besides most of the bpc i got are for mods no one in their right mind would buy in tech ii
any suggestion on how that should be donethe rewards for radar and magnetometric sites are itemsthe price of those items is set by player based on the offer and demand on market if ccp increase the quantity of material available the price will drop so your guaranteed minimum return drop too the only way i see would be to increase the kinds of item found adding different interesting items not an easy task
please add a checkbox so you can set autoreject from all but your alliance members that way you can atleast keep fleet invites etc coming in without worrying about spam in fights
great idea space is supposed to be big and tiny ships should be hard to find so should poss they should be able to be put anywhereas it is now fly to the moons fly to the belts and you can find other peopleno guesswork involved
i support this proposal i assume that those basic laws of physics should be known to most people here if not you are a bad capsulier you operate warpdrives and construct advanced alient tecnnology have a degree in graviton physics but cannot understand that poses should be anhorable anywhere in orbit around a body with sufficient mass to maintain a proper orbit sun planets moons if two massive structures are anhored within short distance gravitational pull they exert on eachother will disrupt their orbits over time causing them to either fall onto the body or drift off into space although i would whant to see jita 44 drifting off into space
except that poses can be scanned down for at least a year by now
no no i completely understand the problem but as ive said before the proposed solution is one of the stupidest things ive ever read how does disabling remote reps on a loggedoff ship make any ing sense whatsoever just make a loggedoff ship unable to warp away or disappear as long as its tackled its that damn simple
this is a much better idea
when a player logsdisconnected thats like not having the pod pilot in the ship right so the ship should only have base stats unless the pilot returns to control the shipi think this would be more logical than being unable to rr themor this because this is just silly
supported
they could make some news story about how someone crashed a nyx into the station and it blew up oh wait
why is this the relevent thread for the topic in the csm wiki about changing the pos missile batteries
i find the 1000 entry limit to the wallet and journal system to be highly restrictive i propose a change to the system that allows wallet entries to be exported and archived outside the client similar to the market andor chat logs
you can do that already see
dek mind expanding on your train of thought a bit im trying to get this proposal workable for the greatest number of people so clarity would be my friend on this i assume you are refering to assigning bpos to wallet devisions  hangers or similar and then using the proposed wallet function mechanism to track the roitheoretically i suppose you could also use it to track ship loss rates for various wings within your corp if you are constantly having to replace the ships by buying them for your members on this wallet that would give you a good idea as to performance indices
blueprint originals are blue blueprint copies are also blue how bout we make copies green a contract filter to differentiate the two would be nice as wellbenefits 1 easier to reorganize our hangars the next time we accidentally repackage a can full of prints 2 less people getting scammed cons 1 im not a fan of the color green but i suppose it would be easier on the eyes than orange or brown prints 2 less people getting scammed
search function is your friend it has been asked a lot of times doing it would require a major overhaul of the database and ccp dont see that as cost effective for the small advantage it give look this thread too lets us distingush bpo from bpc
it would be nice if you can train a skill after your current selection if the prerequesits are being fulfilled before itfor instance i want a legion and i have 50 minutes left on mechanic level 5 if i have all requirements except mechanic 5 for 50 minutes i should be able to stack amarr defense systems after it because the previous selection finished what i neededrather than having to log on 50minutes later and set up the system skills
ahh yes why hasent this been done yet may be hard to code how would it work cant put in queue if not injected cant inject if u dont meet prereqssupported
as many people have said the only barrier is you if you truly wish to join the 00 fun then go through eve university take part of the agony unleashed training courses and youll be in a nullsec corporation before you reach 16 million spdont expect to be spoonfed content you have to go out there and take it yourself
op fail detected you want to go out in 00 then go you dont need shiny rewards to get out there you just need a set of balls i suggest you go grab a pair
yes skills are a barrier to 00 but not a lack of themgoing to 00 means that if you want to pvp with any risk involved aka not run away from even a remotely fair fight you must leave the learning implants behind slowing the progression of your character and its not like you can later catch up  you can at best resume the speed you had earlier once you have the skills that training speed doesnt matter as much clone cost comes into playi believe that is the main reason 00 is so lightly populated compared to high and low sechowever ccp seems happy with this most 00 players seem happy with things this way thankfully theres still high and low sec for those that arentand eve continues along
i was going to try and keep it respectful but spaceship nerd internet tough guy has to show up so to answer your suggestion  as soon as your mom finishes sucking on them you know how she can be insistent and just want to keep on sucking i will take them and go to all others thanks for your replies and i will remove the post as no one else seem to see a problem with such a huge gap between new players and average players cheers
as a player who first moved to 00 when the best ship i could fly was a t1 cruiser i flew a celestis out of empire to my new 00 home i agree with the posters who have stated that skill points are not the issue pilots without a sense of adventure pilots who value isk and ships over experience these are the problems they are individual challenges that only each individual pilot can overcome skill points are an excuse take that excuse away and another will be found
i totaly support a major overhaul of fw stacking needs to end the timer bug for major plexes needs to be fixedif you look at igs you will see most every post are by chracters who are in some way invlolved with or affected by fw the 00 space problems of cva uk star fraction and all the rest are tied into fw the intaki thread is tied into fwthe wars between the major governmnts one of the main themes of eve is played out every daynot by mining not by industry not by exploration but by the wars between the governemnts yeah change is needed
there is the titan in system xy lets go get it call the entire fleetna we cant we have to fight in a different solar system cause ccp changed fleet fights we gotta stay in this onei quit
i support csm on this topic epic fleet fights make eve unique game i understand that lag is inevitable but imo its fair price to pay ccp should optimize software and hardware to support even greater fighting forces not to force them to split players should chose by themselves what force is appropriate for each engagement
macro miners are a pest and i completely disagree with redshirt there is no use of mining ice cause the macro miners are ruining the market for it by mining it 237 it was possible to do a bit of a profit but compared to asteroids not worth the time sure they leave you alone but if they wouldnt mine at all no problem as well  just empty space where a macroer was beforeno macroers  more people who need to actively play  healthier marketthe real problem is how to find a balance between spamming ccp gms and finding out who is a real macroer cause there is no absolute 100 chance you can tell even if you can guess very nicely also the problem is that ccp doesnt really want to get rid of macroers cause they are paid accounts money rules
its almost a sin not to use some cheaper t2 rigs on your pvp shipsfor example medium energy locusts on zealotsto the op i totally agree that gravity capacitor upgrade rigs require to much calibration we should be able at least to fit 1 t2 and 1 t1 gcu rigs on our covops
im gonna prepare a post for the assembly hall suggesting an overhaul of the smuggling miniprofessionregards lax
what if it simply increases the time it takes for cargoship scanners to work if it prevents scanning entirely then ganking is made too unprofitable with the side effect of making npc corp hauling alts much more immune
imho there are much better things that could be worked on
pos batteries only has 8 thumbs up on assembly hall far below the amount you said were not enough to look at the special gallante missions 29 was that number pos batteries should not be included
cutting and pasting only has 8 thumbs up in assembly hall far below the requirements you set for the special gallante mission problems cutting and pasting should not be included

the 5 minute timer for forum posting was supposed to be removed why hasnt it been
thisthere is nothing wrong with making players able to play the game along or against vets in a more decent amount of timewhat is the op worried about if you played eve for 4 years already you are waaaay ahead and you wont be competed by a noob  except you act noobish but thats not the problem of the skillsgrow up and let others play too otherwise go play an offline game or neopets  that doesnt end as well
at the last csm meeting ccp explicitly said that suicide ganking is supported and intended gameplay
so basically what the op proposes is everything to stay the same both sides buyingbribing concord but just throwing money away in case of skill time cause both sides would skill up of courseuseless complexitygain to the game
you lose standing til you cant fly any missions anymore obviouslysupported it would be nice if at least the next mission after declining could be a different one under all circumstances
read the above post  there has already been a fix so that if you declined a given mission eg gone berserk the next mission you are offered by that agent will not be gone berserk if this doesnt happen then bug report it it doesnt need to be raised by csm  its a bugif the op is asking for something different then you need to rewrite your idea so it is more understandablekithran
wait wat i never said the idea needs to eliminate all missions you dont wanna do i simply said when i deny an attack of the drones mission i shouldnt be offered the same mission when i convo the agent for another mission where did i say i want it to eliminate all missions i prefer not to run actually i have run every mission in the game but sometimes im not in the mood to run a certain mission
please provide a link to a changelogdevblogpatch notes that says this is the case as of yesterday im still being offered the same mission immediately after declining
i already provided a link to the patch notes that says this change should have been completed years ago with the release of revelationsas has been stated if you are having this problem the correct course of action is to file a bug reportps also be sure to check that they are the same mission there are plenty of missions that are very similar but could qualify as being a different mission break their will verses blood raiders is not the same mission as break their will verses guristas
i can definitely confirm that agents will quite often offer the same mission that has just been declined declining a mission doesnt seem to have any particular effect on what mission is offered next

i agree that black ops need a good looking over but i wouldnt go sofar as to completely rebalance them tho i agree with the jumprange changesi would try to get them in the hands of more people first then balance them as needed i dont think a black ops a t2 tier 1 bs should cost more than a marauder a t2 tier 2 bs especially with demand as low as it is not to mention the risk in flying a black ops in its intended roleadjust the black ops so that the build costs at current demand is somwhere around 300mil and see what happens first i think alot of people would be willing to fly them but as they currently are the costs and risk far outwieghs any benefits of flying the damn thing
field commands and eos need major loving i always wanted to see the absolution have the range bonus of a zealot i know this would make it op but would be fun xdeitherway commands need a buff
something is to be done but some proposals are just weird why the hell would you want to give astarte yet another gun when she still dies with its current 7 it wont make this ship that much better as no one sane complains on the dps of it but rather on the lack of mobilityfeatures addition of another tanking slot is already way better since 7 guns with 2 damage mods is superior to 8 with just one and im yet to see any setup with 2 mfs which isnt a complete kamikazemobile1 med for abso is dandy but kinda corrupts the whole racial concept as amarr are somewhat supposed to lack mids id vote for another tanking slot toochanges for sleip and nh look reasonablemore pg and 1 med for nh hell yeah
i got bc5 for ages but lack of performance coupled with cost is a reason i never trained into any cs signed
astarte 1 low slot instead of high agreed with the rest good postalso as far as the eos all they need to change to make it not completely useless like literally less than blackops useless is give it back 5 heavys the massive nerf was from 7 guns  5 heavys to 3 heavys and 5 guns just give back the drones keep off the guns  take another for 4 awesome tanking ishtar
thanks for the support so far guys i have updated the thread with the other suggestions noted as alternative boost on the absolution and the astarte the reason for it fon revedhort is because i believe the astarte was made to be a pure gank boat and i didnt want to make it to similar to the others and try and keep it unique for what it was supposed to do the racial concept perhaps it would do better with another low slot than a high its hard to say as that would depend a lot on circumstances either would be a major upgrade to it though  its a major pain trying to balance this ship though as for the abso the 4th med i took as an inspiration from the harbinger im a bit afraid another low would make way for too big tanks for a bc class ship but running some more calculations and theoretical fittings of said change i can see it work  skylar remember to check the i agree with proposal box that said i believe the eos as a fleet command ship should not have 5 heavy drones it could use 4 heavies though along with other changes to make it a more used fleet command its main problem is that its bonuses are made for running along with recon ships which it is incapable of doing in its current state
agree to the op especially in the hp boost part
decently supported by the way this is my first supporting anything normally i just tell people why the subject is bad but this is one of the few really good proposals on this forum more like this please
full support enough fitting for tank  gank  one ganglink
i need this
man if eve had this things would feel so much more interesting again traders would have more fun challenges trying to transport good pirates will get more pew pew bounty hunting may become more viable again to kill high ranking pirates defiantly bump
cool
1 clever  labeling the space that pirates occupy but complicated with the ownership of the real empires imagine star wars there are seedy sides of tatooine but its all owned by the empire2 yes but theyd have to be general pirates and not really faction standinglike im as hated with the serpentis as i am with the gallente3 too tightfisted on valuable markets leave the ore here4 nah fly whatever you want wherever you want down here in lowsec5 i like it but it would have to come with a bounty change too contracted killrights and minimal bounties and other changes to open up opportunities for the antipirates and such dogooders lol we get smuggling they get bounty hunting fair trade if the potential profits say so6 im iffy on the npc riffraff going on there since us pirates dont really care about stuff like that im thinking like cosmos agents but pirates right ehhhh seems gimmicky7 fw makes this viable already honestly since you should only care about the borders if you are in fw anyway8 supported only if the pos had a module to use the illegal drugs to make boosters only anchorable in low sec9 nah low sec is too juicy a passage to null sec to pass up and some of us pirates take great advantage of that fact10 100 supportalot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec established but people need to have a reason to go there established im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked let me stop you here this isnt necessarily a lie as much as it does need to go with other changes elsewhere there was suggested a attackerloot ratio established and this in conjunction with lowsec changes would usher in a time when to be profitable as a pirate you need to be skilled with tiny 23 man squads to take down much bigger prey like faction fit bs with insane tanks thats the only way or reason changes like yours mine and other suggested ones would work in low sec as for turf war however if you are looking for that sort of thing really just go to 00 if you are looking to prey on the allpowerful high sec people who will start missioning in low sec in 2s and 3s with changes like this then these changes are the way to startgood stuff supported
i know a lot of people make jokes about playing eve with sounds muted but to me the audio effects and music are as important as the visuals in making a game an immersive experience please ccp make this issue a high priority
supported great work cyberghost go on 
i miss the sound of my guns so supported right here
ive heard many users say they intuitively mouseover the clock to attempt to find the gmt dateday often only to remember the feature isnt thereif having it in earthly formats is seen to be immersion breaking then maybe yymmdd 100327 so its a lil more star date

good proposition not every icon in the game has to look the same especially that these are just very tiny 2d images 5 minutes of work on the dev sideif not a differnt color then give the mwd icon more blast
yeah its a good idea if just for claritys sake never confused the myself but good to see how many types of something i have without having to squint haha just a very minor graphical change can save on slipup as well as make it easier in the ewar box on the target whether they are scramming you or not should you have notifications off or something
supported even though ive never confused them the idea is nice
ok
definitely 
thank you for your personal definition dually noted i will change my language when i expect to see you aroundim sure whatever account thief out there would love to sit at their computer looking through thousands of pictures trying to find your pin combination at this point your argument is rooted in paranoia are your security systems really that badive still yet to see one reason anyone has put up why this isnt a legitimate good idea
this actually sounds pretty neat i wasnt aware a system like this was in use by other games already
on one hand this is pretty good since it reduces or stops hacking but then on the other hand it also stops corp  alliance theft while i am not a thief in anyway it is fun to read about legit thefts  personally i prefer the wow keychain mechanic i mean whats to stop a hacker from just self destructing your pod 50 times til you are 900k when he doesnt get your stuffprotect the account eitherway supported 
aww gee i hadnt even thought of that that would be pretty lame 
i never thought it would apply to corp hangers personally
1 it wouldnt help new players at all because they would have to train it first2 it would annoy old players by having them spend a week and half training something that doesnt actually let them play the game any better3 poker is a zero sum game and there are definitely winners and losersso in conclusion its a bad idea and you dont know what youre talking about
huh how did you get that idea me personally and many others would be in favour of just removing all learning skills and changing the attributes so they are on lvl 5 for everyone or 5 basic 4 advanced or only remove the advanced ones this would effectively only hurt the people who already trained those skills so myself just because it wouldnt help me in any way doesnt mean i cant see that we would be better off without them
the learning skill tree is just fine in my humble opinion back in the dayyou started out with nothing i agree no more addions to learning area of the tree directly of course as new tech is introduced yes training to related skills may be required the learning skill tree is necessary its what makes this game different an superior to all other games it the big difference remove the learning curve would destroy the debth this game haseve set the mark high upon the tree of knowledge so far no other game has come close to what eve isif you want a lotor type game with no real skill training required then go play sto an lotr but leave eve alone if you are not up to the task get out of the sand boxall eve needs is full surface worlds access like in swg to walk around on with catinas to go into to watch naked dancers to heal our sic minds if u cant woop a guy in space then kill him on the ground or in a bar more women would play eve if they could strut about in attractive gear expand skill tree to meet the new tech requirements as it developes dont speed it up but allow training 3 skills at same time at same speed as 1 skills with maybe a isk penalty
leave it to a liberal minded galente player to want everything with out earning it lol removing the skill tree would ruin the game eve is not a mindless shooter the skill tree is a important part of the over all game of eve if you are a lazy player dont want to earn your bones then eve is not for you just beam out and leave the sand box alone anybody that talks about doing to eve what was done to star wars galaxy should be set to red right away and a plex card bounty placed on their headim joking of course eve is not broken in eve u get nothing for nothing like real life u learn then earn
im gonna make a new proposal ccp should remove all learning skills from game at next downtime
fanfest 2009 npe talk position 3835 ccp acknowledges that learning skills are a terrifyingly bad idea and they require removalsevere training time nerfsome other nerfalso not supported the last thing we need are more learning skills three months of training is already way too long
bump
stabs are optional now anyways since hics were introducedhics are a nerf for stabs so the original nerf can be undone safellyadded to that losing a slot to a wcs means weeker gank or tank there seems no harm in making them an optional module
i agree that maybe stabs need to be looked at since they have become pretty much useless in nonhighsec since the introduction of hics but outright removing one of their penalties is no solution to any problem that still needs inventing
lately i have been seeing ships in dock while mission running why couldnt there be a way to take the ship with some marines or target it and salvage them for a faction fitting or the trit used to make them right now there is nothing that drops on any of them
its because they are large collidable structures that look like ships
eve i pitched as a hardcore game where players are allowed to scam steal and do a whole bunch of things that would not be tolerated in any other mmo the universe is supposed to be dark and dirty but with all of these freedoms we lack even a basic profanity filter something all other major mmos have over us i cant cheat ppl in any other games but at least i can tell them to  off because the potentially offensive bits are filtered and if thiere not filtered then its the players choice to hear my words of wisdomwhats worse is the already busy gms in eve are tasked with filtering the chats i can scam somone for everything they ever worked for in the game with no repercussions but if tell them im gonna  thier mother the gms not onlt have to deal with a petition but i get the stfuhammer thich is not an ideal way to treat a player customer and not really a good use of the gms limited timeso we need usersettable profanity filters just as like are in other modern mmos and the gms need to be taken off babysitting duty allowing eve to truly be the dark and dirty game it claims to betldr version eve needs to have chat filters
cant thumbs up in the first post even tho i clicked itso ill go ahead and support my own post
it wont mitigate blobbing even by a little because like they said before loot is not gonna be even remotely close to a top priority to a blob its all about getting a perfect killboard score in a game for bragging rights and the more numbers u have compared to your enemy the less skillinput required to survive and the less likely u and your ceo will have to cope with even one loss simple as that
i just dont see this as a good argument to continue to reward blobbing with just as much loot as nonblob pvp i tend to think economic implications effect behavior but even if you want to deny this as regards to blobbers there would still be the added benefit of doing small gang pvp this plan has a carrot and a stick arguments about blobber mentality only apply to the stick part of it not the carrot are you saying its impossible that those who like to do smaller scale pvp might not do more of it if they could recover more loot that way if you just want to argue that economic incentives dont work in eve then i guess we will just have to agree to disagreeif you think blobbing is what makes eve great then continue to be in favor of the current mechanic if on the other hand you think blobbing makes eve worse and tends to destroy something that is better  smaller scale pvp  then you should support proposals that promote what you like about the game
so you are advocating for a complete overhaul of the killmail system so that you can achieve an admitedly negligible effector are you advocating for decreasing the isk gained from popping haulersshuttlesetc via camps and suicide ganksconsidering the serious lack of substance to the idea here or in your original post
well put it this way you could implement it but it wouldnt do jack 
actually the idea is not that bad i must say it would strongly help pirates as they will get much more drops nearly twice yet i know it will not discourage blobbing
lol blobbing is not a form of asskicking in any way you spew vomit onto the target and they have no chance to survive at all theyre pussies not pvpersthis though actually the idea is not that bad i must say it would strongly help pirates as they will get much more drops nearly twice yet i know it will not discourage blobbingblobs  failpirates  win a profession that gets nerfed harder and harder every time i turn the  around ccp has literally spit in the faces of pirates neweden wide and gotten away with it cause the easier they make this game the more subs theyll get
because ganking newbies in caracals and badgers all day is proonly amirite
complete overhaull i dont know why you would think that the killmail system in place already gives the majority of info needed if they tried to do something based on a comparison of fleet sizes that would take some extra doing but my guess would be that this would be little more than a tweak to the loot drop mechanic but more importantly i really dont think assembly hall is the place for people to speculate how technically difficult a change may or may not be it seems to me that we need to decide if we want the change ccp can then discuss with the csm if there are large technical barriers of course if there are large technical barriers then sure this idea could be tabled but i would point out that i noticed the occasional bug in the killmail system anyway so regardless of this idea an overhaul may be in order negligible effect im not claiming this will fix blobbing but i also dont think this change is negligible look at some killboards and do some of the math if a typical pvp ship drops 20 mill in mods and the drop is about half the value of the total mods then this means we are talking about a 40 million isk swing per ship if the average drop is 10 mill and about half mods drop its a 20 mill swing i wouldnt call this negligible ok yeah i dont know what the actual numbers are from any statistically significant study but just eyeballing the costs of many pvp ship mods i think most people can see this can really be significant if you disagree use your own numbers but i dont think this is negligiblecertainly it is in line with the changes that the csm typically suggests it may even be on the more significant side of the scale this is not a negligible change haulers and shuttles ccp can value haulers and shuttles however they want or they can leave them out of this new mechanism entirely the change is to promote smaller group pvp not to effect these other things lets stay focused on thatim glad you mention that you argued with me in other posts on completely different issues i noticed a few other naysayers in this thread and the one in features and ideas had disagreements with me in the past on entirely different issues im not necessarily saying they all just need some butt paste after all it may just be a coincidence that we 1 have enough of an interest in the same exact topics despite ther the fact they have nothing to do with each other and yet 2 we always disagree on the conclusions but i cant rule that out either so the fact that a few folks who have argued with me before in the forums on different issues show up in these threads and try to attack my post without really addressing the content of the idea is not really going to make me think the idea isnt a good one at least you address the idea i propose which i appreciate others well read mclevers contribution to this thread and i think you see my point
i really wish you wouldnt have pointed that out now that ccp realizes the proposal may help pirates its doomed btw i dont think this will just help pirates in the strict sense  those who attack pveers instead i see this as helping pirates in the broader sense  just about everyone in low sec who likes to pvp there  with the possible exclusion of fw if you pvp in low sec enough your sec status will drop regardless of whether you attack mission runners or other pvp ships again fw pilots aside the thing is it seems most of the pirate fights again using pirate in this more general sense i see in low sec often have smaller scale engagements of course there are plenty of exceptions but i tend to think more people who are in low sec pirate corps would benefit from this change indeed i think low sec pvp would benefit in general but by saying this i know i am spelling the death knell for this idea still doesnt mean you cant support it
i do like the idea dont get me wrong but it wouldnt really change peoples behaviour one jot outside of a few circumstancesblobbing in my mind is this there is a targets in your systemspace and you assemble a gang to counter it you dont think you have enough so you wait until you get enough to utterly crush it maybe people will be skewed towards taking a bit more risk in these conditions5 man gang comes into your space and you get 20 xs straight off the bat not blobbing10 man roaming gang happens across a ratting raven not blobbingbadger strays into a large gatecamp not blobbing400 man fleet is raised to take a strategic objective despite the fact that the defenders can only bring 200 not blobbing
ok first off let me say that i would love for there to be less blobbing i dont think anyone is against that let me also say that on a gut reaction level before reasoned consideration this plan sounds good however the devil is in the details which you have consitantly refused to elaborate upon or consider meaningfully this is why i dont support the idea atm now to clarify some things that were evidently lost in translation1the overhaul issue i assume ccp should discuss with csm if there are large technical barriers to indicate that you thought i was talking about specifically hardware server loadprograming problems i was not i am arguing that accomplishing your idea would require a major rework in conception of what a killmail thus loot modifier is perhaps an example would be easier to follow here lets assume that there is no technical problem in implamenting your ideasituation a your 5man hac gang jumps into a 20man mix gang loot tables are modified via involved parties list so each kill shows 5 hac vs whatevership to fix the problem you then add fleet chan numbers and ship types into the equation so that the 5man gang is not penalized ok still assuming no technical issues lets see the effect on another common engagement under these new rulessituation b you are in said 5man hac gang and decide to engage a solo hac on your own it is goodfight because nobody jumped in but your loot table is modified againby virtue of your being in a gang even though the gang was not involvedor how about the fact that there are nuetrals who involve themselves in fightswhich side do they effect especially when thier actions are not logged on the killmail at all as i said the devil is in the details and details matter to a community of rational beings whom are effected by any change2on the word negligable i think you misconstrued what i was talking about though this is perhaps my own fault for not clarifying i agree that the effects on loot can be considerable what i meant is that your change will have a negligable effect on the problem you yourself admit that it will not fix the problem and you have been given arguments why it wont act as a strong mitigating force you are asking for changestherefore that dont accomplish anythingmuch in relation to the problem what you do accomplish and i consider this to be perhaps a gooood thingperhaps is make pvp a viable alternative to pve for isk generationfor the solo and small gang players as it stands now pvp is either a necessity to protect isk faucetsassets or for fun and therefore the isk made is accidental and not integral to the game play people run around solo and in small gangs without it being as lucrative so this obviously isnt a driving factor it just makes it so that a pirate doesnt need to have some alt making isk for him to fuel his pvpps alluding to the possibility that people are arguing aginst your ideas purely out of spite does not in any way advance your position in a rational manner but again i applaud your use of rhetorical devices as a means to gain support i must for the sake of reasoned discourse make sure to point them out however its not personaledit added clarifications
larkonisi see what you are saying here your defining blobbing as intentionally shipping up way above what you believe your opponent has to the extent blobbing has a negative connotation i would agree with what you say i guess though i might say other of those situations involved blobbing but i would agree there is nothing wrong with doing that if you have to defend say a pos in a worm hole that your corp spent months setting up then yeah bring all the firepower you can blob them nothing wrong with that but putting aside what blobbing is and is not and whether its right or wrong let me explain how i think this proposal will have some effect on the gameim talking with corpmates we can either join a huge fleet with other corps or just go roaming ourselves if we go in the big feet we will likely be larger than the vast majority of fleets in the area accordingly economically speaking we will be taking very little risk by involving our ships in this endeavor not no risk but compared to flying in a small gang where we know there will be other larger fleets in the area its considerably less if we decide to go out in a gang of 28 and roam around i realize this may seem a very small group to many people but there are places where this is done we run a much higher chance of losing our ships so from an economic perspective this is not a great way to roll my proposal would give an upside to this sort of gang forming versus piling into the larger fleet yeah people would still say we are more likely to lose our ships doing this and they would likely be right but at least you could say well if we do say catch a battleship with our bc and 3 cruisers and 2 frigs we will get a decent amount of loot instead of that bs dropping 10 mill in loot to be divided by 40 it might drop 50 mill divided by 6 assuming under the current mechanic it would drop 30 million so for that gang of 6 thats an extra 8 mill or so for that kill ok its going to be a long haul before you can get slave implants doing this but it is some incentive to join a smaller group instead of a huge fleet i dont think its negligible and it rewards the extra risk you takeso you have a bit added incentive to go small group this should influence you to do it more often heres the thing if it influences you it will influence others and if it influences others to do it then you are going to have more smaller gangs to fight in and against also consider this you might have a solo fight with an equal class ship  lets say cruiser class that you are doing ok against instead of calling in all your gang to obliterate him you may want to gamble a bit to make some extra loot ok most wont do that unless they are pretty sure they can win and if they start to go down they will call in the calvary but still there is some risk and some thought before you immediately decide to call in the 2 blackbirds and 4 megathrons to finish off that rupture how many people would make those sorts of calls i dont know but i know i would kill the guy solo and have more loot for the gang to split immediately warp in the gang and kiss that odd faction mod that might have dropped goodbye would one really be able to make isk at pvp if they were really good well im not saying that either but i would think many good small gang pvpers can see some advantage here its hard to argue against the economics and deny the possibility that this would boost small scale pvp  how exactly it would play out i cant necessarily say but again just saying i dont think it will work is not really a good reason to reject it not unless you are sure it wont boost small scale pvp and i think people who say that are fighting basic economic principles so in the end unless there is a big downside to offset this benefit or at least potential benefit the rational thing to do is go with it
yes give pirates even more reason to dishonour ransom by higher loot dropsone day pirates will realise they dont have anyone but themselves to blame for their lack of targetsregarding the topic so if 5 pirates kill me when flying solo they get most of the loot yet when we would attack a 200 men fleet with 100 people we wouldnt get loot since we are blobbing that doesnt make sense to me
ok your analysis assumes that ccp would take into account the whole fleet that you were in when i was posting in response to larkonis i was not doing that although i do think that possibility is something the csmccp should consider but let me just explain the plain vanilla version so in situation a assuming all 5 hacs show on the kill mail the loot would be adjusted accordingly if that means the killmail is of a frigate then there would be very little loot dropping if it was a battleships somewhat more if the hac gang started winning the engagement they may want to stop all firing on one primary and attacking individual ships to get more loot that would be up to them situation b  if you are the only one on the kill mail then its solo and you only compare classes of shipsneutrals  such as remote repair helping one side that might be bit more difficult since i think neutral remote repair needs to be reworked as it is i would be fine with saying if you get killed despite neutral remote repair all your loot will automatically drop UF04A but im sure the csm can come up with other suggestions for example depending on the class of the ship remote repairing the ship getting remote repaired would have x amount added to it while i agree this stuff will need to be done i dont think this is anything insurmountable
you are right that very little loot would drop in your 100 versus 200 battle assuming people follow primaries i dont think this will change the practice of having everyone shoot at a primary although if it did i think that might be a good thing i accept that this is a downside of the proposal but my proposal would be a reason not to get into a 100 man fleet to begin with if you have good reason to get into a hundred man fleet such as to defend some important resource you of course can but you just wont get allot of loot if you dont have any really good reason to get into a 100 man fleet other than to blob a gate well now you have an additional incentive to try out smaller scale pvp
like any 100man fleet is assembled under the premise of loot this will not change a thing if people want to achieve an objective theyll do it whatever the costyour idea is fatally flawed its been shot down in a previous subforum so you tried again and youre receiving even less support
i dont think a badger has ever come to where we live friendo and the noobs we kill always come back for more shall we ignore them for you grow a brain boss
this
it surely wont fix blobs but why reject the proposal merely on these considerationsthe idea is just to give some carrot to those of us who dont blob
i honestly think it will encourage even smaller gang pvp it wont stop the blobs by any means cause russians cant even read this lol but at least it will give small gangs more reason to go out and fight knowing majority of modsloot will be awaiting any kills they make i know i would make an effort to roam more looking for targets d
another way to handle antiblob mechanics would be to make it so that weapons wont fire if theres something between your ship and the target asteroid station or ship in the way your weapons wont fire that cycle no idea how difficult this would be to implement serverload wise but it would cut down on the damage one ship takes from a big fleet if that fleet is getting in the way of itself
you cant even put two gscs next to each othernobody is going to make a fortune mining into a gsc they are incredibly impractical to use even ignoring the fact that having more space would be helpfulgscs are anchored meaning in order to even move along in the belt you need to unanchor and reanchor it i happen to like my corp but i cant expect the corp to bloody hold my hand is that the kind of corp youre inso what you are saying is that you just want miners to be defenseless because atm gscs are too impractical to even put to use
have to support my own idea duh 
boobies
ok weve the new mail system  which still lacks basic featureswe have new labeling system but we are unable to send to a label simply by clicking on its name and send message from there to everyone in it that would be a quick fix i thinkassigning colors that would be a global thing we are not in four bit century anymore sixty four bit anyone why not to give me a choice from all the colors availablejust my thoughts
rework the mail system from the ground up i think put back the old system with a few minor changes i dont really care about the whole realisticbrowserlike format i just want the simple mail back c
i dont want a realistic system just to be able to send bulk mail to anyone in the label
yes this would be realworld realistic but its not realistic in terms of the gameplay for anyone who cant get on to lay claim to missions immediately after downtimeyou simply cant expect people to be happy 12 18 or 20 hours past downtime when they get home from work and try to play only to find that all the missions have been exhausted by people closer to greenwich
as drake and amberlyn insinuated this would be easily monopolized by people who log in right after dt on the respawn days with thier 34 accounts full of alts with nothing but the standings req to access the agenti would support an idea that found a way around this however
isnt there enough diversity for you mission peope isnt there zero risk vs 100 pure reward for running missions and never having to risk anything they should cut all the lvl 4 missions but one and make every missioner run the same one over and over and over again until your eyes bleed imo
you make some valid points radar  increase datacore counts to help fix the isk returnmagno  id be happy with different interesting items ie factions bpcs d
i might be wrong here but i am sure you get the option to reject people who arent on your address book where you can add corps and i think alliances on it therefore spam will only be from alliance members only or you could just charge people not on your addressbook 
set your cspa to a high number and add your alliance to addressbookccp seem to be taking the position that if someone is blue you must want them to see all your contactsso youll want to test and be aware of how evegate behaves when using addressbook like this
the csm agreed unanimous that limiting the sandbox invalidates the sandbox label
yeah i see that problem too the module is not supposed to make ships 100 unscannable it should just reduce the probability of a successful scan which would work the same way as your proposal  it would take longer to get a scanresult
it is totally discretionary the items she has chosen are worth discussing and she has at least posted them 24 hours in advance thumbs upyou can only hope that the members of the csm interested in pve awaken and in a big gift from the easter bunny
i am hoping that venkuls mineral sourcing information request is included with over 50 supports out of less than 60 replies it would seem to qualify
i have written today to z0d about that as his platform say he is a industrial expert so we can hope that if it is not added this time it will be added next time even if ccp reply was we dont want to divulge the data a simple reply saying we have them will be welcome sometime i fear that they dont gather those data normally but only for special projects
ive updated it as a proposal here
supported
once again i support this effort
something i noticed panther out of all black ops has the lowest targeting rangeat level 5 it has 60km targeting range pretty sucki think ccp took hull bss targeting range and decreased it by 20 why such penalty i dont know this needs to improve imo
boost
once they will be able to outtank normal bs they will be worthy for use in bigger battles at least for fcs still can be used in local skirmishes as the wild card but the pricetag is horrible another idea is to make them t1 so u can insure them  here we go  u will see them much more on the field
supported this and a boost to local repairsystem bonusses 10 instead of 75 to armor rep amount would make the astarte so much more useful
even if they arent meant to be hac on steroids field command ships need some redoing
removing it in favour of a 10 armor or even shield ha ha hp bonus would make it so much more useful honestlyin fact it would be a very interesting ship with a extra high a tad more grid and armor hp bonus being basically something with the gank and buffer of a bs with t2 resists on top but minus the range and utility highs and would make a lot of sense in certain types of gangs
i dont like that idea moves the game once more towards buffer tanks better give all them repboost bonused ships the same bonus to received rrotherwise they would have the same issues as the nidhoggurthis way hype and mael can keep all their guns are fine for solo and and in gangs paired with logsitics
this is in fact a very good idea
1fix it please
yes please

well it isnt my area of expertise but considering nobody else has raised it yet ill put it forward for the next meeting in 2 weeks timethanks for adding supports to the issue it adds weight when talking to ccp
thank you
looks like overwhelming support up in the house here we should get some more of thatliang
great idea but you need to be a little bit less one sided on this topic on top of that members should be here to debate not simply to say no if you say no state explain your views personally i like the idea but it needs to have a few other changes made in order to balance it i understand where all the combat pilots are coming from that you are paying concord to fight that is absolutely true and from a couple of the other posts they use the examples of reallife wars not to be the barer of bad news but no nation has ever had to pay a world governing body to go to war with another country nor have they ever had to formally declare war on another country before attacking it or wait 24 hours after declaring war to attack another nation this is after all a game not the real world so using real world examples is pointless now back to the idea of only allowing a corporation that is declaring war against another corporation the ability to attack in highsec with out the declaration of war not being consensual again great idea just needs a little bit more balancing for example if you look at empire space right now there is very little differences besides the fact that capital ships cant jump into highsec and concord isnt as strong in lowsec as it is in highsec well with that in mind why couldnt concord enforce the fact that a declaration of war must be consensual for attacks to be made in highsec the fact is they easily could however you would basically turn highsec into a safezone as we all know pvpers hate safezones with a passion it would also basically turn lowsec more of a combat zone then it already is so what would also have to be changed is the securities in lowsec face it empire space is empire space its roughly 110th the size of null sec so why not actually give the police a set of teeth to defend that section of space basically make highsec into a safezone unless the declaration of war is mutual once that happens you can kill any where you wish lowsec gets a security increase which would make some of the highsec missions that put you into lowsec safe again for all the pveers also it would spread out the empire space players an increase in minerals meaning cheaper ships an increase in tech ii and tech iii minerals for again cheaper ships and modules would give the industrial corps more of a purpose in this game rather then just being targets or lambs to the slaughter and for all those combat pilots the battles would be truly impressive you would end up getting battles that had 100 pilots mutual wars though both sides take losses and get kills the battles are truly epic being that both sides actually want to fight how many combat corps actually spend most of theyre time sitting on gate camps for a couple of kills or camping a station with 3 or 4 war targets i know i have and i know ive taken losses for fighting with others it happens the trick is to enjoy the game so below is the changes that would have to be made in order for this to work1 lowsec would have to receive a more aggressive police force one that would actually prevent or limit ganking to the ganking force taking losses but still have the ability to run from concord if needed2 in order to fight with out concord interference in highsec the declaration of war would have to be mutualnow i know what the null sec guys are saying this will force the gate camp pirates into null well it would make null sec what its truly suppose to be outlaw space im actually working on another purposal for you guys in null sec that will make your lives much much easier but in the end we all know its up to ccp whether or not these requests are implemented
eve is survival of the fitteststarting a corp takes a certain level of responsibility if you cant keep yourselves afloat through a war maybe you just arent ready to own a corp yetmembers who are dbags in local will attract random wardecks if you are incapable of policing your members and maintaining recruitment standards maybe you arent ready to own a corp yet if the shoe fits hereif you are wardecked often a lil bit of diplomacy can resolve the war if you have no rl communication skills maybe you arent ready to own a corp yetcorp members often expect a certain level of security and defense from their corp if you are unable to provide security for your members in one way or another maybe you arent ready to own a corp yetnaming your corp super elite turbo mining corp or something similar will attract greifers if you cant come up with a better name maybe you arent ready to own a corp yetrogue
ive tried hovering it doesnt work dunno why must be a bugendfaketroll
it makes sense and will take less than 5 minutes so why not
hi have you been introduced to ccp yet naf this is ccp ccp meet naf
good idea
supportedi cant see any negative effects that change would have plus it shouldt be hard to implement that
i see absolutely no reason why this should not be implemented maybe make the mwd red as it is faster everyone knows that the red ones go faster also good to see so many people understand this fundamental truth 
petitions or signed posts are a version of bumping and likewise are not permittedeve forum rules
maybe not red but yes some way to visually differentiate
do want
i support this idea
its a little thing but it would be a major conveniance you got several of the same ship but they are fit differently how do you know which one is which with out physically getting in them this can take a while what with the 30 seconds between ship changes thoughts
i agree its a terrible nuisance with the session timer
agreed d
yes for some things im able to keep track by using a system to name the ships  a certain set of names for each set of functions but trying to remember which of several ittys in different has the cloaking device on it when im multiple jumps away and wish to go fetch the cloaked itty that i havent used for several weeks being able to click on the ship in assets and look at its fittings would be very useful
i like this ideai dont understand why people are so against training learning skills  its not like you are forced to waste your time training these skills  just dont train them if you dont like themit seems to me that a lot of players want the siege tanks and other endgame apps wout putting in the time pooling your resources to borrow from starcrafti support a skill that speeds up my training even more im in this game for the longhaul
nope it just forces you to choose between being smart and bored or being stupid and having fun as people dont like being stupid or bored you lose no matter which option you pick
not supported
this is a pretty selfishly obvious let me translate the op i dont care if my idea wastes all your previous training time so long as it benifits me right now
how about a counterproposaltake all the learning skills out give all characters max stats off the bat and have a pool to redistribute the skill pointsface it for the first 36 months of the game is little more than flying around your racial frigate while you are learning said skills this means that maxed characters those with all 7 mil learning skill points you know who you are keep the base stats they have most other characters that have 4 points in each skill gets a 1 point boost to said stats 12 points in each stat shouldnt be unbalancing put the skill points into a pool to be redistributed this way those 36 months are not gone to waste
the point of the game is to scam and there are 13 year olds that can play this so its not a good idea to have people swearing think about people who are blowing people up in 00 now concord isnt destroying them because it is part of the game
only if we can turn off the filter in wow if you turn the filter off and petition a gm to look into profanity they will ban or we the idiot who has it off then complains
iv been a long time player of eve when i say that i mean iv been paying and rarely playing only coming on to skill up or play with my friend which is not very often as we both work offshore and are only home about 4 or 5 days at the same time what my complaint is i recently used the recuitment channle to try and find a pvp corp i spoke to a guy that seemed really nice and i sent my aplication in he offered to move all my stuff and ships to the new base at syndicate after he had my contracts he went offline i cant see me seeing my stuff back again thats my fault but what my problem is surely there should be some sort of way to have a safe recuitment channle without scammer like him im that annoyed i dont think it likely ill be playing eve ever again
if there could be a way to trade in skills with the same training multipliers or a low rank skill for 1 lvl of a different skill
to make it even easier for people to jump to the fotmimho you made the decision to train that skill so you have to live with it
this
that couldnt work youve already trainedinjected and used that skill
well i used to know quantum physics and how to ride a bike i forgot that though but in doing so i learned how to play the guitaron topic its not a good idea sorry first of all you make choices in eve online you train a skill you have it the time you spent training that time wasnt spent on other stuff second if you spec right for skill catagories you can train them at 2772 skillpoints per hour if youd train one of these skills at 2772 skillpoints per hour and transfer the learned skill to another tree which you would normally train at i dont know 1980 skillpoints per hour wouldnt that be sort of unfair it would at least make attributes obsolete i dont like the idea anyway
hi graari was wondering if you would post in this thread after all your last post to me in a different thread said you would ignore me im glad to hear that whatever was causing that butt hurt has healed as always thanks for your contribution to the debatei see i and a few others forgot to click on the support so i will do that here
this is like one of those ive been playing eve for a week and now i have a great idea threads
station spam is horrible make stations cost 10x more or be destructible please
replace stations with titans and you should realise that isk has never been a limiting factorim all for making them destructible but only with tremendous firepower and with a sort of reinforced timer of at least a week
not supported would make solo mining too easy and could potentially clutter up space
although i support such precautial measures in general i must say that such things do not belong into a gamebesides what percentage of the playerbase is actually femalenot supported
i fully support breasts
fit nanosistabs on your haulers and zoom off before they can get a lockscan on you or even better train for t2 and go with the cloaky or tanky variants if you need to transport large expensive stuff use a freighter
yep nothing to say against it that works fine against normal players if youre able to remain vigilant enoughmy concern is concord now i must admit that i dont know much about smuggling these days and people who do are not eager to share that knowledgeas far as i know concord scans you ship wihtin the fraction of a second anyway before i write an official proposal in the assembly hall about smuggling etc im gonna try it out myself then ill see how viable blockaderunners are for that jobregards lax
concord doesnt do atf customs do
soon
why make ui that forces you to have 534892375x89184924 resolution to keep all info you need on screen and tiny fonts that can only be seen in 1024x768 or less not that 1024x768 makes it much easyer to distinguish symbols mentioned in first post
yes please quitting eve or becoming blind is not a choice i want to have to make
thats an interesting idea but can you imagine the storm from the caldari whine squad if rails bypassed shields for instance to any degree
it wouldnt just bypass shields but armor as well depending upon what defense is still applicable i believe thats how railguns were intended to functionand actually did a long time agoi think it was the difficulty in calculating the damage that resulted in its demise since shields are never really at zero so any incoming railgun round took a much more complex calculation than the brute force approach of lasers and projectilesthere are many things that are in eve that are relics from old design concepts that got trashed the propulsion type of a tech 1 ship is irrelevant yet they are different from race to race if i remember correctly ships used to also have some of all 4 types of sensors with a race based preference like they do now those sensors were based on the concept of functioning similar to their namegravimetriccaldari would be better at targeting and tracking ships with higher mass concurrent with heavy armormagnetometricgallante would be better at targeting and tracking ships with higher em output concurrent with heavy shieldingwhat they had planned with ladar and radar are probably more balanced though the much higher resolution of ladar could be responsible for the failings of projectiles for much of their life in eve in the end the grandiose concept was probably scrapped because of difficulty in calculating the information and server load caused by doing sothis mangled relic has led to the balancing problems facing ewa amongst other things like missiles having aoe once upon a time if they had aoe now the raven wouldnt be the preferred mission running ship and would be nearly unusable in highsec without significant alterations to how aoe agro mechanics workanyways just thought i would throw it out but dont see it happening thats for sure
just so that i am clear on your point here not stating any of my thoughts on the matter yetif people fly the mega over the rohk because it is an armor tank and more people fly the mega than a pest then if the rokh was an armor tank the law of large numbers would be apocrohkpest megais this correct or are there other mitigating factors regarding ships choice i am thinking of things like the fact that very few pvp focused train caldari at all because of the heavy emphasis on misslesbut not limited to this specific example
sinking down the pagesforgotten among the manycan this be done
great idea
because flight simulators are flight simulators and games are gameseve is a brain game not a handeye coordinationquick reflex game
eve is very far from being a dog fight simulator so why take it even further out leave the dog fighting crowd at least a few bonesanyway like or not this feature would reduce amount of player skill involved in pvp therefore i am against it as if pvp in eve isnt boring enough
i like the sleip and nighthawk changessick with the extra med on the absolution for small gang and solo 4 mids are nice and for larger things a bs is superior anywayastarte well cant see any real improvement by a extra turret or a extra low diemost and astarte really need something special that makes them worth over the brutixmega or simply a proper dpsplus dps projection at close range to make the point blank suicide concept halve way interesting at the given price levels of the hulls
supported and best use the tier 2 models for the field command ships they are there they look good use them save for the eosastarte brutix model fits the astarte better myrmidon role fits the intended eos role better

leaving the sound system in such a bad state for so long is unacceptable get this fixed for the next expansion
supported the sound issues are really a major annoyance
i dont want more expensive ships but this is a bit  for those trying to do things properly
yeah id be for this
doing small gang roams this would make my life so much easier as an fc and scout 1
wonderful idea

i hate being the one race whos ships dont have a viable purposeamarr ships are great for tanking and fleet warfare minmitar are great for speed and skirmish warfare caldari have awesome weapon ranges and excel in electronic warfaregallente ships are supposedly the kings of solo combat but with the state of solo combat as it is that role is becoming more and more impossible a situation that will only get worse as eve gains more and more playerssupported on the basis that the the ship andor weapon revisions are within reason
this many times this
this
why is this not so already
while im betting it might take slightly longer then 5 minutes i imagine it would be relatively easy and would definitely be useful
with the exception of freighters which are very slow in warp when 2 ships enter warp across most systems they will arrive at the outgate with little difference in journey time despite the 3aus  6aus gap the ships spend too little time at this speed for it to really show in their transit time across any system except the very large 100au plus systems most of their travel time is spent in accelerating and deccelerating this limits the effectiveness of pursuit of larger ships by smaller ships i propose that the differential between ship warp speeds is widened by slowing down bs to 15aus for example and also that the acceleration and decceleration to max warp speed become more differentiated by either ship mass or class larger ships taking longer for both than smallerlighter ships this will give small ships some of the advantage they should have when it comes to pursuit without effecting any other aspect of the current mechanics
imho the balance is fine it gives the small ships a little edge over the large ships but also leaves room for the larger ships to get out
max speed is fine acceleration and deceleration however are not

as hirana points out a lot of this feature is al ready thereperhaps i should call this more an upgrade or improvement of current gametools rather then a new tool
bumpage
the main point here is missed in this topic probably be cause of the grammar issues people tend to see more prudent if i eject a can and be able to set a timer on it it makes the game more realisticit would improve server load as the default timer now is the same for any type of cango into any roid belt or mission field and you will still see wrecks and cans floating where the owner went to the pub hours before its about making the game more realistic and lower server load so we get some bandwidth freed up for for example a fleet ops
i have no need for that i always loot and salvage them allthats my personal opinion i dont care much about wrecks for others honestly if you want some go and shoot UFFFDem yourselfno support for that
i dont know what universe you live in bro but in mine things break instead of magically changing owners abandoning something is a deliberate act of an individual but it still doesnt impact the condition of the can you abandon if anything abandoning cans shouldnt reset the timer to canexplosion
i distinctely remember suggesting to make it more wild not more convenient or tame imho piracy is not an issue i kinda like the idea of people fighting over resources with in a limited sphereits funoh yeah the real f word in eve
id like to be able to tell which of those astrometrics frigates in the corporate hangar has the sisters probe launcher for starters
partial support as this is already in the game yet its buried somewhere not exactly intuitivelocate the ship in the assets window right click it and choose view content tadaait would not hurt to tack this function onto the rightclick menu of the ship itself in hangar

i hate having to setup a contract to see what is fitted to a ship 1
oh god yes pleaserigh tclick on ship  open fitting manager
yes
do it
full signed1
oh please yes shouldnt we be able to have station fitting services remove our lasers and crap from other ships without needing to have our pod inserted shouldnt we be at least able to see our other ships even through a camera perhaps
please
yes this is a good idea
as partial functionality for this exists i think its certainly worth doing if it can call an already existing function

yes please
good idea

dust 514 doesnt exist its a fake
first you would need to find out whether csm work applies to dust at allcurrently you ride hard in your saddle which is still laying on the floor far away from a horse
pc  could be some interesting dual screen action going on  1 eve 1 dustin the middle of a fleet battle on eve and a big infiltration on dust  mental
its going to be a console game get over it

no if you select a single package of trit that is 567345 unit and you want to buy the total amount you just have to click on all and the 567345 will appear in the amount to buy instead of you having to type the number in

ahahaha you posted in assembly hall you are not going to like what happens when this moves to cp
you contracted over all of your possessions to a complete stranger without asking for any collateralas a player of a few years you should know the cardinal rule of evedont trust anyone
this is assembly hall not supreme court of eve online you put this on the wrong board brothanks for putting it here though otherwise i would have missed your hilarious story
ive played since 2004 and never been scammed by a recruiteri must be doing it wrong
i support scamming in the recruitment channel
sorry you got scammed but without some kind of proposal this is off topic for this forum locking thread
i see what youre saying now but youre still taking the wrong approach the only place for automation in eve is to make repetitive tasks less needlesslytedious a better solution would be to put the same color tag on a target that shows up on your overview for that target and i want to say that this functionality exists but im too drunk to remember if a person has a red minus in overview that person has a red minus on target icon thats all you needwarning dialogs are to prevent newbie i didnt know better mistakes such as entering lownullsec or shooting at somebody you shouldnt be shooting at i will never fly in a fleet with logistics pilots that need dialog boxes to tell them whether the module theyre activating is going to damage a fleet member they damn well better be more experienced than that and there is no need to set do not attack markers because a setting them individually on every fleet member would be a pain in the ass b setting them to all fleet members would make it so you cant shoot at somebody to test their tank etc c its stupid automation that makes eve stupid for stupid people smart people just need more indication of friendly vs unfriendly in the target icon in the upper right
if the new planet options give us pos fuel alternatives then ice mining should take a huge dive although this wont stop isk farmers they will just move on to something else hopefully planet management wont be so easily automatedare ice prices really effected by the macro miners even with the falling prices now the current price is 152 times what they were a year ago also looking at the yearly graph it looks like ice prices are in their usual cyclic range falling in price for another month or two then back up again i am sure some md or si guys have explanations for this but if macro miners are flooding the market how come the price isnt always low jeep
even if you dont want to switch to a different font at least fix the couple characters that look identical to each other

i am under the impression that it is currentlyapoc  pest  mega  rokhif the rokh had a reasonable fit for an armor tank it would then beapoc  pest  rokh  megait wouldnt change the fact that both the rokh and mega are the redheadedstepchildren of sniper warfare due to the weaknesses of railsif the rokh had an extra low slot and the bonus was switched to 5 optimal  5 damage instead of 10 optimal 5 shield resist then the rokh would be useful in sniper fleets or you could fix railguns so gallente are not laughed at in the fashion that most minmatar had been laughed at for so long with their split damage impossible to fit no dps ships until projectiles were fixed because fixing the rokh is all fine and good this still leaves an entire race of blasterraildrones who were once on par with amarr in pvp crying in the corner
well hrmm you say law of large numbers is one thing and the other guy says its something different this makes it seem like the law is not so much a law as a something quite subjective  i would say theory but this word is usually misconstrued by the general populousperhaps both of you should give some evidence for claiming that snipe bs rankings by useare what you claim them to be i am not agreeingdisagreeing with either of you yetjust very keen on differentiating facts from opinions
the main factor for the differentiation is pilot race preference both me and bagehi fly in the south providence catch and curse but in different alliances so our data might be skewed due to alliance preferences and reimbursement schemesanother issue is also sp available for caldari pilots if you have specced hybrids it is much easier to train gallente bs than amarr or minmatar bonus point for this path is the rattlesnake of course if you havent trained hybrids at all then it is widely suggested to go laser  amarr bs getting the nightmare as a bonusthe caldari minmatar path is also available but there is no bonus faction bs to act as a lure the support skills should be as high as possible so the fact that some minnie ships shield tank should not be used as a bonus point you would train those skills anywayin the end what happens is that most caldari pilots that wish to take part in sniper fleets crosstrain to amarr or gallente those that have high hybrid skills go gallente like i have done 6 days left to get thereafter a brief review of the major fleet battles in my alliance kb about a month ago ship distribution was16 apoc for every pest15 megas for every pest03 rokhs for every pesti cannot give a better resolution for this data the sample size is 45 roughly 600700 pilot fleets a uk sysk mainly living in the south sansha rats dont like lasers at all that means that i was looking at roughly 200300 bs fleets each time with the rest being support tackle capitals and supercapitalsof course if you have better and more data please do come forwardedit law of large numbers is a statistical theorem
for the sake of quantifying the race trained bias in tagamis numbers there i worked out based on 2007 data how it compares what races ships are used overall in the game averaging out capital and t1 data from hereplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesfrom this we can see that for most things eve tends to favor caldari and gallente quite heavily making tagamis results all the more alarming it shows a 17 increase in people favoring the apoc compared to people who trained amaar from the start a 45 increase for the pest a 1 loss for the mega and a staggering 215 loss for the rokh in spite of it being designed as a preimier sniper if a ship designed wholly for sniping is appearing in such pitiful numbers compared to its competitors who are either less focused on sniping or simply general purpose ships then theres clearly something very wrong id argue as well as others here that its the weapons system
i am refereing to something different than tagami he is saying no one flies the rokh some people fly the tempest people fly the megathron and a lot of people fly apocsi am saying fcs request ships in this order apoc  tempest  mega  rokh in fact many ctas have instructions specifically prohibiting the use of the rokh because there is a training lag from the time that artillery was boosted to the time people are trained to use them you dont see them in fleets as much as fcs would like to see them but they are rapidly increasing if you look at fleet compositions from a year ago the tempest was loathed more than the rokh i remember people complaining that they were told to get into ceptors and scimis instead of bringing their minmatar bs the mega is only allowed in fleets because it is the lowest sp alternative to the rokh and half the eve population has trained caldari andor gallente bs pilots are told to fly the mega for now while training for the apoc or tempestif you look at bc the brutix and ferox are usually refused in ranged fleets and both are almost never found in bc fleetsif you look at hacs the eagle is allowed in fleets but there is usually a lot of pressure to fly something else gallente hacs are simply refused in ranged fleetsif you are in an alliance check your killboard to see the validity of this statement if you are in an alliance check the ships requested for the cta if you arent in fleet warfare this topic really wont have much bearing on your game unless you are using rails for some inexplicable reason
in sort railguns just suck same for blasters
a bit more subtle than my idea but i support anything that is a boost to field commands i have commandship v also
why do all you people persist in this annoying requestif you must have a t2 ship that looks like the tier2 bc then hey why not ask for a real new t2 ship based on it then you wont ruin a perfectly fine looking ship or 4actually forget reason just shut the hell up about your idea its annoying and i want to bash heads in every time its mentionedps perhaps the best idea to buff he field command ships is to first buff the tier1 battlecruisers and to pass on the buff to the t2 variantsfor all tier1 battlecruisers reduce their signature a marginal amount then improve their agility and max velocity this way they are faster more agile and harder to hit than the tier2 battlecruisers this would make sense as its just doesnt make sense that the tier2s can have more ehp more dps more slots more pg  cp and yet be the same size agility and speed thats a wtf in my booksthen give the prophecy a little more armor and the ferox a little more shield then increase the brutix and cyclones capacitor capacity a bit and increase their repair bonus to 10lvlthat would take care of a minor but suitable buff to the tier1s if we pass those bonuses to the tech2s then thats a good startwhat ever happens after for individual t2 buffs i am down with it if it doesnt include hull changes
yesthis too
yup
agree align at 0 ms without leveling warp will still require the ship to gain speed
vote for this
i fully support this requestremove that stupid and unfair storyline asap
that is a lovely idea and exactly the kind of wellthought out effort that deserves the csms and ccps attention
would look very cool indeed  as long as your alliance had a logowould love to see the broken image symbol for those that dont

no but not that simplemaby ccp could implement a way to mark your corp as a non combat corp so other players cannot wardec or shoot you unpunished but then again your corp should be prohibited to participate in any combat situations and denied acces to 00 or some other nifty way ccp can think of most of the times industrial corps get wardect for the fun of it and because they can playing eve should remain fun for every player and wardeccing a corp just for the fun of it is grieffing
wow is that way 
 leave corp button is that way
wish i could find the quote but wardeccing isnt considered griefing by ccp even if your wardeccr follows you around as you jump corp and wardecs every corp you makejoin for the next yearas long as there is any point to it and all the decr has to say really is he smack talked me ccp wont do anything about itso make your shell corps and bounce corp if you seriously dont want to fight every 23 hours
why is this still being discussed please people stop posting in this thread i am tired of seeing it on the main pageop is dumb we knew that before we even entered the thread case closed
they could use yc for the year if there is a worry about immersion it isnt like people are hovering over the time to see what year it is
dates in transaction logs etc use earth time
every ship in the game regardless of size accelerates and decelerates in an initiated warp at the same rate this is a bit odd support
i agree with the acdeceleration issue not so much the top warp speedsmaybe this could also be remedied by the advent of another astonautical rig  10 bonus to warp drive acceleration and braking for example

so im sure by now everyone has seen the movie galaxy quest featuring tim allen  sigourney weaver the most fanstastic part of that movie is when they are piloting their ship through a field of magnetically charged mines begin battering into the ship unelss they are skillfully navigated i thought to myself why is there not mines in space in eve picture a mine field placed by a faction as protection or left over from a previous war that choose no sides set up in a formation where the correct angle will allow you to navigate through or require you to be at a certain constant velocity magnetic picture it like a cloud in the distance that might just make a mess if your too close or might be faster to navigate through if your a half decent pilotthe purchasing of a mine field should be set up so your not choosing one at a time but you can buy packages of 1000 to 1000000 or more at a time priced accordingly concord shouldnt allow mine field placement anywhere near stargates or starbases but rather in 00 spaces low level security spaces and areas distant from common traffic    or right on areas with traffic more or less a mercenary or pirating toolbattlecruisers or larger would be the only ships capable of setting up a mine field with a tractor beam like tool that pulls multiple mines from the cargo hold and places them in their strategic location where they await activation by the ships pilot in an easy set it and forget it way when the mines have been placed obviously the ship would need to be at a decent distance from the mines before activation    or it just wouldnt be too pretty once the mines are set passerbys will see the formation as a named field not as individual mines preventing your overview from having millions of items mines will only show up on your radar individually if you are within its magnetic range making the purchace of magnetic mines more efficient regular mines are placed in a closer formation since they only activate when hit pros   new skills to train garunteed sales they are mines better protection from attack during wartime or from other assault the possibility of a sport being created mine winding  the piloting of a ship through a minefield to attain the fastest start to finish time i know i would watch in hopes of seeing some major explosions they cannot be destroyed unless you are at a certain too close for comfort range would require target ships to take their chances or take a while longer to go around only certain ships with mine field destruction weapons could take them out like a doomsday bomb or something of the sort new added feature for missions   the list could go on forevercons require a lot of setup time for large number fields unless multiple ships work together concord has the ability to erradicate a minefield or deactivate them at any time an emp emitter attached to a ship can prevent the mines from detonating however the emitter would require most of the power from your ship requires a specially fitted ship to assemble a mine field can only be set up in certain areas destroyers should posess the highest advantage against mine fields due to speed and their ability to target mines farther than other ships the ships name says it all increased risk of loosing ship could potentially be set up in a location that could interfere with miners  pvp can become much harder but much more interesting corps can be extremely well protected against enemy attacks   the list could continue alsooverall the idea is immense in design but could create a new level of gaming that requires better piloting skill allows sport and introduces something never added to a game before space mine fields
i am all for this it has been brought up many times and been shot down due to issues involving lag but why not make it like some sort of area affect damage like damaging clouds it would just do area of effect damage to all ships within its perimeter until the mines run out then you could put up another field or add mines to an existing one makes sense to me 
additional ideas  elaborationminefields being set up in a star map like probing but on a smaller scale maybe even grouping them in bunches so one block of 5 mines 4 on the corners one in the middle consists of one item ecm modules have the capability to deflect mine attacks depending on the magnetromic strength but tier 2 mines may require a higher magnetromic strenth to disrupt tracking when carried onboard your ships damage resistance is decreasedrequires a module specific for setting up mines which would require high skill amounts in electronics achoring etc can be destroyed by smartbombs if mines are not invulnerablecould be left in space indefinitly as long as they are not activated or destroyed by concord certain missions such as race through the poisonous cloud can become race through the minefields and can appear in level 3  4  or 5 missions can make it harder to kill drone infestationstargeting range 10k  giving aggression for targeted player on deployer deployer does not have aggression unless attacked by targeted player activation range 8k  speed 350msthermal damage 300 hp very undecided obviouslyidea allows for warpout with mines following for up to 9au bubble trapped minesyou can get aggression on the deployer before the mines are even activated on you oreguard mines  protect mining operations as fleets are safeguarded also and containers targeting range 14kactive range 10k only able to be fitted to mining barges with a lower powered module than the combat mine module which will take up a lot of power  cpu can only be activated if the player mining who deployed them has aggression on the canflipper for example similar to drones countermeasure mines will disrupt missles or bombs midflight within range take the targeting for that missile  destroy it along with the mine itself will disrupt to destroy any missile or bomb friendly or foe effective but mostly useful for evasive maneuvers war mines targeting range 6kactive range 5kdamage 100hp very undecidedspeed 500msused in larger masses to cover areas power in numbers but not as devastating as combat mines smaller capacity but much less damage upclose and personal weaponry to help put enemies off their course whatif at the time of placement they must be within a specific signature area like 1au out from a stargate only or only to support your idea be allowed to be placed with a minepod module much like the expanded probe bay only much larger to fithaving large mines in your cargohold in high security sectors will be red flagged immediatly by customs and result in the destroying of vessel small mines with the explosive capabilites of smaller missles will be able to be deployed in high sector but since there is as you say friend or foe result in the mines which are linked to your targeting also instantly targeting any ship for aggresion leaving you at the mercy of concord sice pods have such a low signature they are never detected by mines only your ship gives off a low frequency that the probes read from your module that classify you or fleeted as a friendly all others are considered hostile and treated thereasthere is so much i want to bring back into mines as a whole but they cannot just be a messy nuiscance that causes economic problems for miners which i should not have stated in my proposal theory as they should only be critical in 00 and minimal in higher security areas the fact that mines have autotargeting an enemy targeted by a mine has aggression on the deployer  fleet since they are invulnerable also they should be treated equallya vessel that has laid mines and docks will loose ownership of the mines whether undocked again with module or not and be treated as hostile though control ownership will be lost aggression will still be given to the deployer in any circumstances help me get more ideas i know some of you are amazing thinkers
im a minefield fan too and since long the main problem with mines is  lag  the only way to reintroduce them is to manage them globaly like bubbles a global area of effect with minefield graphic but no way a minefield can be managed mine by minegalaxy quest minefield
the rules say you should search for similar posts before posting your own ideasas you failed at it i happily link you the last thread on the same topicto summarize it for you1 we had mines already2 they got removed a people got owned by concord when their mines killed someone b people spammed mines like crazy on gates to lag people out3 devs stated mines wont come backthat said  not supported this is kind of afk pvp  people just get too lazy
to quote what i put on your other post on the features and ideas discussion forumof course if what darius mclever said about ccp saying no is true then  well  nothing we say really matters
i see clearly  minefield before the gate cloaked guy frags keep warping in verdict no

for those of you who dont read oope rule 17 bans the discussion of other games on the eve forums until very recently the oope section had an exemption that stated that other games could be discussed in oope recently ccp stealthedited the oope rules thread to remove the exemption and has started locking perfectly reasonable threads with absolutely no word on why they have made this incredibly stupid change except for some vague nonanswers meanwhile just to make things even more pathetic only some threads have been locked others have been allowed to remain open including ones with the developers themselves posting in themso csm prove that you are actually useful for something and get ccp to fix their forum rules remove rule 17 and allow us to discuss other games in oope
no it is not the rules that is the problem it is one specific moderatorccp adidaeveryone who agrees that we should be allowed to discuss other games in oope or god forbid just mention them in passing should support this thread and send an email to modsccpgamescom and tell them about it and specifically ccp adida send petitions too anything to get this ridiculous useless censorship out of hereit will be interesting to see whether i can get a mod to ragelock this thread

at first i thought this was a thread based on the very very useful skill que which has saved my ass given my busy schedule now that ive read it ill put my own support behind it as it would decrease the time required to warp out if you stop once aligned 
the idea of passive alignment is redundant pointing your ship in the direction of your intended warping point and having your speed set at 00 will take you the same amount of time to initiate a warp as it would if your ship were pointed in the opposite direction the only thing passive alignment is good for is for fcs to get a rough idea of how many people are still awake and ready in the fleet even then it mostly doesnt matterthe only thing this would affect is bombers and for that i give my support the ctr and ctr works but it just seems like a needless hassle if anything they should just add a button that levels your ship for the ocd among us
agreerepost from my threadsoships should allign only on demand and be possible to remain aligned even with 0 ms speed and why else is it usefull  when waiting for somebody to appear from behind the gate  its essential to face the direction where target probably will appear so you dont waste time to turn  otherwise its more likely to escape and this is not about warping but about where your ships front is facing to  added this because some people complained about warping issues which i am not talking about here just facing
i will repeat passive alignment does not help you if you are sitting at 0ms facing in the opposite direction of your intended path your ship having to turn around has no bearing on how long it takes to get to a certain speed your ship will turn around and be at its full speed in exactly the same amount of time as if the ship were pointed directly at your target
id go further and add some sort of roll control

im prophysics tho i can sympathize with ccps lack of knowledge in the arearight now they are using physics code from 1990s its very simplistic adding orientation matrix would increase the required bandwidth at least 2x it would also increase errors we know as desynch bugif ccp would go that way theyd be better off rewriting their physics engine from scratch or just license a popular one like havoc or bullet
i would like to propose the idea of storable waypoints when you have added multiple waypoints to the autopilot you can press a button and save the route under a name and description this will save the individual waypoints the order of the waypoints and the settings used at the time you saved the route use systems in low sec only use systems in high sec only or use the fastest routewhen you want to load a stored route you can simply choose one of a list of previously saved routes by this means you get exact the same route again and dont have to arrange the waypoints and set the settings againthe system you are currently in will be added as waypoint before the first waypoint of the saved route if you want to optimize the route with the current system you can use the already existing button for optimization or manually arrange the waypointsi know that you could save the waypoints in notepad and load them fron there but if you have a lots of waypoints it is very nerving to load them via the menu and set the correct securitysetting again every time you fly this routeand now open for discussion 
based on newsletter vol37s survey theyre still considering a pc relase

he means buy all of a particular order as it stands if you want to buy an entire order you still have to type in the quantity by hand
it can be annoying when you want to buy all of a 2234565 pile of something especially when someone put the wrong price in and you want to grab it before they fix the price it would be nice to be able to have a right click buy all as well as a buy option support
censorship is ridiculous being banned for words is amazingly ridiculouslet little johnnys mum block his chat so i dont have to deal with her head exploding
sure all fine and well however the reason people get banned and temporary bans is because they say things that cannot be filtered with a simply word filter such asim going to hunt you down irl cut your arms off tear your toe nails off then feed you to small kittensthis well something like it would get you banned or a temp ban at the very least however as you can see the word filter found nothing wrong with it
plz stop trying to derail the topicim just saying that we should have a profanity filter not what it can and cannot filterwhat you gave an example of is harassmenti should be able to say   and  in a chat channel all i want without worrying about somone getting butthurt over it and then getting a gm involved
100 support this will free up at least a bit of the gms time which is quite important they are bogged down as it is true this will not stop harassment by way of direct threats not involving profanity but for those all too common occurrence of people simply using profanity this would clear up a lot of that heck we have this functionality in the forums why not ingame
the last proposal someone brought up on here claimed the same thing that people were getting bans and temp bans for swearinga gm replied on the topic making things a bit more clearand this
i think there was originally a skill that wasnt seeded called smuggling that decreased the likelihood of customs finding the illegal cargo
guess the latest dev blog sortof indirectly addressed that issue

hopefully they implement something that references active accounts if you have been paying for a subscription for more than 3 months you should be able to post as often as you likethere is no way spam bots would pay then wait for 3 months of game to elapse before spamming the  out of everyone

initially the whole reason i was raising the point re the order of ships was just to show some inconsitancies and fallacious reasoning on tags partnot to necessarily negate the conclusions reachedoriginally i was fairly ambivalent about a 15 boost in dmg but as i have started investing more time in considering the idea i am not sure if its the best possible answer though possibly an expedient one with livable consequencesi am going back to read the older thread where he and liang hashed out some details before posting my thoughts on a better idea though no use using up all the air in the room now that i am not going to semitroll him
welcome to the foldwhatever you do remember this occams razori am leaning myself towards an ammo fix but that would bunch up the panties of the blaster guys so i decided to keep away from it and propose the generic damage increase proposal the 15 is solidly justified and a very good compromise overall my ideal solution would be for railguns to receive the 15 damage boost as an increase to the kinetic damage they deliver while the blasters get their damage boost in thermalem type
pretty much exactly what i proposed in the original sm topic except do not change the damage type of blasters leave it as thermalkinetichonestly a huge step in the right direction of fixing blastersrailguns lies in their high damage ammo void  javelinvoid increase the damage to stand out over faction antimatter and remove the tracking penaltyjavelin increase range remove the horrendous speed nerftracking penaltydownsides are void largely replaces null rest of the eve players complain that hybrid pilots actually have usable t2 ammo p
mostly because people want a gank and spank t2 ship that looks like the tier2 bc so requests for that get answered with but it would be more of the same
yes a new t2 bc would need a role there are two tiers of hulls that have not been given the t2 treatment and they are arguably some of the best looking hulls in the game unlike the tier 3 bs the tier2 bc already has a t2 ship with comparable bonuses that probably should have been on that hull
supported
this a tier 2 bc in role is similar to the field command while the more modest fleet command has a similar feel to the tier 1 bcs except as stated before
agweed
yes supported there is no real reason other than it hasnt been developed yet that should keep this from being in eve
replying to this thread and when did the word ghost become appropriate here
seems like the tranquility live server cant handle the player load latelyso they come up with this kind of psychological crap to reduce subscription numbers and so server loadi have no other sane explanation for putting this kind of idiocy straight onto the live server ccp needs to stick their heads out of the sand and accept that pve players do not want to pvp period if they dont want them remove high sec all together and make everything ffa pvp and be done with itbut get it out of your heads already that luring pve people into eve with pve content and then forcing them into pvp is going to workit isnt get it if people are interested in pvp they will do so on their own behalfmaybe they can add a ton of pve missions in 00 space tie it to sov and force pvp players to do them ad infinitum to keep their sovlets see how pvpers would react huh i am pretty sure it will instantly fix all the lag problems jer
the majority of pvpers are already forced to spend substantial time grinding isk to fund their playstyle while i agree that the implementation of this specific feature may be a little off i disagree with the attitude im a missioner so shouldnt have to pvp on any occassion i dont want to ever
these missions are indeed ill conceivedsomeone earlier in the thread asked about the mission and how they relate to fw mission goals not read all the pages so not sure if this has been answered but here is my experience i needed to kill a load of elite frigscruisers in 02 space fw territory the mission description said that the transports needed to be killed the mission did not spawn the targets until i had killed a ridiculous number of elite faction ships this level 2 mission would have been difficultimpossible to complete in a sb because of the extreme blobbing of the npcs a sb would have been decloaked long before reaching the target and would then have to tank the 40 strong blob even if the transports that were present in the initial spawn were the mission completion triggersin my opinion this level 2 mission is approximately as hard as a level 35 mission no bss but many elite frigs and cruisers all in one blobi shed no carebear tears i completed the mission in 5 hours  in the same lowsec system i just think that balancing needs to be done extensively on these missions they are well out of the capabilities of many combat pilots running at the level of the mission apart from that they are being given to minersindustrialists i didnt have the option of getting help from corp mates because the target system was over 20 5 through lowsec jumps away for a 40 jump round tripi dont mind going into lowsec for a larger than usual faction gain from a combat mission most storyline missions are a joke more combat storylines please  but taking a faction hit for the opposing faction coupled with the ridiculous journey time mission difficulty low isk reward lowsec location of encounter these missions need restarting from scratch by the dev teamediti feel that my post needs to be more constructive some suggestions1 less jumps to destination 20 jumps for a low volume level 4 courier storyline is fair enough for the standings gain but not for a combat mission2 bettermore accurate description of the mission objective3 pirate faction npcs if people are running missions for standings they are most likely primarily operating in empire and do not want to take massive standings hits for any faction fw is there for people who dont care about opposing faction standings4 achievable objectives in a reasonable amount of time this is lowsec piratefw territory close to 100 ships many elite does not make for reasonable mission completion times in a pvp fitted ship5 a choice of mission types low rewardlow risk couriersupply storylines for industrialistscarebears high rewardhigh risk lowsec combat missions for combat pilots the mission choice mechanic is already in game in the epic arcs so should not be too difficult to use on a storyline mission this would be the carrot rather than the stick approach and after taking a load of the carebear options carebears might just get a little brave and head to lowsec on their own
pve and pvp are two different playstyles you cannot force one upon the otherit will not work period people rather quit than being forced into something they do not wantsomehow ccp just dont want to get that simple fact its like they have a huge big plate in front of their heads and refuse to accept this facepalm jer
i support the idea that the storylines be removed
so what is your proposed solution for both parties
after looking at the rewards to risks they just dont seem good enough to actually go and do them if something was changed then itd be a great idea but as of now they are just not worth it
simple choiceseperate low sec missions from high sec missions and let people chose to go for the more risky ones by their own choicenot like they do now by trying to sneak low sec missions into high sec missionsstorylines and so basically forcing people into itif the low sec missions have a good risk vs reward then there will be plenty of people trying them out by their own choicejer
correct me if i am mistaken but im fairly sure you have the choice to decline these missions you might not get that standing boost you are so accustomed to being handed on a plate but isnt that part of good risk vs rewardhow do you imagine pvpers feel about the game forcing them into doing something they probably loathe pve to be competitive is doing stuff we dislike from time to time not an integral part of a game like this
blasters are an extreme close range weapon why do they have tracking difficulties at their optimalthumbs up to the proposal

i often fly a hac or recon and if i am a couple of seconds behind a bs i just cannot catch up as i chase him through multiple systems the problem involves how long it takes to start up and brake from warp id rather not slow down bs warp speeds because i do fly bs and warps that take 30 seconds are so boring zzzzz
i was in the fleets rolling wi out of geminate right after the expansion early on there was a constant threat of counter attack if nodes wouldnt have completely lagged out nearly every time a fleet jumpedwarped that war would have had a lot more action than it did because the threat of lag was increasingly more feared than enemy fleets fleets had to be split up more than they traditionally had been this means cap fleets often do not have their support fleet near them for protection this means things like this are a big worry in the current sov warfare system it moved a cap fleet without support because support  caps often means people get stuck grids dont handle anywhere near as many people as they used to nc seems to have forgotten their experience in geminate and elsewhere and tried to load too many ships into the fight at the same time so even before the node died many in the nc fleet were not involved in the fight so far fewer ships were lost by it than would have been lost if the nc fleet managed the entry of ships betterso the point of that story is attacking a system with 12 stations would require a very large very split up fleet a fleet with a game mechanics weakness that will be exploited unless fixed making it impossible to take out a system when fixed it will only be a matter of reflipping stations back with a handful of bombers or repping stations without a really large fleet you wont be able to roll a system with a lot of stations
you still havent explained why this would be more challenging than taking the same 12 stations in 12 different systems supported by 12 ihubs
because you can flip a station in one system right before downtime when the servers come back up  prestochango  it is fully repped requiring a fleet to flip it back rather than just a few stealth bombers for this reason station attacks are timed so the station will be flipped within minutes of downtime even if you managed to magically flip each station in a system with 1 siege cycle each and no time between 12 stations would take 2 hours thats plenty of time for the defender to sneak in and flip some of them back thus beginning a never ending flip back and forth of stations aka static sovereignty this would be rolling back the sov changes made in dominion to the pos wars of old but worse with this mechanic neither side would have to haul in and setup new resistars as stations dont die so if taking sov before was bad taking it with multiple stations allowed per system would be impossible
i support this idea but the idea should come with a thorough analysis of the sov system and not just it takes x amount of time to conquer the system with x number of stations if an unlimited number of outposts are allowed maybe how outposts function needs to be reviewed systems like destructable operating costs and total hp so that while you can support a dozen outposts in a system maybe it becomes increasingly less cost effective to have a large number of outposts
 and then what stations cant be destroyed if it costs too much to run all the stations what does the alliance do if they can removeadd stations at will it is the old drop towers on all moons pos slog but worse most of the big alliances can easily hold a collection of strategic station eggs to make systems invincible in the face of attackif you want more stations in systems then sov cant be tied to the stations at all
agreed like i and most everyone else has said for this to work sov needs to looked at i was proposing a way to discourage the have an unlimited number of stations you do bring up an interesting idea of unanchoring an outpost like we do with pos i feel that this would substantially lessen the value of an attack on a system with an outpost if the defenders can just take it and run could easily come up with a back story that prevents the unanchoring of an outpost but still have a destructible capabilityalso what if we took the approach and removed the stationsov connection entirely you dont need sov to own a station maybe even to build a station would obviously need to rework how stations are built then or let sov charge for planet anchoring or whatever in empire there are caldari corporation stations in gallente space and such why shouldnt a similar thing be possible in 00
i believe station ownershiprights are connected to sov and have been since the dawn of time so asking ccp to change that would probably be a major undertaking and met with similar oh god oh god run and hide response as to the repeated beating the dead horse threadsif stations are disconnected from sov not in the op proposal i would support this proposal to a degree however i dont think ccp would even blink before saying no if csm proposed it
afaik the only connection to sov an outpost has is that you have to have sov to deploy one since sov is an alliance level option and outposts are corp level structures i see no reason why there should be a arbitrary hard limit on the number of stations aloud to be deployed in a system on the other hand is should be limited in some way i would suggest any additional stations in a system have certain limitations or expenditures associated with them monthly fees should be added to additional outposts so you have to decide if the benefit is worth the cost its not so hard to come up with he isk and materials to build a spare outpost in a system but if its going to incur a recurring cost that stacks with even more additional outposts then you now have some choices to make edit if the fees cannot be payed or there is no controller of the outpost then start it on a decay timer and start letting rats use it as a base of operation sorta like a dynamic mission based on lack of payment adds some atmosphere to the loss of an outpost if its left long enough and its decay timer runs out very long timer then blow it up if the argument is that every new outpost has the potential of stressing the database with all new market information because they all have markets simply force one of the outposts first one obviously to be labeled as the primary outpost and be the only one with market servicesas far as overpopulation of 00 with outposts is concerned at some point in the future there will be an outpost in every claimable system then those that wish to build their own are screwed if you think this is impossible open your map ingame and sort the star colors by services and select insurance as the filter there are already a lot of outposts in 00 and there will only be more in the futurezoltar
a corp not in the alliance holding sov in a system cannot control the systems station flipping a station is one of the ways to flip sov in the dominion sov mechanicsagreed however ccp said a while back that stationsoutposts cannot be destroyed without a massive overhaul of the code at some point this should happen when that happens sov should also be disconnected from station ownership when those two things happen then multiple stations per system wouldnt be a problem
i think this is a great idea seems silly to have a limit of onethough i think theres a reasonable upper limit to havesay 5 10
yes i know outposts cannot be destroyed atcurrent that would have to be changed to impliment the other crap in y post  although i gotta ask if a corp owns an outpost and is kicked from an alliance they no longer have sov and are no longer in the alliance but they still own the outpost right if it is impossible for a corp to own an outpost while not in an alliance then they would have to hand over the outpost before the alliance could kick them but i assume that things of that nature happen between people on good terms not between people that are mad enough to give someone the boot just wondering how that works right now ive never encountered it so i dont knowzoltaredited for support
well logical limiter is number of planets you can deploy the station at im not especially keen ofc about the limit of having to install it at the planet ofc either as long as you cant install it in the same grid as pos its not like you can hide a station as it shines in the overview as far as current sov warfare goes ofc it sucks and so does lag but basing development decisions on lag is not that good idea either anyway  several ways to circumenvent the omg many station to shoot thru issue if it is issue have been already posted for example having to point one station in the system as capital or master station and if this flips then so do others in the system so in my eyes the condition of current sov warfare is not a reason to keep that limit in place as its easy to adress the concenrs related to many station in one system if so desired i also do not see immediate danger of 00 getting filled with stations as if this would be the issue it would be already happening eventually yes  there will be 1 station in every starsystem in 00 under current mehanics as ccp made sure of it when the sov was tied to station in the way it was done after there is already a station in the system is that so big step upwards if there is several in the system 
people in this thread really should try to engage their brains and think before randomly spamming no lol because in your mind mines can only work in a single negative way if brought back mines would be balanced and contribute an interesting gameplay option devs have long said they would like to revisit mines signed

thanks for the attempt to help out but my original post was closer to what i meant keep posting though your contributions are helpful and original
please enlighten us as to how mines would be brought back in a balanced way 
now that it has been announced that insurance drone regions and loot is taking a nerf data should definately be supplied to be contrasted to another study done before winter expansion so players can see the difference in the mineral supply

i cant speak for everyone but im having trouble understanding the need for this is this so you can go to different market hubs and pick up your purchases without having to change the autopilot or what i would think a macro against the rules can accomplish this already so it isnt for macro miningmissioning an fc usually doesnt run the exact same route for roams adjusted to hit hot spots as they are identified so i guess im just having trouble understanding the need what is the purpose
realistically this is just a usability feature if you are at point a and you want to get to point e and you set specific points bc and d and you know you are going to make the same trip daily it couldnt hurt to be able to save the path instead of having to enter it manually every timesigned
just bought the book and started studying it looked over the moros description and wtfok i know im late i went googling the second i saw it my question is simply is there any thread that has ccp either explaining why they stealthnerfed it or apologizing for not putting the nerf in patch notesi thought the only get drone bonus in siege mode was weak does this 20 instead of 50level nerf replace that or has it been double stealthnerfedi think ccp should have left it alone
the moros used to be able to do more drone damage with 5 heavy drones than a carrier could do with 10 fighters that has been fixed there were threadnoughts and it was discussed in a dev blog if you missed all of this not sure what to tell you other than your dread remains the only dread that is silly powerful against smaller ships if you are not satisfied meh even postnerf the moros is still preferred over the other dreads it could be worse you couldve been flying the splitfit nag for yearsps countdown to thread lock as this is not a post for assembly

yeah that dev blog has the first proposed nerf not the one that actually happened thanks anyway
since the hic can catch anything i think its about time the warp core stab nerf was removed i could fit 2 x warp core stabs to avoid getting caught my say an interceptor but i can get killed during warp by a smartbomb off topic but slightly relevant the warp core stab can be easily countered by focused warp disruption on a hic i often run an onyx in empire wars for catching anything stabbed to the eyeballs for a stab with the nerf that it already has to only have one positive warp point as opposed to the faction scramblers which have 3 x negative points feels like theyre nerfed enough as it is nevermind the targeting nerfi admit ive never used one in my life though i would like to see them have some real use i imagine it would open low sec a little more for some people
i do not support this the point of warp stabilizers is that you want to avoid combat so the nerf on it just keeps it within purpose
the warp core stab can be easily countered far too easily all you need is a shadow serp scrambler and you have 3 warp points on them making them need at a minimum of 2 warp core stabilisers a heavy interdictor can point anything whether it is stabbed or not it doesnt bother the dictor  2 stupidly easily counters to a stupidly overly nerfed module stupid i knowdue to such easy countering i think it is only fair to at least reduce the nerf or remove it possibly change it for something to do with speed with some excuse about stress on your propulsion systems
lol easily all you have to do is put a 120m150m isk warp scrambler that functions at a range of 13km on your fast tackle that is likely to die sounds like a smart and easy fit to meive seen these on stupidly expensive ships but these stupidly expensive ships are not anything remotely close to common pvp shipsmore common is having both a scram and a disruptor for a total of 3 points on a tackler however if this is your fear you are better off fitting a scram yourself to turn off their mwd so your drones can tear him apart in 5 secondsanyway whats to stop you from putting 3 stabs on your ship if you are actually worried about having 3 points on youthis is not wow you are not supposed to have a pvp onoff switch welcome to eve
the nerf was imposed to reduce the massive number of nearinvincible snipers on entrychoke gates in lowsec if you remove the targeting penalty they will return ill be one of them and ill enjoy saying told you so when you come back here and cry about all the snipers your proposed unnerf caused and how you cant even get through lowsec gates anymoreheavy interdictors if fit to survive sentry guns arent exactly fast theyve got a relatively slow locktime as well its a lot easier to get away from a hic than some people seem to think the ones that are fit with mwds are still not fast enough to catch a sniper thats 100km off a gate before he warps out unless you land on top of him using faction mods to circumvent warp stabs is not a viable argument to propose changing the stab few people use the 3point scrams unless they know they are going to need itthe irritation of having to wait longer to lock targets in missions because you are afraid to get shot is not a viable reason to change wcs back to their previous mechanic you are fitting them so you do not have to fight a player that scans you down to kill you there are a multitude of methods to avoid being killed in a mission a few of those being keep your scanner open check to probes in space dont sit on the mission warp in point mission with friends and so on i am against any change to the wcs as they are now they perform their function they do not break anything else no change neededzoltar
oh yeh forgot people dont invest such isk into t3 ships pirate faction ships do they so investing into a high warp point point never happens what makes a tackler likely to die i thought you may of noticed a lot of ships fit tackles a good drake fit should always have a point oh and it usually fits a stupidly high buffer would you consider that easily killed anyway with the fact that the wcs are there to avoid combat why would you fit a scrambler to yourself and use drones dont think too many industrial ships fit them do youback to my original point a hic can easily catch any ship no matter how many stabs thus making a stab easily irrelevant useless modules and a heavily nerfed ship which has been caught with ease you talk about so your drones can tear him apart in 5 seconds back to avoiding combat means you now have to initiate combat you are also completely assuming the tackler is an interceptorthanks for pointing that out to me i must of mixed up the eveonline header with blizzard entertainment silly mefinallyi hope you understand how easy it is to catch something using a hic infact i hope you fly one as a hic pilot myself i understand the concept of being sbd and pressing f1 to infinitely point something rather easy if that is too hard to understand please dont come backi will now use your own phrase to explain this we have fitting limitations edit to zoltar tarzoid i cant tell if ive spelt that correctly sorryfitting wcs to a sniper ship before the nerf was considered good however think of the stupid low dps you receive now i wasnt around when this nerf was initially instigated however was a dramieldaredevil on sisi last night i broke the 10kms barrier in a dramiel for the first time myself i managed to fly from ffa1 0m to a sniper battleship at 170km before he managed to get away i had him pointed and a random friend warped on top of him to finish him this is assuming most snipers are battleships and slow align times as well as lack of concentration  being tackled wcs are easily countered as we said before if you are sitting in a mael you will have 5 low slots you will need damage or tracking mods in the low to be of any use as a sniper a minimum of 3 say would leave you with 2 low slots thus making a scrambler and a warp disruptor have you pointed and unable to warp eve has changed a lot and i think its time the wcss were changed toohowever the point you raised on the sniper ships was extremely valid and still is a huge cause for concern for this proposal to be taken seriously
if you are being 3point tackled by drakes and then dying perhaps you should blame yourself or your own fit alternately you can play in space that is safe like high sec or join a corpalliance and help to keep a section of space safe for the benefit of yourself and your corpalliance mateswcs is supposed to be primarily for travel fit ships not so someone can ratmission in lownull sec and be immune to pvpso youre getting locked by a hic then it is able to get into range and put an infinite point on you see above comment about blame on fitself pretty sure ive flown hics dictors and ceptors more than you so find someone else to lecturepay attention to local dont sit at 0 from the warpin stay aligned out i mean some really basic concepts in evemy point is that wcss are not supposed to be an idiot button to avoid combat as can be found in more simple games like wow this is a higher functioning game you are supposed to use more tactics than press button to win turn your brain back on
if you werent an eve player when this nerf was implemented then how do you know it was considered good to have a stab on a sniper ship furthermore how can you possibly understand why that was the case even if it were also just for reference yes the faction frigs were around then and they were faster it wasnt at all uncommon for a standard t2 interceptor to hit 1516kms and it wasnt unheard of for a crow pilot to spend a billion isk on dead space mods to get their ship up to 2426kms the sniper you caught was on sisi where the loss of his ship isnt important the slightest had the situation been replayed on tq you can bet hed have been aligned to something and ready to warp out the instant he realized you were coming at himthe reason snipers fit stabs prenerf is because there was zero penalty attached to them they could fill their lows with stabs and nothing at the time could stop them from getting away short of 45 tacklers sporting 2point scrams once again assuming they werent paying attention and werent prealigned lack of attention is not something to base balance changes on a heavy interdictors infinipoint has a maximum range the sniper is well outside of that range therefore you still have to get a warpin on the sniper this requires some effort and generally more than 1 person if the siper is anywhere near worth his salt he wont let this happen there is no need for a sniper whos paying attention and doesnt use only 1 snipepoint to use a wcs as a crutch i still say there is no need to change it backzoltar bagehi regarding his post after this one  exactly
this is what happens when people can fit stabs without penaltiesyou cant see the fits properly but if memory serves me he would put 4 mags and 3 stabs on that thing and rip people apart from 200km with that thing then send an alt in after an hour or so to scoop the dozens of wrecks left behindhe was not the only one like this stabs were nerfed because of this if you think this is bad imagine the alpha of a sniper maelstrom that cannot be tackled and what that would do to low sec choke points
yes but silos are large collidables and so are structures and sometimes they do drop items like scrapmetal or ammo why couldnt they do the same it would seed the local ecomony with named items since as i understand it npc stations will soon will not be selling them soon
huh i think you think you understand it doesnt sound like you do they are decreasing the module drops from mission running and ratting because it has too much impact on the mineral market what you are suggesting is increasing the module drop this is similar to requests to be able to unanchor towers in missions which is also absurd the devs could make a bunch of junk npc shipsstructures that arent like anything player owned in the game to cut down on requests like the op unfortunately there would be even more requests like the ludicrous request that pops up from time to time for player owned concord ships if they did
i really really wish there is no downtimeor at least move the downtime to an other timeor downtime only 2x weekis it really necessary to have downtime every day at the same time 
yes it is they do all kinds of cleanup during the downtime seed items and stuff
move somewhere else where dt occurs at night
