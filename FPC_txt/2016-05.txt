this battle is far from over my friend
too long have npc corp members been able to hide their actions in an untouchable corp if someone choses to be in an npc corp their safety should be locked to green to prevent illegal activity if you want to engage in that behavior get out of npc protection
butthurt that a noob stole your loot and you cant declare war on him thats sad that noobs or professional npc corp members answer to your proposal is creating a corp taking your cans and close that corp to go back to npc protectionit might hinder new players of doing something illegal  but wait isnt this what we want them to do to engage with other players how about a lock on red for themabout how many untouchable npc corp members are we talking
i dont get it if they commit an illegal act you get to shoot them with no wardec or any other strings attachedwhat would be solved by forcing them into a corporation
the tv in the captains quarters can be annoying and repetitive can we please get a button to mute it or if a way to mute it exists can someone please inform me
explain why exactly  exactly

we are ready and waiting

this is not going to be the expected salty tears of a bittervet  but a series of valid points that took multiple factors into account and an attempt to remain objectivemercenaries these organizations once had entire communities and oncall channels where you could pay your hardearned isk to defend your assets against an overwhelming force to deny assetsrouteshubs to enemies or to mercilessly hunt and slaughter your enemies wherever they wereunfortunately that is not the case today today many of the larger mercenary organizations have become massdeccing instalocking tradehubchoke point camping f1 monkeys who are half paying attention to their intended targets as they pass through a choke point or undock from a station while theyre doing something far more entertaining than just sitting in the same place why is that it is because one of the best tools that they had was ripped away to protect the delicate sensitivities of the supercapital pilots who never could log on because everyone knew where they were or everyone knew they were online so what we have today is an entire group that has turned into griefing massdeccers with no better purpose than podding a newbro as he undocks because he didnt know better or an industrial corp ceo telling people they cant play a game that they pay for or thousands who now cant go sell their products that they worked hard to obtainproducesteal etc etc etc my proposal is the removal of the buddy list and going back to the oldschool watch list the reasoning is simple supercapitals can now tetherdock at citadels and any alliance which can afford a fleet of supercapitals should be able to afford at least one citadel to serve as a home station for their supersand should be able to defend this location am i asking for a nerf to anything no am i saying a feature need to be absolutely removed nowhat i am asking is that ccp take into account that they created a feature which has created serious ramifications and have ostracized an entire community of pilots that was once great as if one merc org had too many running contracts they would pass it off to another for a finders fee and to ensure that the client received the best services for the isk provided i am thinking that some constructive feedback and dialogue between ccp and the playerbase not just those with large numbers of subscriptions and the reevaluation of a feature that they have created which is not in the best of interests of the community the playerbase as a whole think of how many subscriptions get lost to permadecs from the current merc groups what i am asking for is balance i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sounds like someone got their d kicked in the dirt and has no means of recourse welcome to new eden buttercup its not forgiving nor is it fair and you do have to disregard the frozen corpses in space occasionallyoption a figure something out for retaliationoption b give me your stuff before you hit the biomass queuei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
well technically you do want to nerf the buddy list and the current status quo so edit just saw your post in another thread where you basically told the op there to htfu and adapt or gtfo i think we can safely turn that around back onto you now
it is a shame that your instant uncounterable unlimited and perfectly reliable intel source has been removed to the detriment of your old playstyle i myself would like a shield mod that gives 100 omni resists for when i just want to afk rat while watching a film  this is to name but one example  so i share something of your sorrowas it is i find myself forced to consider alternative methodologies some of which  to my dismay and regret i will not hide or deny  involve effort and risk at this time i can only suggest that you investigate analogous options to advance your own goals until such time a ccp restores your entitlements
you use the global lingua franca just like the rest of us
turn off your computer
hmmm so what are the options now world building seems to require a good lore base and if world building has been abandoned that doesnt speak well for the future of the game
just a thoughtmay i suggest when we get the option to hire concord police to guard it the option would have to be very expensive as it would brake the game otherwiseand you can hire an entire fleet like 100 or soso it can counter big fleets trying to take it down imagine a small alliance that cant afford to guard it them selfsthat option would give them a chance the alliance would have to have a maximum number of playersanything bigger can guard it them selfs
most of the people in the mercenary community dont even want to have the watchlist they understand why the change was made in the first place what we dont like is the blanket solution to a problem that only effect the nullsec side of the game the changes effects more than just nullsec cap games it also hurt wormhole and highsec i dont really care about the old watchlist but i do want some way to show me if my war targets are indeed online are not giving cap pilots watchlist immunity or watchlists not working for those who are in nullsec would obviously work deletetheweak
this carrier needs some love the tiny fighter hangar and useless ecm optimal range bonus is really insulting
it does seem a little unbalanced that players can now logout of the game leaving those hunting them no mechanism to determine if they should continue to chase or if they are spinning their wheels such a counter to this instant uncounterable unlimited and perfectly reliable ability to leave the game universe doesnt have to be instant and free as the watchlist was but there should be some tool to counter the ability of players to completely and infallibly remove themselves from the game universe without the ability of the other players to find out they are now in an invulnerable statei dont think anyone will claim the plight of super pilots didnt need to be addressed in some manner but the solution has seriously hurt wormhole pilots and bounty huntersmercenaries stalking specific targets you can tell them to just htfu and go infiltrate corps or keep alts logged in 247 everywhere but that doesnt change the equation where it is just now too much work to hunt specific targets now that it is more likely than not they will be logged off when you find them so players have stopped and will continue to stop doing itless things are going to happen now in the sandbox because of this change a rollback isnt going to happen but some sort of accommodation or new intel channel is necessary if you want hunterstyle game play to continue to take place in eve
i totally agree with itinstead make the rewards into something thats not directly isk make rewards dependant on what you do kill a rat get some random loot do a datarelic site get some relicdata random loot kill someone in pvp get some bounty money and so on
if you cant protect what you own then you dont deserve to own it simple as that
truebut i could protect itif i had the option mentioned abovethere are people that dont have the numbers to protect what they own but they got the money to hire securitysimple as that
i totally agree im sure if ccp sends you all the localization texts youll get right on it to have it translated right
wait people still use sounds in eve online in 2016
then you can already hire security in the form of mercenary groups pay others to help you protect what you cant on your own you could also go into a mutually beneficial relationship with other groups on the same level of participation as you and together youd be stronger keeping your moneyah but youd like to be like a solo player with swathes of npcs protecting your space right never going to happen
locator agent with a 30 second response time and 80 of the isk back because he just flat out cant find your targettimer and isk back feature to be discussed for balance purpose of course but the agent should tell you rather fast he just flat out cant find any lead to this dudes location
with the introduction of accuracy score to weapons simplifying the calculations and the mental process of calculating relative accuracy of weapons i want to propose the next logical stepintroduce a new column in the overview called difficulty to hitthis should be the result of factoring target resolution and radial velocity for objects on the overview resulting a number on scale with weapons accuracy score this would result in a new way of presenting the same information you now have with radial speed and signature radius and would make target selection and gunnery extremely streamlined intuitive and newbiefriendly
completely agreed already mentioned this many times everybody i invited to join me in eve rejected just because the tutorial and the main interface is not in spanish i fail to understand how ccp still completely ignores this language 12 years into the game
i feel like the buddy list is overall what was intended for the original mechanic the watchlist became a gameable intel source and not much more locator agents are a different topic and i would be more than happy to hear your opinions on that mail me but i will have to disagree that we should revert back to the old watchlist keep moving foward never backjudge
can any of you csm types ask ccp if we can get fw size restrictions fixed novice should be t1 frigates only small should be t1 destroyers faction frigates and t2 frigates medium should be cruisers and t2t3 destroyers large should be t2t3 cruisers and battlecruisers a new extra large size should be added to replace the current large it would be more evenly matched that way the way things are they might as well rename novices to garmur and small to svipul
i propose that all market orders at citadels have the system name prepended to the location in the market screenafter all if the market is part of the scc mechanism the scc really ought to know where the market isi believe that this proposed behaviour is already how the markets in outposts work

nooooo
i really appreciate the effort you put into your post can you give us a few minutes more of your precious time and provide us with more details why preferably with more than one word if its not too much
only if they deliver on the damned musical instrumentsbumble likes to toot his own floot
fun fact the games coding considers navy and pirate faction frigates to be tech 1last i heard some devs wanted to make your idea happen but then ran into some problems
its completely doable itll just be more effort if they coded it wrong the first time granted im not a coding wizard but it should just be as simple as adding complex size to the array the ship stats are stored in and then checking that when it tries to enter a plex its more of a tedious and time consuming thing than a difficult one
if the ccp corp would allow us to come together you would not longer need to toot your own floot
devs when they read about fw
never forget
