and so what he may be uninformed but usually its easy enough with a good attitude to get into contact with the ganker and ask him wtf happened and how he did it many gankers are helpful players and will tell a new player what to look out for and how to preparethere may be a little roleplay involved now and then but omg this is an mmorpg after allthats what many gankers are actually willing to do and you know what quite a few of them are industrialists too all the new player has to do is get a hold of himself and get in touch with the folks who peeled him out of his trit canwe dont need new game mechanics so much besides maybe what zappity stated earlier what we do need though is much improved information for new players about the nature of the game ccp has been constantly failing at this since i started playing just look at what they didnt do with evelopedia
sheltering them the wrong way you meanid shelter new players by bringing them into nullsec
nice trollyou even have valid points but if he doesnt know how to play under wardeccs its the same as if he is unable to and a vet shooting at a noob in his first desty is just killboard grinding these players have nothing of value they cant really defend themselfe because they are lacking the knowledge of how to do it its a greeat difference if you or even i start a new char or a noob we have knowledge that he is missing and player skills and knowledge make a huge difference in evesheltering is normal behavior in every society because people need to learn and have the room to make errors a noob can hardly replace a t1 desty while we laugh at the cost loosing this lousy desty is the equivelant of us loosing a super
1 pve need to be addressed  it realy get boring overtime it pay well enough alrdy but there need to be more stuff incursion were on the right track when they were first released but we need moreeven those daily activity that we got during the last fe
hi guysid like to return once again to the topic of neural remaps i think lots of pilots would agree that 1 remap per year is not enough when you make a remap to save some time training a couple of very long skills you get stuck with it for the rest of the year this gives you no incentive to train skills you need right now if they depend on different attributes so you have to defer them and defer your fun flying ships you want its dissappointing and its not funi know therere threads about buying bonus remaps for aurum and about ditching whole attributes system but id like to propose an alternativei suggest giving an ability to players to get bonus remaps as a reward for ingame activityi suggest introducing a new kind of missions which will be available once in every 3 months just like epic arc available in high low and npc null secutity sectors impossible to blitz very hard to do solo make it a real challange for a small gang of 46 pilots have no or very little isk reward have a bonus remap as a reward for a pilot who started a mission with no ability to share it with the fleetbonus remap is a very good incentive for a pilot to do anything i invision pilots who really need bonus remap to persuade their friends to help them get it or to hire a fleet of mercenariesthis will add some not isk oriented pve which will be very populareven with hardcore pvp players because everyone need remaps
i tell my new players to stick with it and use the circumstances that the war creates to figure out methods to mitigate its effect by adapting i set them up for it so they arent unprepared financially and they can take a few hits and through some trial and error most gain the experience they need now they hardly care if a wardec comes along they simply adapt and continue with whatever they want to dodifference with a lot of fresh corps run by new players is that i got the experience to teach my new players and they dont but from my experience it ultimatly comes down to an individuals attitude towards the situation they find themselves in i recruit my guys based on this attitude so it helps greatly but ive had some that slipped in that didnt have the right attitude and untill they change its hard on them dealing with warsthe op initially not wanting to drop his corp tells me he got the right idea he just needs to stick with it and get himself into a position to be able to try some things and figure out what works we all been there so we can relate most wt popping a noob will explain howwhy etc it happened if you askanyway wars are good it matures players into better ones
i concurreading the old threads on the same topic with the arguments from some of the pros their argument seem to mainly fall in the category that it would favor the prosthose who have iskreal money to spendso what we have are basically arguments from people who already have found all the optimal settings and tools to skill up optimally anyway and so the argument becomes in effect reality ye why change if it works for the few screw the rest as for the pay to win argument  as far as i can see its not at all necessary to make it isk based pay directly to change it  and the options are numerous and there can be no great income for ccp based on the errors of players who err here  on the contrary it will take them longer time to get to the ship that cost more and make them spend more on plex to buy more of the ships and module that require higher proficiency and are more expensive and income wise its really shooting yourself in the foot as a business if or when you make it more difficult for players to access more expensive assets anyway nogeneral example like the skill injectors give larger bonus to the new players w lower skills  new players can be given this option more often or within shorter timeframeswith greater frequency based on age  time in game etc or skillpoints or whatever other newplayer trait really at the very least one could give the newer players the option to reset it to a flat line if they find their mistakes have been too grieveouswhile this mechanic heavily penalizes the mistakes of the new player its benefits is equal for all after a while when optimized or like i said could be nerfed as skillpoints game time is increasing thus not giving any extra advantages to the pros as it is it just augments the pros already enormous head startas it is its just one gigantic penalty to the new player and a huge punishment for his or her lack of knowledgeinsighttime in game or stupidity if you will mine included there in ill happily admitfor those who never tinker much with the mechanic and just set the standard settings it is of course of little to no consequence but already people with tons of isk can buy ourouborus modules skill injectors etc so harping on about how dangerous extra remaps even just or enhanced for new players mostly are  is really a completely mute point at this stage a skill injector cancels out and far exceeds any benefit even a once a month remap the first year could ever add isk income proficiency experience and the wallet already rules supreme in all of this domain skill training  if at all unclearsincerely zid freemanyup its a nod to frank herberts dune in case you ever noticedfeature request user definable voice actor files
to be fair if youre making that argument you should probably stop abusing the ellipsis too op do you want meaningful pve content or meaningful pve content
hes right the main problem is that except for the epic arcs there are no great stories in eve i very fast stopped the wall of text for missions because there are no important informations i think there should be more stories and modern missions with animations voice etcwhy not ditch new players into a story that will take them month of skilling to fulfill maybe with triggers when he reaches the needed stats to complete them and with meaningful choices not just shooting x snakes but decisions thats a maine part of the success of the witcher that you have to make choices
is any csm member concerned about how the new f2p model can be abused by alts online game playand secondly does any csm member feel a main solo alpha clone account should be incentive by ccpregards a freelancerps should the possibility of selling cerebral accelerators boosters designed to boost the training speed of new players for aurumbe restricted to alpha clones only and if they are sold to omega clones for aurum does that fall within the grey area prerogative source
i think wardecs as a system should just be deleted tbqh if people want to gank in hisec then they need some risk too like guaranteed death and a total loss of sec status
first the space the op proposes already exists as its illegal to even bother new players in rookie systems along with a few other specialized places so great youve already got itsecond ganking is pretty rare in most 8  10 systems as concord is pretty fast the people getting ganked in the trade hubs are not new players but rather greedy players who undock with their lifes savings in an untanked industrial these people need to be destroyed so its not helpful to anyone to give them some immunitythird and this is the big one if ccp made 8  10 systems relatively immune to ganking you wouldnt be able to get near the asteroids for all the veterans hoovering up all the ore there would be even more massive bot fleets of mining ships than there already are working the relative safety of the highest security system its why the ice isnt there the new player in his venture or retriever wouldnt get a full cycle off before his rock disappears and if you dont like the guys taking all the ore before you can get any tough you cant wardec them because they are all in npc corps and you cant gank them because its against the rules the one thing you didnt really cover in your rather lengthy idea is why anything needs to be changed to make things safer danger is the nature of eve and the sooner a player realizes that the better chance he has of becoming a long term player frankly anyone who actually needs to be protected while playing in a significant portion of game space probably is going to quit once they venture into a scary 7 system and sees someone flashing red dont coddle the kids they need to learn to fight for what they get in eve by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
im answering this in a separate post because as clunky as the ops idea was it was sincere and deserved a polite answer even if contradictorybut this this deserves nothing but derision it shows a complete misunderstanding of what the new order or code which is only part of the no stands for what it does and how its fundedplease shoot the miners if they die its because they arent following the code as we instructed them clear out all those players who bought permits thinking they could return to their afk max yield mining habits if you kill them first you save us the expense of a catalyst to do it ourselves and the loss of our mining permit fees oh heavens how will we ever get by without our 10 million isk payments why without those we will have to fall back on our trillions of donations received from code supporters across all of eve or the trillions of loot that drop from the freighters mining ships and afk plex toting shuttles we blap daily at this rate we would be out of business in mere decadesas for the highsec miners they are already damned if they do and damned if they dont they choose to flying target ships in a pvp game they choose to delay fun now for some sort of fantasy fun they think they will have once they get enough isk together to get into pvp the only way to win at mining is to not do it whether you kill them or i kill them they are just as dead some portion of them will eventually decide to fight if history is any predictor they will decide to fight for us by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
many miners are against requiring the rorqorca to be on grid and provide boosts to only those ships withing a certain distancenot posting here to argue the pros and cons simply want to know if theres even one current csm member who will talk to ccp against this proposalthanks
still remember
many miners are against changes that put ships in space and expose them to the risk of exploding these people are unreasonably risk averse why should i be able to invest in an orca  pos and get a riskfree bonus to mining yield its a onceoff cost that makes mining better thats bad gameplay and its why ccp is removing it
as stated this post wants to know if any csm member will talk to ccp against the orcarorqual boosting proposal not rehash the pros and consminers are far from risk averse  we risk a great deal every day by putting squishy noncombat assets on the field its not risk aversion its risk management and under the proposal there is no way to adequately manage the risk of fielding a rorqual you cannot asses the risk to the rorq when it will be subject to attack by an opponent that could be of any number and variety meaning you cannot adequately predict and prepare a defense fleet to meet all comers in a pos the rorqual isnt at risk but neither is it receiving a benefit itself from boosting in fact its using heavy water at a decent rate to run the core costing its operator isk the rorq owners mining toons may be receiving the benefit but theyre at riskhow much risk do station traders accept industrialistsbut back to the point is there a csm member that will speak up to ccp against the proposed mining boosts changes
the new system is boosters on the grid so there is nothing the csm canwill do i will grant you that the mining system needs a twist to make it worth it to risk the rorq but ongrid boosters are out of reach for the csm someone on reddit made a calculation that its not worth to us a rorq for mining if you calculate the risks of loosing it he came up with about 810 hour constant core to get even in null
since the new system is still in the upcoming state it would seem that the csm could discuss the impact it will have on miners with ccp even if it was already in place they could voice the issues miners are raising
risk vs reward if you feel that its not worth the risk of putting a rorqual in to give boosts what ever extra it can also mine its self then you dont do it  you must feel that the mining amount is fine without the extra risk involved some not all miners have to use it will feal that the risk is worth it and they will use it some people dont feel its worth the risk using t2 barges over t1 and that is up to them other will and will then get to use it and will get the benifit of doing soyou are looking for all the benefits of using a rorqual without any risk
there are safe bets which prob dont make that much isk and then theirs long term market speculation which could go ether way they could make loads or loose everything just like rl tradersindi people risk things all the time like loosing freighters full of stuff its all part of the risk of doing it and some times they make bank and some times they loose all there stockyou are asking for a  35 mining boost to every single person in your fleet with zero riskpvp fleets will also have to risk there command ships on grid now with the changes some fitted and mindlinked command ships cost just as much as a rorqual does the fleet could deside its not worth the risk and not run links or they could take the chance and use them
as someone who has only recently begun to organize against high sec ganking i am interested in the outcome even if i am not yet qualified by results to participate if my point of view as to why players need to organize against high sec faux pvp is helpful then yes id like to attend
forum tearsanother cry baby ganker this one is one who always whines in every threadattacking those who pay extortion and those who request it will likely become very popular once the alphas hit industrialists will weed out those who are not helping against the blight of high sec faux pvp war decs are also a reasonable and more honorable way to discourage people from kneeling to extortionists the game is going to get more interesting when the alphas change the balance upon arrival
erm we do its called pandemic horde now i am not saying the op is not dumb and unless he has an idea for making it better he should just stfu but well yes he is and he shouldmissions are very dull your never going to be able to make it super exciting but dam anything thing that makes it more dynamic than warping into the same spot and killing the rats in the same order every single time because every mission is the same every single time would be good even doing the scanner exploration game thing at least is a bit dynamic i have no idea how it could be fixed but people that live in empire are the only real people that are propping up ccps bank to a point that they can keep the servers running and i do think more needs to be done to help them
hes simply stating that in a fleet you have the rest of the fleet to defend your expensive ships which is not the case in a mining fleet its also that the amount of riskreward must be good on a money making activity how high are your chances to loose your ratting carrier and do you have to nail it down for 5 minutes to get it do his workimho this is a perfect example for the limited fitting options on mining ships a fleet can now equip boosts in spare slots on frontline ships which mining ships just dont have or use a dedicated booster ship mining fleets dont have any optionsim all in for boosters on grid but the mining fleets have different options then normal fleets and ccp has to target this problem
1 a fleet does not always defend against alpha and just haveing your links vaporised2 why can the mining fleet not defend does not sound like a fleet to me3 why does the risk reward have to be goodbetter than something like a pvp fleet where there is no real incentive other than kill mails your reward is you get stuff out of thin air and you can calculate almost to the 001isk how much reward you are getting for doing something for 10mins 1h 10h 10 days what other activity can you calculate the rewards so accurately you can also calculate a worst case scenario where you send the whole fleet out to mine you get nothing and all get wiped out you can also calculate to the nearest 3mins exactly how long you have to mine to 100 pay for everything in the fleet i dont think there is anything you can do in this game to make isk that you can calculate the riskreward so accuratelyusing a rorqual to give bonuses has the same risk as using a dread you know how much the ship is worth and just the same as a dread all you are gaining by using one is time and time is the one thing you can calculate when mining and can also calculate how long you need to mine with the rorqual boosts to pay for the risk of losing it you can then calculate the likely hood of some fleet coming that you cannot deal with and then work out if its worth it4 only a few ships can use links not all of them no one is forcing you to use a rorqual to run links you can also just stick some mining links on a ferox just like a pvp fleet could put their links on a ferox to lower the cost risk of losing them vs a vulture or something you can have lower cost links which boost less or you can risk more and get more all very simple and nothing that a pvp fleet cannot or does not do also most pvp people dont have links trained so even if you were someone like pl you cannot just run a command ship fleet and say hay every single one of our ships has links now because it just does not work that way you will always have to have dedicated people flying dedicated ships that cannot really do much other than boost at least the rorqual has more roles than just give boosts while its there it can support other ships with reps it can mine stuff out of thin air just like the rest of the miners it makes isk on its own which also reduces the risk reward for using it you are in the mind set still that a rorqual does nothing but run links but they do so so so much more even now they can do more stuff than just run links and when the command changes come in they will be able to do loads loads loads more than just sit there running linkspvp fleet hay we could use these dreads to kill xxx but if we get dropped they will prob die or we can take some battleships it will take longer but there is less risk of been dropped and if we do get dropped we might be able to save some of the shipswe could use x and get z compleated in 10mins or we can use y and it will take 15minsmining fleet hay we could use a rorqual to boost but if we get dropped it will prob die or we can just run links on xxx or no links we will have to mine a bit longer but there is less risk of been dropped and if we do get dropped we might be able to save some of the shipswe could use a rorqual for links and we will make xxx in 30mins or we could use this ferox for links but we will have to mine for 6216546 longer to make the same isk
pvp fleet are for fun not for making money you have to compare with ratting or mission running a mining fleet cant defend ships because they dont have weaponsand how high are the chances that your dread gets nailed when it has to be 8h on the grid to be worth it
erm pl run pvp fleets for making money all the time merclifejust like ratting and mission running sometimes it is not worth the extra risk of using more expensive shipsfittings to just earn 110 more isk per tick which is why people use things like vnis for doing it and dont use officer fit t2 bssa 20bill isk mission running ship cannot really defend against been ganked either but some people still do it as they think its worth the 2 more isk per tic over something that is less likely to get ganked it seems you dont feel its worth the risk so dont use one use something else thats in your price range to run the links and because of the lower risk you get less isk its really really simple mathssaying your special snowflakes and mining is nothing like the rest of the game in any way so you need your own special rules to make it fair on you is just dumbyou want to field capital ships you want to field capital ships that give 3550 boosts to other ships that make isk and can also mine its self and make iskyou want to field capital ship that make isk and boost others isk making with no support and no riskyou want to field a capital ship that can make isk boost others isk remote rep others that are making isk and rep people who are trying to support it and that can also put a special shield around others making isk and has the tank of a triage which even some alliances in this game would not be able to brake and have no risk to using itwould you also like ccp to reduce the skill cap and build costs of it as well because i think this ability should be available to even new people to the game
a superficial assessment of risk management with respect to the rorqual sure some will solo mine in a rorqual but anecdotal nonsense doesnt make it good risk managementwhat were looking for is a change to the rorqual that makes risk management sense  not a panic button if it has to be on grid it needs to be able to fully boost without the industrial core running it needs to be able to move when necessary not just when ablethe changes we were hoping for the rorq had more to do with the clone vat ore compression and current trait benefits that didnt mean much not thisthose who operate rorqs risk a great deal with respect to their mining toons too bad if thats not enough for youbut ill say it again this post is simply asking if any csm member is going to talk to ccp about the mining boost changes on behalf of miners those who want to argue the merits need to go to the dev blog thread
maybe you should lead with we are hoping it gets a tweek to the clone vat ore compression and stuff when the rorqual is been looked at as at the moment these bonuses are not really used in modern eve rather than starting with we dont want them on grid for boosts thats all you asked for in your opand like i said you dont have to use a rorqual for boosts there are 17 other ships that you can use to give boosts they are a lower boost amount but cost less than 110 the price of a rorqual just like no one forced that guy that died today in a 1520bill isk officer fitted mission running ship for his 3 more dps and incomei mean whats wrong with the panic shield does it need to last longer does it need more range does it need to use less fuel to activate maybe you could diversify members in your corpalliance so there are people that like to pvp also so you have some back up or maybe make some other frends outside of your corpalliance just like everyone elce does even people that fight you might be willing to help if a 3rd party come just like pandemic horde today helped nc who every day kill horde members with a thing or the time any one helped any one else in this mmoi mean if all it comes down to is you dont like to have to siege to boost why not just use an orca thats cheaper provides some level of command boosts is moveable not sieged i would love if pl could use titans as command ships all the time to get there dank boosts but we cannot as its not worth the risk for the extra so do you know what we do we dont take the risk and go with a lower level command ship and miss out on the benefits i would also love if i could build a 30bill isk kronos and then go use it with a very low risk but thats not possiblepeople used to be able to out run missiles in hacs and now they cannot miners used to be able to have 100 safe links and not you cannot you also used to be able to aoe dd with a titan without the titan even been in the same system and now you can not things change every one is in the same boat all miners have the same problem some will risk it and maybe they get mad bank or maybe they all die some people will not risk it and will have to settle for a lower mining amount
its not completely clear to me why the rorquals fleet boosting role needs to be tied to the seige mode or whatever its called i forget no other boosting ship suffers this limitation
nor do i and yes that element seems a little off but the op was only asking for a csm to plead the case of 1 why does it have to be in a belt to boost and 2 only in a set km range of the rorqual when its in the belt
im more than happy to play devils advocate and i can agree not all parts of the change are perfect in my view and hopefully we can hammer those out but i cant in good conscience say i will oppose the changes if your goal here is to have ccp scrap the changes that wont happen if your goal is to have your voice and opinion expressed at the summit then you are in luck send me a well worded in game mail and we can go from there
it is a sad commentary on the role of the csm and the way players vote when a large block of players can at best hope for someone on the csm to play devils advocate on their behalfalthough i sincerely thank you for being willing to represent players who would otherwise have no voice on the csm i think the fact that the csm has no permanent voice of industrialists onboard is structurally a weaknessperhaps you might suggest to ccp that players should have category choices to vote for csm members high sec pve pvp low sec null sec rp industrialist anoikis fw and so on getting an actual cross section of what players do in eve wouldcould serve the players the csm and ccp much betterjudge your opinion is valued since you are the only member of the csm to respond to this request for representation in this thread
or maybe members of the csm have taken on board that something might need a look at but feel on the whole it doesnt require such a long discussion and how do you even know that industrialists arent represented just because somebody is in a pvp alliance does not mean that they also dont run large industrial jobs or small industrial jobs or mine or station trade or any of the other industrial type activities
does the concept of stakeholder groups having seats at the csm table scare you that much exactly what are you afraid of is it the concept of people being represented by people who share their interestssomehow i suspect there might be some difference in point of view from a full time industrial player and a pvp null sec alliance fc that perhaps possibly does some mining from time to timeperish forbid the thought that an industrialist might actually add something to the mix of fresh ideas right
interesting that the high sec gankers are the biggest opponents of this change of restricting production only to lower security space where they never gosounds like they are tearing up because the use of boosters will make their targets a little tougher to gank in the time they have before concord kills them they are afraid a little risk might be injected into their current sure thingtheir forum tears are quite interesting obviously anything that might offset their balancing act scares the hell out of them towards that end i am going to distribute drugs that boost shields in systems that have a high gank kill total and see if we can rebalance the scales going to build a lot of warp stabs also giving them as gifts deterrents will cause a little rippleone of the good thing about being a builder i can decide to gift anything i can make and trust me that is a loti will post a thread on the results if we can get ganks to fail more often making it a little more dangerous in high sec for gankers fits right inline with eve philosophy or at least as it should be no guaranteed results when you undock just risk danger and the possibility of getting what you want done
need to get some feedback on this proposal especially from csm membersdmc
i think you are forgetting that some of the larger scale pvp alliances have massive industrial infrastructure backing them upin pl we have teams of people who do nothing but the industrial side of things mercenary coalition back in the day were a huge industrial machine able to produce everything they ever needed from mining the ore and moon goo to the construction of the titans hundreds and thousands of people working together for an alliance yes there are people out there that do nothing but industry and are not on the csm but that does not mean their voices are not represented how miners mine can have very big consequences to the way alliances like pl or goons operateeven if a csm member is a null sec alliance fc does not mean that he is not privy to the information of industrial activities and would not have advisers in those types of thingsome might say that the people that only do industry and have no real contact with pvp alliances are at the disadvantage in being able to balance things not the other way round
i think it would be reasonable to bring back mining signatures with these changes
standing fleet to respond to your panicked calls even if they are ratting watching local intel systems the 45 hour payback on the rorqual investment isnt that long and should be part of your calculations anyway i seem to recall pressing the UFFFDsiegeUFFFD button on my moros yesterday i got really good value in the form of a tenfold increase in dps and paid for it with being stuck in place for a few minutes having said that i dont really understand why boosting is the effect of the rorquals siege cycle why not give the ship immense mining yield for the duration of the cycle no other boosting ship suffers the penalty of immobility a direct mining yield would feel much better for the user
will dothanks
i honestly think that industrialists do have a voice on this csm be it members like myself who are yes in a large nullsec alliance but also help manage massive industrial production and mining or members like steve in high sec or sullen who put together the industrial capital round table aimed at talking about the changes to mining boosts mainly i wouldnt be too hard on the other csms for not replying because in all honesty they probably havent seen the thread i arrived in iceland on thursday 4 days before the summit starts while most of the other csm members are either traveling as i type or getting ready to leave their homelands to come to this volcanic rock in the middle of the oceaneveryone deserves a voice we all play eve people shouldnt get too tied down to where the person is from but rather how well they can listen and communicate so as to represent you as a player and customer properly
some might say the exact opposite is what we have now and it does not work very well for industrialists so we can choose between your hypothetical and the in game current reality easy choice for me but i respect your right to search for explanations that will reinforce your conclusions
i appreciate your response i do not hold it against the other csm members i simply am glad you were tuned in you speak of the massive industrial needs of the big alliances which all industrialists who play the game know has to exist the culture in game acts as if industrial production is not an integral part of the game design perhaps if some on the csm spoke out against this false premise and articulated that industrialists play an important role beyond beind easy targets industrialists would feel representedsince that is not yet the majority stated position of the current csm i think a system that would insure that players who primarily focus on industrial game play could have a designated position on the csm would serve the game and all its players better
i hope the csm has a very productive summit it is an exciting time to be involved in this game changes are coming fast and some are making things better i have confidence that overall the csm shares my desire to make the game better where ever they can and i support their efforts to balance all the multiple communities of interest that compose the eve player universe i am optimistic that a better system of representation will one day be implemented and be more reflective of the diverse community of players and play styles
can we have ship module show info with hover over icons similar to those shown against the module in market viewthe market view states whether a module selected can be fitted to the active ship with sufficient cpupower gridthe show info view does not seems a small askcheers
another mechanic that creates many frustrating situations without adding meaningful complexity or positive gameplayhaving to travel 30jumps in an interceptor so you can buy a skill having to clonejump to highsec and be stuck there for 20 hours or having to wait for somebody to bring you the skills from highsec with the next jf run so you are able to actually play the game is not meaningful choice nor creating content its only frustrating and unfunintegrate the skill market straight in the character sheet add a buy skill button on every skill and detract the amount of isk from the wallet voilUFFFD youve just fixed another feature apparently designed to kick the newbie in the teeth and burn out the veteran player this kind of procedures create the eve learning cliff not the complexity of the mechanics or the gameplay lets work to turn that cliff into a curve
jump clone fatigue is a feature that creates many situations where the smart move is not to play the game just a few exampleswant to enjoy a little pve in the morning but if i clone jump i wont be at the staging for tonights fleet ill just play overwatch insteaddoing an exploration run on the other end of the cluster ping pops up to get in fleet if i go ill be unable to come back here and keep exploring crap ill have to get in fleet but just log off after the op because what i really want to do now is exploration not ratting and im 19 hours away of jumping back to my exploration shipwant to help the newbros in lowsec learn some pvp again if i clonejump there i wont be here for tonights coalitionwide operation sorry newbrosi understand unlimited free clonejump has issues but the current system has the biggest issue possible people not playing the game at times because of it
honorable lolif many highsec residents cant be bother to even tank their industrial ships or do one of the many other things that make you near invulnerable in highsec with only a tiny amount of effort or even pay attention to their eve client what makes you think they will start using alpha clones to start attacking other players and if they do and are successful they will be attacking other industrialists who are not following the new halaima code of conduct even if they have a permit as bing described above which means they are effectively doing the new orders work players that follow the code are immune to attack and thus have nothing to fear from such actions do you see now why the code always wins best we get you set up with a permit now and get you compliant if you are planning to start a career enforcing the code on an alpha clone once you have that we can give you some tips on how best to gank or wardec industrialists to get you startedbut as to the op no new players already have the rookie systems to learn the interface and get started on the game if you want to expand that or add some expanded protected area as part of a new npe i have no problem with that as long as it is completely economically useless or even walled off to existing veteran players that means no rewards whatsoever that will affect the greater eve economy no industry no missions no anomalies no playerowned stations no ore no trading  nothing any content there cannot reward anything of real value outside of that space and only should exist to train true new players highsec is already saturated with veteran players abusing concord protection to gather resources and do industry even safer space to hide in will just result in riskavoiding veteran players moving in and outcompeting the new players for the resources there
1failure to deliver a pve worthy of all the backstory and the excellent lore has haunted ccp and this game for 13 years and its probably the biggest reason why user count will never really take off until addressed

honorable yes clearly a concept you are not familiar withlet me guess why you always win  could it be you are afraid to fight anyone who can fight back and all your targets are unarmed oh be very proud little high sec faux pvp fan boi

faction warfarehopefully it is at least considered when the clone states are discussed
its up to the csm to bring neglected subjects to ccps attention its up to the players to let csm members know what they think is neglected
the item i would like to propose is a security log of who took control of citadel weapons or who accessed certain hangars either in stations or in citadeli am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im sorry that this is somewhat of a duplicate post in another forum but someone really should sticky a post indicating the areas that each csm member is more focused on i didnt know which csm member to send this to feel free to redirect this thread as neededlets face it the game mechanics for weapon accuracy and damage are not obvious for new players and even many that are not so old and even if you understand those mechanics it is still difficult to know whether your weapons are doing maximum damage while in the heat of battle because there are too many factors for which to account projectile weaponsrange  optimal falloff and out of rangetracking speed radians per second versus transversal speed of targetmissile weaponsflight range versus rangevector of targetexplosion radius versus signature radius of targetexplosion velocity versus velocity of target of targetthat is a lot of information for a person to memorize recall and estimate while doing everything elsein the end it always comes down to comparing predetermined sets of data is the target too far too fast or too smallthats basically all that the player needs to worry about yes i know can be a bit more complex than that but it is close enough my idea is that there should be an optional visual aid added around weapon module icons in the hud here is a hasty exampleweapon effectiveness indicatorsif something like that but less ugly were used it would drastically reduce the amount of confusion that new players experience while in combat all they would have to do is look at the module to understand how effective the weapon will be against the target
this comment makes me longing for a dont like button
wardecs are fine they just dont follow the paradigm of eve at all  with risk brings opportunity for reward without a mechanic for the defender to force an end to the war outside of surrendering the best bet for wardeccers is simply to have 300 active decs at all times for example if you needed to have a citadel mod that could only be fitted to fortizars or higher for your wardecs to be active deccers would have some skin in the game and deccing couldnt be so capricious as there may actually be a consequence to the war with nothing to defend and no commitments the mechanic is just lame get some skin in the game
missions that work against main factions are just a pain if your are not running for the pirate factions mission runners avoid them like cancer and they are a good way for noobs to shoot their standing to hell they really dont serve for anything because the loss of standing to one faction outweights any increase on the other side to get standing up again is a boring grindeven shooting the standing to hell in fc war doesnt really serve any means because you most likely have another char that is doing work you cant do yourself anymore and after the fc war you need the long grind to get faction standing up again where is the fun in doing x level one missions when you can easily do level 4 its just a grind to get free from the faction policecapsuleers are mercenaries lorewise and everyone knows that these will fight you one day to help you out the next no real bad feelingsmaybe the csm could look into this part of the game which is just annoying in every way without really creating roleplaying content and i dont count agents simply not talking to you as content
you you can just not do them
good idea if you know what they are doing to your standing but why are they here when 999 of all players avoid them like plague for good reasons teasing noobs
i dont know wasnt ccp affinity musing last year that she didnt think standings were consequential enough and that you shouldnt be able to be positive with all the factions it doesnt seem like there are many consequences for your slaughtering of thousands of npcs to benefit one of the empires as it is seems like a better solution is to only allow antifaction missions in highsec so that players have to make consequential choices of who they side with it makes sense that the empires would be more concerned with battling their neighbours than sending capsuleers off on police or antipirate duty and how do these npc pirates get into highsec anyways when i infallibly have the faction police on me seconds after entering 05 security system if you want to fight pirates in antipirate missions you should have to go to lowsec closer to where they live to get these missions
why not but you need much better options to raise your faction standing again the problem is the inparity in gainingloosing faction standing if you could raise it as fast as loose there would be no big problem but for noobs with just one char most of the trade hubs will be unaccessable and they will be quickly killed by any gate gun what wouldnt be a big problem for vet will be a great problem for noobs
what about tags and lp stores without antifaction missions

i know full well what they do to standing im one of the 05 who prefer being able to make 20b in a few weeks to caring what empire facpo think of me
thats a good point that the op should have a think about while i tend to agree with black pedros post and affinitys thoughts if ccp were to remove all the antifaction missions they would need to do a big pass on the lp stores as many items need navy insignias
lorewise capsuleers are mercenaries which are paid for a job so ccp would just have to remove the negative standing effect which would lorewise mean that the main faction accept that there are no personal aka standing feelings involved like amaar has no problems with us shooting amaar ships in the purity eventfw or working for pirate factions may be something else lorewise so there the faction standing losses make sense
actually both are true
first of all the code is flawless so there are no problems with itsecond wow ive been asked to stop thousands of times while bumping miners ive stopped because someone asked me to zero the whole point of bumping someone is to get them to do something they dont immediately agree to like buy a permit does it make any sense that it would go down likeme bump buy a mining permitminer well nothing actually because they are afkme bump this is new order territory all miners must have mining permits and follow the codeminer sits 50 km away from the ice for a while lasers off just sitting afkminer whame bump buy a permitminer please stop bumping me  i added the please part they dont actually say pleaseme ok sorry see you laternotper ccp the miner can make an effort to move to another location and if the bumper follows them it can be harassment they later clarified this to mean several jumps away to me several is 20 or more its never been tested as far as i know in any case ive bumped a miner for hours as he obstinately refused to buy a permit and stubbornly kept trying to mine i know ive had enough petitions filed against me that i have my own little folder at hq up in iceland but i havent been warned suspended or banned for bumping someone who asked me to stopof course now miners dock up when i enter system so theres much less bumping by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
i would vote to keep missions standings like they are right now because they reflect the conflict of new eden but i would add a warning in the mission description or a separate notification about the standings drop
even i personally dont give a flying  about pve and lp stores in global this seems like logical and legit request why should some hardcore carebears have access to stuff the other hardcore carebears doesnt makes no sense whatsoever on the other hand how many things in eve actually make sense
i dont think that is the case though since the only players doing such a thing in the game are antiganking and i dont think they get banned for it they even have a whole channel and website devoted to following us around in highsec no matter where we go luckily they are pretty bad at the game and have no negative effect on my gameplay so it does not feel like griefing
i dont think that is true these antigankers that you refer to are within their rights to shoot players that are kos or flagged as criminals did you forget your coffee
any notes or dare to set an eta on that 
op please understand this as you can see from some of the cynical responses this is why this cool game has problems getting and keeping new players just cause those that be feel the need to keep it harsh and cold and all that bsi think if you asked the csm how to get players and keep them playing and paying theyd blow their veins out honestlythe wardec system is very broken it is theres loopholes in it which can end up having a regular corp to be endlessly wardec back to back all you have to do basically its been broken and they know it just like other parts in this game are completely broken which gets pushed away cause they just dont know what to deal withwill eve online ever get back up to the numbers she once had thats the main question everyone is waiting for an answer onbut we all know the answer already just by taking a quick snapshot at its forums most of the time
speaking as a member of a large and relatively solvent alliance being able to purchase wardec immunity would be extremely convenient for uswhat other immunities might we be able to purchase one example that springs to mind is that many of us have very low gallente and minmatar standings owing to years of farming angel missions buying immunity to the faction police would be very handyalso i dont really like having to make isk it isnt my playstyle and it compromises my freedom i guess its ok having to do it once but i dont see why i should regularly be forced to do something i dont want to how about if i could purchase immunity from ratting pay 1b receive 100m per month income im not greedy a couple of bill a month would be ample for me
i talked about following around and not simply shooting other players wasnt that obvious probably
csmim after the summit so this may be after the point and an old topic but i would encourage a look at bumping in eve please consider 1 if one were to impact or ram anothers vessel in reality it would most certainly be considered a hostile act 1a i get it eve is not reality 1b should bumping be a concordable offense 2 sometimes people get bumped by friendlies on purpose to help align time 2a exempt criminal status when in a fleet with the impacting vessel 3 sometimes newbros accidentally bump other players 3a can there be a way to have a box pop up that says vessel impact detected and give options of forgive or report 3b in this way afk players could still be codedthanks for all you dojoe
when will the csm summit notes be posted or are you saving all that info for october and vegas
with the new alpha clones coming will ccp look at balancing the skill the new free to participate f2p clones get level 3 but you only need tohave it at level 1 to use 1 and 2 and 3s and some t2 implants only require level 2source
this is not just about learning implantsas for the question ccp probably havent decided yeta case by case basis might work when we are talking about ccp intervention but someone is going to login on a character that used to be an omega with implants fitted that alphas cant use then eves code is going to have to decide what to do on the spot possible responses include  let the implant work give former subscribers an advantage over people who have never subscribed  leave it plugged in but nonfunctional now the former subscriber needs to decide between destroying the expensive implant or having an implant slot that they cant use  lock the character  crash the client  crash the servermy guess is that the implant will remain operational punishing people for subscribing is a good way to convince them to never subscribe again it should be obvious why the last three options are undesirable
i will be extremely surprised if the large majority of implants do no continue to work i would expect the only exception to be some kind of edge case producer scenario where the implants allowed the alpha character to be somehow way too effective at welath generation no one cares about t1 cruisers having hg slaves or whatever
wtb a clone bay that works without a delay oh wait we have those alreadyeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
whats the problem with deathcloning
this problem is frequently trivialized if you learn2therathat aside if theres only one thing youre willing to do at any given time and youre going to log off if you cant do that one thing thats something thats just going to have to be regarded as acceptable collateral damage because the alternative is far worse
as you know one of the best ways that maintaining modules on overload is splitingfor example when i want to fit two turrets on three high slot the best way is U25CFU25CBU25CF instead of U25CFU25CFU25CBhowever when i fit turrets on imperial navy slicer like that the ship is not symmetricalsome people does not think it matter but other people like me who want to appreciate ships looks it is really matterso what i want to your team is just reallocate the turrets slot or position locationat now1st slots turret is allocated on ships lefttop and rightbottom2nd slots turret is allocated on ships righttop and leftbottom3rd slots turret is allocated on ships middle and both bottomi want you to replace them like that1st slots turret is allocated on ships lefttop and right top or leftbottom and rightbottom2nd slots turret is allocated on ships leftbottom and right bottom or lefttop and righttoplast 3rd slots turret is allocated on ships middle and both bottomit can be a trivial thing but i really want to see symmetrical and powerful  can endure the heat from overload  navy slicersincerely your games fan

update on csm notes release ccp please
hey guysunfortunately ive been indisposed and out of office for a bit so the minutes have had a bit of a delay im aiming to try and have them out by the end of this weekccp logibro  eve universe community team  distributor of nanites  patron saint of logistics
that sucks hope you get better soon im looking forward to reading them if it helps when i get sick i often try to treat it with multiple doses of bourbon whiskey it doesnt make me get better any faster but it makes me care less about feeling bad just throwing that out there
see
i dont have problems with the time but with stopping the skill queue there is imho no reason because it works on death too you pick up at the speed your new body allows eve just needs to recalculate the learning speed even if you loose 10 sec for the recalculation its much easier then stopping and starting the skill queue
ganking has no real disincentive the overall consequence is marginal for the value generated kb stats etca few thoughtsincrease the criminal flag timer possibly in a way similar to jump fatigue ie on a sliding scale for high sec attacks make it substantial so that death has a consequence in high sec set it for days for negative sec status players this would work well with npc corp gankers the perk here would be that a genuine high sec blunder by newb would have a fairly insubstantial penalty while a habitual criminal would be slowed in hisher frequency to gank however the basic gank mechanic would be unchanged coordinating a gank is not easymake it cost zero isk to war dec corporations with over all bad security standings this would work on a meta incentive corp kb stats and allow high sec players to proactively attack ganker corps who currently enjoy high sec protections when massing or otherwise performing movements to setup a high sec gank
why should it have a disincentive new eden was specifically designed as a fulltime pvp sandbox with no safe spaces why should intended game play be discouraged through disincentives but regardless the consequences for being a highsec criminal are extremely harsh so harsh that most players at least highsec residents used to their npcenforced safety flat out refuse to ever commit a criminal act the consequences for becoming an outlaw prevent the pirate from doing anything at all in highsec but constantly moving about in small ships no pve no other pvp no resource gathering or even just acting as a scout in space even for nonoutlaws illegal aggression earns you a 30day kill right that forfeits your free npcenforced safety blanket which many players are not willing to give up i would say that is not marginalwhat is marginal is the value you say they earn killboard stats are not valuable UFFFD they have no direct ingame impact on the game killmails the same they are just a record of an event they may motivate some players but they have no effect on the game itself even things of real value ingame like say the cargo of an overloaded freighter are not generated by ganking those assets are just transferred from one player to another as a consequence of a pvp encounter this is not just a semantic distinction risk vs reward is an important idea to balance resource generation in a singleuniverse sandbox game generating resources like isk and minerals into the universe devalues everyone elses resources balancing the effort and risk of generating things against the risk of loss and vulnerability to the other players is necessary to prevent hyperinflation and to give meaning to these industrial activities and to generate content piracy has none of these issues UFFFD it only destroys virtual items while creating content from a purely economic view it is only a good thing as it stimulates the economy why should ccp lock out players from playing the game as they intend for it to work its doesnt seem wise to straightout mechanically bar your paying customers from playing the game as you built and sold it to them if ccp decides they dont want players shooting each other in highsec wouldnt it be easier to just lock out the ability to illegally activate weapons against other players in highsec then the pirates could at least go on and do something else in the game other than sit in a station unable to undock for most of their game time outlaws are already freetoshoot and enjoy no highsec protections you dont need a wardec at all UFFFD just go shoot themthis isnt really the thread to rehash the one more nerf and it will now be balanced debate the roundtable is i assume over as is the csm summit however i will point out that the existence of highsec piracy is very much intended by ccp the fact another player can attack you in highsec is not an oversight or exploit but an intended profession and feature of the game which ccp developers spent significant development time coding into the game whether or not you think it fair other players have the option of accepting the consequences of illegal aggression and exploding you and taking your stuff they can do that for ingame profit for intangibles like a killboard as part of a greater sandbox cause or just for fun it is up to you to use one of the many tools ccp has given you to protect yourself from them and this is where you should focus your concerns about ganking if you have any UFFFD the fact you can be attacked is not a problem and completely intentional but if you feel there are not sufficient tools to mitigate and counter those attacks that would be of valid concern to the game developers they have deliberately made you content like they have of all of us as that is the game so i suggest you play that game and use the many methods provided to mitigate the risk from other players instead of coming to the csm and asking them to petition ccp to tilt their pvp game in your personal favour at no cost or effort for yourself that is just a waste of time for all concerned
from a pvp perspective the risk is disproportionate between players ill skip detailing this for brevitys sake i said metaincentives because intangibles like kb stats kms etc are partial motives that incent player behavior  these are indicators of ones sense of success or failure the argument that the game is functioning as intended is problematic for a game like eve there is an extended argument here one could make about change control and functionality and unintended functionality but its tough discussion because of the sandbox nature  which means shoring up high sec mechanics such that high sec behaves as a more secure space than low sec or null sec is also a valid input into game play high sec mechanic are fair game for change just like other parts of the game high sec ganking is an insightful minmax assessment of game logic but numerous changes which are cumulative in nature make it difficult to distinguish between performing as intended and unbalanced the lack of proportionality in the risk between gank play style and high sec nongank play style is both an innovative insight in how to play the game but also one that characterizes high sec as something it is not
highsec is most certainly high security it is not safe security as you seem to imply but it never was intended to be high security space is exactly that highly secure red frog freight makes 9983 of its deliveries ccp quants numbers show that destruction in highsec makes up 02 of the value goods importedexported from the various highsec regions and that is from all causes not just ganking the chance of you losing a ship to criminals is extremely small under most circumstances probably approaching zero if you stay at your keyboard and spend any effort to defend yourself the few situations that put you at great risk UFFFD making yourself a valuable target by carrying too much cargo for instance UFFFD are completely within your control and these risks are easily mitigated by various fits ships or behaviours i am not sure how much safer you want highsec to be before you consider it high security a 0001 chance of losing a ship 000001 actually i do know the answer zero you wont be happy until nonconsensual pvp is not possible in highsec if that is the case i can only say that you should consider whether a pvp sandbox game that features nonconsensual pvp everywhere by design is really the game for youin any case this has nothing to do with the op so i am done here present your ideas in the appropriate forum if you wish to continue a discussion
what i am arguing for is a proportional degree of risk if you read my original post i was not calling for a change in the mechanic the risk becomes proportional as an expression of time currently within this power dynamic the assets at risk between players is not equitable longer criminal flags decrease the frequency in which the behavior can easily occur unless the ganker invests more resources accounts train times alts etc that investment then is similar in the sunk cost that to that of the target that is equitable without changing the actual play style and importantly the trader  hauler playstyle has a different domain of risk than a gank playstyle ill skip the elaboration here but these risks also make this less of an applestoapples comparison
since they claim they cannot be beaten join them just start another permit organisation then another and several more mix it up and charge 2mil a month just abuse it until it is declared a broken mechanism it does not matter about tank  because bumping does not care and is perfectly legal even an alpha clone can do it
this idea of combat ships attacking non combat ships is a part of the problem all indy type ships are designed so that they perform in a task with no though of combat to fix a lot of these issues just make all indy ships mining trade whatever combat effective even if it is only really good at defensive combat hell make it offensive if you want but do this and let it stiff perform its intended role there would be no reason that any race of people who were under constant threat of attack would not adjust there ship building techniques to reflect the change in there universe to better perform and provide a harder target we see this in our own historical evolution of warfare start back with sticks and stone to atomic age weapons and now into unmanned weapon platforms how is it that in eve we still have mining barges and freighters with no thought about defensive or offensive armamentsseriously like wth if miners traders andor care bears were able to have combative styled ships of their professions then there would be less issue with an unfair gank and more of an issue of learn to playfix the ships and you will go a long way with fixing a lot of issuesnote i know that some will say that the shields and such are defensiveya surebut when you cant do anything but sit there and wait until your shields are drained or gone that is not a form of active defense it is a horrible passive and not something anyone would use as a primary defense it is only a partial method after all of the ship rebalances and new systems that ccp has added the last change made to indies way the mining barge nerfadjustment which ever way you want to look at it force them to want to upgraded into a bigger and better ship that still performs its desired task but make it capable of either putting up a fight or give it some sorta ewar bonus to confuse its attacker so it can safely disengage after all the wars and such i think someone would have made a safer or more combat oriented ship for trade and mining and this would force indies to get their butts into combat oriented mindsets as in order to get into these ships they would have to learn some combat skills and such and then everyone is happyyes either the ship would perform poorly at the combat or at the assigned indy task i know that is the most likely result you would say not really we have tons of multi role ships that perform combat very well and their intended roles extremely well indy ships could do the same and not break anything in game
no ship used for hauling should be as combat effective as a ship designed exclusively for combat
snipno ship used for hauling should be as combat effective as a ship designed exclusively for combatwhyi see so many reasons that others have posted in so far as to why highsec players are targeted is that because this is eve and pvp is eve and that care bears and what not need to not think eve it is a solo game however by getting combat oriented industrial ships the first response is no that should not happen why not  seriously this would make the whole targeting of industrials fun right it would get everyone into a more combat oriented playstyleagain why not because it would make it harder to gank themno that just means tactics would change and it would definitely make them more lucrative with the mods being dropp other than mining upgrades trust me gankers are gonna gank if you look at all high sec combat i would think you would see that industrial ships are likely in 75 or possibly greater of those incidentsmy question is why wouldnt they have combat oriented ships in such a dangerous professionwe used to have some cruisers and battle ships back in the day that were used to mine in not sure but those got reworked for other stuff its not like its a new concept im not saying making it the best mission runner or make it the best gang support or even the best in group ganking or solo ganking i am however saying making it proficient in its role and combat but it can choose to accell in either a defensive posture or a indy role but not both at same time just as you can not go full tank and full dps in any ship or what ever there is no need to make a hauler or a miner that is better than current ships out there who are combat role specific but you do not have a single ship out there either that is best in all each ship has its role where it is good great and some time op lets do the same with a new industry line or some thing let them have a choice as everyone else does right now indies dont ever single hauler except the gallente now have exactly the same ships with different looks miners suffer from this too we cant go out and try to build cool new builds because the ships are old outdated relicsthe only reason that i think this is not something always thought of is because every game so far that i have seen other than some rts that have space combat is that industry ships have always been non combativebut so what this is eve and anyone who has visited or lived here knows combat is eve and that is why i dont think eve should allow itself to be dictated by old none eve concepts combat is in every part of eves creative life blood but why is it not in the indy side of the game it should be
the minutes for csm 11 summit 1 are now released and can be found here
i aprove this service and  or productevent website wwweventuk blog
i tried to click on the first link for the store  got rickrolled  laughed  boss noticed and i had to go back to workthanks ccp now i have to work instead of reading the minutes lolon lunch break now so that is why i posted here
two quick things is the rookie ship ganking just cynos getting popped is ccp still blissfully ignorant that some starter schools hello cas have actually built real communities despite the 10 tax and lack of support re there was then some discussion on the retention statistics based on the race and school they choose with certain schools having higher retention ratesnyjils corollary to malcanis law any attempt by ccp to smooth the learning curve of eve online will be carried out via the addition of extra factors and features such that there is a net increase in complexity
i killed at the wh meeting just saying
for the love of god pleaseon the part about adding more duel statics idk if that is a good thing when c4s got it whs were almost killed for us as any seance of isolation was lost the most intense times i can remember having in eve was in our c4 with a null static and sometimes going weeks wo any connections to wh or empire at one point we only manage to get fuel into our tower with 12hrs left to go
i mean i guess we finally got some sort of confirmation from ccp that jump fatigue isnt working entirely right but at the same time its been nearly 3 years without any major changes regardless of frequent passes being promised
you represented wh space very well despite that im dissatisfied with the lack of responses to the issuessuggestions that were raised unless they are hidden behind an nda wall
mrhyde nerf nullification buff gatecamps so people do more camping  lol
this is so truepos vulnerability and timing was and still is working perfectly fine i have no idea why they took it away everyone set citadel timers to the weakest tz for possible attackers weaponized boredome at its finest furthermore killing a pos requires 2 engagements  time of the first one is chosen by attacker time of the second  by defender which is fair now it is  how many 3 i never even bothered to find out all of those timers are defined by the defender seriously i can understand forming 1 alarmclock cta but 3 of those to kill even the smallest undefended citadel and if were only 15 minutes late  all is in vane that is hilariously broken
my suggestion for citadel engagement rules  keepstar is fine as it is  fortizar should be always vulnerable and have 2 timers  shield and armor  astrahus should be always vulnarable and have 1 timer for shield just like ye olde pos
you appear to of forgotten to add minutes from the lowsec round table
were judging an incomplete system citadels are not what we are supposed to be fighting over they are just the only piece in place atm they are meant to be tough and this minutes has confirmed that you will get closer to what you want with the iskmaking structures
believe me when i say thisthe only reason astras are surviving in highsec at all is that theyre a massive pain in the arse for a 2bil kmmost of the time having a crappy timer is quite literally their only defense because no one will bother defending them
this  did ccp just say nothing  wh space is getting very empty especially in non eu tzs alot of that is because of risk and time vs reward this applies equally to pvp and pvewh merc services in au tz citadel defense  offense more details see forum post  link
