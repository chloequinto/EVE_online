"i don't steal/scam from people in my corp or alliance. e-honor is such a burden.to the point of the op:scamming and outright theft are part of the dystopian universe that is eve online. so are murder, backstabbing, betrayal, treason, and bullying. the game is not that way by accident, considering it's been ongoing for 10 years.also, there is no real monetary value associated with isk. that's like saying monopoly money has a real value because you bought the boxed game with your credit card. you paid for a service from ccp when you bought the plex. that service is the right to connect to the game server for 30 days. the plex item is simply a representation of the service owed to you (in that sense it's like a token at a video arcade - you traded your money for token to be able to play the games - but the tokens themselves have no real world value). as an in game asset you are free to trade the plex for any other in game asset at an exchange rate determined by the in game market. but like every other in game asset, they have no out of game value. the only thing involved that has any real world value is your time, and presumably you agree you are getting an equitable trade for that time, or you'd go do something else.if you propose that in game items have a monetary value, you should be able to use them as a normal medium of exchange. so unless you can buy a cheesburger and a beer for a fully fit tengu, your argument fails to hold any water."
"sovereignty has always been a pain in the ass for everyine in nullsec and ccp... it doesn't have to be though.the one massive problem has been that it's always been based around a structure grind. first posses and now sbu's, all things that don't really need any presence.i say, remove all structure based sovereignty and base it entirely around activity. if an alliance manages to form at least 60-80% (to be determined) of all activity in a system for a week, they gain sovereignty of it. activity can be defined as follows, from the least impact to the most:influence. see below. basic presense. be present in the system. the more pilots spending more time in a system, the more activity you produce. cloaked ships do not count as any activity! construction. manufacturing items in pos or stations. putting down pos (doing nothing else with it) also goes here. moon mining. belt activity. (ice) mining, belt rats, the lot. anomalies. capital ship construction in pos. construction of outposts. pvp kills! pvp kills over the past x days are tallied up: more kills (final blows from players) generate more activity.activity accrues over time, retaining the level 1 through 4 for a given system. massive pvp action can swing activity in favor of another party, making war a viable option to switch it. however, to retain sovereignty, one must remain active! system level and the amount of time where sovereignty is held also produce influence around the system, ala the eve sovereignty map. this makes it so that fringe systems do not need to be actively pursued around the clock, but still gives smaller alliances room to manouver into a part of space.this system also allows smaller alliances to claim a part of space without being overrun by larger alliances almost immediately - sovereignty is no longer a matter of plonking down an sbu, you no longer need a pure capital ship force to take over systems, making invasions by smaller alliances much more feasible aswell as them simply taking unused portions of space.this system also means that travelling to another part of the universe for a prolonged time means you may have to give up sovereignty back home, since you will be much less active there. this makes cross galactic wars much less common and much harder to maintain. this combined with the possibility for smaller alliances to take unused space means that conflict may become much more common and local.renting out space is still possible, a new standing might be created where the renter doesn't generate any activity for themselves. in return, they get (full or partial) access to the system and generate activity for the landlord.freespace alliance could retain their sov due to surrounding system influence (as most freespacers will not generate enough activity over multiple systems to affect this), but they could also enact a system-wide tax which generates activity in their favor. this would apply to bounties and refining at least, possibly also a fee for pos maintenance. this would apply to neutral and higher standings towards the sov holder: negative standings don't \"pay tax\" but are also unlikely to be able to dock in stations/outposts, nor survive for very long in the first place unless they're in invader, in which case they have to be able to generate competing activity anyway. another mechanic to enforce open space would be to have it declared as such, but tax has to be paid to concord.the pvp mechanic could be enforced by a dominance system. a tug-of-war style system where dominance goes from 50/50 to 0/100 or 100/0 for the parties involved (all attackers vs the sov holder). the more dominance one has, the less activity one generates by more kills, this also prevents abuse of the pvp activity by repeatedly killing a pet corp in newbie frigates for example since they will not generate dominance activity in return and will cap out very soon.continued in part 2..."
"part 2since capital ships are no longer the sole factor determining sovereignty, guerilla warfare suddenly becomes an effective way to wage war aswell! defenders are no longer relegated to fleeing to empire or playing station games with little to no effect, they can actually affect the war if they play it right! this also goes for offense: large empires cannot ignore smaller invaders anymore. if unchecked, they can severely hamper their activity ratings in systems. this further incentivizes only taking systems you will actually use, rather than spamming sbu's/posses everywhere you can.to ccp: i strongly believe that this will not take away points of conflict. since the activity system encourages actual activity, conflicts will arise at the points of interest in a system: mission areas, anomalies, asteroid belts and moons, aswell as stations. since pvp activity is still the most valuable people will still be engaging one another, only there's little to no incentive to blob each other out depending on the size of the organizations waging war on each other, making warfare far more dynamic.current structures only incentivize vast blobs, the entire organization gathered in one place to simply force their advantage in numbers with little to no thought behind tactics or strategy, nor any worry about having to defend their own territory while attacking. spreading out points of conflict together with incentivizing smaller empires because of the activity system will generate enough points of conflict, as furthermore smaller empires will move into nullsec thus increasing the likelyhood of conflict elsewhere.about using sbu's and pos's, there's a brilliant quote from the philospher james may:\"it's an ingenious solution to a problem that should never have existed in the first place!\"they are artificial means of creating conflict where none should be necessary and in the process they eliminate any chance of (significant) conflict anywhere else.i truly beleive that this sytem will revitalize 0.0, aswell as making it vastly more accessible to new alliances and players."
"quick! we're losing sov! to the mining barges, everyone!this is silly."
"i think that the sovereignty levels should be more granular than they are now, and that there should be multiple metrics that all feed into determining the level of a given system, so that ratting/mining/etc (there are references in the database to other types of indices beyond military and industrial) all contribute in some way.however, making sovereignty based purely on those sorts of things is silly."
"it can't be based on anything else if you want to get away from the structure grind. that's the entire issue.the values on which activity is based are tbd of course after a lot of testing. i don't really see any downsides to this proposal, but i do see a massive improvement on what the situation is right now, or what it has been ever since sov was introduced."

"so i have been playing eve for a few months now, my character is much older than his skill point level reflects as i was turned off at first by the steep learning curve of the game. having been begged by friends to come back i can't help but notice a number of things that drive me absolutely batty. the first of these is ship design, while i understand that developers have children that build things with duplos or make finger paintings of space. these things belong attached to your fridge with a magnet, not thrown willy nilly into the game you are making. that being said i find the most difficult thing about eve is tailoring a ship for a mission, everyone says to switch ammunition types, tank modules, and even drones to match the mission at hand. i fly gallente ships because the few ship models that are not intolerable are actually very good. the problem here is that all of the bonuses are directly related to the racial module, a bonus to hybrid turret damage for example. i find that this prevents me from using other weapon modules, artillery for example, to their full effect when mounted on my ship. so really my questions is whats up with that? is there some underlying game background that prevents starship captains from wiring their ship hulls with electronic components from other races? would it actually unbalance the game if players could put weapon modules of one race on ship hulls from another without suffering a penalty? is there any kid of idle chat about making ships customizable in some way so that players who like to enjoy the way their starship looks can have their cake and eat it too by also fitting the weapon modules with the most pleasing effects and not suffer a penalty for it? just something for y'all to ponder. those who feel it necessary may troll away as i will just ignore you."
"ships have roles. bonuses are designed to help the ship to fulfill the role. they create diversity between ships combined with the fitting attributes of the hull."
"not to mention that ships that are fully and equally customization will all sport more or less the same fits and use similar tactics against one another...as opposed to the \"rochambeau game\" we currently have where each ship can be fitted for certain tactics that other ships can be fitted to counter and so on and so forth."
"omg what a can of worms that would be...i'm all for more customization tho.armor tanks lose space for nanos and damage mods, shield tanks lose space for ewar. it would be nice to be able to switch that out to fit your favorite ship to fly in a specific kind of fleet. it would also be nice to switch out shield boost or armor rep bonuses for resistance bonuses for fleet pvp. i always liked the hurricane and rifter because it could be tanked either or and be effective."
"i'm not saying ships can't have roles i just mean that ships for each race that fill essentially the same role. the tier 3 battlecruisers for example what is the underlying issue with the percentage bonus to hybrid turret damage of the talos applying instead to all large turrets so that i could fit artillery if i wanted a more satisfying boom or the choice to choose ammunition with a different damage type on a hull that was also aesthetically pleasing? as it stands right now my options are, fit medium hybrids to the talos and throw away any advantage the talos really has in effect making it an expensive cruiser, fly a ship i dont like to get the bonus for the guns i do, or just fly it as is using the rail guns. at no point am i allowed to have my cake and eat it to. i mean i would be perfectly happy if there was a way to customize so much as a color scheme on the ship to make it more appealing. on another note, whats up with the specialized ships being the same hull as a non specialized ship with very minor changes? i mean sure a navy issue version of the ship i get but the enyo and the incursus are entirely different ships yet the only real difference in appearance is color and a minor change tot he engines. or the vagabond? its just a stabber with some camo paint and extra wingy bits glued on the sides? im sure there are more examples these are just the ones i am familiar with."
"can anyone check which ship gives a racial bonus to paragraph size? i need to know what this guy is flying."
"duh. welcome to eve - you will likely be very unhappy for the short time you are here. that fact that you think that the only difference between the stabber and the vagabond is the paint job and a couple of frills means that you are either:a) a troll so obvious that even other obvious trolls are calling you an obvious troll, orb) so ill informed on the topic at hand that we can safely ignore any input you might make.actually they amount to the same thing.seriously, l2playthedamnedgamebforemakingdumbasssuggestions."
"i am quite aware that the stabber and the vagabond are two completely different ships, the numbers and stats and bonuses are different , their abilities are different, my point was why the devil are these people so lazy with the models? hell we didnt even get four brand new destroyers. we got three brand new destroyers and the amarrians got a coercer polished up a bit with the abilities changed around. one might expect better from people who are descended from a culture that more or less wrote the book on ship building."
"additionally, the next time you want to use an amalgamation of words longer than my arm you can precede it with a hashtag and post it to twitter where it belongs. your reading comprehension level is worse than my niece in kindergarten."
"because one is used to create the other? think of t2 ships as \"modified\" versions of the \"standard\" ship. yeah... that one was a bit... underwhelming. but it's not like too many people cared. it does what it does and that's why people fly it."
"see now this was more helpful in dispelling my negative feelings toward ships, the flavor text fails to explain that they used the original ship as a design model, it just says so and so was paid to develop this to solve this by this. in fact the ship flavor text is very \"cookie-cutter\" all the way around. i just figured there would be more people that would hire some space junkies to float about in the hangar and repaint their ship if they could."

"there is a very simple fix to re-balance drones: prevent npcs from targeting them.i don't really get why this was changed anyways. drones were fine before and are now the probably most tedious thing and nothing but plain annoying. it feels like someone came up with the idea that guns have a 1/100 change to explode when trying to fire: a plain nuisance to increase the price for the item.as it stands currently, all you need to do to \"counter\" that targeting is to keep an eye on the targeting and recall drones as soon as it changes. bigger drones may be kept alive using remote repair, but for once that does not fit on every ship, and for second the small drones tend to die way too fast to keep them alive using rr.but what does that change add to the game? beside the increase in drone-price, i can't see anything here. drones before haven't been overly powerful, as their damage was extremely restricted. they only thing you could do using a drone boat was to afk through a mission, but at the drawback that it actually takes 2-3 times as long, which sounds balanced to me. now drones have been nerfed from an addition to useless, as i (and i am pretty sure many others as well) don't want to spend their time in the mission staring at the targeting signs and keep recalling and sending back out their drones.if a change adds nothing but an annoyance to the game, it is a mistake and needs to be reverted. and this drone change is a mistake."
"there are actually people who seem to use bots to place bounties on everyone.i've been in jita recently and someone asked what the word \"scam\" means, so i said: \"scam is, if someone says like: give me any amount of isk and i double it! guaranteed!\"2 seconds later i had 100k bounty on my head. as no one can actually place bounty this fast by hand and several other people had the same issue with the same person placing the bounty, my guess is that this is a bot watching the chat for certain words (scammers?) and throws around bounties."
"sorry op, i don't support your proposal. imho, the new bounty system was a fantastic part of retribution and very well thought out too (congrats to all involved btw). my main critisim of your proposal is that i can't see why a small bounty on your head would be something to worry about in the first place."
"you missed the point. you don't understand or i'm not familar enough with english. the low bounty on me or someone else isn't really the problem itself. the important word is \"everybody\": i detected that bounties are placed on almost everybody around jita. the problem is see is that the following game feature helpful for bounty hunters, to detect pilots with interesting bounties, gets unusable if more than half of the players in the universe have a useless bounty on them:overview window / icon column / \"player has bounty on him\" ... and if there is no chance to set a filter on the bounty amount to be tracking or place a threshold on the initial bounty.ps: yes - i agree that \"the new bounty system was a fantastic part of retribution\"."
"you've skipped both reasons why these structures exist - the main one being timezones. it's very difficult to have a 'fair' mechanic that ensures alliances can't lose their assets while they sleep, while at the same time not giving them a massive defensive advantage. how would such a system react to a euro alliance going to bed then having 1000 hostile us timezone players sitting camping their hq each night while they sleep? what if those 1000 players split up into groups of 100 and camped 10 systems? what if they did that each night for a week? it's not practical to enforce activity 24/7 to claim a system, nor does it work if the period is so short that it negates the effect of timezones. on top of that, any mechanic that demands players to sit around in a system doing nothing is even more boring than grinding structures. at least when shooting ihubs you might be hotdropped.secondly, structures and reinforce timers also serve to force fights at times when one party would not otherwise engage. while you've gone into some detail about a 'pvp mechanic' that measures who has the best k/d ratio or whatever, you haven't provided any incentive for those parties to actually fight. if alliances are in two different timezones and system ownership is determined by activity in a system, what reason would they ever have to fight each other?in truth i think the best solution lies in a combination of new and existing mechanics. as myanna said, there should be multiple metrics that all feed into deciding ownership of a system or region. it's all very well asking people to compare k/d ratios or rat more, but unless you provide other mechanics that actually force parties to engage when they may not want to you're just going to end up with a race of who can run the most bots or keep the most eve clients logged on afk."
"another group being active in their own timezone in your systems means that they are giving up on their own systems to do so. that said, while timezones are an issue they are an unimportant one imho. you could simply make non-pvp activity by the alliance that owns the system count 100% more than activity from alliances with no sov there.sitting in a system doing nothing should give next to no activity. sitting in a system cloaked gives no activity whatsoever, this also counts for 'active' covert ops ships. as such there's no point doing nothing.the point of this system is not just to eliminate structure grind, it's also to force alliances to only take systems they actually use. any kind of sov system which does not reward actual activity in the system (ie, sbu's, posses, whatever) can and will be abused to spam them around, making it impossible to wage any meaningful warfare nor stake a meaningful claim to something.as i already explained, the best way to take over someone else's system is to fight them. pvp activity, especially succesful activity is rewarded with a lot of activity. this also makes guerilla warfare possible and a credible threat, rather than something to be ignored 'since they can't hurt out pos/sbu anyway'. if you want to conquer a system you have to fight. if you want to keep a system you have to fight aswell, you can't simply ignore invaders.if you choose to try and ignore invaders, all that happens is that your activity will degrade since you're not doing anything there other than hide. in the mean time, the invaders are happily making use of your system, generating their own activity. cloaked fleets don't help you, the occasional gank doesn't create any meaningful activity due to the time spent cloaked and a single kill here and there won't offset the otherwise massive activity an invader could bring.if alliances are in two different timezones, sovereignty will be determined by whoever is the most active, simple. timezones should not count as a defense against anything - as i explained already, 'offline defense' requires structures that can survive untill the next time you can log on, which introduces the structure grind yet again. this is exactly the thing i want to avoid, and so does everyone else.timezones not mattering for this also reinforces the effect of more space being available to smaller alliances... also, one should not be able to claim sov solo.as i explained above, parties have to engage one another to force the other out. if this can't happen due to timezones, then quite honestly it's just bad luck or bad timing. eve isn't turned off when you go to sleep, nor should it be, but structures do exactly this. they don't just make it boring for defenders, they make it boring for attackers aswell.the current system also forces capital ships to be used for each and every fight that determines sov. any other ship class does not matter for this since they hardly do damage to the structures determining sov, or can even defend themselves against stuff like pos guns."
"by 'unimportant', did you really mean 'the most important issue'?"
"i don't see how timezones are more important than the sovereignty system itself. this is an important distinction to make - catering to different timezones is a part of it, not it's main focus.the problem with catering to timezones is that you are saying to give a defender a means to defend without actually being there. the next question is, how long should he be able to do that? why should the game give 'free defense' to someone who isn't actually there to defend it? catering to timezones is one of the reasons why the current system doesn't really work."
"i made a similarly-themed attempt at sov-reform awhile back. basically, line up the incentives so that...1) holding space has inherent costs, which vary based on the strategic value of the space in question.2) holding space affects your neighbors, encouraging local/small-scale conflict; effect scales as more space is claimed.3) the more active space is, the more it can be improved in various ways. conversely, disrupting activity can have major impact on both the economic and strategic value of said space. 4) timers are defacto set by defenders, but this ability is related to and limited by the financial costs of holding sovereignty. the longer the timer, the greater the costs. various other often-asked for goodies."
"you could, of course, reply with actual arguments based on facts and deduction instead of going for the typical troll/flame response that adds nothing to the discussion in this topic. nowhere do i mention that 24/7 presence is required. you only need to generate more activity than other groups in the same system. if you don't want to actually be active in the system there is no reason to take sov there - if you don't want to invest in an area of space, why should you be entitled to take it and keep it? the current jump bridge mechanic is one of the major offenders in this entire story aswell by the way, if that wasn't clear enough.if you can come up with actual arguments that 100% refute and put down my proposal, i'd be happy to concede the discussion to you and declare you the winner, if that makes you happy.point 1 is inherent in my proposal - you need to actually use the system to generate the activity points (clarifying this term like this for now) needed to obtain and retain sovereignty. the costs are (again) inherent, as time is the most important commodity in eve.point 2 is also covered under influence, which is one of the activity point generating mechanics in my proposal. it basically works like the eve sovereignty map influence, albeit in a modifed form. influence alone could feasibly take over systems, but since it's activity rank is the lowest, any proper activity in the system will very quickly move sovereignty to the 'proper' users.point 3 is also inherent to my proposal (that word is popular today isn't it?) - more activity points enable more sovereignty levels, which might work the way they do now. enemy activity, without even needing to generate points, can be incredibly disruptive since it disrupts your own activity point generation.point 4 would be irrelevant here, timers are something you'd want to avoid since they encourage more passive play, aswell as being prone to abuse, both from internal and external sources."
"so you're arguing that if you can pve grind in your timezone better than the other guy can pve grind in their time zone, you should get to own the system?that shouldn't be a question. if a pvp fight comes into it, great, but earlier you talked of other activity, so that is, in fact, what you are arguing. and thus ends anyone's legitimate interest in your ideas."
"sounds to me like you're proposing we trade an annoying system for one that is completely broken and easily exploitable. no thanks."
"we'd game this system by camping you into station and holding a frigate tournament outside."

"goons like to post.and there's plenty of constructive criticism of your proposals over the last page amongst the 'lol evolution' comments."
"once it hit the point where you failed to take in the constructive criticism offfered and failed to notice the parts where you contradict yourself within your own posts, it became a comedy thread. which of course we've been passing around on jabber alongside choice quotes. at no point have we complained, this is simply pointing and laughing now."

"seems sensible to me. why should plex be the most expensive way to pay for the game..."
"because it is functionally different than just paying for a sub. it can be used in multitude of ways and even traded for goods and services within the game. it's a superior product from player perspective in every way, which justifies the larger price tag."
"this scam is very easy to counter by using \"brain\" (tm).1. check the market and realize someone is paying a lot more for an item than someone is selling it.2. understand that if the seller would have seen the buy order, he would have definitely sold it to that guy instead of putting it on the market.3. realize that you did not just get lucky today, but that it is a scam.on the other hand, i recently got 100m for a 1m corpii b-type, because someone was not doing the scam right. ;)"
"okay... so it does say that it was based on the stabber hull and i have overlooked it completely. don't i feel sheepish. still the fact remains that i think there should be some method of changing a ship's appearance so that you can have a ship that both serves a specific function and is pleasing to the eye. in most cases i would settle for a 'make symmetrical' button."
"i think your problem can be solved by improving on the market systems.if ccp made it easier to browse all buy orders from a specific player/corporation, sellers can easily identify buy order hotspots. if they do that buy orders can be met quicker and possibly at a higher profit then market average.so for example a player or corporation has just setup in a fairly empty system and a group of buy orders go up for standard t1 products. sellers can browse a buy order and then look at all the buy orders of the player and sell.also to encourage this brokers tax can be reduced depending on the number of sell orders in that station.having npc's sell products on the market goes against the player orientated environment eve has so i'd vote against your idea. sorry"
"this gets an enthusiastic +1 from me. really, anything that can help the overview would be welcome, but this would be a major improvement."

"yes. exactly."
"my bad and apologies, i did miss your point. an appropriate filter in the overview options i could support, assuming the coding would not be resource hungry."
"because your idea was pretty godawful bad to begin with, so it got linked around for others to recognize the awful-badness of it. when confronted with attempts at argument and discussion (such as my and cynonet's points that it's a good system but ought be combined with others rather than used on its own) you brushed them aside, declared \"no it has to be this way\" and later labeled them with the blanket of \"complaining\". thus, it's guaranteed that you'll be pointed at and mocked.and that's ignoring, as cynonet pointed out, the flaws in your arguments. i mean, you've made such claims as \"this will help small alliances gain a foothold\" when in fact such small alliances would be drowned out, activity-wise, by a larger alliance, even if they're in other timezones. you've claimed that time zones won't matter, when in fact a multi-timezone alliance will directly contest a smaller single-time zone entity in their time zone, and drown out their activity in an uncontested manner the rest of the time. you've claimed that \"nothing but caps matter\" in sov warfare when in fact deploying unsupported caps is just asking for them to be murdered by an opposing fleet comprised of supcaps or properly supported caps. that's just from re-skimming your post, i'm sure i could go on."
"lets introduce something called \"null plex\" and you have to orbit a beacon with your titan to contest it. if no enemy enters a npc will spawn to amuse you. if somebody contests your system while you are not on you have to spend the same amount of time when you are on to decontest the system again. in worst case its a total waste of time for both sides. in best case both are on at the same time and meet at the beacon. at this point you have to make the decision if you should better orbit something else or press f1 while activating your batphone. ok maybe not."
"i think the op's ideas have merit and i've seen other suggstions that an activity based sov maybe the answer to the problems a structure based system introduces.i loved playing the board game risk and still remember fondly the arguements, gnashing of teeth and heated debate that would often ensue as temporary alliances were forged. the beauty of risk was that ownership of a region was soley determined on occupany. i also liked that if you occupied all of the several regions that defined specific areas (such as north america) you recieved bonus rewards. i wonder if an eve based occupancy sov system could have this too, say for constellation and regional domination?goons gonna goon. afterall, intelligent and reasoned debate is somewhat lacking in their group psyche."
"that's actually not a bad idea. i don't really see any problem with that.as i explained before, you can do that, but people will just jump clone out and do the same in one of your systems, so it will all balance out :)the only counter arguments i've seen were ones where i believe my first post wasn't read properly.1) pvp and other warfare activities are the most valued. timezones always have some kind of overlap aswell, it's not like that at the exact moment eu goes to bed, us logs on, not logging on before that. there will always be conflict of some kind.2) structures are a bad thing since they only relocate the problem and don't solve it, as i keep explaining. they require large blobs of capitals to defend and place effectively, drowning out subcap ship classes significantly as far as sov warfare goes. the time commitment (as in, having to show up at very specific times to be effective) due to reinforcement timers is also stifling and leads to less organic warfare in almost every single way, aswell as posing a significant barrier of entry for anyone wanting to participate.3) larger alliances would have more space, but only as much as would actually be used. think of this as 'people per system' - the system works in a linear fashion, not exponential, so an alliance of 1000 people would be able to hold 10 times as many system as an alliance of 100 people instead of the approx. disproportionally 20-30 times. the larger alliance can try to contest other systems with smaller alliances, but this would lead to other systems being less active and this easier to take over.lastly, people seem to be under the impression that under this system sov should be 'flippable' within a matter of days. that's just silly. sov will require a commitment to the space, whether you actually want that part of space. spending time and generating activity there means you can't spend it anywhere else, on a per player basis. i believe that this will lead to more interesting warfare in the long term since sov is no longer a matter of spamming pos's and sbu's, with structures taking on a support role instead of a pivotal role in determining such a defining mechanic. since structures still serve as staging and reinforcement points they will still act as points of interest as far as generating fights is concerned but since activity is a much larger issue, small gang fights will have a much larger impact on wars they do now (anything higher than 0), giving added incentive to engaging in this kind of warfare over the currently only reasons of 'being annoying' and 'getting killmails'. killing in it's own would actually serve a much more defined purpose under this system, whereas now fights would be avoided entirely unless absolutely necessarym like the structure grind.that said, i do genuinly appreciate yours and cynonet's comments. i will admit that my proposal may not be entirely sound, but i don't understand why this may be just yet. it may be that the truth lies somewhere in between, but i don't see how retaining the mandatory structure grind is in any way productive in this issue, i haven't seen any definitive alternatives up to this point. i really hope that there's some way to avoid structures, reinforcement timers and all that jazz, in the end. sov needs to be much more organic to be truly fun to deal with.also, i do apoligize for my somewhat derogatory tone in my quoted post."
"i have removed some nonconstructive trolling from this post. please attack ideas, not people or their corporations and alliances."
"i may be awake in russian or eu prime time but i'm certainly not available and useful for conflict. this applies to many people in many other time frames. scenarios in which space is \"flipped\" or \"fought over\" without the two sides ever seeing each other remain all too probable. or ones where a large multi-time zone alliance dominates the small single time-zone through matching kill for kill in their time zone while dominating the pve factor in other time zones, or...you get the idea.structures are bad for all...well, for many...of these reasons, yes. they do not, in and of themselves, require \"large blobs\" of capitals to tackle. large blobs of capitals are used either because they're available or, due to hostile opposition, necessary. and i still disagree with the notion that subcaps have \"no place\" in sov warfare, or that the best solution to what issues you list that i do agree with is to \"burn the whole system down\".this is an undeniable upside, yes. it is not a quality unique to your suggestions, however. there are many ways to place a soft limit on how much space can be held. and frankly, i happen to think that there are a lot of reasons for an alliance of any size to want to \"own more space\" that is not actually used, such as an alliance in period basis (for example) absolutely requiring midpoints somewhere in either delve or querious to perform logistics runs to and from empire. if they're not friendly with those who own the space around their midpoints, defending them will be hard enough as it is, to say nothing of if the requirement becomes entirely one of \"use the space\" as opposed to \"defend hardened and static structures at a fixed time.\" once again, these are not qualities unique to your proposal. think of it this way - a medieval attacker may have weakened the castle by blocking all supplies from entering and taking them for themselves, but at the end of the day, starving and weakened as though its defenders may be, they've still got to storm that castle. as i mentioned previously, i have no problem with the idea of activity tying into sov, just with the idea of it being the only determining factor. so, perhaps in eve terms, the structures are perhaps more easily taken out if the activity levels in their system are low, whether that's through enemy action or simple lack of use. for a concrete example, placing the tcu gives you the system, but the reinforcement timers for structures that have them have a large variance, +/-6 hours, perhaps. increased \"use\" of the system, be it ratting, mining, commerce in the station, whatever, increases the value of one or more indices, all of which contribute in a finely granular way to the sovereignty level. one such benefit of a higher sovereignty level attained this way could be the placement of another structure (of suitably \"not too high but not too low\" hp) that gives one finer control over defensive timers."
"nope, not supported. plex prices are subject to the player driven economy, excluding impact from the release of siezed plex by ccp or by increased supply from ccp offers in exchange for rl cash.note that according to a recent article on noseygamer's blog, there appears to be a direct correlation between the success of rmt operations and low plex in game prices. so, in this respect high plex prices kick rmters in the gonads something that i hope everyone welcomes.also, i hate grinding missions (or whatever) for isk so for players like myself, a high plex > isk exchange rate is very attractive."

"how about eve starting to make some f**in sense ? 1) what the is \"bump mechanics\" anyway ? the magical push of a ship by another through sheer willpower / pixiedust ?2) the station exit mechanics is a sad joke... especially in cases such as 4.4... 50 ships flying overlapped until one moves out of the \"convergence bubble\" then if you steer you bump in to the bubble and bounce off... this is just a workaround for not implementing any decent physics into the game. the above is just like saying that broken mechanic a can't be fixed because mechanic b is broken also! yes, both where workarounds from the start... instead of implementing a \"sound\" system, it's the easy way out, the cheap fast way where ships are nothing more than bounceboxes in the engine.how about a revolutionary approach to gamedesign? if you have 2 halfbaked systems in the game: fix both!1) ship collision:shields will push back against shields > at small speeds and similar mass the ships will slowly push each other away, except if they are intentionally fly towards each other. => shields will be drained by this, just like any \"projectile/beam\" hitting the shieldif the speed exceeds what the shield can push back => ships will crash into each other resulting in serious damage to both > depending on the mass of each.for example, a frig flying full mwd into a freighter will be a fly on the windshield... wish/wash... gone.a battleship, ramming the same freighter at full mwd will result in the bs going boom and the freighter loosing ~ 10% shield and ~ 30% armor + 10% hull(the pod of the rammer also going poof in both cases)(yes, this will make highsec ganking cheaper and easier)2) avoiding ship collisions / station exits:station exits are actually very easy to fix:stations are big! actually huge. why not having them 58 exits instead of only 1 ? version 1 (more realistic and more difficult to implement properly): each station has 58 exits, ships are sent out through them in roundrobin with a timer on each so that no ship is sent through the same hole in less than 5 seconds (maybe 10 ?... needs some testing).version 2 (cheaper will prolly be favoured by ccp): just like stargates, place ships at random points in a random 20km radius of the station => problem solvedavoiding collisions: while the safety is on, your ship will automatically try to avoid collisions > if your ship is on a collision course with a ship less than 5000m away, it will break/steer away of the object. if a ship is on a collision course with you, your ship will try to get out of the way/move away from the incoming ship. 3) possible fix for increased ease of ganking: if you intentionally (safety off) ram (accelerate into) another ship (in highsec), and cause serious (over 50%) damage to either ships, concord suspends your flight license for 30 (15 ?) days, leaving you unable to undock from the station in which your clone is / the first station you dock into (in addition if you don't dock, you also get a 5 min counter & warning to do so, if you don't you become suspect, for the duration of 30/15 days or until you dock)...and i'm sure the above solutions will also uncover other bad mechanics in place, to which i say: fix them too! keeping bad mechanics because fixing them will cause problems with other bad mechanics is not valid argument."
"currently, when scanning in known space, you must scan an 'unknown' signature all the way down to 75% strength in order to figure out if it's a wormhole or some sort of combat complex. this makes life harder for everyone scanning in hs, as the population of explorers that are highly interested in combat complexes is generally fairly distinct from those who are highly interested in wormholes. moving wormholes into a \"wormhole\" group (similar to how a ladar or a mag has a distinct group in the scanner ui) and perhaps renaming the existing \"unknown\" to \"combat\" would make life easier for everyone, wouldn't it?"

"exactly right - as a drone-boat l4 mission runner, i *like* the improved npc ai - it makes missions a bit more challenging. it just takes some creativity to come up with new tactics. i've found this approach to be especially effective - i think someone suggested something similar earlier in this forum:"
"you might reason that it is actually the returning of the escrow that is broken.if somebody tries to sell to a buy order, but it fails due to insufficient funds of the buyer, he is at default. to my knowledge when this happens the order is removed and the (23% at mt 5) escrow is returned to the buyer. this is wrong. the escrow should be given to the \"damaged\" party, the party willing to sell without the seller having to deliver any of the requested goods. this way he is partially compensated for the fraud and he can try to sell the goods to orders that do go through.mt scams will be more riskfull and it might trigger the creation of a new profession: mt scam busters.in order to not completely penalizing honest traders, the change could include a 1 (x?) day notice period in which the buyer is emailed that he is is at default and has limited time to get the extra money in order to get the goods that he wanted) however he should not be able to change/cancel the order any more"
"escrow funds in this game are a weird thing.... first, they are used up first... meaning if i place a buy order for 4 items, and 25% is put into escrow, i can sell myself one of those items to empty the \"escrow\" funds... and then i still have a buy order up for 3 more of those funds.... then i transfer isk away and the margin trade scam is working the same as it is now...."

"i here by announce my theory to brighten the future as dim as the thread at current may be, and redirect your attention now. smart gadget! it's quick, it's smooth, it involves human contact! you have ship + human and get to = whatever your standing causes because of common goals and enemies. i'm talking tracking devices to distress beacons! pilots that can make insane jumps into uncharted space and make an sos. here to help? sure i am, because i have what gadgets it takes to respond to such a signature. you can get anything as long as you ask for it nicely is the golden rule i was brought up in this world with. i always turned off my oven when i wasn't cooking and for it, i've never burned down my house. you have weapons, aid, jettisons, thermal resists and even names like bell! now don't think there would be a problem arming us with some more. would you? it's not like running from a dam in 15 minutes is necessary! but it's better to keep resists on the mind than your location in space.there may be love for ecm, eccm, control of drones and awesome vindicator technology, but is it hard to dedicate time to making what makes us fly? personally what makes someone fly is a pilot, and their wings. a compressed stock, and it's advantages by the executives call. where ever that may lead you you still feel a cold because not everything thought of is there. if i were to come back into this game i would want it to look like july 4th. the day of freedom; the day of the brave; the day of rust. what you could salvage from this is what technology could be flared into your mind right now. the more than what this has already lead you to believe we have. what else can you think of? what will take it from here, to in there? what might save us a little more from an incoming attack? what could put the fires out a little faster? *petition to **start **educating towards smart technology*"

"confirming that repeatedly pressing f1 is hard work and eve needs more of it.i think they did that with the followup patch.i don't believe you even have 39,000 accounts. but on the off chance you actually do: can i has your stuffz?"
"drone aggression is a good thing.two changes to make it better for the player:1) show when a drone is being targeted, make the 'drones in space' bar flash with the individual drone highlighted. this saves the drone and gives you a chance to get it home before it pops.2) show the background of the drone as a bar that fills up with 'aggression'. when full the drone will be targeted. ( i am sure this number exists in the code already ) this means you can tell what drone is in danger before it is targeted and possible switch targets so the aggression comes back to you."
"still doesn't solve the issue of drones being targeted the moment you throw them out, from my experience, when the rats flashes yellow it normally means they have potential of switching targets to your drones, the problem is you can wait an hour for the rats to switch from flashing yellow to flashing red, but even when they all flash red, they'll still go after drones if your drones gets even close to a pack"
"i agree that he number one hindrance with drones right now is the first sign of them being targeted is when they take damage. currently if i deploy heavy drones, they are half dead before getting to the target.it makes sense for the rats to target drones first, what do we do when you see a drone boat in pvp? personally i take out his weapons first, hull later. if the drones are ecm than they are an even bigger threat as they prevent me from doing other things.fix it so we can better manage our drones and the understand the aggro they generate, then we can balance how / when they get targeted.*edit*as i understand it, the npc ai hates ecm with a vengeance. equipping a target painter or ecm module may help to keep them targeted on you. not confirmed, just a thought."
"well maybe a noob would kill the drones in pvp, but every expert pvper knows you take out the ship first, kill the ship you kill the drones, drones are almost impossible to kill with standard weapons, the time it takes to kill the drones you'll already be dead, in pvp you should always know you kill the most dangerous ship first as quickly as possible or you're whole fleet is already dead, those who has the 1st tackle, are usually the ones that wins the fight"
"there is one very simple fix for this. it would not only eliminate the margin trading scam except for the excessively lazy. but would improve the margin trading functionality for the traders that use it as intended. add a show info for market orders. this would allow you to view stats of the order. such as the available escrow, total units of the original order, blocks of goods sold to the order, and possibly if the traders who placed the order has enough isk available in the appropriate wallet to cover the order if the escrow is not sufficient. this would not need to show the owners wallet balance, but only a green/red icon to indicate in the required funds are covered. any time you see an order you are not sure or suspicious about, you can check the info to see if it is a valid order or not. not only would this expose scam orders but allow you to double check larger orders to make sure they will not fail before completing them. this would benefit the trader who owns the order by allowing the order to show it would fail if the owners wallet drops to low while they are offline. allowing the order to stay active and be available once the owners wallet recovers. it is not like this would be a major inconvenience. you do not have to show info on every order, unless you are ocd paranoid. but will allow you to double check any suspect orders. for example if i placed a constellation wide order for 100,000,000 units of tritanium with a 100,000 minimum buy, and i have margin trading trained to 4. i have no intention of this order to fail, but as the escrow is limited there is a chance my buy orders could fill before my sell orders. rather than have my order fail and come back the next day to a limited amount of trit and have to place another order. potential clients could view the stats of the order and not sell to it until my wallet recovered giving the order an increased chance of completion. better for me and better for the client that would have suffered a failed order otherwise. at the same time any true margin trading scam would be transparent, and an obvious scam to anyone who bothered to check the info on the order. as a result margin trading, as it was intended to work is actually improved, while margin trading scams are all but eliminated."

"same issue here: i have this 1.2 billion isk gila and had a lot of fun with it the last year, and this single change rendered it almost useless, and i am this short from hitting the quit button.this is already known: target painters and ecm seem to have a much higher aggro, keeping npcs on you. but if a is bad, and b nullifies a, then this is not a solution for a, but more a kind of an exploit for a badly implemented feature. a target painter or ecm is not supposed to save your drones, it is supposed to increase your damage/reduce incoming damage."

"1000% agree with op. i am losing 1-2 drones per mission and i do not afk -at all- sometimes i drop drones and lose one within seconds.. totally lame. honestly i feel for any drone boat pilots. i will not be training drones from this point forward. i will also be only using drones i loot from missions as replacements for my lost ones."
"that i spent 6.214.415 skillpoints on training drones, which have just been rendered useless by a single patch.as i have a solid amount of skill-points in gunnery and other ships than drone ships allows me to switch to my vargur and kill them the other way, but someone who doesn't have that much skills and completely focused on a drone ship is now pretty much screwed.you are implying that all of ccp's changes are final and they never make mistakes, which is both - luckily - not the case. i consider this change a mistake and so do many others, and a mistake needs to be fixed.there are several ways to fly missions, you are describing the drone-afk version, which is easy if done right, but has the drawback of costing a lot of time. if you calculate the isk/h flying a drone ship vs a gunship, that gun-guy will make twice or three times as much money, so the drone-afks are already penalized by having a lower income. i don't see a need to \"fix\" that any further.besides: all you need to do is to stare at the targeting and hover your hand over the 'drone recall' button. this isn't challenging, this is just tedious. and whether or not your drones survive depend solely on factors like lag and drone reaction, unless your personal reaction time is incredibly low.if npcs tomorrow stop targeting minmatar ships and instantly kill every other faction's ships as soon as they enter a mission, would you still say the same?"
"he just said it's not useless nor a problem. i'm a drone pilot and i fly in wh space. it isn't always about keeping an eye on your drones as much as it is knowing when to launch them and what target to attack with them. through my time in wh space (nearly a year) i've lost maybe 20 drones to sleepers. in addition you can tip the scales to your side with almost any kind of ewar. if you can spare a slot for almost anything like remote reps, web, a warp disruptor, target painter ect it will give you targeting priority over your drones.that being said, if you launch 5 drones and there are 15 frigs, 10 cruisers and 8 bs on the field you are probably going to lose one or more of them. now if you remove most if not all the frigs then launch drones there is less of a chance of them getting quickly destroyed."

"incorrect sir. we are the core storyline of eve... not the other way around.faction standings hits for shooting friendly militias? reasonable request.supported."
"go to the grocery store. get some food. get to the counter. try to pay for your food. find out that your spouse used your card to pay a bill, so you don't have enough to buy the groceries.obviously, the store should be able to keep a portion of the price of the groceries that you attempted to buy out of your account, even though you are not leaving the store with any groceries. doesn't that make sense? because that is what you are proposing here."
"no, it isn't. what you told is an example for sell orders, not for buy orders. for this example to be anything like the eve buy order thing he would've had to tell the store to deliver some stuff to his house promising a certain amount of payment for it. and we were already discussing half a thread ago why real world stores don't like to do this when anonymity of the supposed buyer is involved."

"confirming that this is a big kerfuffle over almost nothing. if you aren't sentry-range-dependent, simply swap an otl for a painter as mentioned earlier. also, remote reps are good at getting the attention of the sleeper ai, too."
"this doesn't even matter. i ran the assault mission level 4 today with a target painter and remote repper on one of my senties and had to keep recalling them over and over because targets still switched to them. i would like to be able to use heavies again and regular drones, but i don't think that is a good idea at this point which is sad because i just got done training for these."
"well, to be fair mission really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really suck. took me forever to get level 4s and that was simply so i could get jump clones. now i never do them, just too damn boring."

"if heavy drones are no longer feasible, then drones are imbalanced.pretty simple."
"i am surprised how many people agree that drones now die a lot faster, some of them are situationally no longer usable and you need to exploit the ai using a target painter or ecm, but then still say this is fine.i sometimes get this feeling that no matter how obviously something is wrong, there will be always someone saying \"it is fine, just deal with it\". i think it is because i am more of that problem-solver type than the problem-accepter type."
"this."
"uh... what?! lets see here so i'm supposed to let their ecm drones jam me out so i can't shoot them. i'm supposed to let the carrier i've tackled kill me before reinforcements get there. i'm supposed to not kill their drones as i'm kiting them to do just that and bring their dps down to near nil.right got it... i'm now an expert pvp'er...o\"
"if you see an order you are not sure or suspicious about, should you take a step back and decide if you want to risk buying goods and attempting to fulfill it? i mean, you have doubts because there is risk in the transaction... why should that risk be removed? you currently can accept the risk and attempt to fulfill the order, or leave it alone of you think the risk is too much. please explain why ccp should remove the risk by providing you a green light when there is money behind an order, and a red light when there isn't? also, most take out restaurants operate using anonymous buy orders. and most other wholesale industries operate using non-anonymous buy orders. i do not support \"fixing\" the margin trade to remove the risks involved in moving goods to buy orders. i do support adding more info to the game by: a.) the creation of financial analysis agents and market analysis agents. this allows you to follow money... and opens up lots of meta-gaming opportunities. b.) remove the character anonymity from buy/sell orders. if you can right click and show character info on the corp or character that \"owns\" the buy/sell orders, you can use social media to identify scammers, etc.... this creates lots of interesting potential solutions that don't involve dumbing down the game!!!"

"i agree that the pve of this game is not one of it's strongpoints. it could be made better maybe with work, but that is a bit ot.now, for drone \"aggro\".other mmos have abilities that can reduce or wipe aggro. my suggestion is this: why not have some drone control module that can temporarily reduce signature of the drone? or some module that lets the drone discreetly target? or have the ai of the drone know when it is about to die and automatically return to drone bay?i am not to the point where i can reliably do the high level missions yet, but i do hear on teamspeak mates complain it is annoying."

"very simple,just like the re-sculpt for plex, this will be remove skills for plex.for a plex, you can remove your unwanted skills. i.e. mining, all planet management, trade skills, etc...you do not get reimbursement of skill points!you do not get reimbursement of skill book prices!the system already has a check to see if you can inject a skill, it will not let you if there is a prerequisite.just reverse that order & have it not let you remove a skill that is needed for another skill.if, by chance, you want to train that skill you removed, then buy the skill book & skill it again.just a few examples;injecting a skill without fully knowing what it does, just to find out you didn't understand it.mining ii comes with new character and is completely worthless on combat alt.like me, you are ocd.tried pi, didn't like it, want it gone to keep you from trying it again. <--me againbought a character off forum, some skills on there that you don't like.your nyx \"coffin\" alt had there drone bay nerfed & you cant use regular dronesthis will probably never happen but,would be just another use of plex, since ccp likes to find ways of using them up."
"...why would anyone ever do this?"
"answer me this - why would anyone ever spend a plex to re-sculpt?answer: because they can if they wanted too.same would apply to removing unwanted skills, because they want too.i for one thinks it is a waste of a plex to re-sculpt, but i guess there were enough people that would do it for ccp to add it to the game.i have three alts that i would gladly pay a plex each to be able to remove some skills from them.if ccp did this, i bet they would consume more plexes with this then the re-sculpting."
"paying 600 mil or 15 bux to downgrade your character... i have no idea why anyone would be stupid enough to do this or why you'd even want this.how about: plex for account removal! :d"
"same question as above, why would anyone pay 600 mil or 15 bux to re-sculpt? it does nothing for you, waste of isk or rl money.also, i am not downgrading my character because i want to remove the following:all industry skillsall planet management skillsall trade skillssome science skillsi am actually cleaning my character up from all the nonsense that i will never ever use again. once again, it is my choice to do it, why do you care?"
"not to mention high profile members of alliances sometimes get their accounts hacked, so, this is a terrible idea. deal with your ocd some other way, buy a jar of mice and smash one every time you get annoyed that you can't micro-manage something."
"that is bad logic, if an account is hacked & proven to be hacked, ccp can reverse everything, so no loss there.so if a high profile members of alliance get account hacked & the hacker uses a plex to re-sculpt the character, do you not think ccp could reverse it?"
"because it's a useless feature that would detract dev man hours from things that actually do need fixing."
"they spent who knows how many hours puting in plex for re-sculpting and this does nothing too.furthermore, like i said in post above, everything is already in-game to do it.skills are already removed from you when you lose a t3 ship or get podded in a lower sp clone.the injection of a skill is check to see if there is a prerequisite, just reverse that check.not much to do to implement this, if a ccp dev came on & said this is impossible without lots of work, then i would understand.you do not know that it would take or detract dev man hours :p"
"re-sculpt is a vanity issue, i may change how i look in real life and decide to make my avatar match.your idea is like saying, \"gee i haven't done algebra in 5 years, i should pay a surgeon to remove that part of my brain.\"as for as isk sink, there are many better ideas out there for it."
"if the devs can install this quickly and easily.... let them... if it takes longer than an hour.... it's not worth the effort in my opinion. by the way.... anyone that actually spends plex to remove skillpoints from there character is a moron.... but i see no problem helping morons be morons... that's pretty much how we end up with rorquals spamming the jump button on lowsec gates..."
"then i am here to tell everyone that i must be a moron 3 times over, because i would pay for the plex on 3 different alts right now.but then again, i did try to jump a rorqual thru a gate once......"
"remove skills would be a vanity issue, i may decide that pi is a waste of my time and decide to make my skill sheet match.\"gee i haven't got laid in 5 years, i should pay a surgeon to remove that wart on my face\"actually, eve online is set far, far into the future, we have clones that we can jump to on the other side of the universe.oh wow, each of these clones can have different hardwirings in their head, so not much to stretch that you could remove some skills if no longer needed."
"yes but vanity, by definition, is for others to look at.i cannot see your skill points, and even if i could i would wonder why a x year old pilot only has x skill points. this means you were inactive for a potion of time or a really poor player and didn't train to your attribute skills.this is why implants are important, they allow you to shift your attributes without remapping.now, in terms of vanity, i would pay a plex to have a jump clone with a different face. think re-sculpt on a clone by clone basis. no name change, no attribute difference, just a different face to look at. it may be a headache for cpp's servers but i think the delayed portrait thing is already in place."
"i don't see the point. not supporting."
"wow talk about crazy ocd!"
"well i can see a point, i'll try to be the devils advocate here.when i started my character, certain skills came with it and i had no choice in the matter. we still don't with some.my character is pure pvp, but there are 2 skills that came with birth. mining and industry. both are at level 1, meaning a grand total of 500 sp. i can honestly say, i would pay to remove those 2 skills. i can see the issue the op has. but my thought on balance and consequences, sees the need for large limits on just what skills you could remove and how much sp each one holds.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"why? i just don't understand why you would remove skillpoints... let alone pay to remove sp! these are the images that come up in my mind: a.) hack account, destroy pilot's skillpoint pool...... very harmful....b.) ransom pilot... and force them to remove sp to save their ship?? (this is pretty funny actually)c.) extremely vane aesthetics... (this is either extremely ocd and/or just stupid)and really, any skillpoints you have are part of your character's history.... have a pvp pilot with some indy background... so what... if you have mining iii and indy iii from your early stages of playing... so what... need an rp reason to have those skills... easy: i know how to rollerskate... i haven't done it in 20 years.. but i still know how... i never skated regularly, but occasionally i went to kid socials at the skating ring (birthday parties, whatever). make up a backstory that explains why you have indy 1 and mining 1.... maybe you played with mining lasers as a toddlerpod... i honestly just can't imagine how this is worthy of developer time... i put this idea on par with: allow me to wiggle my finger..... i don't want to be able to do anything by wiggling my finger, and its important to note that no-one will ever see me wiggle my finger, but lets waste dev time on making it so i can wiggle my finger... i really just don't understand this request.... and unless you can give me a decent reason, i just don't support taking dev time away from revamping sov, revamping pos's, revamping ships, revamping wis, revamping industry, or the 1000 papercuts that truly improve the game..."

"sorry man, but you are using the fact that you got scammed to try and get margin trading removed???this is a useful skill that any station trader will use every day to broaden his market groups, some days certain modules move more than others, margin trading is a way to \"spread your bets\" across multiple market groups and increase your chances of obtaining goods and selling them. the fact that people are abusing a mechanic is no excuse to remove it. there is hundreds of mechanics being exploited daily, and if you've played any other mmo, you know that you will never be rid of exploits, and you can avoid being a victim of this abuse by paying attention to what the hell you are doing with your wallet. to quote ccp here \"eve is real\" and i doubt you'd sign a contract in real life without at least thinking about it or asking the contractor a few questions about it would you?approach eve contracts the same way."
"just a minor thing but it has been bugging me for oh so long.if you want to check your mission status to see if you completed your objective (which can be kind of vague for certain missions) atm you have to open your journal and read mission details.could we please get an additional status in the mission journal so that when all objectives for a mission have been completed, the mission status changes to 'completed'? it saves having to open another pointless window.and while you're at it, could the mission objectives and their status be displayed in the little mission hud thing below the start system info?"

"once again, why would someone waste a plex to re-scuplt?a> ccp can reverse any account that is deemed to be hacked - non issueb> you want to ransom me to remove my skillpoints, ok i will do it, but first let me dock up so i can buy a plex.c> this one is just a plain stupid responseonce again, none that has posted can say that it would take more time to implement this then did the re-sculpt.all the code for it is already in the game, just takes some tweaking.plus, once again, this is a another way for ccp to remove plex from the game (helps their bottom line)of course there are more important features to add or revamp, not saying to drop all of them for this."
"i bet a plex i am not the only one in eve with crazy ocd. :p"
"i think this idea has merit, but as a nice middle ground, at least a percentage of the sp should be allowed to be reallocated. deffo not all of it, but a percentage. this would more than likely give enough people pause before going through with the process. i know i have a few skills that i would like to see go away, but i did spend time on them...that shouldn't be 100% wasted.every time i post is pardy time! :3"
"absolutely not.... i would allow people to remove sp for free to be honest... but i wouldn't allow them to redistribute them!!"

"this statement really doesnt make any sense at all. it is so much nonsense, it's not worth a reply.let's get back on topic again, everyone re-read my original post.then let's please discuss its pros & cons with some thought."
"there was a long and bloody battle between the caldari and the gallente faction. it is clear that the caldari elite understand by now, that freedom is stronger than oppression. however, the real fighting was done by our volunteer pilots and their allied counterparts. the organization of the gallente militia was simply outstanding. the men and women that enlisted and the ace corporations that lead them have achieved what we always knew would happen, freedom of oppression. victory!our pilots suffered heavy losses. the caldari proved to be an oponent to respect but at the end, our pilots have pushed them all the way back and have conquered all of the systems, in the name of freedom.therefore, our pilots should at least be rewarded for their courage, dedication, execution and their victory! an award would mean a lot to them. the pilots involved in the fighting are entitled to a medal of highest honor, so they can proudly show them to any future opponent.\"we showed already once that freedom is stonger than oppression and we are not afraid to show it again if anyone tries to prove otherwise\"it is clear that the many of the caldari did the right choice, giving up the dirty fight for the caldari wealthy elite. we salute you for that. we are also aware of the guerilla tactics and operations that are being undertaken against us as we speak and our pilots are everywhere spread out trying to deal with the situation.so let our pilots have such an honor, let them show that victory has been achieved, by gallente, for freedom and peace. let them wear such a medal, so the remaining caldari fighting for a hopeless cause can clearly see that we have already won and we will never quit to fight for freedom and we are ready to die trying to defend it!gallente pres. spokesman degaulle"

"seconded. this is eve, not a space-flight simulator."
"margin trading is a v ery needed skill to anyone that goes deep into marketing proffession. as for a fix , it still need the right plan to do a scam with it . so if you are taking by fool when you try to do some fast profit , then accept the fact that someone was more clever than you and you fall into his scam. next time be more carefull or if you got what it takes do the same."
"how totally arrogant! as well as presumptuous and how wrong you at ccp can be to say wardecs have been fixed.here is one basic example of how it is not just broken but totally incompetently, impotent.group of say 8-10 ice miners mining away, for arguments sake using their main chars who are all in another player corp or npc corp. lots of almost unlimited isk, whether they (bot or not is irrelevant at this point), they are in it for massive isk returns, not simply a reasonable quota to fuel a pos or two they might own but to fund wardecs. they then form up a separate small player corp of alts and use that as the front corp to wardec any and all small and medium corps / alliances and with that level of isk flowing in from their mining chars they can fund permanently a wardec on small and medium corps or alliances. you cannot know for sure who they really are, as they are in effect invisible, it could take months, years or never to find out whom the main chars really are to deal with them! leaving aggressed corp players to endlessly chip away at only alts ad infinitum. with no way to ever effectively get to the end of an infinite and infinitely funded wardec. also if and it<U+FFFD>s a big if, you do by some freak chance discover who the main chars are and you find they are in an npc corp the only alternative is the suicide gank process, so why even have a wardec process in the first place if you leave embarrassingly glaring, gaping loop holes like that. if i was was a patient in hospital, i would hate to think that ccp were the doctors \"fixing me\" i would rather be treated by a vet and you say you all play the game same as us mortals and are in touch with it, sorry but you are not in the same world as the rest of us.jeez"
"i noticed this looking over dust stuff, and it bothered me.in rp, no-one seems to be blameless in the struggles between the empires.right now, gallente and minmatar are crushing their enemies in fw. amarr and caldari need a bit of a boost if anything.when i look at the descriptions of the empires, the words that are pushed the hardest for each empire make gallente and minmatar out as the epitome of all that is good and noble and apple pie, while portraying caldari and amarr as evil. \"dictatorial\". \"slavers\".amarr has been making a lot of strides toward ending slavery. we have nice people! we do good things! really we do! we honestly arent any worse than the old british empire.caldari are hard-working and independent people! they're big on collective action and the good of the many! and they're fighting for their independence!meanwhile, you have gallente which is always portrayed as good and noble and wonderful. gallente would never invade anyone! they just have.. \"humanitarian police actions\" and \"occupy\" planets and \"assist\" them to set up \"peaceful, democratic governments by the people\" that somehow are always run by a gallente representative and perfectly echo the will of the gallente government. that's known as imperialism where i'm from..and minmatar is all about \"reclaiming their heritage\", thats fine and dandy, but they dont seem to mind being repressive and whatnot while they do it, and they seem like they're a lot more concerned with recreating their traditions than they are with, you know, feeding their people or having a coherent government system...people like to be the good guys, and they flock to the \"good\" side, and i'd appreciate it if the people who wrote the descriptions for each empire would work harder to try to muddy the issue of which of the empires was which on the material that people first see."
"what's that true slave?i can't hear you over all this freedom"
"it's pretty hard to put a positive spin on an empire who's policy is literally 'we will invade your planet and enslave your people because god told us to.' it's all very well saying they're taking strides to end it, but there's still the whole seven hundred years of oppression for us minmatarr, and the full third of us still in chains."
"minmatar is pretty good at being oppressive to its own people on occasion, and there's more to amarr than 'lol slavery'. that'd be a bit like deciding that australia should be described as needing to be nuked into oblivion at every possible opportunity because of their ideas about the kyoto protocol. it's taking a whole culture and stereotyping it by one single issue and portraying it as evil based on that, when in actuality every empire has some things about it that are admirable, and some things about it that make its enemies justifiably think they're scum. i don't want it to be \"amarr is great and wonderful!\" i just want it to be portrayed as grey vs grey instead of good vs evil."
"i'm pretty sure you're playing a different game than me."
"well that's because it is imperialism. vide longe er eros di luminaire vii, uni canse pra krage e determiniex! sange por sange! descanse bravex eros, mie freires. mortir por vostre liberete, farmilie, ide e amis. lons proviste sen mort! luminaire liber mas!"
"and, by extension, an invasion.though, you're quoting stuff that i don't believe i've seen before. got a source? i don't doubt the 'liberation' invasion thing, but you're making **** up with the mary sue bit."
"it just seems that amarr and caldari are portrayed as the \"bad guys\" in character generation, and gallente and minmatar are portrayed as the \"good guys\". every game that i've seen that had a \"good\" side and an \"evil\" side, the \"evil\" side was completely outnumbered. and lo and behold, we have \"winmatar\", and we have gallente celebrating owning every fw system.but it seems like it isn't nearly as cut and dried, and if someone wants to be dashing and heroic, i'd like them to have to stop and have to make a real judgement call on where to go instead of just waffling between \"democracy\" or \"freedom\" and passing \"slavers\" and \"dictatorial\" by. every empire should be described by a mix of virtues and flaws. \"they' stand for these great things buuuut they also do this nasty awful thing..\""
"well, if you're a western liberal, an empire built on slavery and an empire built on social darwinism is going to be seen as \"bad guys\" because these belief systems are offensive to us. you are simply imposing your rl western beliefs on the game, where only one of four faction could be considered \"western\".also, when the caldari won all the systems in 2009, there were lamentations about pro-caldari bias from ccp. your point is redundant."
"except that in character generation, that's pretty much the only thing that you read about them. the races get a little snippet, and there is a bias.old, lots of education, but slaves. okay.tough, strong, driven, but dictatorial. okay.brave and champions of liberty and democracy! and on the other hand.. wait, i'm not seeing anything to dislike in this.poor minmatar to have suffered so much! and they are such awesome people! on the other hand... yeah, these guys don't have anything written here to either appeal to the blackhearted or to give the heroic pause, either.that's really all i want, is for these to be evened out a bit. mention the valklears or something."
"you really can't expect introductory paragraphs to be that in-depth. when i read that, all empires are portrayed as having good qualities.but i can tell from this that you like democracy, dislike slavery, dislike ruthlessness. what if i don't like democracy, like slavery and like ruthlessness, especially that the latter tends to get stuff done far quicker?there wouldn't be any issue of bias at all. this is all perspective."
"i also saw good qualities in all of them. but only two were portrayed as having bad qualities.please list a few english-language-primary speaking countries which have a positive reaction to \"slavery\" and \"dictator\".even dictators don't want to hear the word \"dictator\". it's highly loaded. plus, it doesn't even seem to be the most accurate term available. caldari seems to push for excellence and upward mobility within the system, and that is antithetical to dictatorship. caldari is conformist, strict, and even authoritarian to a certain extent, but it isn't exactly a dictatorship per se.were it not for the minmatar problem, amarr's stance on slaves would barely be worth mentioning. it's not worse than any of the other dystopic stuff that's going on elsewhere that doesn't get brought up.i didn't see any words in the gallente description with negatives to most people. they didn't work in \"hedonistic\", \"sybaritic\", or \"presumptuous\", for instance. and as noted, there are aspects to the minmatar that are less than positive - just indicating what the valklears are puts a bit of an edge on them, for instance."
"while i agree the initial reaction to slavery is negative, that is due only to our preexisting views. slavery in the empire is a completely different thing than that of the british empire, or modern society.slavery in amarr history, past and present, is done due to the sacred duty we are given in the form of the reclaiming. we are supposed to spread our faith, and slavery is a piece of that process. at least the way that i understand it, slavery is intended more as a rehabilitative tool. while you can dispute that with examples of those who simply treat slavery as it is on earth, it does not change the intent and purpose of it in new eden and the amarr empire. \"god named them the rightful masters of the world [20] and tasked the amarr, through the leadership of the amarr emperor, with conquering the fallen people of the universe and bringing them back to his grace\" quote. and later, \"the reclaiming is viewed as a sacred duty, with amarr citizens required by god to teach and guide the other races toward the amarr faith. slavery is thus necessary penance for refusing to embrace god.\" remember, that slaves are not necessarily going to remain as slaves for their whole life either. at least the way i read it, proper rehabilitation is supposed to lead to the resulting freedom of the slaves.basically, while i know what you're getting at, i don't view this as a problem for the empire. if anything, it should encourage a second look if someone is interested in getting deeper into the story and lore in the game. and yes, even if the minmatar weren't existent, i do think it is an important part of the backgroundas far as the other empires, well sure it depends on your perspective, and the relevant subfaction, but none of them are any 'better' than the amarr. caldari are an authoritative regime that has a strict duty-based system, which allows for little at least public freedoms. gallente call themselves a democracy, but there is a lot of propaganda there covering things up, i would imagine both internally and externally. as for the tribals who call themselves a republic, these are the terrorist insurrectionists in new eden. now is that due to my bias, maybe, but there is definitely precedence there supporting that claim. in fairness, i have not studied the other factions nearly as much as i would have liked, so i apologize if i was incorrect in anything that i said in regards to the other empires.if you want people to see more (negative or positive) of a specific faction, they need to actually be interested in looking at it in the first place. and if they are willing to look at the lore, they will. i'm sure they can find 'negative' aspects by simply looking into the established history and lore of the different empires, so i don't think it is necessary to adjust the intro paragraphs."
"exactly my view, but i do think that those opening paragraphs should be tailored a bit to project a 'gray vs gray' outlook rather than giving an impression of two empires that are interesting and have a dark side, versus two empires that are also interesting, but which radiate fluffy bunnies, rainbows, and apple pie. a new player may only see that little bit before deciding, and afterward might not want to restart a character after they start to get into the lore."
"i can understand that, but the truth is that the people who care about the background are going to look into it themselves, and they will find it all out anyway. for a single paragraph description, they do a pretty good job on describing key information on all of the empires. even the federation and republic, because depending on where you live, the very words federation and republic suggest more freedom than state or empire do, which could be considered bias. really though, it's just the way the empires are, and at least personally, i like what they did with it."

"arbitrary restrictions are bad for you, better solution:1. make friendly npc's actually friendly (someone broke something )2. introduce poison pills in all missions .. example is fox hunt where an item has to be collected, opponent can force a 'mission:failed' by getting it (or make some cash selling it to mission whore ).3. only spawn in hostile space.the pills alone would make the bomber obsolete within a month as they have no hope in hell of killing the most common mission hunters (frigs) .. if he can't kill the predator the mission is effectively forfeited, he takes standings hit and will eventually be booted.number three is there \"just because\" .. makes no sense for missions to go to friendly space, at least not when it is the same missions as on can get to hostile ditto. alternative is to create a new set of missions more appropriate for friendly space, such as \"build this\", \"mine there\" or \"salvage that\"."
"what is it with faction war people and the need to restrict everything.first there are people screaming for restricting stabs in plexes, because they are able to flee combat.now it's the missions, rather strange i haven't heard about those the moment people where able to get lp from plexes.pirates life from those mission runners, and the lp is not even close to that people can get from plexes."
"speaking from experience, no. i can count the number of times anyone - pirate or opposing fw pilot - has followed me into or otherwise harassed me on a mission on one hand, and i've run at least a few hundred of them. the beacons are up there for everyone to see, but they're almost invariably ignored - the structure of the mission deadspace means that by the time you do get to them, the preferred ships (bombers as noted or fast cruisers) are well away from the beacon, and any half-awake mission runner sees you coming on scan anyway.200k lp per hour is a low end estimate. they're way the heck better than anything you get from plexes and despite the nerfs from retribution, a total income of \"a few to several hundred million an hour depending on what you buy from the lp store\" remains the norm to someone dedicated to farming them. plex may have been what were highly publicized during the farming era, because they were still quite profitable and could be done even more trivially, but missions were where the real money was at, and still are.now, rewards that high are probably an issue but i don't have a problem with them being lucrative in general. it's lowsec and is notionally a warzone, after all. but the risk:reward is way off, and a large part of that is the missions themselves. almost all of them are warp in and kill one thing (or several things in the case of the hauler destruction missions). there are item recovery missions, but few people actually accept those - they take longer. the end result is that your exposure, the time spent hanging out in the deadspace, is very low; you're typically in and out of the system in five minutes, tops. plus, the structure of the mission deadspace is conducive to safety as well. like the old plexes, the actual target of the mission is 50-80km away from the warp-in point. that gives you plenty of space to move away from the beacon and react to any potential attackers, even if you're not spamming d-scan to see them coming.bombers only exacerbate the risk:reward factor, since they can move about the warzone with near impunity thanks to their cloak. the places you can die in one are a) get horribly unlucky on a gate and get decloaked, b) get horribly unlucky on the warp gate to the mission and c) get horribly unlucky with someone following you through the warpgate right after you warp in. and given that, as i mentioned before, my experience is for most people to simply ignore the missions, b and c are unlikely.still, the solution is not to overtly target bombers with the nerf. while they're most people's preferred ships because of the aforementioned safety, a stealth fit tengu or any fast cruiser with an improved cloak to evade gatecamps (and frankly the cloak is optional) can do them almost as fast and with almost as little danger. so we need to look elsewhere.first: change the mission layout. do what was done with the plexes and move the warpin closer to the objective. doesn't do anything about people mashing dscan, of course, but that can't be helped. second: require players to kill everything to complete the mission instead of just the objective, and then use that as a dial to balance how long it takes to complete the mission. in their current form i'd say they have way too many npcs in them, but that's easy to change. this is where the nerf to bombers comes in especially, since bombers will have a lot more trouble killing frigates than a more suitable ship would.those two combined will up the risk by obliging players to use easier to catch ships and spending a little more time in mission, and lower the reward by making it take a little longer."

"we know that ccp are looking into possible discounts for continued subs and discounts off second accounts further than just the current power of two offer that is available from time to time.a nice feature i would like to see would be to move characters between my accounts without having to pay the plex cost. there would need to be a cooldown on this to prevent load/abuse, but i think being able to essentially be able to make it easier for me to control which of my different characters are available to be online without having to think of it far in advance of pony up on plex costs would be a very effective tool."

"i feel that current rats in asteroid belts are immaterial and serve no purpose. fighting for your right to mine is a fun idea, so let's make it fun and part of the game. i propose scrapping the current system of spawning belt rats and replacing it with one that is reactionary and scales with the number of players.my method for doing this uses asteroids like spawn triggers in missions. when an asteroid is mined, it has a chance of spawning a rat; higher quality (+5% and +10%) asteroids should have higher spawn rates. the trigger must be when mined initially, not on destruction. this should be obvious, but i want no misunderstanding.in this scenario, the lone miner will find himself under fire more often, but to no greater effect than current rats. an occasional pest, which can be avoided by mining the normal yield asteroids.when you have a mining fleet, spawns will scale up because more asteroids are being mined at once. this could be expanded for mission runners and miners to play together, while applying their individual crafts.or maybe i'm a fool. what says the internet?"

"****what i had in mind is to give to lowsec a purpose, an identity. the purpose is a quick buck (at least faster and bigger isk rewards than highsec) the identity would be the transition btw highsec and lowsec into null and viceversa.how to achieve those things?***quick buck- exploration- missions- mining (drug manufacturing should be available in lowsec too)(the new tagforsec idea is very welcomed into this script)all of those activities need to be doable fast but yield more isk than they do in highsec. - exploration: there is need a faster spawn rate of plexes (1-3/10). u dont want bears come form highsec and search for hours for something meaningful, because they ll be probably dead.- missions: lot and faster npc spawns. shorter but dense missions.- rare spawn of dense rare materials in standard asteroids, which u can deplete in15 mins max and should yield a nice amount of isk. hint: there would be a need of fine tuning. these activities shouldnt be to short so that the bears have chance to be caught. risk vs reward should be present. 15 min should be enough for each.***transition highsec<>lowsec<>wh or nullsecthere are few stakeholders that are meaningfull for this transition:- casual highsec visitors (they are after the quick buck and we settled them with previous tips)the other group is:- corps/alliances that became too good for highsec and they want to try the end game (wh/nullsec). the trial for the endgame should be lowsec, but how to motivate those group to try first lowsec? bare with me little more and i it will be a bit more clear.- booted nullsec alliances/corps. they should retire into lowsec, reorginize and consolidate. but why would they do that when u literally will have harder time to survive in lowsec than in null? answer coming soon.- entities that like lowsec mechanics (organized corps, mercenaries, pirates etc.)- and militia. but i want talk to much about them. cos they are now a sec for themselves and are standing pretty good.the problem is that the lowsec atm. is like null on steroids (difficulty wise) for entities trying to be self sufficient and survive. the isk is very very poor and not there is not lot going on, not a lot ppl to shoot at.whats was the motivation to change the situation. again the same 3 saviours:- exploration: 4,5,6/10 plexes should be more present around lowsec.- missions: lv 4 missions should ve the quality risen at least double to 40.- minning: more meaningful gravitometric anomalies. with dense asteroids that can be depleted faster and yield same or even more than normal.- lowsec stations sohuld be buffed a bitand the ultimate motivation, sovereignty?highsec should ve the beggining of the ownership with poss.militia has its own sovereigntywh has its own. u can claim a wh and make it a fortress, almost inpenetrable.and null sec that we know all about.sow what kind of sovereignty lowsec needs?not the generic, stadardized sov, but fictional. sov claimed by presence and dominion in an area. but to motivate that dominion we need that area to be a bit more special.my corp recently moved into a system, attractive one and i think we made our presence noticed. we achieved some kind of dominion because all entities that were around before, are not anymore. why we choose that system. it has some nice composition of moons, where we settled our pocos. we receive taxes and do our own pi. it is connected with highsec. which means some more taxes trough pi and camping opportunity. it has 2 lv 4 agents and 1 lv 5. the system is pretty good but is not even close enough. all of our members have alts elsewhere adding helping our mains and corp to be competitive.so how to make the areas interesting for dominion.make them special. make some constellations or systems have higher spawn rate for 4,5,6/10 plexes. make some areas awesome for mining industry. make some places awesome for drug manufacturing and some with awesome agents. make some stations having even bigger bonuses. some with lots of wh openings.that kind of lowsec would be damn attractive. and would make a perfect highway for nullsec with some motels.and in my opinion only when that kind of lowsec is balanced compared to highsec, u will have easier time to revamp nullsec and u ll know exaclty what to buff and how to buff."
"lowsec needs none of those things. none of these things will change a thing.it needs fewer garr pirates, and ppl will come. identify the cause, remove the cause, problem goes away. ignore the cause, pretend it's not the cause, change things other than the cause, problem remains. choices and consequences. the lowsec choice = pewpew on carebear pve fits for riskless kms.the lowsec consequence = carebears left.no amount of workarounds on your part will remove the consequences of your choices.unwilling to change your choices = accepting the consequences - accepting lowsec."
"this is a very good point, though it could also lead to massive super alliances... would have to admit that this is dangerous territory. on the other hand, a lot of players value their individuality on either a player or group level, so coalitions may be more likely - though on a much smaller scale than right now and in a very different way, covering timezones instead of regions?edit: seems like the latest csm minutes discuss a proposal much like this one... iiiiinteresting. seems there's more people thinking about this than i thought :)"
"while i would love this personally, it'd be exploited to death with buddy invites etc. i can't see this one happening in the future, sorry bro!"
"while i would love this too since i tend to move alts to different accounts after they are trained, as to train another one.i don't think ccp wants to lose the 2 plex i pay each time i do it. so, not seeing that this would work out good."
"how does ccp tell which accounts are owned by whom?"
"if you take the data from an eve system (like the mass, radius, density, orbit distance etc of the moons/stars/planets/stations) and use that data to recreate the system in a gravity simulation program, you will find that mass-radius-density interactions are correct, and that when you run the simulation, the system will likely not collapse or fly apart (stable orbits)."
"adding more/better physics will add to gameplay. just think of the possibilities orbiting a planet in a fast, small ship will keep you from falling into the planet but if a larger, slower ship were to scan you down and warp to you, they would get pulled into the planet. lot's of new mechanics and strategies could be made.the only problem is ccp have stated many times they want the greatest bang for their buck so working on something like this for minimal returns wouldn't be realistic.hopefully someday in the future when ccp can afford twice the number of developers this can be implemented.herping your derp since 19potato - [url="

"what was the purpose of reposting the exact same thing in a new thread? summary of eves last four expansions:"
"op... answer me this one question...where do changes like this end?because they never seem to. it just seems that things have been made incrementally safer and/or encourage people to avoid conflict over a the years. and this invites more risk adverse people to join the game and then advocate for better security and safety... which invites more risk adverse people to join... and the cycle seems to just keep looping back and feeding on itself.and here's the best part; it changes nothing in the grand scheme of things.creating an npc response to attacking people in low-sec will only force \"pirates\" to adopt suicide ganker tactics (except you can escape from these types of ganks) and the standings hits will just make \"pirates\" live full time in poss... which is something only the rich can do (no more \"poor pirates\"... just the \"good ones\" that know what they are doing). this means that the risk adverse people will still not go out into low-sec because they can still be killed just as easily.nothing will change except for the fact that you have dramatically raised the entry barrier into \"piracy.\"oh... but it doesn't stop there. if more ideas along the same lines as this one are put forth you'll have more changes being made that make \"illegal attacks\" more punitive and more draconian until you eventually have another version of high-sec."
"to be viewed by a different audience.as i explained clearly, the goal is to increase the appeal of lowsec by enabling gameplay. the idea that people are not going to lowsec because they are risk averse is mostly false- some fall in to this category, but they generally don't stay in eve for the long term anyway. more important is that lowsec mechanics prevent many types of gameplay from occuring for a majority of players. if all of my long list of ideas is forgotten or discredited, this core principle remains.as i also explained clearly, it's only a set of brainstorming ideas. if you have a better one to address the problem, please put it forward. if you don't have that, then please describe in detail why the mechanics won't achieve the stated goal. your current explanations assume that risk-aversion is the dominant motivation, while i am assuming something entirely different.the unstated (until now) issue is that any assumption of motivations by a large number of players is just that, an assumption. in the absence of actual data, we can only go with the idea that makes the most sense. i find that simply projecting the antithesis of one's own behavior onto anyone that doesn't behave like yourself is not an accurate way to judge the behavior of others."
"note: i've since been convinced by nick narrell that the better approach is to reduce the gap between pvp and pve. a pve pilot will be more likely to engage in emergent pvp if his current ship has a fighting chance at it, instead of being completely at the mercy of any pvp fit pilot."

"there is lot more than that. if carebears could earn 1-2x the value of their ship in one trip. there would be more and more visiting. even now there are quite few visitors, it is getting better.what really is missing is organised group. atm to be self sufficient in lowsec is much more harder than both wh and nullsec."

"solution to 1: use \"brain in a box\" to tie to \"activity line in a box\" so that each job in an activity line is calculated based on the skills of the person preparing the jobsolution to 2: rather than change existing refinery modules, introduce two new modules: refinery and reprocessing plant add the new functionality to these two modules thus the only legacy code to interfere with is the \"this thing requires cpu & pg from the anchored ct\" then when modular poses come along, both the \"line activity in a box\" and the refinery/reprocessing code can be reused oh, and as a freebie you get to replace existing \"refineries\" with the new refinery and reprocessing activity lines"

"what would we call this? harvesting gankbear tears? doesn't sound catchy enough. hmmm."
"nothing will push high sec people into low sec if it is not atleast as safe and profitable as high sec. that being said low-sec is not scary. i remember the first time i jumped into atlar with my blood pumping so hard my ears were ringing. all my little noob life everyone told me how scary low sec was. then i got a fight, killed a frigate, lost my cruiser and my pod and while staring at the station wall realized...holy crap that was fun! i have since lived in low sec most of my eve life, first as a carebear(ish) and later as a pirate. one of my past corps even mined in hulks in low-sec while the pipes ahead were scouted and gates were camped. later i became a pirate myself and im telling you if you know the game mechanics you can easily get into and out of low-sec with minimal danger. its just getting past that initial culture of high-sec carelessness and adopting street smarts that is hard for most bears. there is no point in making low-sec more friendly or you are in essense expanding high-sec into low and tbh there is already plenty of high sec for everyone. maybe even too much."
"they should either increase the risk in highsec, or reduce the income from highsec. lowsec is fine."
"i appreciate your explanation... i just don't buy it.if you know what you are doing low-sec is already very \"low risk.\" hell... you should see the amount of haulers and freighters that come and go through low-sec already. my alt is one of them. and he makes a killing in terms of profits by selling much needed ships and equipment to outlaws such as myself at a premium. as far as low-sec \"preventing many types of gameplay\" due to its nature... i can say the same of high-sec and null-sec. the simple fact of the matter is... no real consensus will ever come with regards to how each should behave in relation to the other. high-sec, low-sec, and null-sec all require different types of methods and styles of gameplay. the problem for many is that that the game's general mantra is that more risk should produce more reward. not the other way around. the issue is that there is no real problem and people are still trying to create one. if people learn to manage risk and use the options they have available they can do things they never thought possible.i mainly fly blockade runners around an active faction warfare zone seeding equipment and ships. i have flown through amamake's gatecamps. i have only been caught once (and that was because i screwed up using the mwd-cloak trick using a deep space transport early on).this is true. i do believe that \"risk aversion\" is a dominant motivation.many get ganked the first few times they jump in and and then decide that it just isn't worth another try. this is a common sight within the minmatar militia as many new recruits get caught in the amamake-ossogur gatecamp... after which they become scared of jumping into low-sec (even through alternate routes) without an \"escort.\"again... once people learn how to enter and exit low-sec safely, there is little issue. it's the initial experiences that scars people. and yes... i will concede... you can't really put this into hard data either way without doing numerous and detailed surveys of many, many players. except that even this should be taken with a grain of salt as the first reaction of many is to \"create greater security\" rather than adapt to the current degree of hostilities."
"ecm is a force multiplyer and it's designed in a terrible way and isn't subject to stacking penalty. since a falcon is generally balanced around keeping 3-4 ships jammed, when you're the solo target even in an eccm'd bs with only 1 racial of your sensor type on you, you are probably still going to be permajammed.ccp knows it's broken and has promised us further changes/balancing in the future. hopefully ccp fozzie will follow through with his promises.

"better question? 'why is csm'?after reading the csm 7 meetings minutes, i don't see any reason for csm to continue.why don't we just save the game time spent on voting and send ccp messages saying, 'just do what you want to do.' every few weeks. they're going to do it anyway.there is a possibility that ccp's money making schemes would be affected by player input. let's not let that happen.seriously, if ccp went out of business, what would we play?"
"i know what seven is on about. having read the minutes of the meeting, i also wonder who the csm speak to in-game. i suspect it is only to the corp/alliance they are in as they do not seem to speak to, or get the opinions of, those who voted them in.at voting time, i am usually sent an evemail requesting me to vote someone onto the csm. once i have placed my vote, i hear nothing more until the next election. how hard can it be for those that are elected to occasionally to sent a mailshot out to the people that voted them in (if they know) for some sort of opinion? ok not everyone will respond but that is the nature of politics."

"pirates, even rl historical ones, prey on the weak defenseless merchant ships. there is not a single story i can remember of any successful pirate who only went around attacking any of the contoling power's navy. the ones who met the navy usually ended up bleeding on their own deck or hanging by a rope on a yard-arm. so yes. ganking defenseless ships and taking their loot is a totally acceptable enterprise for people like me to make money. now that everyone has a bounty it is even more profitable. so yes, if i see your defenseless ship in low-sec i will probably pop it and sell your blood stained items to the next person who comes along. that being said i also love me some pvp and keep a well-stocked hangar full of various t1 frigates, crusiers, bc and bs which from time to time i go and visit the real boost to low sec: fw. people complain about low sec now but a few years ago it was so dead you could hear a rifter backfire from ten high sec systems away. fw brought tons of pvp-willing people who are always happy to try and blob the hell out of a red flashy and they are usually successful cause i don't mind taking bad odds and i don't give a crap about kb and stats. low sec has its own rewards. it's like living in a ghetto...someone is always trying to kill you, you are always trying to kill someone else and the only thing that keeps you alive is your understanding of game mechanics and skill. quit trying to make carebears come here and don't try and make it high sec v2.0 to get them here. you might not understand the play style, you may not like the risk of being ganked by someone like me but your also free to live in the some odd thousand systems covered by concord."
"i fully agree with everything u said. but dont get the point or the context that fits within this thread."
"the first half was dealing with the people saying it needs less yarr and ganking is bad. the last 2 setences mostly says it all...there are like 3 of the \"what low sec needs\" \"how to make carebears come to low sec\" posts rolling right now. my point is low sec isn't broken. fw brought in new life. it is very active and attractive to the people who want to live there. you could buff every mission, mining opportunity, npc rat and exploration site until it is paradise on eve but it is not going to make anyone move there who is already afraid to make the plunge. it is not dead. it does not have problems because it is missing isk making opportunites. infact with the recent aggression/criminal changes i'd say it is as perfect as it has ever been in my 6+ years of living in it. if it aint broke don't fix it."
"and your are living completely from lowsec. u dont have any alt in highsec/nullsec/wh or fw which boost your isk wallet, right?"
"yes...i support myself entirely on the contents of my victims wrecks or ransoms. i have one pi planet that im always forgeting to renew the harvesting things on...but it makes me less than 5m a month....and from time to time when i get desparately low on isk i'll scan out a plex or annom...but that is when the bullet supply is in jeprody...90% or more of my income comes from re-selling blood stained loot...."
"great u are a true lowsec citizen, but unfortunately u are 1 of those that fits in 5% while the rest of 95% unfortunately finds they resources elsewhere."
"i'll take that as a compliment...but the point i was trying to make is that you could get every item on your wish list and maybe get another 5% of players to come into low sec. i remember when they added bs rats...that was supposed to attract ninja ratters...who all died horribly (some of them to my guns) and aside from the occasional noob no one really goes to low sec to rat unless their suicidal. if you add something in low sec so rare that it would attract attention it would probably end up like the high end low sec moons: all owned by 0.0 alliances. and there is nothing to be ashamed of because your low sec character is supported by an alt. especially if you pvp alot and loose ships all the time. pvp for pvp's sake don't pay well, you have to gank to bank. null and high are good for self-support, low isn't but the pvp opportunites are unrivialed by either. i guess the way i see it you fit your play style around the game and don't ask the game to fit itself to your play style."
"ofc it was a compliment. for example lowsec cant offer me all the isk i need, so i need to find it elsewhere. dont u agree that if the conditions were better u d see quite few more self sufficient corps/alliances in lowsec? be it they come from highsec to find better opportunities or few that will get back from nullsec if they are chased away. now if a nullsec /corp/alliance comes to regroup get stronger, they d just disband in this harsh enviroment. even and for a moment dont look at fw as a part of lowsec. for me is the sec on its own, same like 0.0 and npc 0.0. we moved in this region and we are quite happy. there is so much more activity. before this we were basically in all lowsec parts/corners and the situation was desperate. 75% od lowsec is dead.i dont want lowsec to depend on fw. it should depend of itself."
"many many moons ago i was in free galactic enterprises, the founding corp of the long ago failed frege alliance. after we got our behinds tossed out of 0.0 and the alliance fell apart we moved to aranir in derelik. we ran missions for ammatar fleet, locked the system down and our miners mined (in hulks no less) enough minerals to build everything from ammo to cap ships. there is isk to be made in low sec and a dedicated corporation that is not risk-adverse can repeat what we did. not even once did any of us think our selves as having the short end of the stick because we lived there...we could have just as easily lived in high sec. but it gave us all what we wanted. the members like me who wanted pew got it. the ones who wanted to mine and produce got that too. we just were fearless after a rather brutal 0.0 fight and were not afraid of losses. there is a mental block that tells you to stay safe and not take risks, once you manage to hurdle that barrier the sky is the limit in eve. until you can make players pass that block you could hand them free isk on the other side of a low sec gate and they still wouldn't jump in."
"well u are right but still there is a fact that those kind of entities are just so few, like the fact is that lowsec is much more harsher to survive than both wh and null. because members of corps have lot of harder time finding both the isk and interaction than in other secs. i dont say it is impossible, afterall balex is already 6 years in lowsec (with few small pauses). before i came in balex i was in nullsec whole time with some small amount time in wh and from my own experience lowsec is the endgame of eve atm."
"have you ever run drugs through empire? then you know that at just about every gate, you get this epically annoying prompt asking if you want to hand it over to the fuzz.i can't think of anything more annoying and unnecessary and dangerous as this (maybe a warning prompt everytime you enter lowsec that never goes away). running drugs through empire in a cruiser or lower is almost no risk, but this stupid prompt stops you at every gate. if you lag at the prompt or arn't on the ball, you can lose your ship or the drugs for no reason.why would i willfully hand over the 100mil in pills i just bought?at the very least make it do not show again.if you want to make drug running dangerous, just make possession of pills a defacto reason for empire navies to attack you."
"i think its rly buggy because i got the message one second before i was able to jump but if i warp off from a gate with a ceptor nothing happens???best thing was i clicked no but i payed them anyway?!!!"
"add the tickbox but make drug running more like 'real life':- random chance based on system security that police scans cargo.- if contraband is detected, roadblocks are set up (can't dock and can't jump) and perpetrator is flagged as suspect.++ handing over drugs at this point removes roadblock/flag as well as a hefty fine.- criminal now has to shake pursuers (must not be on grid with police for 3 minutes or so) by warping around (safes required, ie. preparation) or kill all the officers present at time of initial cargo scan taking a sec. status hit.then:- add drugs to market database.- allow affiliations with pirate organizations (serpentis etc.) that decrease chance of scan.- redo low-sec to give pirate affiliated organizations bonuses to drug manufacturing at pos (new and improved please).but first things first; there should not be a pop-up without a 'do no show this again' tickbox!"
"keep in mind that the caldari medal is from a time when there were no incentives/carrots (and no sticks for that matter) whatsoever .. it was done simply because they could and to troll the snot out of gallente.now we have lp for everything, particularly farming plexing, that not only yields stupid amounts of lp/isk but restricts access to systems ..create a medal and stick it in the lp store for 100m lp which should be (ball-park) what the last years worth of incentives has given the individual farmer plexer .."

"overviewthe proposal i would like to suggest would be to overhaul the mechanics, ships and functions of black ops and force recon. black ops ships and force recon tie together hand in hand but are currently not used very often in today<U+FFFD>s game as it is really limiting new players and players with high and specific skills. the proposed changes would introduce changes to ships and skills with and introduction of new ships and tools to help the black ops and force recon ships.game play changes black operations should be a name of a style of combat and not the battleship. black operations should be a form of game play which allows new-ish players and experienced players the ability to experience and grow black operations together.to be able to perform these changes and introduction and change of ships would be needed.why changeblack operations in itself is reliant on so many different factors that make it very difficult to use. black operations is very dependent the ability to move ships from point a to point b to perform its tasks. to be able to do this the black ops battleship is required to use faction isotopes to allow the other ships and its self to jump to other systems. the amount of isotopes used is dependent on: ship size (mass)distance to targetas there are no tools giving the ability to judge the distance for bridging against the amount of isotopes required. it makes the job of a single or multiple bridging<U+FFFD>s and jumps harp to determine. because of the reliance of the isotopes as fuel against the size of ship and distance it would make sense to introduce more classes of ships to allow a variety of fleet sizes.concept introduce a whole black operations class of ships from frigate to carrier all still based upon the aspect that all ships would need to be able to be fitted with the tier 3 cloaking device or designated as a portal generator ship.the black operations ships would be:black ops frigatecovert opsbombertackler

logistics as per the new logistics ship given at the 2012 eve tournament the black ops logistics ships would be a variant of this ship. all the ship classes would be relevant to the current versions (frigate and cruiser) the only new one would be the destroyer class logistics which would be a variant change and the difference between the frigate and cruiser.the t3 cruiser is use full but the cost, size & speed of the ship limits this type of ship really to be jumped into a battleship class fight. it would not be good as a frigate or destroyer fleet.black ops noctis the black ops noctis would be limited to the same category as the battle ships where it is a black ops ship and can bridge through black ops ship but can nit use a covert ops cloaking device. this noctis would have all the standard noctic specifications nit have the ability to have a fuel storage are for black ops battle ships to use. command shipsblack ops command ships are not able to fit the normal standard warfare links but fit a black ops warfare link.command ships are not effected by ecm or tracking disruption. the role of a command ship is to give bonuses but not necessarily command the fight. because everything is manual and not automatic it gives the command ship pilot more work to do protecting his own pilots.black ops command ships are able to lock up to a number of ships dependent on skills and the type of ship flown. e.g. carrier = 50, battleship = 30, cruiser = 15 contiunued on part ii"

"have you considered maybe sending them an eve-mail to try to address something? see if you can chat with them every now and then. the forums are not the only medium they respond to. that reminds me. i need to get in touch again. it's been a long time for me since i last contacted my representative but that's because my account was in cryostasis for some time."
"i could contact my rep if i knew who they were when elected. maybe i am not looking hard enough. reading the wiki, any issues are raised in a new topic in the forum and may be supported by a csm member if worthy of following up. best that there can be i suppose with the large numbers of people in the game. i do realise there are a lot more experienced players than myself in eve but cannot help thinking that matters raised at meetings between ccp and the csm regarding proposals are biased towards the big alliances and to their advantage."
"in the summit minutes, ccp listed a number of things they would like to address regarding 0.0 and in the following discussion they seemed to introduce more skeletal points they would like to address rather than solutions to these problems. the issues ccp would like to address are as follows in no particular order: 0.0 alliances control a large area they are not utilizing. ccp wants to avoid vacant systems and for alliances to 'use or lose' sov. large areas of sov control and presence of blob warfare make it difficult for a small alliance to carve out an area of their own in the shadow of large coalitions. blob warfare is common because there's very little players feel that small fleets can accomplish. they want more objectives for small groups to undertake. industry in 0.0 does not exists, not profitable enough, better to just import from empire. some parts of space could be more resourceful and a greater prize for large alliances, while less resourceful space could be less contested, giving some smaller alliances a chance to stake their claim. ccp minutes mentioned luring industrialists out to 0.0 with more efficient research or quicker manufacturing capabilities. my proposal- imagine sov structures tied to the pos system. (this is debatable, but laid the basis of an idea that can be molded as ccp sees fit) each sov structure would need to be fueled by the alliance in control. this fuel could come in the form of unstable isotopes. these isotopes could have a half life that is tied with the jump system. for the remainder for the remainder of this post i will use uranium 235 as an example (u235) since it is both familiar to many readers and all ready used as a fuel source! u235 could be used as is or combined with other pi/ice products to create sov structure fuel blocks. i will continue with the notion they would be used as is. imagine that an alliance has a particularly resourceful system and wants to extract fuel for their sov structures. once acquired, an industrial ship loaded with 1 million units of u235 upon jumping from main hub to next system, half of his cargo hold is converted from u235 to thorium 231 (natural decay product in the real world... i'm a biochemist, let me use my fancy science!!) leaving him with 500 k units of u235 and 500 k units of th231. he then makes another jump and now his cargo hold contains 250 k units of u235 and 750 units of th231. also, those janitors in his cargo hold have had their faces melted off and are now units of zombies!!!!! (one can hope!) perhaps that thorium 231 could even be used to make charges???!!!where would this u235 come from? perhaps each time a miner's laser cycle completes there's a 5% chance tor an additional amount of u235 equal to say 10% of the miner's yield to have been found within the ore. (numbers subject to balancing of course) whether this additional u235 was in a refined state or ore like state (favored) is irrelevant, so long as they were still subject to decay. in addition, pi extractors could had a chance of finding an additional x units of u235 per cycle and could automatically be routed to the launchpad or silo. these yield numbers could also vary slightly depending on system/constellation to provice one more facet for defining more resourceful areas for large alliances to contest over and less resourceful areas for smaller alliances to gain a foothold. this would require alliances to utilize the systems they claim sov of, provide a need for industry pilots to exist in 0.0, large alliances that could afford the decay rates could even fuel a larger area without making the most of their systems, but would limit the scope of vacant but still claimed space, and with a need for more industry pilots in 0.0, the markets could also grow to the point where it would be more worth wile to produce in 0.0 than import from empire. small fleets could still play a role in sov by disrupting enemy mining operations or protecting their own. we all know how effective that can be in high sec. perhaps spawns of valuable rats could even increase depending on the number of ships in belt to reward the combat pilots for hours of staring at strange blue lights they know nothing about and make coordination a requirement for industrial affairs in 0.0. . . . oh god i just signed up to have more of my precious mining barges blown up!!!!!why the idea of ting sov structures in with pos? if miners and pi folks obtain raw or refined u235 in system, they don't want to waste a half life by taking it to processing. furthermore, the lack of station capabilities is one reason that many systems go vacant! if sov structures were tied to pos functionality, areas that are claimed would be more usable. ccp mentioned increased research efficiency or quicker manufacturing capabilities in 0.0 to lure industrial pilots to take the risk. perhaps this could offer those possibilities. no one enjoys hauling fuel to the pos, and the idea of having to haul fuel to something else would be even more annoying, but by fueling them both in the same place it would be less of a chore. planting a flag (sov structure) that says \"this spot belongs to kno3\" in an empty system seems like an empty gesture, building a shiny pos and then planting that flag would suggest not only have i claimed it, but i am using it. i know there are complications to this, but i'm not familiar enough with the workings of 0.0/poses to discuss them. how would this effect empire? if the empire factions were to fuel their own sov structures by pulling u235 out of their derriere and shipping it using the npc merchant vessels that all ready patrol high sec, hopefully it wouldn't. any u235 harvested in empire wouldn't be shippable to 0.0, and could be refined into either amunition charges, something new entirely, or minerals (though elements -> minerals seems unusual.)"
"i ran out of post characters i welcome your feedback and suggestions and would love for a dev to take notice!!!!thanks for reading- kno3"
"if you actually wanted to learn how to live in lowsec and develop the unique \"street smart\" skills it takes you can earn 300mn (average) for 2-3 hours of exploration work. i made a very handsome living at it and i lived and explored minmatar lowsec for two years straight. i will not live in highsec.but yes, it requires you to understand game mechanics. know your turf. know the other inhabitants of the area and their habits. like i said, street smarts.if you're an idiot you will die. judging by your post i'd say you're going to die."
"by the way.. ccp will not listen to you because there is plenty of opportunity in lowsec. the rewards and the dangers are well balanced. many of us enjoy the game of evading our enemies. lowsec living has an edge to it that 0.0 (blob fest) does not.so quit trying to bring a \"cure\" to a society of eve that is not interested in seeing their turf changed so you can jump from your comfy highsec home to dip in the riches of territory we bleed for.recognition (your fake sov idea).we already do claim space. but we don't need a banner. we claim it by raining bullets and plasma down on your hulls. frankly we'd prefer to keep you unsuspecting. so no thanks, we'd prefer the intel of \"who owns this space\" wasn't so easy to access.your wow-like petitionfurthermore i am disgusted by your petition. you are just one more person in a string of lazy nubs who want ccp to make this game easy!get it into your head. eve is hard!many of us like it that way. it truly means something when you've mastered a lifestyle in this game. i have mastered lowsec. it took me two years. now i'm onto my next great challenge. and this if the best thing about eve. it has diversity of lifestyles that present a whole new set of challenges.the day this game gets simplified, homogenized, and dumbed down for the wow wusses is the day i cancel my accounts."
"get off your condescending high horse. learn about economics and put in some hard work of making yourself successful at pve. i get the feeling all you want to do is \"make a quick buck\" so you can easily afford to fly something other than tech 1 battlecruisers.newsflash: more risk = more isk = nicer ships. in 0.0 has great rewards, but you can also lose your stations. generally you can evacuate in time.wormhole space have some of the best rewards, but you are also risking everything. it's all on the line 100% of the time.what does lowsec have? no maintenance fees. no fuel costs for starbases (as is the case in w-space life) no risk of losing anything you don't undock.so please explain why you need a \"quick\" buck when you got nothing on the line?"
"yep. what he said. fuzzy high sec carebears rarely shave their hides."
"i am quite good at making isk. got more than enough for my expensive toys (ofc isk is not coming from lowsec).been both in nullsec and wh. and if stronger entity comes in u move somewhere else. same is in lowsec, if a stronger entity comes in your system and camp u, u move somewhere else. so pls dont come to me with the speech nullsec bears risk everything.also we got more poses than most of wh corps.also why lowsec has the nickname lowsux?why at least 75% of lowsec is deserted?why only interesting place is around fw systems?and i welcome coven into lowsec and live few months and live only from lowsec. firstly u d never come cos it sucks badly, 2nd if u came u d disband in no time. why? cos compared to null and wh it sucks badly."
"zloco what do you think about this idea? would something like that benefit lowsec? would you like some pro pirate hunters coming after you? they would make more challenging targets then your average pve fit careber, you would probably get better fights."
"greetings,just had a fleeting thought that it would be a nice system to implement the petitions like whitehouse.gov and change.org into eve, either answered by the csm or even ccp directly. for those that don't know: let's say you have an idea/proposal. you write it up and post it. you get so many people to sign it and it goes public and searchable. let's say 20 people sign it through you telling them about the idea. then i can come around, take a look at public, and sign petitions that i agree with. once it hits a certain number of signatures.... idk, let's say 3,000, csm or ccp has to respond to it.thought i'd throw it out there."
"it would help get the players ideas voiced properly.however, when there are alliances out there with 1000+ members, they would dictate most of the suggestions that get through."
"but even if ccp did respond to them, we'd still get three near identical 'nerf cloaks!!!1!!1!!!111111' threads every week."
"is it ccp's job to implement mechanics which specifically encourage 24/7 alliances rather than leaving it to the players to decide their membership?"
"^^ this.the unified inventory debacle is proof of this in my eyes. from may to december 2012 we had to deal with how lacking it was.the excuse ccp unifex uses that \"a pos revamp would require its own release\" is just being used to either hold off until this blows over or not do it at all because when they tried to fix the unified inventory it took the release of retribution to fix it. sounds to me like they now understand that the ui fix was more than they could handle after the fact, and don't want to have another 6 or 7 month window of pos'es being worse than they are now.now, if they went to a modular pos setup most of the in game art and mechanics are already here (please see my post on this here) by using sansha/gurista/serpentis/angel stations for the art and player owned outposts for the mechanics. examples would be +1 to dock, +5 to use modpos services, +10 to run jobs from the personal hangar (either npc station with skills or from the corporate modpos). legacy code could eventually be removed as it wouldn't be used anymore, and it solves the security/access/management problems we all are facing now."
"screw infiltration, i want to have a realistic field of options for providing roles to my members.ccp already mentioned custom corp hangars, we just need corporations to be revamped altogether.i'm tired of providing someone a role and they only need to utilize a small portion of it. i don't enjoy losing billions of isk thanks to a easy click-and-drag, that i knew could happen at any moment, when i only want that member to be making ammo. i should be able to see exactly what i want my member to be able to do, and have options to limit it. there is literately so many ways this could be done! let me explain.i'm sure a number of you are familiar with \"conditional formatting\" in spreadsheets: well something like that. you stick in \"starbase fuel technician\", you have options to specify when and/or where the role will work. we could be talking specific towers, systems, constellations, regions, specific security status, minimum/maximum isk levels, when a specific member is in that system.... so many things!when it comes to corp roles, its trust everyone or trust no-one. some are stupider than the rest. some only pretend to know what they are doing."
"great idea, i've seen similar before but this is neatly summed as to what needs to be fixed asap. i'm running an industrial corp myself, but i'm not willing to allow any acces to pos if i ever do set one up, as it will be a massive security liability.naturally i'd like to see more borked corp roles fixed, but if this at the very least gets fixed we can at least start moving forward."
"reduce drastically their signature and improve their ai ( give a prograing command to return if on fire/ locked/ damaged ) new pos system new sov system"
"great news: low sec already has \"gameplay\" enabled, so your goal is achieved without the implementation of your game-breaking ideas.what types of gameplay do lowsec mechanics specifically disable? here is the trick though: try to answer that question without relying on risk aversion by players, which, mind you, is not a mechanic of low-sec."
"never understood risk-aversion in players. i started eve in a highsec mining corp for months, then immediately left with a couple of my mates, formed my own corp, put up a platinum moon-mining pos in devoid-lowsec, and proceeded to live out there for months, we still operated just fine, even with test burning null and lowsec not 3 doors over for days at a time. granted im now in a wormhole merc alliance with those same mates, and maybe that just says something about the approach i take to the game, but seriously.i have only ever been ganked once in lowsec, adn that was my own damn fault, i flew an empty bestower into lowsec to pick up 200m3 of trit i had bought a month prior, hit a gatecamp, a crappy one. if i ahd flown anything but an untanked bestower, iw oudl have survived.maybe im biased, but lowsec just doesnt seem all that dangerous, it seems the reason people avoid it isnt because \"oh it keeps me from playing\", its more that they refuse to go anywhere they cant fly an untanked hauler safely, plenty of epople could switch to stealth-haulers and change very little about their old high-sec routine if they moved to lowsec.wow i went on a rant didnt i? well, would prolly eb better to delete all this crap but i guess ill press post anyways."
"the op wishes to increase the appeal of lowsec by destroying the appeal of lowsec."
"exactly.the ops suggestion appears to be making low-sec more akin to hi-sec in order to incentivise people to move from hi-sec to low-sec. but to what end? you have just extended hi-sec, albeit with a very small amount of increased risk and demolished the current low-sec completely... and then consider the change from the \"new\" low-sec to 0.0? the gap just got massive.the proposal is pointless and without merit."
"scamming is legit, though maybe not this particular form of scamming.personally i'd just remove the order from visibility if the buyer does not have the isk to cover it. i don't see why the ingame scc should condone scamming in such a way, if they're the ones controlling the flow of isk in the first place."
"are you new to eve online? scamming has been allowed since forever, some of the most noteworthy things to ever happen in the game revolve around scamming.i think you're playing the wrong game."
"phase onethe aim of phase one is to modify sovereignty mechanics to induce alliances to claim sov over fewer systems and increase the level of activity in these systems. maintaining and increasing sov level will require high levels of activity within the system which can be disrupted by hostile gangs with the potential to erode sov levels and make the system vulnerable. two new game features are introduced: military control and system influence.1 - military controlthis introduces factional warfare style system control mechanics to nullsec. the aim is to make gaining sov easy but maintaining and extending sov difficult and dependent on player activity within the sov system.1.1. in each system with alliance sovereignty pirate faction complexes will spawn during downtime each day. these sites need to be scanned down and when their acceleration gate is approached within 10km they will be flagged as discovered and visible to anyone on the overview.1.2 pirate faction complexes can only be accessed by certain ship types based on the complex type as per factional warfare mechanics.1.3 initially the acceleration gate can only be activated by members of the sov holding alliance. once activated for the first time the complex is set to activated and this status is visible to anyone in the overview (flagged differently to discovered status sites). once activated anyone can access the site in accordance to ship type restrictions.1.4 the site must be controlled within 1 hour of activation otherwise it reverts to a status of pirate controlled. this is an end state. the site will be removed at downtime and degrade the system's military control level at that time.1.5 if the sov holding alliance controls the site, by destroying all npcs present and orbiting the control button within 10kms for 10 minutes, the site is set to alliance controlled status. this is an end state. the site will be removed at downtime and will increase the military control level at that time.1.6 if the site is controlled by players not in the sov holding alliance the site is set to hostile controlled status. this is an end state. the site will be removed at downtime and degrade the system's military control level at that time.1.7 military control is graded from 0.00 (lowest) to 5.00 (highest). when sov is first gained military control is set to 3.00.1.8 military control will persist and change each downtime as a result of the number or pirate/hostile controlled and alliance controlled complexes. if all complexes are pirate/hostile controlled at downtime the military control level will fall by 1 point. if all complexes are alliance controlled the military control level with increase by 1 point. where there is split control this will be applied proportionately.1.9 a system's effective sov level (which counts for bonuses and the system upgrades that can be installed) is the lower of the strategic level (based on days occupancy as per current mechanics) and the military control level. hence where military control levels fall below the strategic level any system upgrades depending on that level will be offlined (jump bridges, cyno generators, cyno jammers). also bonuses from system upgrades will operate at the lower effective sov level. note: upgrades that have been offlined will still count towards sov costs.1.10 once a tcu is onlined the system is invulnerable to attack until the military control level falls below 2.00. above this level sbus cannot be anchored or onlined.1.11 if military control falls below level 1.00 and this is sustained for 7 days the systems infrastructure hub and outpost (if present) will immediately become vulnerable and will stay vulnerable until military control is raised to level 2.00 or higher.2 - system influencea new concept of system influence will be introduced. the purpose of this feature is to allow sov systems to project influence to surrounding systems which provide sov-like benefits without the need to maintain sov in the influenced systems.2.1 every system with sovereignty will extend system influence to nearby systems. the strength of the system influence will depend on the effective sov level of the system (the lower of the strategic level and military control level).2.2 system influence will have the same strength as the sov system's effective sov level in all adjacent systems (via stargates) and decrease by 1 point for each subsequent jump. for example a sov level 1 system will have influence strength 1 in all adjoining systems and a sov level 3 system will have influence strength 3 in adjoining systems, strength 2 in all systems 2 jumps away and strength 1 in all systems 3 jumps away.2.3 where two or more alliances have overlapping system influence the alliance with the higher influence level will have influence for that day. when influence levels are the same the alliance with the higher military control level in their sov system will be deemed to have influence.2.4 an alliance that holds influence over a system will receive the same bonuses in the influenced system(s) as received in the sov system e.g. pos fuel discount, moon mining, pi and mining yields.2.5 pi can only be installed in a system with alliance sov or influence. if influence is lost the pi yield will be reduced to zero (offlined). where influence has been lost for more than 7 days all alliance pi infrastructure will be destroyed."
"cont'd3 - outpoststo compensate for the reduced number of systems likely to be held by alliances the following changes will be made to outposts:3.1 outpost manufacturing and research slots will be increased by a factor of 4.3.2 outposts will be able to be repackaged to facilitate their storage and relocation. this is possible at sov level 5.3.3 outposts can be self-destructed with a 7 day timer. during the 7 day self-destruct cycle all outpost services are disabled and anyone can access the outpost to facilitate retrieval of items. this is possible at sov level 3. if destroyed an outpost leaves an invulnerable core in place that contains any items held within the outpost at the time of destruction. if a new outpost is built in the same system as a core any items held within the core will be accessible by their original owners in the new outpost (depending on outpost access settings) and the core will self-destruct.4 - sov costs4.1 the cost of maintaining sovereignty will be increased in phase one to reflect the likely fewer number of sov systems held by an alliance (by a factor of 5). cost will be split between an isk cost and a fuel cost in the same manner as pos e.g. pos fuel, pi manufactures etc. 4.2 fuel will be required by the system's infrastructure hub. this transition will help ensure sov is maintained by local activity rather than just isk which can be transmitted across the universe instantly.5 - force projectionto limit the ability of alliances to project force over large distances, in order to promote smaller local wars, jump drive capable ships will be changed as follows:5.1 normal jumps to a cyno will require a 30 minute cool-down before the jump drive can be used again.5.2 jumping from a cyno generator will be introduced as a new feature (approach cyno generator, right-click cyno generator and select jump to xxx). jumping from a cyno generator to either a cyno or another cyno generator does not require a 30 minute cool-down.5.3 jump bridges will be permitted for alliance members use only and not usable by dreads/supers/titans.the intent of this change is to force dreads base from systems with cyno generator, making their placement a strategic decision. the cool-down will limit their use in battle but will not prevent transit across large distances for migrations."
"cont'd phase twothis phase will involve a general boost to industry in nullsec enabling nullsec alliance to be self supporting and at the same time create barriers to high-volume trade between nullsec and empire6 - industry boost6.1 new system upgrades will be available that greatly boost the yield of moon mining, pi, asteroid mining and ice mining.pi booster - boosts all pi yields and processing times e.g. by 20% x effective sov levelmoon mining booster - boosts moon mining yield e.g. by 20% x effective sov levelice mining booster - boosts ice mining yield e.g. by 20% x sov levelsystem scan array - uncovers scannable mining sites containing rich ores (quantity and quality graded by effective sov level)6.2 outpost manufacturing and research slots will be increased in number and have increased efficiency and speed.6.3 if ccp agree to a pos revamp industry could be moved from outposts to pos with the same bonuses but this can be done as part of a separate initiative.7 - logisticsto encourage industry to move to nullsec, prevent the importation of high-volume/low-value goods from empire and also hinder nullsec alliances from dumping lower cost goods in empire the following changes will be made:7.1 jump freighters will lose the ability to initiate jumps from high security and low security systems.7.2 steps can be taken to foster trade within nullsec and between nullsec and empire of high-value/low-volume goods using blockade runners. this needs to be developed further but examples such as booster production and expedited bpo research already exist.8 - sov costs8.1 the cost of maintaining sovereignty will be further increased in phase two as a result of the industry boost. cost will be split between a reduced isk cost and an increased fuel cost.phase threethis would involve implementation of the 'farms and fields' concept widely discussed elsewhere. in summary this involves increasing the number of industrial structures and industrial activities that can be disrupted by small gangs. this will create increased opportunities to disrupt alliances and generate opportunities for pvp as alliances defend their space."
"there are plenty of suggestions that i have seen that would allow a large alliance to live in a relatively small, well used amount of space. there are plenty of suggestions that i have seen that would force an alliance to live in a small amount of space. there are suggestions in both categories that i like parts or even all of.this is not one of them."
"the primary effort isn't really to force a large alliance into a small space, it's to move industry and market out to 0.0. i think regardless how ccp chooses to limit the scope of an alliance's influence in unused space the current controlling interest wouldn't like it. if the sov fuel lasted sufficiently long, alliances could still claim large areas of space."
"the sov system used to be tied to the pos system...it was even worse and didn't limit claiming large areas of space either."
"i guess you didn't read the minutes well enough. ccp didn't have a problem with alliances holding sov in systems they weren't using. they only disliked this if it prevented smaller groups from moving into the space.also, as was discussed in the minutes, the issue isn't a lack of desire to move industry into 0.0. it's a lack of ability to do industry in 0.0 because of the poor distribution of low-end minerals and the lack of industry slots.your idea places another logistical hassle on owning space without fixing the lack of industrial capacity."
"there are many suggestions outside my own to do that that i've seen and like as well.this isn't one of them. so long as the relevant systems were well executed, i'm fine with it. i've got some interesting ideas based on discussions with one of our sov experts in that regard, even."
"the alliance control and ability for small groups to move in go hand-in-hand. i thought requiring this effort would be an excellent way of allowing small alliances to negotiate control of areas while acting in partnership with nearby power houses that didn't prioritize them.i've been told from some folks in 0.0 that industry has no place out there.. that they aren't even wanted. if the limits were strictly lack of slots and lack of low end minerals (although that was discussed and they had a plan for it), then those things would be taken care of in a hot fix. both would be quite easy to implement."
"back when i pitched my wildly under-read sov/nullsec reform package modeled on the 'farms and fields' design, i actually came to a lot of the same conclusions you did. i think the best way of allowing small alliances a space in nullsec would be to create an incentive for larger alliances to tolerate (non-rival) alliances on their borders."
"exactly my point!"
"oh god yes. it is an awesome idea. imo sheriffs should get very substantial amounts of concord lp for each pirate kill.penalties for sheriffs are simple: (penalty sec status and lp substraction)any act that causes suspect or criminal flag."
"i managed somehow to delete my reply....."
"i mean we don't really need an eve version of twitter, do we?nor would it be wise to have the local chat window expand into an eve version of facebook, would it?and no-one is going to go to ccp and say \"we have raised the money to buy you the tools you need to make us happier\" will they?"
"there are the ingame chat channels for all those middle aged men with female avatars.most of an eve player's in game time is spent avoiding another player in one way or the other. why would you want to see their faces? if there's a nuclear holocaust and evetards are the last group of people alive from hiding out in their mothers' basements, i wouldn't want to socialize with them."
"thats sad, because in the event of nuclear holocaust, this \"basement\" my family has been over the last 30 eyars doubles as a nuclear fallout shelter, complete with a hydroponic garden, armory, shooting range, a whole town's worth of mre's, environmental suits, and enough dvd's/blurays to last you decades.but if you dotn like socializing with eve players thats too bad.(but seriously, i wil never leave this basement, theres just no reason too)"
"don't forget about these forums in the in-game browser. they're way better than any in-character, in-client social networking systems that elder scrolls online can create.it's good to know that you'll be alive after the holocaust, as i may need you to grind some standing for me"

"but caps are really slow, so if you're not at knife fight range, you're completely immune to this..."
"275% of a capital's max speed would come to around 300m/s for most capitals. the damn thing's going to hit you once it starts moving. it's a valid point though; perhaps that speed could be applied as the damage but have an animation much like the mjd?"
"if you jump dreads in at 30, it'll take 100 seconds for a thanatos moving 300m/s to hit you.assuming all skills to v, it will take 45 seconds for one seiged moros to destroy said thanatos, assuming it is in structure and running a dcii.also, having it be impossible to stop said thanatos from ramming would be rather overpowered, don't you think?"
"i have a better suggestion. why not make it so players can truly be the police in lowsec by having concord give security status gains instead of penalties for engaging players with a negative security status who are known criminals? it increases pvp, increases gameplay and improves the spirit of fighting."
"over a year ago, i was one of many who brought a proposal to the table to overhaul the mercenary system. the system was essentially non-existent. there was no way to ensure mercenaries were paid for the work they did, and the wardec system was jacked up by having to wait to declare war to help a corp. many ideas were brought forth, and after recently coming back from a break, i see there's been many changes, which at first look seem to be for the better.one feature i suggested however, didn't get added although back then it got quite a bit of support. because of that, i wanted to propose it again. it's my firm belief that pvp in high-sec/null-sec would be improved if players were rewarded by concord for shooting players who are known criminals or aggressive towards other individuals by giving them sec status gains like they do for killing npc's in belts. not everyone wants to go grinding for sec status all the time, myself included. it would be a benefit to gain sec status for doing what i love doing in this game and that's shooting other players who also enjoy combat.i propose that any player with a -2.0 sec be agressible in lowsec without global criminal flagging, and that any player with -2.4 or below be aggressible in high sec without concord intervention.the pros:a. it encourages moar combat amongst players in high-sec & low-sec by concord not lowering your sec status, but raising it.b. it gives players who hate grinding for sec status the opportunity to earn it a different way and again encourages more pvp in lowsec.c. it gives the bounty hunter career an added bonus to collecting bountiesd. it provides mercenaries a way to focus on their targets at hand after having to suicide gank someone or several persons as part of a contract.e. it adds to the fun of eve without giving one side an overbearing advantage.the cons:i really haven't found one as of yet, but that's why i'm looking for your input. i don't see how it can be exploited so long as you don't receive credit for shooting neg sec pilots in your own corp or alliance. i welcome your input and appreciate your support. csm, please give this some thought and bring it forth to the devs."
"this sounds like a good idea to me. +1"
"how about automatic bounties placed on pirates by ccp? that could really liven things up."
"--------> seeing the flashing red sec status decrease approaching / the person you have to worry about on your way to jita because you gank people. i like how you've tiered the pros in the description too. overall: great enhancement idea, fitting apparent"
"ok, let's move this up again.ccp wants to find ways to remove plex from game.they did a re-sculp for plex which is a vanity item.let's have a remove skills for plex, another vanity item.why you ask, because some of us have too much isk to spend & we are ocd."
"what a complete waste of time."
"do you expect anything more out of this thread that hasn't been said already?[citation needed]"
"as someone else said already, lowering your clone cost isn't a vanity thing.making your character worse is i guess, but really, even in a perfect world where no accounts were ever hacked/borrowed/whatever, you'd still get people putting in petitions to get thier skills back when the next patch rolls around and fixes or buffs whatever they deleted."
"i am sorry but removing the mining lvl 2 skill & the stupid pi skills i injected, is not making my character worse. and no matter what ccp buffs, i will never inject these skills again :p"
"your premise of involvement of 'real money' is flawed. therefore, your context of the margin trading scam being tantamount to theft is likewise incorrect.let me elaborate. you pay real money for plex. this is where the link to real money is concluded though. your plex thereafter converts into isk or game-time, whatever your preference may be and neither of these things has any real money value from that point on. why? because there are no (legal) mechanisms in the game that will allow any player to convert their isk or game-time into real money. therefore, there is really no theft of real money in eve<U+FFFD> ever. you have to be careful what you are insinuating by suggesting that a game condones an illegal activity, especially when there is no real basis for it.your isk is scammed from you because you failed to detect what was clearly a \"too good to be true\" market/contract deal.it's a tough break but you have to learn to spot these types of scams. it's a part of the eve learning experience and it holds true for every activity undertaken in eve."
"lots of people like to solo, myself included, should it be a requirement of the game that everyone must fly in a gang?stupid comment of the day, either that or poor attempted troll."
"this idea starts with control of ones space being based upon something that (if i read it right) could spawn at any time, in any timezone, which those attempting to own space have no control over whatsoever. that alone makes it pretty awful, and the fact that it gets close to a few good ideas does nothing to redeem it.you get points for putting in the effort to try to build a complete system though."
"a good point. fixed that. now the sites would all spawn during downtime. they can be activated only my sov alliance members so they have complete control over when during the day the sites would be opened to be contested."
"that's great. it's still a poor idea, in my opinion. i do not think some involvement of structures should ever go away for a formalized sovereignty-based ownership system (though other styles of living in or using space can coexist, such as the concepts susan black describes here). however, i do think that use of space should play a role. however, i'd prefer to see the overall level of sovereignty affected and boosted directly via actual use. the general idea along those lines i've been thinking about is to first make sovereignty far more granular, far more finely divided than five levels. then, feed the existing two indices (military and industrial) into it in some way, fine-tuning them as necessary (currently high military is easy to maintain, high industry is hard.) perhaps new indices could be developed as well, all based on disruptable player activity.sovereignty now is governed to some degree by usage - no longer do you just claim a system and eventually tick up to maximum level, and indeed the level of sovereignty achieved passively would be heavily limited. for example, if this new system were on a 1-100 scale, the highest you could achieve by taking control of a system and then not using it would be 20, for example. below 20 there would be few defensive benefits available, if any. reinforcement timers on structures would be highly randomized, or perhaps present in 24h increments (so if your attacker hits it in their prime, it comes back out in their prime). the structures themselves could even have a reduction in hp. however, if you start to make use of the system, it becomes more defensible. hp gets higher, you get finer and finer control over reinforcement timers, defensive structures (eg cyno jammers) become available, etc.the goal then is that the defensibility of your sovereign space is tied to but not completely reliant on how much you use the space, and more importantly is tied to usage in a variety of ways (mining, ratting, production [especially if it moved to crunchy modular pos in the far future], how much pi your members do, etc), rather than being tied to \"usage\" by a single (or several) glorified fw complexes. contesting or weakening a defender's control over their space can then start by targeting their myriad forms of carebearing, though a sufficiently powerful invader could simply go straight for the throat. obviously it's not a fully thought out idea and i'm sure there are quirks that haven't occurred to me that would need be addressed. i absolutely disagree with the idea of crippling the ability for trade to flow between high and null, however. i also acknowledge that ccp has made noises about limiting force projection, but don't really like your proposal for doing it."
"i'd be interested to hear your reasons why trade flow between nullsec and empire for high-volume/low-value goods (e.g. tritanium etc) should be preserved. if nullsec is to have self-supporting industry this link must be severed for goods transported in freighters/jump freighters. otherwise buffing nullsec industry will just reverse the flow of these goods. trade in low-volume/high-value goods can continue via blockade runners and this should be encouraged.if a nullsec alliance is forced to develop local industry to build ships, ammo, installations and fuel then there is no need for an artificial industry index to encourage this activity.we'll have to agree to disagree on the broad approach to sov. i think this should depend purely on military force, with all other activities implied by the need to build and maintain this."
"if an alliance has both the interested producers and the interested miners, they'll develop local industry. if they have one or the other, perhaps they continue to import finished goods or export the minerals or both. they should not, however, be forced to do anything, nor should any such mechanisms to force them to have self-supporting local industry be required if the entire system is appropriately balanced. in other words, if an entity wishes to live as a martial band, holding a small pocket of space that they supply from empire as a base to burn and pillage their neighbors, they should be allowed to.the point of such an index would not be to encourage such activity, but reward it, to give an additional or alternative route to improving their control over a system. perhaps a system has poor ratting and mining potential, but has a great setup for pos based production.at the end of the day taking and holding sovereignty in the system i described comes down to military force. i do not think holding sov should depend purely on military force. if an alliance is industry and mining oriented and is able to overcome the need for military force through either careful diplomacy or the use of mercenaries, that's awesome - they should be allowed to."
"let's see the changes required to make it even possible (never mind actually being preferrable) for an alliance to support itself out of its own space before we start talking about choking off links.you may wish to recall that not all alliances come with a fully fledged industrial wing, and that these take time to develop. also that not all 0.0 space holds all resources - most of drone space is cripplingly short of mexallon, for instance, and good luck supplying your ship building industry with that from blockade runners.and finally, as mynnna say, whilst it's certainly reasonable to rebalance the advantages of a gameplay style or economic strategy, it's not so reasonable to force them. if nothing else, it will take time to change the vector of the cultural momentum that 0.0 has built up and simply trying to enforce that by fiat will just cause huge resentment."
"remark: 1st post changed to reflect discussion and it's not necessary to read the whole message thread. ... and tried to change some grammar as well."
"bump<3"
"thanatos dies either way, so to the pilot it makes no difference. i agree that you should be able to shoot down a kamikaze carrier, but maybe you could implement some sort of \"all power to the hull\" system where resistances shoot up during a kamikaze run? i'd hate to see immortal carriers bringing down all sorts of other ships but, at the same time, i also would like to see the mechanic actually make a difference."
"so, if say my alt was in an npc corp... and i got this alt to -2.1 by ganking stuff... then picked a quiet high-sec system... repeatedly ganked the said alt with my negative status main... i'd be what? +5.0 in no time?"
"pretty much what i was going to say. use an alt for ganking or simply smartbomb jita to get neg sec status, then go somewhere and blow the snot out of your alt to farm sec status.we all know what eve is like, any gains to be generated by player against player actions will be exploited.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
"the amount of gain would be important, and as with npc's the gain in security status should be appropriate to the loss.so if it was worth blowing up a bunch of battleships for you to get your security status up, then sure you could fast-track it, but i think the price in that case would be sufficient that \"exploit\" would not be the correct term for it."
"i am sure this proposal will not go down easily, but i believe it needs to be made and implemented at some point in the future.ccp seems to be getting better and better at chasing down botters and rmt. if we find any, and we have good reasons to believe someone is breaking the eula, do we use petitions to report them. nothing further needs to be said at this point.the sandbox principle works fine for all matters that take place inside of it. players need not fear the loss of their ships and playing with a player's fear (of a ship loss) is part of the game. however, players do need to fear the loss of their accounts as a means to prevent eula violations and it is not a matter of the game play within the sandbox itself. accusations of eula violations are not required to have fun in eve.in eve there are players who use accusations of eula violations as a means to pvp. while players are being harassed with spaceships are they often accused of being bots and to be breaking the eula. because this is a play style, which leaves the sandbox, should players be protected from it, to give a good meaning to the fear of eula violations and to preserve the good fun within the sandbox. to stay with the sandbox analogy - it does not need kids in the sandbox, who shout \"give me your shovel or i'll tell your dad!\"as such do i propose that any such accusations, by means other than with petitions, should be taken as a violation of its own and receive recognition by ccp. meaning, players who make such accusations as part of their play style, to grief and harass other players, should receive a warning in-game as well as when done on the forums.i believe by giving it more recognition will it not only lead to a better game play, but also to more players taking eula violations more seriously."
"i think i see what you're getting at here, but i want clarification before i respond.basically, the situation i think you are describing is something like:i'm mining, happily doing my own thing, when some guy comes in local, starts harrassing me, and threatens to report me to ccp for botting unless i do x,y, and z things that he'd demanding i do. plus he'll blow up my spaceship if i don't comply.is that about the size of your issue?"
"there is no size involved here."
"i have deleted a few off topic posts here."
"*snipped discussion of moderation* - ccp eternei still cannot see what size it is you are asking me about.am i being accused of making a petty proposal??"
"i am going to assume that english is not your first language since you're not getting the idiom.allow me to rephrase.is that an accurate summary of the problem you are proposing to solve with this thread?"
"if i understand correctly, his problem is ppl smacking drama in local about how he's going to get you banned for eula violation, instead of quietly file a petition and let ccp sort it out.there's a merit in this. +1threatening players with imagined backing of authority, is akin to posing as gm, and is already a bannable offense in most mmos. this is especially acute in eve (aka, spreadsheet online), where botting consists of ocr bots that do not use code injection and thus impossible to positively identify/proven. banning for botting is merely a matter of educated guess."
"by no means. it is about protecting the dignity of the players further than before by forbidding accusations of eula violations. players should simply not be allowed to verbally accuse others of being bots, or, of grief play.i have seen it a lot and i believe that all this \"i shoot you, you are a bot!\" and \"you shot me, you are a griefer!\" needs to be put down and to force players to play a little bit more seriously so we can leave some of the whining and smacking behind. it sure does not make for a great game experience. instead, i believe the proposal will make eve a better game."
"ok. yeah i was way off.for the record i think you're fighting a losing battle."
"why?"
"not necessarily. like i said, threatening players with imagined backing of authority is already a bannable offense in most mmos, ranging from huge themepark mmos like wow that's closely controlled, to small ones like salem that's far more hardcore than eve (you died? biomassed! no clones, game over).may not guarantee it will happen in eve, but precedents are all over the place, in wide range of mmos."
"threatening other players and being accused of eula violations is almost commonplace in eve... so much so that most people don't take the accusation seriously anymore. i certainly do not (mostly because i took the time to actually read the rules so i know what i can get away with).it would also be very hard to enforce such a policy... hell... racism, sexism, and various other \"sensitive\" things are not allowed to be said in eve... and yet you see it everywhere (sit at a trade hub one day and read people's ship names, some of them are really funny).i highly doubt that ccp would ever find enough gms to scrub and enforce what people say outside of the very worst examples. like de'veldrin said, it is a losing battle.dignity is overrated. it makes you concerned about things that you should not be concerned about."
"i assume you have little knowledge on human rights or only the rights within the european union of which iceland is trying to become a member of. it will surprise you to know dignity is being recognized in article 1 of the fundamental rights to the european union, which is possibly why you think of it as being overrated. therefore will i not discuss dignity with you. if you want to know more can you find plenty of information about it on the internet.further does it not mean it needs an army of gms and isds to introduce this. it will simply be another rule just like \"discussion of moderation is not allowed\" is a rule. there is no need to ban lots of players. what it needs is to create an awareness among the players that such a play style is unwanted. new players will pick it up much faster than older ones. however, those who play eve long enough will already not violate it, because i believe a lot of us are rather sick of it.this lets me believe that the battle has already been won and ccp only needs to declare the winner. who then does not see the point of it will be made aware of it in the usual way: first through leniency, then through warnings, then with temp bans."
"oh. you're one of 'those' people.understand... you're on the internet sir. take nothing [too] seriously and understand the 'common rules of decency/morality' as you understand them do not apply here. especially in a game where 'bad behavior' is not only encouraged, but rewarded."
"no. it would simply take the discussion further away from the topic, which is about the introduction of a new game rule. you wouldn't take your own comment now and call it \"on topic\", would you?"
"actually, it is somewhat on topic. but perhaps i should clarify.i reject your argument for the new rule based on your premise (that such a change is necessary to 'protect people's dignity'). no such protection is necessary because if someone has not done nothing wrong, they have nothing to fear. if they do fear such a threat, then i invite them to read the eula itself so they better know what they can and cannot do (information and understanding is power).edit: i would like to add what people can perceive as a \"threat\" is extremely subjective. people talking about or quoting the eula can appear to be non-threatening even when they are making a clear threat to another. the same can be done in reverse."
"how does everyone know they did not do something wrong, when many young players have difficulties interpreting the eula in the first place? in the end is the interpretation of the eula entirely left to ccp, we have no say in it, and as such is a discussion about the rules of no help. a rule, which forbids accusations of eula violations, on the other hand is quite easy to understand and shuts all arguments, discussions and accusations up (one rule to rule them all ...).it gets everyone back to the game, lets players dust off and get up faster, than any whining or smacking ever can. all it currently does is to lead to fixed mindsets and emotional trench warfare. it would be nice to get rid of some of it."
"let me spell it out for you...his demise had nothing to do with ecm and everything with him being alone fighting a larger fleet. you can solo all u like, just don't ***** and whine about it when u die to superior numbers. the ecm ship could just as well have been a logistics boat or another ewar vessel. the result would have been exactly the same. he dies and kills nothing."
"i agree with your point. ideally both playstyles should be possible. if deep nullsec receives a greater industry buff than nullsec adjoining lowsec/empire then those alliances that wish to develop industrial self-sufficiency will gravitate to deep nullsec and those that wish to keep their umbilical cord to empire will stay close to lowsec/empire. the key is getting the balance right to ensure industry is viable in both nullsec and empire.as long as nullsec industry is desirable as a means of producing the material required for a nullsec alliance then incorporating some sort of bonus to sov from an industry level can fit within my proposal. perhaps higher industry levels can reduce the strength of the npcs occupying the pirate faction complexes or have an effect on system influence, so for example where two alliances have the same system influence level in an influenced system the alliance with the higher military control and industry level gain influence over the system.in this example diplomacy means depending on somebody else's military force, and mercenaries even more explicitly. either strategy is perfectly viable under my proposal. in fact corporations and alliances with strong industry will be even more valued under my proposal as their capabilities will be greatly needed. they will be the new 'tech moons'."
"voting is anonymous so actually it would be extremely hard to fulfill your request general. we do have constituents though, several established and reliable ways to talk to them or prominent figures in any subgroups representing them, and relatively large networks of information gathering in general. otherwise we'd have been hard pressed to get elected in the first place ;) we also interact on twitter, podcasts, blogs, news site interviews, and interactive town halls (in addition to being available by eve mail and private convo). as for not knowing who the csm representatives are after you read the minutes, i'd say yes you haven't looked hard enough. not sure if troll or just stupid, but i was bored and thought i'd respond for the benefit of other players happening upon this thread.opinions of eve players are not very difficult to find. separating the signal from the noise, however, can be difficult. aiding with that and acting as advocates for players behind closed doors are two very important functions of the csm. ccp never has to actually do anything we suggest but recent history has born out that our advice should not be too hastily disregarded (incarna/summer of rage, unlimited allies/dec shield exploits, the current pos stuff) and can in fact push things in a good direction (numerous feature refinements, logistic frigates, bounty hunting revamp, planning a long term view of eve development).also for the benefit of other players, the wiki is based on the csm white paper (our founding document), both of which are horrifically outdated. as discussed in the minutes, csm7 has managed to convince ccp xhagen to update them this month (we hope). hopefully such an update will include locking + archiving this assembly hall forum, which has not served a functional role in the csm process for almost 2 years and really just confuses new players."
"1.0"
"this is one of the most upvoted proposals on the csm's assembly hall but it didn't get much from their meeting:\"seleene brought up the topic of off-grid boosting, and fozzie responded that technical limitations were the only reason it continued to exist. fozzie could not comment on when this issue would be resolved and stated that <U+FFFD>one day veritas will come up to me and say <U+FFFD>hey i fixed off-grid boosting<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>, but he had no idea on a potential timeframe for this sort of miracle. elise emphasized that while off-grid boosting was an issue, just the simple way that bonuses are applied in a fleet is flawed.\""
"i like the idea of ramming speed. op has put allot of thought into it; however, after reading the mechanics behind the idea i can tell you as a pirate. i can exploit the children out of this!here is what would make me mean it instead of making me lulz at the expense of others.the skill is expensive and takes the same mount of time to train as the titan skill.every level of this skill would modify how much damage my death would cause. instead of a speed multiplier. the ships warp drive would overload breaking the hold of any points, using the targeted ship as the focal point for the warp core, this overload would actually act as an interdiction point as well as preventing the ship from docking or jumping basically pinning it in space. basically once you choose this road there's no turning back for either of you. take the total of the ships maximum structure hp's modified by the pilots skills. and them multiply like so.lvl 1 =2lvl2=4lvl3=6lvl4=8lvl5=10this way you do a decent amount of damage and have a good chance at getting some revenge. after all if your willing to suicide under this system it would have to be for revenge because...each time i use it, i would sacrifice a level of the last skill i've trained. in addition i loose one full level of my suicide skill.also, if i suicide at lvl 1. i loose the entire skill and have to repurchase it.another idea i'd like to see is making the normal self destruct on caps to have an option to cause damage. like the old amarian super weapon. it would have all the same penalties as ramming speed. but would just blow up at the end. it could. disrupt warp drives. giving smaller vessels a chance to run for it. or maybe just so i can say \"run you cowards!!!\" before i vaporize them. obviously. freighters wouldn't get this weaponized version."
"the problem isn't that the pirates would be in danger.the problem is jerk like me and my buddies, who would use this to kill every hauler that was brave enough to jump in.when you jump in your about 13km of the gate. bombs have a blast radius of 15km last i checked.i have already had great success plugging gates with 6k radius smartbombs on their way out, with bombs i could get them comming in too. no one would ever make it through low sec again!easy fix. infuse low sec with an attribute that kills bombs area of effect down to 4.5kor create a secondary ammo type that they can use that can be fired like a torpedo. and trades power for tracking. so instead of 6k base damage it would have say, 3ki could use something like this to hunt solo targets. with a wolf pack i could take down almost anything, but it would be useless for gate camping.right then, game on ;)"
"the incentives never work. the persistent idea that we need more players to low and null sec just isn't going to happen without diminishing risk to pointlessly low levels. i don't see the proposal as being pointless, just not all that workable. that being said, eve probably has most of the non-risk averse players already. customer growth will either be slow or the risk will diminish. if that happens the player losses will have to be surpassed by the growth. more safety, more losses, more growth, (repeat).conversely, the push for more pvp can only produce more complaints since the main source of new opposition remains new players or risk averse players or players (such as myself) unable to pvp effectively.the game is mostly fine. kindly don't make it squishy."
"the price difference between npc ships and player ships doesn't scale so well though. you can have a multi-billion rookie ship, or a 50ish mil unfit battlecruiser; also, npcs do not have pods and implants. so, if 'isk lost' is going to guide sec-status gain... might as well make a mechanic where you can directly pay for/buy sec status from concord.either way, i don't think that your proposal is as much of a conflict driver as you may think and is definitely open for exploiting."
"so basically this is a roundabout way to pay for security status?i have a few battleships lying around that i can insure and blow up."
"easy. they read it and ask questions about the bits they don't understand.i know this is a foreign concept to most people (*scroll down* *click 'accept'*)... but it does help to make it a habit and prevents a lot of stress in the long run. true. some of the rules will always be there to legally cover ccp's ass. but other rules are there because certain behaviors were actually destructive to their playerbase and discussed at length by the players and gms/devs (e.g. \"harrassment\" and \"new player griefing\").threatening someone with the eula does neither of the above because (again) words are extremely subjective and they don't have any real power unless you give them that power (either out of ignorance or true belief)."
"besides what shah has already pointed out, consider the following: if we already troll with fake threats of eula violation reports, what's going to happen when you make eula violation threats petitionable?people are immediately going to threaten to report people for threatening to report eula violations. it'll turn into a constant, swarming storm of garbage that will, in the end, only cause more problems for ccp.besides that, i highly doubt ccp doesn't have rules for people who impersonate gms. if they're already posted somewhere, i'm going to feign ignorance to where they are because i'm too lazy to look it up."
"what he said is his opinion and i will not argue it, but respect it.to answer your question, what will happen when goons make it a method to accuse players of eula violations is that we then have a means to stop you. or what would be the purpose of goons going around and threatening to get players banned if not for you wanting to take away their accounts? you would only be trying to get others kicked out of the sandbox. if you do this for joy or if it breaks your heart is of no relevance."
"1. just because they threaten people with the eula... doesn't mean that it carries any weight. they are only trying to scare people through their own ignorance... which is a perfectly allowable tactic (though, to be fair, it's a meta-game tactic... not a gameplay thing... but eve has gained a reputation for blurring the two).2. you are aware that goons (or whatever group) will adapt and turn it right back around... right? instead of threatening you with the eula they will report you as soon as you mention the eula and get you in trouble. and you'll be back to square one because you haven't changed anyone's core behavior... just the content of it."
"1.) no. threatening players over something that resides inside the sandbox is ok and good fun. threatening players over something that resides outside the sandbox, including the sandbox itself, is not.2.) absolutely! i believe it will teach players to stop thinking about the eula rules and to simply play the game.i have no doubt that for some will an introduction of such a rule be difficult to handle, but who would these players be? i imagine the extremest of the high-sec carebears perhaps, but not goons."
"dear csm members,i have read through the winter summit minutes especially regarding null sec. i think there may be another way to solve the problem, as all of you mention in the winter summit blobbing and small corp difficulty in entering null sec seems to be the problem.instead of changing all the mechanics perhaps there is another way. as i see it the problem is super power blocks. i think if the corp and alliance system was change a little the problem might be solved. i am not claiming to be an expert regarding null sec and i don't claim that the suggestion to follow will solve all the problem but it might solve a few.step 1: limit corporation and alliance sizesperhaps if we limited corporation to a maximum size of 250 members and then limit an alliance to 5 perhaps 10 corps. this will perhaps creare multiple alliances with max size. thus making over kill fleets less of a factor.step 2: local view in null seclocal view in null sec should not show you people's names nor their corp or alliance unless you belong to the same corp or alliance. e.g. entering a null sec system i see 10 corp/alliance members and 34 unknown pilots.i believe it's important not to be able to see another players name or alliance until you've received the killmail. as alliances will then simple have unofficial alliance and thus avoid seeing shoot people because they can see the name and corp and alliance. whereas an unknown threat will only be known once killed dead.step 3: delay killmail by 30-60the reason being other wise each fleet kills one of the opposing fleets member checks the kill mail to see if they are friendly and then move on without conflict.random fleets should still be possiblepeople should still be able to group with other people randomly and as long as they are part of your fleet you should be able to see their name and alliance ticker. this will then also make provisions for empire fleets to invade null sec for the fun of it.this suggestion also solves a few other problems: 1. fc won't necessarily be called primary first2. member won't necessarily die alphabetically3. the possibility of 3 - infinite directional fight increase as i wouldn't know if the other people on the grid or in system are from the same or two different alliances. in fact my fleet might jump through a gate into a battle i would not know which side is which unless they are corp or alliance mates.why i believe super powers are the problemit's very simple this is how blobbing started alliance a form a fleet of 200 to assault delve alliance b who control delve get the scouting report of 200 inbound. alliance b drums up a fleet of 1000 to counter alliance a's fleet.one week later alliance a arrives with a 1000 member fleet, alliance b responds by creating a 2000man fleet. now if there was a limit to alliance sizes this escalation would have a limit.in closingperhaps this is a simplistic view or the view of someone who knows to little about null sec but i thought i post and see what the response is like. perhaps it get flamed (most probable) and perhaps not (very unlikely)so wouldn't it be cool to see 40 alliances with 1000 members versus 10 alliances with 6000 members"

"i am not a very assiduous reader of that forum, and i apologise if the idea i am bringing before you has been exposed and objected already.as a null-sec player, i have an alt. most of my corpmates and alliance fellows have alts as well, it's so useful that it's almost mandatory to get at least one other character to help you do stuff (mining, transport, scouting, what have you).my main character and my alt learn their skills at approximately the same speed (with attributes and implants giving them boost where they need them).ok. so that's how it works as of now.seeing that having alt is so important, i have seen extreme cases of people multi-boxing 20 characters at a time, and i have no problem with that.but i wonder if new players experience (and also people that can only have one account at a time, whatever the reason) would not be improved if being active on a character actually made the skill learning quicker, according to what activity the character is doing. skill points bonuses would be earned, as you are actually doing what the skill is about.i haven't put a thourough system up (how would science \"abstract\" skills get speeded? i don't really know, i wanna hear ideas), but it would encourage people to actually do stuff instead of sitting around and waiting.why not offer skill points as a mission reward as well? it would speed up the training of assiduous players, without removing anything to the others.it seems normal to me that a single-character player would get more reward than someone's 31st alt that never does anything.tl;dr: reward player actions (missions, ratting, mining, pvp, heck, flying in space, why not) with skill points (if the activity has a link with the skill being learned)what do you guys think?edit:a handful of examples:- when learning a spaceship command skill (let's say, amarr cruiser v for instance), flying an amarr cruiser effectively gives out more skill points (it might be even better to attribute skill points in function of a players' action, so that just sitting in space doesn't give out the bonus)- when learning an industry such as refining, bonus sps are rewarded in function of the volume and type of refined materials- when learning a gunnery skill, shooting at stuff will give out sps bonuses- when learning an ecm skill, using ecm modules gives out sps bonusesi'll try and come up with a more detailed list, with ideas for skills that don't directly relate to an activity."
"*queues up caldari battleship v**orbits a pos in rokh**goes to work, comes home to extra bonus skillpoints*"
"which is why i stated there should be some sort of timeout measuring the actual activity of a player, rendering afk mining the only actual activity that could give out those bonuses (and perhaps cloaking as well).maybe i should explain more: mining and cloaking are activities that do not require much player operation to be actually used.for the spaceship command skills, it is simple to understand that your character would learn more about his ship if he uses it for some stuff rather than just orbiting a pos."
"you haven't answered the most important question of all - why does training need to speed up in the first place?"
"well for any player that comes from another game, having to wait 3 years without any action from you to speed it up (other than implants) to get in some ships is discouraging.this system would lower the entry barrier of eve by rewarding active players over inactive ones. that way, people that come from another universe don't get so discouraged and have an incentive to keep playing (and it also means losing), because there is value in action.as it stands now, the value of action is in isk and isk only. i think the game would be improved by adding anothere interest to actually move your ship around in space and do things.and there's a part of me that finds it unfair that a player that is on the game a lot and does stuff masters things at exactly the same rate and speed as someone's never used 31st alt.this addition wouldn't take anything from anyone, whilst rewarding the active persons (without removing any interest you can have in having alts), hence only making the game more attractive to new player without taking anything from the vets. win-win situation, as it seems to me."
"this is the response i was expecting, to be honest. people that think this way are caught up in the model that other mmos have where \"catching up\" to vets is an issue. eve doesn't have that problem precisely because of how the skill system is set up.there is no catching up to be had. once you reach level 5 in a skill, you're just as good at that skill as any other \"maxed\" character in the game. your system would, in fact, benefit older players more than newer ones simply because an older player would have more skills that are applicable to any given situation, which would translate to more bonus sp from any given activity than a newer player with fewer applicable skills.the simple fact is that there is no ship in eve that takes you three years of training to be able to fly. you can (in theory) obtain the bare minimum skills to fly a titan in about nine or ten months if you max out your training and remap at the right times. you won't be able to fly it well, but you will be able to fly it. and any player that is discouraged by the amount of time training takes in eve, is probably getting some bad (though well intentioned) advice.eve doesn't need an active skilling system - for one thing, because some skills don't have activities associated with them, and for another, because it wouldn't close the gap between new players and old ones, it would widen it."
"to give ppl a reason to log in?as devs already stated, sub cancellations follows a period of no in game activities aside from logging in to update skill queues. this will keep some of these people in eve. and no, \"ppl won't stay in game just for that\" is not a valid excuse against this proposal. some people will, some won't, it's just a matter of numbers in each group. there's no \"all or none\" in this. it helps, to some extent."
"oh, sorry.*sits in amarr bs, puts alt in something tanky, shoots alt for entire work day instead*better?"
"and only the first 30 minutes of your entire workday gave you the training speed bonus for the day. read the post you're replying to before you hit reply. it's already covered. you're making a fool out of yourself by not reading."
"but no timeout measure can actually measure player activity? i mean, let's say i'm bashing an abandoned highsec pos with my oracle. takes a while, so i just leave it alone to do it's thing. that's still me actively trying to achieve something. or say i'm burning deep safes in a claw. still doing something, even if i'm afk. or hauling, or mucking about with a sentry ishtar in hubs?any system which gives rewards like this can and will be abused to hell and back. it will basically become mandatory to do so.also, any system which gives sp as a mission reward is grossly unfair to those of us who don't live in highsec. where is my easy sp for literally no risk whatsoever? all you do there is encourage botting.in fact, all this proposal does in general is encourage botting and afk play."
"if you're going to bot for merely 30 minutes, that's your issue, not ours. if you're going to shoot alt for 30 minutes for no additional benefits, instead of shooting ppl for kms or rats for isk for the same 30 minutes, that's also your problem."
"(the last threads on this subject)"
"where on earth are you getting the 30 minutes from?"
"so change the timeout to 20 minutes instead. does finetuning the balancing matter to the essence of the proposal?"
"i still think you should go with the \"defender missile\" approach for a revamp comparison. the hue and cry from npc's being given very powerful/effective defender missiles would be so loud yet this is what was done with the npc ai and drones. making them less effective, more expensive and eliminating portions of your weapons systems from use as you game."

"drones were bad enough before the stupid ai. several changed need to be made, 1. drone targetting warning, some kind of warning that a drone is getting targetted, so that your first indication that a drone is being attacked isnt that all the shield and half the armor is gone.2. smarter drone controls for players. options for auto-dock when targetted, attack smallest to largest, closest to farthest.3. when drones are launched and you are already being attacked, dont have them just sit there all ******** like until you can target something and manually tell them to attack or fire a weapon. if you are being attacked, drones should never ever just be sitting around doing nothing.if they are going to leave drone babysitting the way it is, then new skills, maybe a break target skill, allowing those tiny super fast drones to break a target, dock repair, where drones can be repaird while docked in the ship. the way it is now went from weak to totally broken. kiting for noobs is out, drones are useless when you are jammed by 5-10 ships at once and before you could rely on your drones."
"there is a couple things wrong with your base arguments here.firstly, you are making a broad assumption that less risk and more security means more players into eve and more players into lowsec. both of these assumptions are not really based on anything except your own perception of the game, which is limited.in terms of bringing in more players, you can just as easily justify that making low-sec less secure --and thus giving more pvp opportunities, would attract more players. it's just a matter of which kind of players you're wanting to attract, either way.as far as low-sec attracting more people and increasing it's ''appeal'', the same thing applies. making it harder for pirates and easier for carebears increases the appeal to a certain subset of the population --people like you, specifically. but, making it appeal more to some people and less to others solves and/or gains nothing. if you gain 50 carebears and lose 50 pirates, you're still where you started from except people are afk mining instead of interacting through pvp.www.gamerchick.net @gamerchick42"
"yeah, that 1:1 yerr to carebear ratio... we're still talking about eve, right?eve was, is, and always will be mostly pve activity when headcounts are concerned.it's more like gaining 100 carebears and losing 1 pirate. surely the 100 carebears interact with eve more than the 1 pirate interacts with himself, not that anyone really cares.the question is whether lowsec gaining population is a good or bad thing. some people likes the way lowsec is atm. the fact that population will increase once safety increases was never in dispute."
"you see, the annoying thing about your post is that you claim not to know much about 0.0, yet here you are proposing significant changes to it.i mean c'mon man. browny points for the effort but plz, plz, plz do some research before you post an idea.someone with much more spare time than me will come along shortly and tell you just how invalid most of your ideas actually are. more likely, you will just get trolled into oblivion.i don't mean to cause offence but common sense is a valuable commodity. in the absence of having direct experience/knowledge on what you want to propose, the following also could work:1) talk about your proposals with people that live in 0.0 that you may know and that are experienced; and2) research the forums on similarly posted ideas and read the discussion."
"fair comment, but if you read the winter summit stuff either we find another way or perhaps wait years for null sec fixes."
"1) i make multiple alliances and multiple corps, run them all under the same leadership structure and manage them as one unit. nothing has changed but making it more annoying to make multiple corps and alliances.2) yes, because my amazing spaceship with all of its futuristic technology can't possibly fathom an fof tag. no, that's not the problem with local.3) if you're stopping and checking your killmails every time you've killed someone in the middle of a fight, you're seriously doing it wrong. and no, there's no reason to limit killmail generation to 30-60s after the final blow when you're just going to gloat over them anyways once you're done for the day."

"like the poster above me already pointed out... much of what you are requesting already exists or isn't needed.force recons (t2 cloaky cruisers) already have large bonuses for ewar and cyno fields... stealth bombers can deal large amounts of damage (~500+ dps if properly skilled)... and black ops battleships will be getting a much needed buff very soon (more jump range, more fuel capacity, lower fuel consumption).as for skill requirements... it doesn't take very long to jump into a covert ops ship or stealth bomber. minus support skills... it's a 2 to 3 week train from scratch to use either ship fairly effectively. that's not very long in the grand scheme of things.there have also been grumblings that ccp is looking into splitting black ops battleships into \"combat\" and \"logistics/ewar\" variants similar to combat and force recon cruisers."
"just like dust 514 skillpoints (which are exclusively actively gained, which proves that it's not impossible after all), there should be a daily cap to the amount of bonus skillpoints you can gain in a day.indeed the \"intagible areas\" of the game won't be accelerated that way. and so what? they'll still be learned exactly as fast as today! what's so unfair in encouraging the guy that shows up at fights (for nullsec), or does missions, or rats, or mines, over the one that doesn't even log in?- \"active skills encourage grinding\": like nobody's grinding already :) they encourage those who show up to do stuff. with the bonus sp cap, it still doesn't justify your staying there all day long.- \"intangible activities\": logistics and scouts get bonus sps for repairing and scanning (yeah you can always scam the system by repairing your alt, but if you're ready to log in everyday to reach your sp cap so that you can do that, hell, i believe you deserve it)- \"sp amount balancing\": well yeah, obviously, it's the whole question. but there again it's about rewarding people for what they actually do. if you do damage to others, at the end of the day, if you feel guilty that you didn't grind on another skill and start franctically mining cause \"i gots to grind\", yeah, you're the horrible human being making this \"mandatory\" to other dumbarses. but for those who actually do stuff, it gives them a bonus because of what they do. reward for action, once again.- \"people worried about max skills\" : ain't this what this is all about? except at the minute, there's nothing i can do on a daily basis that accelerates my reaching this \"max skill\" state. implementing this will only help me get there faster.- \"you will have to grind for years to get max skill and people will try\": well... yeah. and so what? just because some people can't control their emotions and franctically want everything, i shouldn't be rewarded for logging into eve? it is not a valid reason to me."
"no, just no. this would be abused so badly."
"you arent supposed to get to maxed all skills, that the point"
"nope. outside of npc standings, you don't have to grind for anything in the game. and you don't even need npc standings unless you have something special in mind (poss, faction warfare, better reprocessing rates, lower sales taxes, etc.)... which are really just \"perks\" when you think about it.you can submit your services to other players in exchange for isk... probing, pvp, logi ship, logistics, etc.as far as being encouraged to \"show up and do stuff\"... the game already does that. you gain isk, resources, allies, and learn more intricacies of the game. if those aren't enough to encourage you to play... this may not be the game for you.when i mentioned \"logistics\" i meant \"someone who hauls, organizes, supplies, and generally makes organizations work.\"people who perform \"logistics\" don't really utilize any in-game skills (what skills they do use are a potpourri of various unrelated things that have little relevance to each other).there are no direct \"scouting\" skills. \"probers\" are just that... probers. scouts use d-scan. there is no in-game skill for d-scan.the same applies for \"spies.\" there are no in-game skills that makes a better spy.diplomats don't have any in-game skills to make them better. why should they \"fall behind\" one of their ratting grunts?the list goes on.again... you are already rewarded for doing stuff. what an active sp system does in introduce a new mechanic that encourages people to perform (see: dedicate) certain activities over others for certain periods of time or be \"left behind\"... which is a concept that currently does not exist in eve.and yes... people will be concerned about \"left behind\"... because humans are compulsive about things that give them tangible advantages. people are very predictable in this regard. nope.max skills give you an \"advantage\" but are not absolutely necessary. a person who has all the skills within a specialty at level 4 can fly at about 80 to 90% of the effectiveness of someone who has all skills within said specialty at level 5.beyond that... being \"throttled\" and waiting for you skills to go up effectively \"forces\" you learn and work with equipment that is cheaper (good for newbies who often have the idea that bigger and more expensive is better)... choose specialties that can give you clear short term advantages... and/or find ways around your \"lacking ability\" such as talking with other players who are proficient in that specialty (and in turn you offer your specialty to).do you remember the \"learning skills\"? do you remember how they were technically optional but in reality they were not because they gave tangible advantages (which you wouldn't see for a year... but you'd be stupid for not training them now)."

"\"why wait years for fixes when we could make everything much worse right now?\""
"i am reading a lot of thoughts about the problems with player-owned stations and why it should be the topic of an entire expansion.because i see this angst and misery i feel the time is overdue to post a solution to this vexing problem, because that is after all what we do here: solve problems.therefore consider the following:- at fanfest 2012 [a blessing on my soul] i mentioned the fact that as the new eden elite, we do not have an address. we have an office in a station, but that is not our home. who knows who stays there when we're not there, right?so, how do i solve the problem of a personal home for the capsuleer and the player-owned station and keep eve's character, which has to be protected at any and all cost, intact?here is what i propose:a pos will become a new class of ship.- it can be anchored- it can be equipped with all the traditional defences and features we know and love [but this time with an interface that doesn't look like it was designed in a 1950s kolchoz].- it will be able to carry [part of] a capsuleer's fleet in a massive secured hangar [it does -not- serve the role of a carrier], this hangar will the equivalent of a station hangar.- several pos's will be able to combine in space, so that they become a lattice of pos's, they will be able to disengage from the lattice at any time, if the situation requires it.- this pos will serve as a base of operations, if the capsuleer so desires.the reward of having this pos will be that the capsuleer has access to it without being penalised for having bad standing with local factions.the risk will be that it will be a very challenging asset to own.a group of pos's should not have the same resilience of a station, but it should also not require sovereignty. a capsuleer should be able to [fairly] quickly fold the pos and move it.several different versions could be designed, depending on the role they are required to play in a coporation's/alliance's strategy.1. this gives ccp a reason to make a theme around pos's2. this creates new content for players to explore3. pos's will become an asset worth having and fighting for4. tear-extraction from the destruction of these structures will be a natural by-product of owning one5. a capsuleer will have an address, a place of their own, with the associated responsibility of maintaining and operating this assetand that's how you solve the pos problem."

"i have been an advocate of people getting sec status gain for shooting people of a lower security status than yourself since forever. you don't need to change aggression mechanics though, they are good as it is. who is attackable where at what security status is fine as it is. don't go changing that.if players are to get security status increases from attacking other players, two things need to occur to stop exploits. firstly, the players your attacking must be below your own security status if your to accrue security status increases. secondly, the sec status increase has to be tied to the isk loss of the player you blow up, because otherwise you could blow up your friends in n00b ships to raise your sec status, without any risk or loss all round.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"suprpower blocks is how some people want to play. some people want to play smaller entities or even solo. stop trying to make everyone play in a certain style. if you dont want to be invovled in teh superpowers then dont, its simple.the way sov works may need to change so that swathes of unused space arnt owned by powerblocks, maybe have it that apart from your initial space an entity can only own space directly conected to it not just by stargate by by location too? make some space that is simply inaccessible from any other null or lowsec, maybe make quite alot of areas like that. there are alot of options that will allow for power block play to run side by side with small powers and even solo corp play, you dont need to artificially enforce arbitrary limits to sizes then say that everyone else is an unknown target as this is just ridiculous.ccp need to just use some imagination, take some suggestions from the forums and use common sense, no arbitrary limitations are necessary."
"first of all, i'd rather ccp resources be spent working on a myriad of things before avatars in space....having said that, there's probably a team working on avatar development. as i work in recruitment for tgrad i can tell you that the population of eve has a surprisingly large number of mature players playing the game and real life professionals and business owners.so i'd encourage additional options that reflect that about eve including the fact that we have \"seniors in space\", \"middle aged folks in space\", \"dwarfs in space\", \"fat guys in space\", \"mature women in space\", and the like.while i do have my cadre of hot cyno alts, i'd like to see additional diversity."

"if i were a demigod worth more than most countries i sure wouldn't look like an old guy"
"so basically... a carrier that instead of launching ai controlled fighters it launches player ships? i like it!"
"what purpose exactly does this serve...? how much do those rigs really cost? if you made such a ship, it's step quite a bit into the region of the carrier, which has one of it's roles to be a ship transport in low/null. all you need to do, is allow freighters to move assembled ships aswell, unless they already can, in which case, no change is needed. having them moved via courier is also not the worst thing, and to those that say you can't courier to yourself, i'm pretty sure you could make an alt and courier to yourself. we already have the freighter and jump freighter for highsec as well as the orca, add in the rorqual, carriers, super carriers and titans for low and null. do we really need more ships to move other ships?"
"it doesn't launch player ships. it can transport them. it will be incapable of launching ships in space. the only way it will be able to interact with ships in space is with a pos ship maintenance array (so that it can't be utilized like an orca).and to answer the question about rigs, when it comes to certain vessels, rigs can be pricey (especially if you're talking large rigs, or t2 rigs). the point of this is to facilitate improved logistics, and to plug a hole for transport purposes. sure, using an alt to transport utilizing courier contracts is all fine and dandy, but not everyone has the money to have more than one account, or has the time to train a second account while they take care of rl stuff, or their main accounts.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"keeping the pos industry alive!hrolt ceo live free; die proud"
"i see no reason to change the current skilling system especially to a system as potentially open to abuse as the one you are proposing."
"i fully agree with this statement.eve has managed to create imho, one of the best and most balanced skill systems out there.no grinding, no abusable mechanics, no afk experience leveling, no discrimination between players who can play for 10 hours a day and those who have to work and can only get on a couple of hours every few days or weekend players.why does the op want to ruin this?jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
"i read valid assertions, but what i mostly see behind it is fear of \"no-lifers\" that will abuse the system.however, nobody replied to my quoting dust. i am aware that both games are different, however dust combines eve's skill system with \"action reward\", it's even a general reward (not skill-specific)!it means that dust diplomats will never get any skill points for doing what they do. nor won't the ceo. is that unfair? no, it's simply that what they do doesn't have a direct influence in their character's lifes as a fighter. i think here, many people confuse players and their characters.but then again, in eve, as you said, it doesn't require any in-game skills to be a diplomat or a scout... so to what would you give out skill points anyway, as there are no in-game skills for that?you can scout and be a diplomat without any in-game skills, which means you don't need a skill-point bonus in that area anyway, because there are no skills that make you less efficient at it than any other person.perhaps i should formulate the first idea again. in my thought, bonus skillpoints are only awarded to skills that fall under the action's category.for instance, i shoot lasers, my character gets better at shooting lasers. that's how it goes.so a diplomat would get bonus skillpoints for shooting lasers, because that's what he'd be doing at that moment. his role is in meta gaming? then he isn't limited by in-game skills as the grunts are. in the end, if there was to be an \"injustice\", it'd be the other way around: grunts do their role and are limited by their potential lack of skills, diplos or scouts are not.and as for eve's unique perspective, well, this system doesn't remove anything from anyone, you'd learn skills as fast as now (which according to your own words, is nothing to complain about).at a time when ccp wants to attract (and supposedly, keep) new people into eve, it seems to me that giving a new incentive to various activities (i'm sorry but as i don't have 20 accounts, nor any valuable asset to play marketeer, i actually have to grind to get any sort of isk, be it hisec missions, null-sec sites, mining, what have you) might actually get people into staying, and not just get into the game, get told \"well, you need at least 3 months before you can actually do cool stuff\" and **** off as many do today.because it's easy to say that rewarding action is unnecessary, or even dangerous, when you have several 3-4 years old characters that allow you to do whatever you want to do. just as easy that it is for some politicians to say general health-care is useless: well it is not for them, they got the money for it. and those who don't? well they can **** off, take it or leave it, right? (btw i'm not american, and don't give a damn about american healthcare, i'm just making an analogy as many people as possible can relate to)well that's exactly how many newbies see. leave it.and i know this feels like butthurt, but it's not really for me that i want action rewards (it wouldn't change much to what i'm learning anyway now), but i know it'd encourage some newbies to stay long enough to get to see the whole game, and not just lvl 2 missions.i have friends i want to play that game with me, but none of them wants to spend 3 months to start playing, and i understand them. (i know, they can specialise in t2 frigates and get in interceptors... really useful when you can't even do lvl2 missions)and a minor bonus for being active, this skill being learned slightly faster because they did good, it might just be the little push they need to click that \"subscribe\" button.what would it change for newbies? it'd give them one more chance to stay in the game.what would it change for the vets? nothing. well yeah, it'd give the active newbies a chance to catch up with the lower skill inactive vets.but you don't really care, do you, as long as you get to keep playing the game you own way :)anyway, if you'd be so kind, for this conversation to keep living on in an interesting way, to mark objections as under either the \"principle\" or \"technical\" level, that be nice (and it'd clarify the reading :) ).for instance, saying that this proposition should not be adopted because it changes eve's indentity is an objection on principle.saying that people will abuse the system by afk repetitive actions is a technical objection.thank you in advance."
"horrible sugestion."
"has anyone else noticed that everyone who says that drones aren't broken always talk about \"dominix + sentries\" and nothing else?"
"actually the real problem isn't that they're being targeted: it's that they're being insta-locked. i've seen light drones come under fire not two seconds out of the launch bay, and by cruisers no less. i've seen sentry drones come under fire in less time than the lag between my pushing the \"attack\" hotkey and them firing one shot. no player ship can do this!25m signature = 0.1 second lock-on time? my ass. and once they get locked the rats never miss. my ass x2."
"the lock time should be looked at, and perhaps the tracking aswell, but for frigs to be effective at killing the larger drones isn't a large surprise at all. can i also point out the fact that when the drones use their microwarp drives, their sig radius explode? just, in case you weren't aware. one might want to have a look at the drones resists (assuming they vary racially) to figure out what to use. alternatively, use them high slots for autocannons or blasters to blap frigs before putting out the drones."
"ok how about this: can't aim bombs at anything within 10km of a gate or npc station, but everywhere else bombs would be kosher?"
"tell me where else the bombs would then be used? there's little point in being able to use bombs in these systems if that's your suggestion. it's also an incentive for moving into null territory. what i'm curious about is why titans can't doomsday in low, now that their damage is no longer aoe."
"i see the merit in the system. the only problem i see is that if you make the sec gain too high then you are going to get alt grinds and if you make it too low then some players will argue that there was no point in \"wasting\" time coding the system. frankly i would like to see a sec gain exactly like that for shooting npcs (swap elite hulls for t2 hulls in terms of sec gain). that way there is no point in grinding it out with alts. no ratios, no special conditionals, just straight up +sec the exact way you get it through shooting npcs. i would like to advocate to make it a larger gain but if you make the gain too large - then you will get people making -10 alts to treat as a personal sec reliever."
"to counter this to an extent, you could set \"point values\" for ships so that nothing below a bc got any significant gain, therefore, the player is having to spend all that isk he ganked to get his sec status back up. you could also require there to be a fleet involved for sec status to be awarded. there's many work arounds to stopping... or at least hampering exploit opportunities."
"another thing you could do is put a maximum number of times one player can be killed by another in a single day and still receive sec status gain for it... or even more simply make it so a player's death rewards sec status only so many times per day/hour/week depending on the level of increase they would award. perhaps they could make it to where the longer a player goes without being killed the higher the reward in sec status gain for his head? just thoughts."
"+1 excellent idea aye aye m8"
"good idea, and it would need to be worked out so it cant be exploited. bounty payouts shouldnt affect sec status gain.space cadet online - a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks - public npsi events fleet - launching 28th august"
"if eve would have no alts... sure. the problem is that the proposal has the same loophole as the first bounty system."
"so kind of like an orca that you can anchor to prevent people from stealing it?"
"i'm fine with changing poses in a way that allows us to use them as stations, and replace station functionality. allowing it to be a ship however, can be considered a troll. the amount of rights managements to do this sort of thing would be mind boggling, not to mention moving an object whilst a certain amount of players are already in it and doing their thing. station size poses should never be able to move about, or else, it will be abused to the ends of the earth."
"i assure you i am quite serious about the idea. this is a problem that many people struggle with, it is part of the game play that ccp thinks is not important because they do not recognise that they are underserving the people who would use this feature if it was properly implemented.my intention is to contribute meaningfully to the discussion. you can like or dislike, as is your preference, but i'm not trying to be a smart ass. i do plenty of that in coms, i don't need to assert myself here.it should be a ship, because that is the metaphor we use all the time. there is nothing new to the idea of flying a ship. but, the pos features would -only- become available when the device was deployed in pos-mode.think of it as a mobile oil rig. it kinda sorta sails across the sea, but it's not really intended to do that. the thing it's supposed to be doing, it only does when it's anchored and deployed. all the features are on board, you just don't start using them [unless and when the feature is required for the basic needs of navigation] until it's fully deployed.so it would be with this device. it's a ship, it will fly, but you won't use the pos features because these only become available when the ship is anchored and the pos is deployed. then, all the features become available and it is now a pos.ownership is a great issue, but that is why the corp interface would need to be updated to allow for the private ownership and deployment of a pos in the corp/alliance constellation. you would be allowed to own your own pos/s, that would not automatically translate into rights to other poses. obviously this is a non-trivial problem to solve, but i have confidence in the demi-gods in fair reykjavik [and their subsidiaries] to solve that problem. that's what would make this a full-featured, theme-based expansion. it would be real work, with a real pay-off. and pilots would respond to this becoming available.i have not touched on where it can be deployed, how it needs to be deployed, that is work to be done.after deployment, features as now commonly used, can be added to the pos. the oil rig idea again. you can add modules and start production, harvesting, protection, as you do with a current pos.you would then have to disassemble all the parts that are not part of the flying vessel to bundle the craft up and enable the warp drive.you would have different sizes, they would fold swiss army-knife-style. you pack your kit up, you store it into the pos, you fold the pos, you secure the ship for flight-mode and off you go. you've got all you need in one smart package, all parts of which can be built / purchased on the market. the geometry would change when you change the configuration, it would look awesome [like everything in eve looks awesome] and it would be a feature that people would look for and use. like wormholes have proven to be a very successful feature. this too would be something to look out for.would it be a challenge to build it? of course, but this is eve. the hard stuff is the most fun.i believe in this as a workable idea. specifically because it touches on the basics: there's great reward and great risk and it's a fis feature. this idea is an all-eve all the time idea. get the balance right, implement a new pos-management interface, like we have seen awesome interface improvements in the last release, and this will be a sought-after asset.you can sell this idea. i can see the fantastic video the marketing geniuses [not a hint of sarcasm!] would produce to make us salivate over this release. eve online - foothold. it's a serious proposition that i truly believe has potential.if you think it's nonsense, please tell me why i'm wrong. i'd love to hear your ideas."
"a lot (if not everything here) has been discussed and beaten to death by the modular pos discussions."
"i have not read the modular pos discussion. if there are no new ideas here, and i'm certainly not claiming originality, why haven't ccp implemented them yet?"
"contracts should be targeted for personscorporationsalliancesmilitiasfaction standingspersonal standingsor in general, whatever filter eve online already applies to players, corporations, alliances, etc.. in-game.mostly i'm interested in being able to assign contracts to my militia, but this sort of feature ought to be generalized."
"so im searching for a contract for a mimmi ship. 90% of the contracts are multiple items. 1) change multiple item contract icon to reflect the item you are searching for, then the most expensive item if searching for all types. 2) or let me have check boxes for which racial ships i'd like search to return. hopefully both."
"no it doesn't. player purchases plex from ccp for real money & the real money involvement ends there. you get exactly what you paid for & what you do with it afterwards has nothing to do with real money, because you got what you paid for."
"it may be worth considering that i haven't seen a single gatecamp in the last six months that wasn't based around a faclon, either alone or with friends. no other bubble ships even get used any more. that in itself should tell ccp that some balance issues exist."

"just dropping this in: simply restricting boosts to a grid can possibly not deliver desired effect. there's not much help if said booster sits 300 km away from you rather than at the safespot. this can make little difference in big engagements and probably in smaller ones as well."
"care to explain why?"
"on the good side, ccp obviously recognized the massive demand form the players to do something about overpowered drones and decided to address it in a well balanced and nuanced way.ccp just had to respond to the large number of players who threatened to quit if the all powerful drones were not nerfed.horrible drone ui and virtually useless heavy drones, nice work ccp.sigh"
"this has been probably already addressed before, so i am most likely repeating myself. problem: as with being a miner, it is pretty important to maximize your available time. with this being said, i find it rather curious that a mining laser would continue to work on asteroid that no longer exists. i imagine that there is some code that makes the mechanic of when a mining laser deactivates it then determines how much ore was extracted based upon the time it was active. i understand that this is a game and that mechanics don't necessarily mirror real-life situations, but it really doesn't make sense why a mining laser would still be active while an asteroids mass has already been completely depleted.solution: make asteroids \"like\" structures giving them hit points. make mining lasers like regular guns that will reduce the structure of a given asteroid by the amount equal to whatever turret is being used and skill points given. i understand that this would most likely change the entire mechanic of mining since the minerals gained would no longer be attached to a cycle time. i also understand that this would have farther reaching effects in regards to mineral prices on the market and so forth. i thank you for your time and consideration.best regards.alkolik"
"the amount of minerals removed from the asteroid would indeed still be tied to a cycle time, the same way hps are removed from a target ship for each cycle of a weapon turret."
"this ^instead of new ships, i'd rather see player deployable racing gates that dim when passed going the correct direction. let the gates be linked and have a timer that times first gate to last. this would be an actual improvement over the current anchored sets of cans to make gates. further iterations would add course designers and touch sensors on the gates. different size gates could allow multiple racers to race at once. and... everything would be destructible, and manufacturable by players."
"this is a stealth anti new order thread. the new order calls non compliant miners bot aspirants. miners frequently are warned to not engage in botting, afking, petitioning new order agents, excessive mining etc as violations of the new halaima code of conduct. violators are subject to bump and ganking. like someone in this thread who famously lost a billion isk pod to a new order gank and then put a billion isk bounty on new order logistics corp. in short, we tell them they are bots or almost bots. we don't threaten to report them or call them eula violators. we call them code violators and take action on our own. we are on the receiving end of more actual eula violating actions such as real life threats, cursing and racial and homophobic insulting than we could ever petition. so we generally don't bother. so, somebody answer me this. would an agent of the new order calling a miner a bot be a eula violation under this idea? and if the answer is \"yes\", well, you can see what this really is all about.bing bangboomagent of the new order of highsecbelligerent undesirable by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
"it's clear the op is looking to retaliate against the player group responsible for the emergent gameplay resulting in this killmail:*do not post killmails in this forum* - ccp eternei believe bing bangboom is correct in that this player group has never threatened players with reports of eula violations, perceived or real. and i've witnessed first-hand the eula violating actions like real-life threats, cursing, and racial and homophobic slurs they receive from the so-called \"decent\" people the original poster fancies himself the champion of.this whole proposal reeks of bitterness and malice."
"actually, the way i read the proposal it seems like whitehound is attempting to adjust the eula to -protect- members of the new order of highsec. he is proposing that people who use threats that are based on the eula should be banned.from what i've read and seen this is typically a response of people who have had their ships destroyed for whatever reason. you know the one of, \"you're griefing!! i'm reporting you!!\"so, under the proposed changed, the person who makes that threat in local (and, i would assume mail) would be subject to a ban themselves. with this proposal describing someone's behavior as \"bot-like\" or \"bot aspirant\" is not impacted nor would it be an infringement of the proposed changes. i don't think this proposed change is needed but it is worth thinking about."
"why not?"
"whether you are correct or i am would result in much the same thing. new order agents are extremely aware of the limits the eula puts on player interaction. each thing we do have been carefully vetted to ensure we are not breaking it. the miners on the other hand have proven to be not only unaware of what the eula says but highly creative in making up many new rules for us to violate. if falsely accusing an agent of violating the eula would result in a poorly educated, emotional miner receiving a warning or even a ban the power of the new order would expand exponentially. i have been accused of violating the eula hundreds of times in my career. whole systems would be cleared of bot aspirant miners, the hard way.... don't give us that kind of power. although invincible we are only human.bbb by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
"the thing about the eula is that every player and organisation interprets it in a different way. it's purposefully vague, as are most eulas and is written in legalese so that they can cover their own arses in the legal sense.luckily ccp are usually willing to lay down exactly what you can and cannot do by (gasp) actually participating in discussion about it, the recent gm decision on bumping for example, they started a thread for feedback on it, then spent a month or so digesting all that feedback before coming to a decision and presenting it to us."
"thus a rule in the eula which states not to make accusations of eula violations would be extremely helpful in solving these problems.frankly, i am tired of the same, repetitive, boring and increasingly annoying accusations of being a bot. if this happens directly or indirectly as \"bot-like\" or \"bot-aspirant\" does not matter to me. i got ganked a single time, moved straight on, placed a 1b isk bounty on the gankers to put them into the top ten for good fun, which they could have used for bragging, and bought me a skiff. yet here we are and i am being stalked and accused of being bot-like over and over again. why can i move on but they can't?i am not sure if i should thank the new order for their comments now or if i should be just sad. i find it an annoying play style to accuse others of eula violations, which is a rather serious accusation and should not be taken lightly by anyone and so just goes beyond the sandbox.why do i then need to delete mails by unknown players, who believe what a blog says and then send me mails?! why do i need to read the same comments by the new order for the 8th-10th time where they say that i am bot-like? i am not a bot and i do not want to defend myself against every player for being afk and who can send a mail or post a comment. it is ridiculous and not worth the money i pay for a game.i say, away with it. i am sure some will feel the same way, some maybe don't even realize it yet how much better the game could be if they were not being accused of breaking the eula.and i am far from being selfish here. the proposal is intended to make the game better for all of us."
"haha... this^"
"and what about the guy who loses his titan and removes all the cap skills to drop his clone costs right down? or the guy who removes command ship skills, and then demands them back at the next patch? and what's wrong with pi anyway? it's literally free money."

"i sit in a nullsec system cloaked for days, even weeks, gathering intel on which alliances come and go through here, their peak hours, their preferred ship type, individual habits, and so forth.how do you propose my character receive bonus sp? i am performing a valid form of gameplay after all.summary of eves last four expansions:"
"as i said previously, this specific type of gameplay (that comes close to meta-gameplay) does not require any in-game skills other than cloaking. therefore, having low-skills somewhere does not hamper your capability to practice this activity, it is out of game skills that count.in that instance, just as for diplomacy for example, there can be no in-game sp reward, as there is no in-game skill that limitates your actions in that field.if you wanna be a good scout, train and practice scouting (and learn cloaking, yes, but it's not exactly the longest skill in the game).if you wanna be a good battleship pilot, spend 6+ months learning skills, and also train and practice to be on equal grounds with someone that has already trained that up.i'm of course not saying that the system should turn to those classic mmorpg xp grinder style, upping people to lvl 80, \"yay imma elite pvper in 3 days now\". i'm simply wondering if there could be a way that action is encouraged in another form than just isk.so tl;dr, to answer your question:activity based on in-game skill = bonusactivity based on out of game skill = no bonusand before you say \"but it's unfair!\" : well no, it's not, as you (almost) are not limited by in-game skills to do that job!"
"seriously, the above statement is not showing a limitation in eve as a game, its showing a limitation in your friends intelligence and willingness to work towards a goal.eve is not about jumping into a uberbattleship and screeching off into the universe with your solid gold pants on.....its about being dropped into this huge universe full of powerful people, in a little tin can and a few coins in your pocket. then figuring out what you want to become and how you are going to make your way there!there are many other games out there that reward grinding and where you can be level 80 in a week, so you can be all end of game raid and wear the bestest hat.... why do you want to turn eve into another one of those.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
"hahaha i was expecting a vet's condescending response, and i'm not disappointed.as i've said previously, it is very easy to say that \"eve is not about jumping into a uberbattleship\" when you can actually do it!it is somewhat less easy to actually discover the game and persist playing it, when so many players are old and have several accounts. and if you can't do **** for three months (come on, don't serve me the \"be a rifter hero\" bull ****, you know you actually need at least two months to understand enough of the game to do that, and one more month to have sufficient assets that you don't care about losing ships) it's frustrating.contrarily to what you seem to think, i do not want to turn eve into an xp grinder. i appreciate the fact that i don't have to be logged and grind every single free hour of every single day to have a chance to get to an equal ground with older characters: i'll never be!but i'll still log in and do stuff, so why not give active people a boost? what, you're afraid that some newbie will catch up with you through those bonuses? lol.anyway, it clearly shows me that nothing's wrong with this idea on principle, but human uncontrollable fever for xp grind would actually harm eve and i, as much as you guys, certainly don't want that.is it not possible to consider having this sp bonus for basic (newbie skills) only? that way vets don't have anything to ***** about, the grind remains about isk for the immense majority of the players, and it simply gives a boost to active new players without taking anything away from inactive players in the end (they still learn the skills as they would today).as for eve not rewarding grinding..... really? that's your argument? with tons of afk miners in the belt, mission and site runners in every corner of eve, do you really think eve is grinding free? as the meme goes, b*tch please."
"and there are good reasons why games that utilize that kind of reward model has more subscribers versus eve. just saying... i think the problem with this game, is that many of you die hard blow hards on the forums just cannot admit a better game model when it's actually better. you types are hung up on the fact that this is a \"unique\" game, despite the fact that that uniqueness is flawed in many important ways."
"are you kidding? rat's could give sp when shot, and completed plexes could also. i have no sympathy anyway since you live in an area that supposedly pays you isk wise for the risk you are taking, right? to expand the idea further, for killed rats and such, the combat sp's could be rewarded when your wallet updates every 15mins. i think it's totally fair."
"i agree to a certain extent. this is why i agree to this only if it were rewarded after completing a plex, mission, or whatever. the sp's could be rewarded and you can delegate where they go. the only catch is: if you complete a combat mission it rewards sp's that can only be used for combat type skills. mining mission sp's can only be used for mining skills/industrial. so on and so forth."
"since when is meta game a valid form of gameplay? if you ask me it's just a part of eve that will be abused far more often than the posters idea, which isn't completely bad. it's just half bad."
"since day one?"
"here we go. let's insult the intelligence of prospective players. as if you never dreamed of flying in a titan when you first heard of it. how is that plan panning out? yeah, didn't think so."
"it's meta game, meaning it's a part of the game, but not really. not officially anyways. so if it isn't official, then it's not valid gameplay and will therefore not be recognized as such."
"i like the general idea of this proposal, but the idea needs to be refined and remodeled. i've been playing this game for over four years now so in my opinion players like me don't need the boost, but giving new players a small boost to their skills with hard limits is actually a good idea. and here's how it should be accomplished:1) limit the skills that can be boosted to the essential core skills (these \"core\" skills are debatable) -spaceship command -engineering -gunnery -energy management -etc2) limit the total value of skill points added (again debatable on the exact number) -for example, if the total training time (assuming no implants and no remaps) takes 1 month to train up all the \"core\" skills to lvl 5, then these boost would take off a week training time3) limit the way these skill points can be awarded or earned -tie these bonus skill points to be only rewarded after completing portions of the tutorial missions.4) establish a \"use it or lose it\" system -once a player reaches all lvl 5's in the \"core\" skills, any remaining bonus skill points are deletedthis system would encourage new players to run the tutorial missions, it allows new players to finish the essential skills quicker which allows them to start training the skills that will put them closer to a veterans level. it's not game breaking in the overall process of playing because the bonus is small, but tangible and rewarding for new players. no veteran should cry about a new player being skilled a week earlier because we all know player skill and skill points are two very different things."
"solution.dont use all your mining lasers on the same asteroid.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

"i hit 'post' instead of 'cancel'.i'm not sure how i feel about this proposal - i'm not vehemently opposed to it, but my inclination is that one should err on the side of allowing more discussion instead of less. as whitehound points out, falsely accusing others of eula violations is generally unproductive. but on many occasions, what began as an accusation of eula violation leads to a fruitful discussion of what the eula actually entails. i'm open to opinions."
"this is all very clever whitehound. anyone who's been in a system that we're working knows this is our casus belli. we fly into a belt pick a miner out, drag his name into chat, accuse him of being a bot/bot-aspirant, and give him a chance to respond. this is the absolute best way to start a player interaction. there are a thousand things that can happen next. i don't see a problem with it. you know who has a real problem with it? bots and afkers. why you ask? because they have a 0% chance of stopping us. you may not believe this whitehound, but we are so easily beaten if you are at your keyboard it isn't even a competition.that is the thing about the new order i find so engaging. we tell people exactly what to do to beat us but they're usually botting, afk, or just don't care. sadly, we've never run out of targets.i'm awful sorry to have misjudged you whitehound. i thought you were alright with how things went down. hell, i've caught you in our systems a couple times and always \"o/\" at you in local. so be it. i oppose this idea. fly safeo7"
"i have no problem with you shooting my ship, but i sure have a problem with you accusing me of being a bot and even going as far as to call me out for it on a blog!who do you think you are to be treating a fellow player like this? i pay just as much for this game as you do and you try to get me banned from the game, or just to ruin my game time, by telling everyone i am a bot!you even follow me around here on the forum and keep trolling me with that one gank you have made, continuing to insist that i am a bot or being bot like!if you cannot see how wrong this and think this is just fine then how serious do you take the eula yourself? apparently is this all a joke to you and you do not take this serious at all. so do not tell me you now suddenly have a problem with my proposal.players have been accused of breaking the eula for as long as i am playing eve. there may have been a time when ccp did not take bots as serious as they could have, but i believe they are now doing everything they can and are being successful with it. therefore do i believe it is time to get rid of these constant accusations and the \"witch hunts\" some players indulge in, because it is not fun to be on the receiving end of it and being marked liked this within the community.nor do i like playing with players who might be breaking the eula, because if they do then it could affect me, too, and because i do take the eula serious.as you may know is ccp going to take botting within alliances more serious and to make alliance leaders responsible for the actions of their members. who here then wants to be accused of being a bot and watch how others begin to distant themselves from one, because of such accusations? i sure do not want to be treated like this."
"this thread is close to crossing the line. you guys have remained fairly civil for the time being, but please do not let your arguments devolve into personal attacks or insults."
"i'm not sure i've ever seen someone come up in local and start yelling about how he/she is going to report another player for eula violations... in fact i've never seen this, ever. and i'm in the business of shooting at people who are most likely to be bots. i did read your post, forgive me if i didn't get the right idea/direction, and i only skimmed the other posts. but please note, saying to someone of being/acting as a bot-aspirant, is not out right saying \"you are indeed a bot.\""
"i do indeed take the eula seriously. because of this i've never been warned, gagged, notified, or even talked to by ccp. in fact i can only recall one time ccp has warned one of us we might be going too far. one time ... not a bad record imo.if you get your way on this whitehound i would certainly be in violation of the eula. i oppose this idea for that reason."
"an accusation can be made directly or indirectly. it does not change what it is.if you then are aware of what you are doing or not does not matter, but it may only be unfortunate for you when you do not know how your accusations are being perceived."
"how would you propose to tell the difference between a warning given to a player about violating the eula out of genuine concern that that player not place themselves at risk of a ban, and a threat?"
"you do not tell the difference. you play the game, and either do not bother with what players do inside or outside the sandbox that could violate the eula, or you press f12 and petition it."
"so... if a new player asks a question or ignorantly proposes a course of action that you know to be in violation of the eula, you just ignore them and then petition them if they go ahead and do it?sorry if i seem bewildered, but as a new player myself, i don't get how this proposal is supposed to help me."
"the decision is for you to make. personally, i would not go around and petition everyone for the smallest thing.i did however only recently petition a player who indirectly threatened a group of players with stabbing them even when it is pretty hard to stab someone over the internet and we are playing in anonymity. it just is not acceptable talk to me and i do not think we need it here or that it is required for having fun in eve."
"so in answer to my last question about whether or not i ignore someone who is about to do something that i know is in contravention of the eula:but earlier when i asked about discerning the difference between a warning and a threat when the possibility of assisting a player eventuates...those statements conflict.on the one hand it sounds like you're saying that i should use my discretion as to whether or not to warn a player, but on the other hand you're saying that i should completely ignore them."
"if you cannot make the decision then just play the game. this is why we are here and we should not concern ourselves with the eula. if a violation is serious enough will ccp notice it eventually. i believe ccp uses detection systems and in cases where it has got a victim will the victim report it. you are not required to do anything about it nor should this ever become the case. if you must help ccp then do it discretely to protect those who might be innocent and leave the rest to ccp."
"so, from the answers to my questions it seems clear that the proposal: \"to make accusations of eula violation a violation of it's own\" would contain no distinction of what would constitute an 'accusation', and that merely attempting to discus the possibility of an eula violation would therefore be petitionable.the net effect of the introduction of such a proposal would be to discourage more experienced players from giving suggestions to newer players to help them avoid issues with the eula arising from their actions, as fear of misinterpretation of intent, for which no provision is intended to be made, would effectively create an environment where any discussion of the eula could be construed as harassment.this proposal is not in any way beneficial to newer players and would in fact be detrimental to them, for the reasons stated above.furthermore, in it's current state, this proposal infringes upon the inalienable human right of freedom of speech.if iceland is indeed seeking to become a member of the european union as the op has stated, then i can see the introduction of this proposal constituting a major stumbling block to that process and i would encourage ccp, for the good of eve, iceland, the european union and indeed the wider international community to summarily dismiss it on humanitarian grounds."
"know that ranting on the forums is not allowed. i can write this even without being a moderator and simply to inform you of the forum rules.freedom of speech is not the highest of the human rights and it has rights above it like the right on dignity. if you violate the higher rights with your speech then you can be denied your right of freedom of speech. for this reason can you not say whatever you like and racists remarks, hate speeches, ranting and trolling can all have consequences for you.other than this will i respect your opinion and treat your comment as such and not argue about it."
"thanks for the warning."
"i think this idea is terrible.... it essentially discourages players from reporting eula breakers in case they are \"wrong\" or in case the person they are accusing is \"well connected\". i think a more detailed report violator petition would solve most of the erroneous petitions. with specific questions designed to flesh out \"why\" you think this person is a bot, or \"why\" you think this person is violating the eula... furthermore... if someone \"overpetitions\" or what not, the gm's can deal with the overzealous culprit on their own.... perhaps they can create an internal list of complainers with low credibility.... but they shouldn't ban someone for reporting a perceived eula violation."
"we already have plenty of encouragement with the \"plex for snitches\" program, where players can get a free plex when their petitions on bots prove to be right. it does not need any more encouragement than this.anyone who throws accusations on chats and forums will more likely do this out of malice or revenge. it is unnecessary, and especially because eve is a pvp game is it important that players learn not to act like this, but to find other ways to deal with it, i.e. by shooting spaceships."
"i think you need to understand that what is being proposed is not a penalty for filing a false petition. the proposer wants you to be in violation of the eula for saying someone is violating the eula in local. just for saying it. like in saying \"you are a bot.\" lets just pull a random example from out of the air. say an agent of the old chaos approaches a, oh, a person , ok i can't think of anything but mining... so he approaches a person mining and talks to them in local. when the person doesn't answer, the agent says, in local, \"so and so is a bot\". under the proposed rule change, this would be a eula violation on the part of the speaker. not reporting them to ccp as a bot. not putting them on a bot list somewhere and asking ccp to clean them up... no, just saying \"so and so is a bot\". its an attempted gag order on the new order of highsec. a totalitarian solution to a libertarian movement. it boils down to \"\"shut up\" he explained\".bbb by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
"ok... this is even more terrible than i originally thought... social pressure is one of the strongest ways to combat botting... and trying to gag people for calling so & so a bot is just ridiculous... besides... the accused can always speak in local and to waylay any accusations. besides... where would you ever draw the line? \"bob is a bot\"\"i think bob is a bot\"\"i fear bob is a bot\"\"bob is acting like a bot\"\"i wonder if bob is a bot\" you can't sensor all of these, and social ingenuity will allow you to bypass any directly bannable offenses..."
"or when you gank a player and the player then retaliates with accusing you of being a griever and threatening to petition you. you can then point out to the player that what he does is against the rules and he needs to make a petition or to suck it up.i can only guess why this is not in your interest. perhaps the blog is your way of fighting back, which would not make much sense, because you would only fear of losing your fight here when really you gain a new tool.explain why this is bad for you so we can understand you."
"while this is only your opinion do know that bots do not care for what you say. only banning gets rid of them or else do they keep coming back. so you are only putting social pressure onto fellow players, who enjoy a bot-free game just as much as you do, and for no good reason."
"it's stupid to change the game just to accommodate one player.moderators, please lock thread.edit: personal attack removed - isd suvetarsummary of eves last four expansions:"
"first off if the guy with the titan wants to remove all his skills & lose all that isk in cap skillbooks, then that is his right & what does it matter to you.you second statement doesn't make sense, about someone demanding his skills back. that's like me losing a ship in battle & demanding ccp replaces it because i did't want to lose it.it is stated that before removing any skills that it is non reversal unless it is a hacked account.and back to pi, you are correct it is free money & i have two alts that dabble in it. its just that this character is for combat only & i was wrong to ever inject it on her. i don't do pi on her & never will again."

"the single biggest issue with eve for me at this point is travel.the vast distances over empires is what makes a thriving economy. it is also the thing preventing one area from being overrun by players from area b.it is also hindering any sort of casual game-play that is not planned in advance.corei suggest that ccp change the clone jumping mechanic to be restricted by isk not by time. make it so that you can clone jump twice for around 10m per day.(first jump 1m -> second 10m -> third 100m -> fourth 1000m etc. )what is it that the vast universe really hinders ?asset projection.why changing of jump cloning would not change that very much at all.well you can not bring your own ship on the journey, so either someone else already brought your ship to the deploy area or you go and buy another ship. this supports the different trade hubs as well as restricts asset projection as the original universe structure intended.extensionsmake it easier to deploy a jumpclone. either by giving corps with required standings the ability to act as brokers for jumpclones within game mechanics other than leaving your own corp and joining another. or simply lower requirements to \"not hostile 0<=\" to deploy a clone.this could also be the carrot for separating the empire factions with low sec in between. you can safely and quickly travel between these places by just clonejumping. to actually make a profit you would need to suffer risk of low sec.make empire clonejumping stations. a station that allows for anyone (restrictions could apply, based on standings, criminality and such according to best balance) to clonejump to another station in a different empire.this will bring your current clone with you, but leave your ship at the station.purpose and single goalto make it easier to coordinate with friends to do joint ventures without incredibly long set up times.to give players the opportunity to go out play with a friend and come back to his home station at the end of the day."
"it's called \"bounty contracts\""
"this would be great it would let small corporations temporarily move into unoccupied c1 and c2 wh's and mine all the unused gravimetric sites that build up there, without having to put up multiple large pos's to keep up with the refine volume, and lose 25% of the minerals off the top for no real reason it would reward industry in null and deep wh's it would be positive in every aspect if minmatar outposts need a corresponding buff to keep them usable, then sure i personally think increasing the refining amounts, and formulating the base yield so with 5 refining spec in that particular ore and with the 4% implant the yield would be somewhere around 95-99% would be fair, to maintain minmatar outposts as the best refining option--but 75% is insultingly low i think lowering the fitting requirements as well might be overcompensating a bit too much, i wouldn't want to buff refineries so much that rorquals become useless--but neither should using a rorqual and refining in high sec be nearly mandatorythis would be a simple and enormously important change to say that ccp should leave the simple and important changes undone, because they have to focus on the changes that will take years first, is really quite nonsensical this change should be done asap"
"agreed. ridiculous that that a ship can sit off invulnerable and undetectable (with eccm and small sig radius) while providing massive bonuses."
"unfortunately offgrid boosting is not a gamebreaker. despite what some people may think. if it was a game breaker there would be teams assigned to it, scrounging up as many ideas and shitcode that they can throw at the problem until something sticks and refine that into something that is workable.if the problem rates one person (that being said, that person is veritas). then the problem is either nigh unsolvable or quite down the list. from the sound of the quote i would say boosting mechanics are close to the single thread node problem in terms of difficulty."
"i have deleted an obvious troll post from here."
"having the command ship on grid 300km off would be a poor choice as it would be quickly chased off or caught and tackled by frigates and other light support burning towards it or simply being slingshotted by a prober. the safest place for on-grid boosters would be with the rest of the fleet, stuffed full of buffering modules and pre-locked by the reppers in the fleet."
"eve is such a big game that its true no current problem \"breaks\" the whole game. but based on the player feedback in this thread, this problem is causing the most damage to the game. i am not aware of a specific mechanic fix that has more support from the players.yes lots of players say \"fix null sec sov\" but they don't give any specific ideas as to what should be done. forcing boosters to at least be on the battle grid is pretty specific. we really don't have any idea what the techincial problem is. so its hard to speculate on what other options might resolve the issue and not be so technically difficult.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"if the ship is on grid you can see it and decide if you still want to take the fight. you can't warp 300km away from someone. bottom line: forcing ships to be on grid will solve the problem.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"i disagree with you. i don't think there is a need to limit how many sp's can be earned. i'm getting tired of being regulated for doing this, or that. we get enough of that in real life. i pretty much agree with what halcyon says here."
"why are smartbomb gate camps allowed in lowsec but stealth bombers can't launch bombs?"
"because there are no bubbles to catch stealth bombers as they warp away (stabbed battleships can be caught by hics and sufficient number of \"fast points\")... they can be used far more precisely than smartbombs... and a reasonable number of bombs can melt anything battleship class and lower."
"in my opinion lowsec is pretty much fine as it is, with the exception of smartbomb camps. now more than ever pirates seem to love parking their shiny bss in popular fw systems and get infinite free kills (lots of frigates coming through, and although most frigs can tank it, ecm frigs almost never survive these camps). what part of this is balanced if you can't know they're there without relying on a scout (who still has to risk it himself) or spending 5 minutes per system scanning? i don't mind the isk cost because the frigs are cheap but i'm sure this has great potential to **** off vets (clone cost)."
"then do what us vets do... - learn where smartbombing camps are popular- create safespots 150+ kms around gates you commonly use and/or where camps commonly happen- warp to a gate at 10km rather than 0- watch local for \"skulls\"- use d-scan- suck it up and use something tankieralso know that smartbombing battleships, while annoying...- cannot actively align to \"instawarp\" away from danger... not without giving up their alignment to catch potential targets.- usually have weakish tanks (large smartbombs use up a lot of grid, you need capacitor boosters to run everything including your active tank, and stabs use up precious low-slots)- have little to no offensive ability beyond the smartbombs themselves (faction smartbombs only have a range of 6 to 7 km... but most people use the cheap ones with a range of only 4 to 5 km... well within scram and null ammo blaster range)- are slow and easily caught by ships coming in from the other end of the gate."
"1.0"
"1.0"
"this is an obvious contradiction. if you can't even hold to the principle you are espousing, in the thread in which you present it, how do you expect anyone else to ever follow it? i hope that ccp realizes this proposal is hopelessly paradoxical and straight out of 1984: a rule, which it to even mention, breaks that same rule. we will all call it the fight club rule, which will itself be bannable to say once this meaning is established, et cetera."
"there is a difference between the two. you're assuming that i believe they are a bot without reasonable doubt. the player in question could very well be afk. still, i'm not going to wait around for an unknown amount of time to confirm and even if i did, that still doesn't prove anything. you're walking into this thinking that people assume players who don't interact are automatically considered bots and those \"bots\" are then reported. i don't know where you're getting your information from, but like i said i've never seen another player come out right in local chat accusing another player of being a bot and threatening to report them, ever.if someone doesn't respond, i don't automatically thing they're a bot and i don't believe most people do either.are you sweet talking me? i am aware of what i'm doing and it does matter, i don't believe you are aware of what i'm/other people are doing concerning this topic."
"why is it a contradiction?"
"like i said before, it does not change what it is. nor does it matter what you think or what you believe when you make the accusation.for example, even when i a do not think of myself as a racist would it still be racism if i accused somebody of being a \"n-word\". i could think about myself whatever i wanted and it would not change a thing, but i'd still be a racist."
"you tell others not to concern themselves with pointing out the rules to others, to let ccp deal with it. you point out the rules to others. this is a contradiction. i thought it was pretty clear already."
"i felt it to be necessary for this particular discussion. do you think i was wrong?"
"based on the moral stand you're taking, yes, what you did was wrong.it clearly contradicts what you have been arguing. the situation is different, but as you have argued, that shouldn't change the application of the standards you seek to uphold.is this a threat, or a warning? you've contradicted your own moral stance by posting, albeit with the best of intentions, a statement that could be perceived as threatening.you have beautifully illustrated precisely why the proposal you've made is impracticable."
"in which case you would be using the proposal against me and proven its success.it was neither a threat or a warning. it was an explanation and a trap for you. if you were honestly against the proposal then you would not have used it. yet you did and you seem to be enjoying it!"
"you're mistaken, i'm not saying that i think that what you did was wrong, i'm saying that based on the moral stand you're taking, what you did was wrong.you contradicted your own moral stance by doing something that you believe to be morally wrong. based on your arguments, if you believe what you're saying, you must believe that what you did was wrong.on the contrary, what you actually did, was to make a mistake. see above."
"it was unfair what i did, but not being free of sin only makes us human and shows that we need rules. it does not relieve us of them."
"i have deleted some trolling from this thread."
"you've incorrectly stated that i used your proposal. i have shown that i haven't, you have provided no evidence to the contrary.if you disagree, please quote me and i am more than happy to continue our discussion."
"your feeling that it is necessary to break the rule you yourself proposed shows that the rule should be discarded and discussion of it discontinued. your question is therefore not material, nor would any other be."
"if you cannot stay on topic but feel to make this personal then i will just ignore you and not take you serious. i am not here to feed a bunch of trolls."
"i am staying on topic and not making this personal. i am making logical arguments which are irrefutable. making it personal and going offtopic would be if someone said they werent taking people seriously because they were trolls. that would be a real problem, if someone did that."
"i don't see you posting on topic!can we please not have this?"
