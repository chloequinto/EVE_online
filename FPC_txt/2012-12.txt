welcome to my hell
so rvb  red federation has just disbanded 3000 players and we just stole their alliance name so they cant reform if only there were some mechanic in place to prevent these alliances from being permanently trapped in wars im not even sure they can reform into a new alliance because theyre still stuck in outgoing wars
10 isk says it becomes an extenuating circumstance and they get their alliance back
would surprise me if ccp would actually grow a pair and it wouldnt happen d unbelievably low tollerance to stupidity in people that  you being your mothers child might aswell be the main reason why i am not your father
what happened to that beating a dead horse thread with modulated poss thats what id like to see
while youre at it could you boost the corp bookmark limit as well i have lost count of how many times we have bumped into it and had to go pawing through deleting bookmarks that may not be ready to expire out
thats a poor reason sure i understand noone wants to get podded with bubbles in low sec but you could use the reason that the gates are controlled by concord and so any bubbles get popped by the sentry guns smartbombs are allowed in low sec as an aoe weapon should smartbombs be removed from low sec poor fiction disallows bombs and a decent gameplay feature
cloaking devices are broken they need some kind of modification like fuel or something that one afk cloaker cannot spend month just sitting on system
please use the search function to find out why this is and has always been a terrible ideanot supported for the millionth time
jf cost allot not because they never die it is because of the regular materials that goes into one combined with expensive tech 2 for a capital tech 2 tend to be 510 fold cost of tech 1

fun trumps realism imho at least for game implementation
im going to go with no
best answer to this you mad broanswer yesreply moar tearsregardslee anderson
nope their counter is the ability to fire back  these ships are substantially weaker on their own and require the ability to attack targets of opportunity to be honest a procurer can probably kill a manticore no problem as a side note

there are 3 good counters to cloaking1 move over hop over a system or two if they follow see below if not they are truly afk and not a problem2 set a trap go out in a hulk and mine away with a blue cloaked nearby3 show force have the blue not clocked i am not sure who is out in null with zero support anyway
 op the fix afk cloaking topic has been posted to death do some research before posting also your forum thread doesnt add anything to whats already been discussed on the topic hopefully this thread gets locked soon things to keep in mind
try it on buckingham you might be surprisedb eve game designer   team super friends b
i was hoping an announcement like this was going to be coming on the day before deployment well played ccpnot sure what i think about the red fed thing zerg youre basically thinktank griefing now ive noticed corps arent getting proper instructions on what to do when they join decshield or on how many players they can be legally shot by the surrender list and the begging that comes with it just for us to let some bears out of a mistake they made by misguidedly joining decshield bear this outi came into this experience thinking the only annoyance for us was the constant notifications maybe even get some pew out of it and that you were doing this solely based on philanthropic reasons but the red fed name steal and the lack of any kind of movement on your side suggests there is more to this and youre getting a little too much enjoyment out of being the hand on the mixing spoongive red fed back their alliance name youre actually affecting the new player base subbing on a game you claim to be an advocate for
the chance of this happening is pretty close to 100 got to grant special protections to groups that ccp likes
screwing up low entry pvp is a good reason to force someone to change their alliance nametundragon  low sec piracy since 2003  youtube  join us
even another alliance couldnt get this from the devsim really curious what will happen next 
sweet so you guys changed the rules at the last moment to stop the new loophole im downloading buckingham now but i doubt theres enough time left for me to actually verify things before retribution goes live edit ive just received a second verification from another dev saying that our proposed loophole has been fixed
honestly i preferthe current method of actually messing witht he geometry ive seen some messed up faces you could never get with just basic slider options and it would eb a shame to see that goalso as far as visual interaction goes in the creation process alot of my friends have mentioend to me they prefer it over sliders because it feels like they are actually making the character as opposed to choosing from various ones already amde that sliders no matter how variable tend to evoke
great article on social gamingabout a game created in 1985 personally i think ccp is at its best when it creates simulations based of the canon of its universe it tends to do horribly when it tries to make a game fw plex balancing its gamey feels gamey and inevitably gets owned the destiny engine for fleet fights somehow the core fundamentals of the simulation havent changed that much in 9 years and they keep workingjust my 002 isk of course
i agree on most parts except for removing them form the open marketi honestly oprefer to think my character is just using a shady marketchannel disguised as a teddybeardistributionoutlet to buy my combat drugsrealistically though limiting these to only direct trades might discourage newer players in that they all of a sudden after getting curbstomped in lowsec 3 or 4 times they all of a sudden hear about these magical drugs that make them significantly stronger that they have no way of knowing how tog et or even what they are called adn which ones do what it would just come across to them as a hidden advantage players in the know have that they could not compete withsorry for any spelling errors currently on an old computer and the lines im typing take about 810 seconds to show up on the screena nd i cant be arsed to go back and type it on a bumpy bus
but none of that matters because all you experience was up to the transfer process all that is after and that info is a lost fork not to say that there shouldnt be some confusing stuff but it would be experienced duringafter upload in the cloning bayid suggested a quick cutscene for the beginning of the game first person of the pod filling with fluid while the system jacks you in and initializes the hud and camera as a replacement for the loading screen could be just a couple seconds long
i was told about this thread just now so apologies for not replying earlier since we are currently active on help chat on tq because of the retribution release today i cant go into specifics just now but i have read the idea and like it a great deal and would like to thank op for bringing them to light these ideas would tie well with an iteration to the overview i will bring them to the eve ui group for discussionall the best for now and i hope you all like retribution ccp arrow  director of user experience  eve online  ccparrow
thank you ccp arrowknowing that a developer have read this forum couldnt make me happier today now i just hope the ccp ui group will like the idea too
ccp what have you done taking away a good thing and not giving us the option for it once you implement your halfworking dynamic sound systemwhat i propose is that you bring back the jukebox but also let locationbased music be an optioni cannot live without having my below the asteroids or my surplus of rare artifacts ready to play at a moments notice without alt tabbing into ccps soundcloud then coming back to the game seeing im in half armor because i had to leave the game to change the musica fellow player has made a petition for ccp signing it will show our strength
same here it sucksccp please bring the jukebox back would you
they took the boobies away
what would the world be like with no more boobies would there be less war nothats no religion would there be more war oh godno please dont take boobies think of the children
fix large shield extenders they are far more powerful and should be adjusted for ship classes a hurricane with a great passive tank of 2 x lse is not a fair setup i think a new module should be introduced called xlarge shield extender and hp bonus adjusted accordingly to ship that it fits onthis is how an extender size should fit each ship classfrigate micro shield extenderdestroyet small shield extendercruiser  medium shield extenderbattlecruiser large shield extenderbattleship xlarge shield extender
the current setup micro  wtf are these actually in the game still i think they are legacy small  not worth fitting medium  for frigs and destroyers large  for cruisers bcs and bs as for plates 200 or 400 mm frigs and dessies 800 or 1600 mm cruisers 1600 cruisers bcs and bss put in that context the lses seem to be in the right position although a full rebalancing to make 50  100 mm plates as well as small shield extenders worth something is reasonable
finally a senior gm handled the situationi got the plex now thx everyone for posting
1having an external fix for something that wasnt broken in the first place is rather pointless
i second this give us back the jukebox
the wrath of retribution mutilated my beloved jukebox what a sad day where is my nouvelle rouvenor hero to save my dayseriously though i read torfifrans dev blog and i dont like the external solution at all simple as thatplease just reimplement it
yes ccp please please devote more of those precious developer hours to reimplementing and maintaining code that has nothing to do with the actual product youre sellingalso i demand that my refrigerator also preheat my oven
i also miss my beloved jukebox please ccp bring it back or at least tell us why it was taken away
ingame sound has nothing to do with the game oh well you are probably just an armor triage piloti forgive you poor sinner
i like not having to alt tab out to change the music tracks i like being able to pick a track to play whenever i want while at the same time hearing cool event music when i enter a plex or am doing a mission having a jukebox is just damn convenient like the stupid pointless web browser i love
oddly my game still has ingame sound without the jukebox maybe your client is brokenand this was not a surprise folks they only announced this a couple of weeks agoremember reading is fundamental if you choose not to be informed that is not ccps problem
yeah well reading is fundamental then surely you have noticed that i mentioned torfifrans team klangs dev blog smartass just because you dont care about eves music doesnt mean nobody doesnow that the troll is fed onwards to another matter if the jukebox doesnt return it would be nice if you could not only put the tracks on soundcloud but also enabling them for download so we can integrate them into our own playlists cheers
this is a fantastic idea and i support it yes 1000 times yesanyone who says that a successful drug dealer doesnt dip into their own produduct isnt harvesting their base materials and cooking them in their own spacegarage besides you never know what that stuff you buy off the guy on the corner of jita and sobaseki is cut with 3
nerf my drone nerf my fitspank me til i cannot siti dont care im still freeyou cant put a bra on metake me out into lowweb me so im really slowburn the pos and bomb with gleeyou cant take my boobs from mei know ccp totally could but please dont
i am laughing so hard right now i got through half the first verse before i made the connection i really miss that show
same here finally got a bluray player and bought the series again on bluray
honestly up in the air about most of these however totally for mroe wormholes and c7 wormholes gets a little crowded in a c6 sometimes
i would like anyone who has thoughts on how corporation members killing another corp members orca or other high priced industry ship is combat mechanics working as intended i understand corporation members allowed to engage in combat perhaps for practice or what have you but a disgruntled corporation members getting a free orca kill or taking out a mining fleet and nothing you can do except hold the memory hard in your heart and never talk to other players this type of behavior kills relationships with other playersthough i have never lost an orca i have seen examples of this kind of abuse and find it disturbing that there is nothing to really be done except forget about recruiting for corporations perhaps someone can explain why this is perfectly acceptable or how one might avoid this kind of abuseand yes it is abuse scoring free kills because of a lolz you let me in your corp gets around the mystical ever watchful eye of concord i would think concord would respond to noncombat vessels in distress or why bother having them in the first placeedit i might add with the new safety feature the excuse of friendly fire accidently concording them shouldnt be a problem anymore
have you tried shooting back
you try combat in an orca against battleships let me know how far it gets you besides what im mostly referring to is two core problems 1 concord believes attacks on industries is okay in high sec i dont see how this would make sense on any level they assume that corporations are approving these actions2 corporation members are allowed to betray each other and get away with it no criminal flags are going to be thrown this retribution patch completely ignores this still present problem someone can do close to a billion isk worth of damage to you for free and the only recourse is well dont trust anyone and play alone if you dont like itthere must be some middle ground some way of allowing you to group with other players and not have this giant loop hole to worry about constantly a corporation member should be the one person you can trust on some small level as ccp does not allow you to recruit orcas into your corporation for the sole purpose of killing them neither should ccp allow members to join corps for the purpose of killing orcasedit this comes from a gm reply to my concerns stating that this is corporation mechanics as intended i have come to argue there is problem where industrial ships are concerned i think this should be reviewed as an exploit
there are a several good reasons why you would allow corp mates to shoot industrials  they could be used in some entertaining battle badger like tournament  you might be insurance frauding them  you are testing the their tank  you are trying to stop a corp thief that is hauling your valuable assets off  you are pissed off at the corp and want to inflict major damage to it  webtowarp freighters and orcasso why should concord defend them furthermore if you truly believe these ships to be of such value why dont you step up and keep it safe examples a if it is so valuable then why dont you have protection for it escort it with a blackbird or falcon or even a griffin so it can get away you could even store these ships inside the ship maintenance array and have your corp mates switch to them if you get attacked b alternatively you can keep your valuable assets in an alt corp away from potential hostilities of an awoxer trust should be earned my corp has trial periods where members are given limited rights until they pass the trial period you can use social media and forums to publicly declare awoxers and untrustworthy players for all of eve to know about your entire corp can gang up on the member and destroy his stuff until he leaves corp and then you can place bounties declare wars suicide gank and socially sabotage him until you feel vengeancejustice has been served you see all those options i listed above thats the middle ground what you are asking for is the ability to just straight up prevent someone from awoxing your valuable industrial operations thats not looking for a middle ground thats flipping an off switch to make you and yours safe because you dont want to utilize any of the other methods awoxing has a long tradition in eve and you need to have a very compelling argument why it should not be allowed frankly all youve brought to the table is its not sociallymorally fair eve is a dystopia and socialmoral unfairness is not only allowed but encouraged now can you show why it is mechanically unfair can you give a reason not centered around a moral compass that these actions should be inhibited can you explain why the current awoxing situation is unmanageable then and only then will you have an case worthy of discussion
morality and money are the two things that govern laws this mechanic abuses both
the best solution to this issue would be a margin call at the end of the trading day downtime when all margins are settled if that leaves people with negative balances for putting up buy orders they couldnt afford then they simply wont be trading until they grind back the isk they owe the scc for covering the tradethis would make margin trading a risky proposition but a lucrative one for legit speculators
no this would open the up exploits to get free isk i setup an alt with 100b of stuff on a sell order which with margin trade 5 i need 24b in escrow to setup i then sell my alt said item for 100b putting 100b in my wallet at the end of the day i have 100b in my wallet my alt has  76 billion in his i forget about my alt train up another margin trading 5 character rinse and repeat soon ill be very very wealthy and the isk i earn from this scheme allows me to pay plex to activate new accounts and repeat ad infinitum any mechanic that transfers isk from player a to player b in a manner that allows player a to go into negative isk creates this dilemma and will be abused as such
are you really that terrified of a player whos away from his keyboard maybe this game isnt for you if you scare that easily perhaps hello kitty online is just right for yousummary of eves last four expansions
not this thread again
so an update on what were seeing so far1 were not sure if the situation has been fixed2 wars that are set mutual by the defender can start a 24hr retraction by the aggressor we set all our wars unmutual right before the expansion to avoid this and rightfully so a dropped corp experienced 74 retractions in under 8hrs by staying mutual3 no wars against dec shield have ended in the past 48hrs by random distribution of our 286 wars around 81 should have naturally ended by now so something is going on4 we proposed a new method of maintaining infinite war by a repeating multiday staggered sequence of dropping corps out of alliance and rejoining a few days later to restore any dropped wars under the old rules this would have been effective because the start date of wars were set fresh when a corp joinedleft an alliance two devs have sworn this is fixed but not how they fixed it our proposed fix was to inherit the start date from the parent war when making a copy to prevent the 7 day extensions5 corps dropping out of an alliance still do not inherit the start dates of their parent wars because of the dev insistence that this loophole wont work weve concluded that all wars have a hidden enddate that isnt visible to the players it is possible that copied wars now inherit this hidden enddate timer from the parent wars thus its very possible the loophole is closed and we wont know until its too late6 but using evidence from point 3 above something has changed with wardec mechanics or its a feature we never knew about before because we had never unmutualed wars as i said we should of had 81 retractions by now and weve had none therefore weve come to believe that the act of unmutualing a war sets the hidden enddate timer back by at least 48hrs probably 7 days therefore since its possible to instantly mutualunmutual a war weve begun tests along these lines to see if unmutualing extends the enddate we will know for sure in 5 days the results of these tests
starting a corporation for new players is extremely difficult and frustrating aspect of eve online currentlyi started my corporation a short while ago because i enjoy all the administrative duties that come with organizing a large group of gamers i also enjoy teaching new players all the intricacies of eve online i have been having a grand time talking to new players bringing them into a corporation and teaching them all i know they are a good natured bunch who are a great deal of fun to play the game with then there came the first wardec standard setup the enemy only engaged when they had a clear advantage they are unwilling to risk a fair fight another issue is with faction warfare an incident occurred when a rupture from an opposing faction was camping the couster station killing new faction warfare players as they undocked why werenUFFFDt the station guns shooting him why was he able to dock are we at war with the faction or not i was under the impression that faction warfare was a good place for new players to start pvp right away clearly i was mistakenwardecs are hugely in favor of the declaring corporation they have the ships and isk prepared they can receive help from neutrals any time and if they are any good they have them prepared as well they can hide in a station all day and for whatever reason they have no problem not actually playing the game they disrupt a corporations ability to make isk to buy new ships and to enjoy the game they are only doing it because they can grief easy targets without risk this ruins the fun for those new players my peoples first taste of eve includes getting 20million isk worth of stuff from starter missions meeting a neat group of people who are fun to play with and then losing everything they have to greifers and being unable to play the game they just spent hard earned money on the only reason they stuck around was because i promised them it wasnt always like this and that eve was actually a really fun game i am now under wardec from 2 other corporations and i have egg on my face i cant hire anyone to help i have no reason to trust that they will helpfor the faction warfare end of things i recommend the solution of making faction police more responsive to enemy faction attacks in system also by making gate guns and station guns fire on hostile factions in highsec and refusing docking rights to hostile factions in highsec for the wardec end of things i recommend an exponential increase in the cost of wardeccing corps with new active players killing a room full of kittens with a baseball bat isnt sportthe biggest thing that eve has going for it is the sandbox pvp but if i cant keep things stable long enough for new players to get a good handle on the pve aspects of eve then how are my members supposed to get to a point where they can enjoy the best part of eve
and so should you youre playing in a virtual dystopia where the economy is based on warfare you should expect war to come knocking on your door at a moments notice interesting fact if a neutral gives remote repairs to a person you are at war with you can shoot themalways count on your enemy bringing backup in some form or another if its logi you are having issues with bring energy neutralizers it it is offgridboosters bring ewaralso the tricks to getting rid of an annoying wardec is to bore the attackers ie do nothing make the war unprofitable ie kill their expensive ships and make the war expensive for them contact them directly and see if you can work out a deal often they just want a fun fight so give them one on the condition that they drop the dec george lemmy doesnt understand the point of a war declarationyou can hire someone via the ally system there are plenty of pvp corps that will gladly join in your war for free if it gives them targetsand those corps you hire have no reason to trust you either for all they know you could be an alt of one of their enemies and are trying to drag them into an elaborate trapthe docking denial makes sense the rest of it though no speaking as someone in fw its already plenty hard to kill people in enemy highsec without dying yourself those that do it just have a lot of experience doing itbesides if your newbies are getting killed by a cruiser in highsec how well do you think theyll do in lowsec
exploit found veterans create a corp full of newbie characters and use them to conduct their business in highsec without fear of a wardecbesides what constitutes as a newbieby not doing the pve to train for pvp seriously low level pve doesnt teach you much if anything about pvp or give you the opportunity to learn the mechanics that you must use to survive against another playera level 1 mission will not teach a newbie that you must fit a warp disruptor and a propulsion mod microwarpdrive or afterburner to tackle someone missions in general dont teach newbies how to speed tank fit omniresistances how to evade pursuing hostiles by warping into icon clusters how to get under guns the list goes onyou know what does actually doing it and talking to more experienced people who may or may not be the same people who blew you up about what you did wrong
let me spell it out for yano pve  no isk making  no pvp shipsi have no issues with these wardecs i have cash i have experience new players dont and i cant cram years of experience down their throats in a matter of days its also is not fair to tell them dont play eve for the entirety of the wardecyou make a new corp recruit 30 new players and teach them for a month ill send some people to wardec ya and well see how well your people do
i never said thatbolded the important biti pve every day in some form or another i just expect someone to blow me up around every corner and planfit accordingly and honestly most people should adopt the mentality even in highsec id bet hard isk that most of the whines on the forums here would disappearexperience cant be taught it must be gained make your newbies fight you or make them fight each other to the death then tell them what they are doing wrong each time and reimburse them thats what my corp leaders did back when i was a newbie and when we were war decced back then many of us died so the directors gave us all cheap gank ships assembled us and told us primary target is  turn on everything and bumrush him we the newbies still died but we killed way more isk than we lost
what do you do with a frigate fleet against a faction battleship that wont leave the station what can you bring to fight roving bands of strategic cruisers these are honest questions on our first wardec i took our guys out to lowsec so our enemies would think twice about bringing their shiny toys in exactly that kind of setup with exactly that plan in mind but the enemy did not come every experience i have ever had with wardecs is that if a fight looks even slightly fair your opponent will not show up they will wait until they know hey have an easy kill with a corp full of new players they are pretty much guaranteed some easy kills
if the person hugs a station dont engage just fly away get ewar a lot of ewar ecm specifically energy neutralizers work well tooif the person is sniping at range get probes probe the person make himher feel unsafe using that shiny ship get ewar again damps work perfectly in this situation a single celestis can frustrate the efforts of a single sniper fly into the next system set up fast tackle and dps on the other side grab the guy when heshe jumps through use ewar i know i sound like a broken record but few people war dec eve university possibly the one corp with the largest concentration of newbies in the game for a reason its because they blob people with  dozens of blackbirds and griffinsthey literally make every fight as frustrating as possible to make it not worthwhile to engage them so use that to your advantageif you dont want your enemy to engage make it look like you are ready to spring a trap i recommend a procurerif you want your enemy to engage make it look like you have less than you really have ex get one of the more experienced newbies into a battleship super tank it bait in a system and save the newbie when heshe has the hostile locked downand there is no problem with this if given the choice everyone everywhere will take the easiest route to victory ill kill someone if its easy the same way someone else will kill me if its easy for them hell im sure even the famous carebear chribba would blow someone up if he knew his chances for victory were high and no one would come after himlook if you feel youre in a bad position and you dont have the ability to climb out of it no matter what you do then its probably a better idea to just scrap the corp altogether and save yourself the angsta proper corporation in eve is not like a guild in other games its not just a banding of multiple pilots under the same banner or cause its effectively a declaration that youre ready to play with the big boys it says that you are confident in your abilities and can hold your own a corp gives you the ability to do things and have perks that you cannot have by yourself but the tradeoff is that you are opened up to the hostilities of others
here i thought the only attention i was going to get was trolls thank you
i could go down this point by point but it would be laborious to point out the obvious for an extended period of time so you get this instead htfu there are dozens of options available to combat your enemy so fight for what you have or dock up it makes no difference to me
just put all your pilots in blackbirds and jam your enemies giving them massive blue balls such a tactic will frustrate your enemies making them hopefully find you to be bad targets have your corp stay together and always be ready at any given moment to outnumber your foes if they dont kill anything you win and they go home bored and will find someone else to pick on if they start stacking eccm modules and implants do something else to frustrate them without being able to kill you also you can bring more blackbirds if your members dont want to be all in one spot say to badput blackbirds cloaked in all your missions falcons preferably but you can fit a reg cloak on a blackbird blackbirds at all of your mining ops then when they have to much eccm get celestises and damp them for all i care if you want your noobs to mine only let them do it in one system if at all and designate someone to keep a watch out on all the entrance gates preferably with a cloaked ship or noob account not in corp if you run missions have someone scout whenever you jump through a gate and do it in a system with as few entrances as possible be wary of log off traps the griefers will log off on a stargate you are likely to use and have a scout look for one of your members come by then they all log on at once and kill him i should know i war dec nublets all the time also you can hire your own mercenariespeople who wardecs are like bullies we keep going for the person who gives us a good response if you just dont reply and have no interest in fighting back with your feeble resources we will get bored
a faction bs on station you ignore it it cant catch frigates especially in empire space use griffins to jam him out use instaundocks to come and go from station safely use tactics to evade him until he is vulnerable also 20 frigates especially now that there are rr frigates can run lvl 4 missions very entertainingly a 30 man gang of frigates is extremely powerful it wont beat a 30 man t3 gang but it will destroy a 510 man t3 gang learn to utilize ewar learn to coordinate your attacks and have fun doing it so blueball them if they dont get easy kills they will eventually leave you alone run from them move your base of operations dont engage until you have the advantage utilize allies to help you out utilize neutral alts to mess with them too there are tons of options you need to step up and lead in all seriousness pm if you have pvp questions agonys pvpuniversity teaches pvp to the general eve populace and our introduction class pvpbasic is all about utilizing frigates to have great fights we take 30100 man frigate gangs into nullsec with everyone one of our classes and smash them into organized gangs of bss and t3s and logistics and we often win the battles because a large number of frigates is extremely potent even if they are individually fragile so right here you have found a way to evade the war dec situation in lowsec there are level 14 agents there are good plexes there is mining if thats your thing there are si facilities you can access sure you have to be weary of pirates and the like but thats part of eves landscape in all seriousness adapt you may not get to play exactly like you want but these intrusions into your gameplay should be seen as an opportunity to take your corp in a new direction
it would be great be like 4 jitas one for each race i have never left my caldari space i have never left the main sys i live in for months not even one jump all the places cut off would become trade hubs and they would make the stuff and mine for it in that area of space then be right back to the way it is now x4 there is all ways a way to by pass you being part of the game 3 weeks later op we need to end high sec
missiles nerfed again as long as ive played eve its seems that missiles get less and less ive lost over 60 k of range from the cereb  the complaint use to be missiles are over powered now they are crap  the drake a missile ship now wont even hit at max range come on 35 drop off  i trained all my missiles skills too 100 percent over the years and the caldari a missle loving people cry at how sorry a missile is now  when an orcale can put out 1600 damage a round where is the comparassion to missiles yeah i know the drake can tank alot but come on it has to as it will take hours to kill anything lets be fair here its a missile it should be deadly with the right skill set i could go on and on about comparisions but we all know missiles have the bad deal here
heavy missiles had better dps than any other longrange medium weapon system in game and thus needed the nerfcomparing anything to a t3 bc but another t3 bc before they are tiericided is silly specially if even the weapon systems are differenthams torps and rockets got buffed this expansion by not being exluded from some rigs and implantsthe damage of light missiles got buffedtech 2 missiles had their silly penalties removedprecision missiles were buffed they no longer do less damage than t1fitting a bunch of launchers got easierthe golems target painting got buffedtell me again how missiles overall got nerfed badly againwe want pve activities to require active participation and mirror pvp more closely stacking penalty for npc ewar thenUFFFDlock range under 9km from over 100 in a bs is not fun norUFFFDis two npc web drones making me crawl 10ms pvp sw900 x5 75ms
so you got your butt handed to you by a hurricane instead of changing your tactics you come to the forums and plead with ccp to change the game in a futile effort to make up for your individual shortcomingsyeah i thought so lses are fine summary of eves last four expansions
great argument you do that often yeah i thought so you are dumb
meh i prefer the sculpting approach i just wish there was that level of customizability beyond the physical form of the characteri also wish that the clothing and hair designers had hooked up with the people who wrote the lore too instead of designing generic space1980s rave outfitstm but maybe thats asking too much
on nov15 ccp fozzie talked about change for ewar cruisersfiftynine down  ship balancing for retributionnow from yesterdays patch notehow does an unchanged dronebay and painting bonus being significantevery other ship including golem with tp bonus got the buff why does ccp hate bellicose so muchi mean bellicose is like the only potential tp ship in the game that can scale into a real fleet consider that the poor locking rangeehp of vigil and hyena and the general inequality of web  tp on huginn and rapiers show some love please
see that post its awesome 3whatever is done the current ui need some love btw a search filter would be even by himself anhuge improvement
hello nyalnarayes i have read betolis post but i dont know how all these changes could look like ingame here is what i would suggestbetoli wrotewe should not be limited to one  dual overview and maybe more tabs could helpbetoli wrotetabs are far too annoying and unintuitive to set up with consequences for getting it wrong it is the epitome of spreadsheets in space i like tabs they help quickly splitfilter elements in the overview but i agree they are unintuitive to set up though one thing annoys me a bit is the slowlyness of the ui  especially after jumping through a stargate or after undocking a station the game sometimes doesnt feel really reactive i am sure some players have lost battles in lowsecnullsec just because their interface hasnt refreshed quickly enoughand yes the overview window does look more or less like an excel spreadsheet but how could ccp gather and display all these informations quickly  i havent the final solution to this issue but i tend to think players shouldnt have to search for these informations everywhere on the screen so gathering them all in one window isnt maybe the worse idea ccp hadbetoli wroteconfigurable buttons column for common actions appropriate for each object linked to tab settings you should never need to right click take cans  what do i ever do with them  approach and open so my cans setting should have those two buttons in the button column other people might want warpto and orbit for cans too here are mockup images for this betolis suggestionnew column with action buttons
i totally agreei am not a good player i dont know yet all kinds of ships and sometimes when i see a ship in my directional scan or in the overview i tell myself   hmm is it dangerous or not  is it big or not  is it a t2 ship i dont know how but being able to quickly know more about a ship could save many players livesships mine firstmaybe hovering the line in the overview where the ship is listed could display the following tooltip first the player selects normally the ship theres nothing new in this image 
its in some ways a handy feature to allow personal playlists into the game not many other games offer that without serious modding though ccp picking playlists based on location and situation seems to add more atmosphere and immersionmaintaining a mp3 player also takes resources that could be used in other placesfrom the list of changes sounds like they adding a heck load more of sound related stuff so its certainly not like they abandoning it
i have to support this the jukebox made it easy to music play without having to alt tab in and out of the game it also added a convenient interface for pausing the music as for claiming that it takes resources to maintain a jukebox that is bullshit it probably took more time for the developers to remove the code than it would have to leave it in and what is there to maintain about an mp3 function  last time i checked mp3 technology is was fairly simple and efficient it is yet another example of developers thinking they know best without actually thinking
red glowing dust red glowing dust i want the jukebox back enough is enough i loved the option 2 choose what song i wanted you took my baby away from me why whyyyyanyway you got my vote 2 save the jukeboxwarm regards
oh noafter the patch i search my top eve tool  the jukeboxits gone the help channel told me ccp have remove it wilfully and knowingly in the patchnotes i red i cry my pain in the eveuniverse what do you have done  how can i hear my favorite song below the asterdoids stay near the asteroids alttab junkieon no this is the worst thing you have done ccp why  why why
i dont know  if the subjectwriter is a troll but i am not i mean it seriousif you say nobody cares about eves music  it is arrogant perhaps i had a chance to red it on the devblog but what have i done in this situation  starting a petition  collection signes perhaps the most people dont use it i dont knowbut it was important for me and my user experience in playing eve reallyalttabbing is not the same or listen in browserrealechnaton
 signed we didnt fight to get this  in the first place to let them just take it away on a whim context driven soundscape  that im sorry but some of us play this game fullscreen and the whole reason that we got it in the first place was so we didnt have to be assed with alt tabbingexcept theyre not using it in other places theyre using it to create context driven music like i want it hear the same track or two five thousand times while i camp or mine or whatever the  im doing
dont fix what isnt broken the jukebpx is what keeps me going with my own music listening to eve music isnt what i want to hear over and over and over again pluse tabing isnt something i like to do between screens that in it self takes up your  even if it is just for a few seconds resourceswhats even more funny is you leave your launcher program running on the screen that takes up resources  something i dont care to have running when i can just log into eve gate and get what im looking for de monik uend of lineu

ships get killed collapsing whs all the time and there is barely anything you can do to prevent that declaoking is a  in a 3d space without reference as for controlling your entrencepvp doesnt come through your static it comes through k162 and when it does it comes within seconds in high class where you need siege and triage to pve this means that you have no choice but to fight and usually dieas for stabilizers yes we should always listen to evaluate however any player side tempering with mass restrictions kills what makes wormholes the place we live in as for making the mass equations different youre just looking at it from the perspective as safety please realise we need those statics for everything to fight to do pve to get skill books fuel etc if we cant control the statics as we can right now it would mean high class wh space would become much much harder but not in a way anyone in wormhole space would enjoy high class depend on the mass calculations even though often enough it brings death to ships when maths are offwant general pve safety made less as far as i know sleepers knew how to control wormholes and make them go where they want they also only spawn to protect their assets and they are very advanced maybe they will soon figure out that the best defense against capsuleers is capsuleers running pve have double the chance to get k162 and light a frckin sleeper cyno so we know where the pve fun is as for fortress systems yes they are very very hard to siege and get alliances out off however the amount of work to setting them up is insane and also we dont care we want to fight not evict why fight over a wh system its useless there are plenty of others its not like 0sec where the system itself has its value now that ive typed all this can i have alliance bookmarks awesome
not in a dystopia a dystopia is a society most notable for its injustices typically enforced by biased societal laws eve prides itself on allowing morally grey or inept behavior the devs purposely allow awoxing scamming ingame stealing suicide ganking piracy extortion and all other socially reprehensible activities if i steal your bpo collection from the corp hangar should concord force me to give it back or pay you restitution if i disband your alliance should concord reform it for you ccp devs purposely avoid creating a mechanically enforced socialmoral code they purposely leave that to the player base and its up to you to enforce it now i provided you several examples of how to keep yourself safe i gave several examples of why people want the ability to shoot corp mates if the only reason for nerfing awoxing is awoxing conflicts with your personal moral code and causes you economic hardship then you lose especially since you can take ingame steps to limit your vulnerability thread
i still think your love of every other aspect of this game would not be bothered by an adjustment of the mechanic where industrial are concerned nice rant but i dont see much credit to the argument that its the way it is because it has beenthats why im asking for improvement
youre supposed to trust the people in your corp that is all this mechanic is about
and this idea essentially is about forcing people in your corp to be trustworthy i dont particularly find that appropriate for eve and am vehemently against it
i think you abundantly made your point gizznit i would like to hear some other views and may i point out if you did want to attack your former corp members there is a multitude of ways to do soand my argument is strictly high sec theres no limits what you can do in other places of space live the life you want to and dont assume we all wish to keep this faulty mechanic just because you find it fitting
easy fix make a new trial corporation for yourselves this way everything is separatei know fleet mechanics can factor in as well but you can always kick them from fleet and let concord do their job
this is a good temporary solution for me so thank you for posting  i hadnt considered this even so i think its still valid i shouldnt have to have two corporation to do the job of one but i will adopt this technique for now
no you cant shoot a fleet member unless youre part of the same nonpc corporation ofc
ways to solve thishave recruitment standards
because even the most well known pirate cant make a 1 day alt and pretend to be friendly or newor lets say i take one a 10 mill sp minimum and api check for industry skills but they decide  it they never get kills and theres and orca right there protected by a bunch of retrievers fit battleship out for well doesnt matter does it concord isnt gonna stop them anyway with almost no combat skills and a warp distrupter boom dead orca maybe it was because they got into an argument with someone maybe they want to turn pirate or maybe they are just an asshatmy point is i dont care why they suddenly choose to abuse this stupid mechanic i havent heard a real reason to keep it just ways i should be working around itsaying i can work around it isnt a reason for the mechanic to exist thanks anyways though
one reason to keep the mechanic is because the average hisec bear pilot doesnt have hisher overview setup to defensive or pvp tabs accidentally shooting each other whilst trying to defend a corpie is a real possibilitytbh though if you have gotten to the point of disgruntled employee suspicion and not taken action first removed roles get ready to boot if it goes the way it is already keep indys out of harms way whilst the 24 hours cool down period ticks off etc etc  then something bad is going to happen 910 times
the problem is even if you are ready to boot someone kicking them out after the fact isnt going to help much they already got what they wanted and were planning on leaving after anywayedit with the safety button this is no longer a concern about shooting eachother
firstly as the person that wants to change the existing system the burden of proof is on you prove to us that your mechanical enforcement of your moral standard will make the game better for everyonesecondly the first rule i learned in eve was never trust someone out side of punching distance if someone is out side of the range of your irl fist assume they have a dagger with your name on itthird htfu
 removing a mechanic that only occurs a percentage of the time and wouldnt effect the game in a negative way for any of the people complaining about this but improve the game for the people who are affected by it yeah i see why i need to explain my proof even furtherthe only purpose of the corporation kill mechanic seems to be to allow for abuse and though players are forced to find ways to deal with it still doesnt seem to be any evidence that its existence is good beneficial or logical the one argument was friendly fire which retribution has made moot so i ask again why should this not be revisited if not across the board at least where industrial vessels are concernedtaking advantage of this in the past does not mean it should continue for the rest of the game
you could you know have other corpmates shoot them you do have other people in your corp right some of them have ships that mount guns rightrightsnarky trolling aside if you want to protect your valuable assets man up and protect them instead of crying to ccp to do it for you
dont see the point in changing this mechanic its fine as is
ill bite why is that
do i really need to give an explanation if so then this is better suited for the fi forums than the assembly hall im simply expressing my yey or ney vote here
i wasnt asking for a vote this topic is entirely for discussion if you dont feel like stating your views thats fine but that is why this thread is here
im convinced people only make these threads to troll i cant believe yet another crybaby would spew tears over this none issue
if they are afk there is no problem just keep doing what your doingi played in tribute for a while and when irc put a cloaky in our system everyone stopped doing their normal stuff i continued to do what i was doing and the guy never bothered meyou let cloaked players keep you docked that is your problem not ccps
i was disappointed to see how corporate recruiting has changed since incarna the older system was buggy but at least it was useable the current implementation for corporate recruiting is completely useless as most of the bugged filters from earlier releases were simply removed or disabled rather than reworked and fixed it is difficult to find relevant corporate adverts when you cannot filter by region say your in forge and looking for a local mercenary group youll end up with hits for null sec corporations out in the ass end of minmatar space additionally there are no exclusion filters so youll end up with all the results that match what you want but for multipurpose corporations youll still end up getting hits for corporations that perform activities you would rather avoid i think we need to get this system fixed so you can actually find what your looking for rather than wasting time scrolling through hits that are not relevant let alone even in the same empire as your character
it seems its no longer possible to join a dead corp to an alliance but they didnt remove the dead corps that are already in the alliances a corp applies to the alliance alliance accepts application corp disbands corp remains in accepted state until the application becomes effective then the corp vanishes into thin air the war declaration message is now incorrect stating that outgoing wardecs increase in cost based on the number of outgoing wardecs you have the message for booting a corp out of alliance is now incorrectmisleading it states that booting someone from the alliance will make copies of all the wars and then immediately retract them all if this was the case wed be back to dec shield v10 confirmed that wardecs no longer inflate in cost due to multiple outgoing wars confirmed that mutual wardecs can be retracted by the aggressor the right click menu ability is gone which helps clear up confusion for many
so nobody really understands the simple wardec mechanisms introduced in infernoretribution
i havent wrote something in a while i was hoping for ccp to end it well but i doubted it i had so many petitions about the copy mechanism being the root of the problem but no gm nor any ccp member answered them in a satisfying way last petition ended init will be fixedi am so disappointed by ccp responses in this forum i do not know if you zerg are in direct contact with ccp but responses like try it on buckingham you might be surprised show no professionalismi started another petition my last one on this matter to answer for and to explain the current changes i have to say i am not surprised by the actual outcome to end it i will use some words from my favorite eve moviecrap crap mega crap
i am being bullied off eve by a person who has taken offence at catty remarks i made on local chat each time i get the bounty removed it is replaced this is stopping me playing the game the eve management dont seem to care about this treatment of me i am not the only player this is happening to who runs this gamewho protects players from any form of abusei have read and understand all the penalties for misuse of this forum and respect them but players are being subjected to abuse in game and it goes unchecked ignored and seemingly almost condonedare there any other players who feel the same or have had some form of abuse directed at themselves
its not abuse its a feature i am now going to place bounty on your head oh yeah getting a bounty does not mean that anyone can legally kill you in highsec unless you are at war with said person or heshe has aggro rights on you
let themlog in an alt and claim their moniez until they run out its like them giving you their stuff and not rage quittingfor serious
except you only get a return of 20ish of your loss coupled with insurance you still wont come out in the positive bounties are garuanteed to inflict economic damage on an opponent now which is a good thing note there might be some items you can buy cheap enough to boost your return rate but none exist that im aware of at the moment also have you tried apologizing for your remarks i think this is good social pressure finally why do you care if you have a bounty on you can you please provide an example of how it negatively impacts your game play
you can only claim the bounty when you kill someones ship the bounty paid is based on 20 of the destroyed ships value that means you can never claim your own bounty in one go unless you kill yourself in something expensive enough making it not worthwhile to kill yourself with an alt
working as intended
doesnt it require a person to have done something officially read concord standards wrong for a bounty to even be possible  or did the sages in iceland remove that nagging common sense ruleif nothing has to go before a bounty is placed then it will degenerate into a griefing tool with decade old carebears that has never fired a shot at a person having the biggest pools around  hell wouldnt be surprised if the suicide gankers organize into a murder inc type thing all chip in and make it a sport to see who can get the most bounties in a given time frame
sounds like a troll wanting bounty to me but seriously its an in game mechanic dont make catty remarks and you wont get a bounty
id like to point out bad guys put hits out on good guys which could also be called a bounty so why should bounties be limited to lower sec status plaeyrs
placing bounty on op right now 
lmao what a load of delicious tears protip the last few updates have done nothing but swing the wardec mechanics far far in favour of the defender if youre still so terrible you cant deal with it then tough luck bro you lose at eve
 complaining about wardecs and boohhooremember that these guys griefers are taking time and isks to create a story in your sandbox the carebears that just want to mine and rat in peace  nothing but npcs
worse than npcs npcs dont cry and demand ccp further limit the scope of the game
you complain about war decs yet you put your noobies in a constant state of war with fw ummmmmok
jukebox was one of the first player requested features to be actually implemented by ccp previously we had to hack the client to create custom playlists ccp please dont be an indian giver and return our jukebox
i support bringing the jukebox back but i already have a thread up for this here

i like the low sec idea but the problem is almost every gate you could think of would be campedif you want to get rid of afk freighters prevent them from having auto pilot in the first place
it would be silly to think every gate would be camped even rancer is not camped 247
this is the second time this week i have heard a similar idea
actually mr richard i do not believe the op ever mentioned heavy missiles or heavy missile damage point of fact if you read his post he is complaining about all missile range and all missile damage compared to other races and weapon types he at no point said missile damage was nerfed the op also never compared anything to the tier 3 oracle he asked where the comparison to that level of damage was in missiles across hybrid laser and projectile weapons there exists a balance of damage that is to say they are all about the same or are able to be made the same missiles however do not compare to other weapon types at all especially not in the terms of dps rof or now range not to mention all turrets deal multiple types of damagenow to clarify i own a oracle and have the maximum skills for it and t2 lasers i can in fact get a amarr bs to this same level of 1600 damage he mentions bs just cost more cruise missiles also with max skills do not come close to this level of damage and will not hit a small ship for more than double digit damage given the appropriate range my t2 lasers will insta pop frigates and cruisers every time no missile boat i have ever tested used or operated is capable of such action even with grouped missilesfrankly mr richard to call the op or his post silly because you either did not read or are simply stuck in your own little world of wanting to be superior is just rude the op makes a solid point and i do not know many who use missiles out side of pve the accepted standard fits for most if not all pvp ships is based around turrets now mr richard if you are truly a player of less than one year you have no basis of knowledge for your statement eve has been around a long time you have not what gives you the right to complain about drones in another thread and not respect this man for making a complaint of his own you sir forget yourself
the op complained about losing missile range of which only heavy missiles have recently had their range altered teh op mentioned how the oracle outputs 1600 dps a round opening the door to discuss missile damage note an oracle can not in fact output 1600 dps with any reasonable fitsince half the missile systems in the game just had their damage buffed and none of them had their damage nerfed mr richard pointed this out which is extremely relevant 1 the fact turrets deal multiple types of damage is quite often a penalty not a bonus 2 what compares to the potential damage output of large pulse lasers blaster cannons and autocannons well geeze perhaps torpedos note you cant get your reasonably fit amarr bs to 1600 dps eitherthe torp raven has similar range higher alpha and similar dps as a pulse abbadon or gheddon ill acknowldege that applying torp dps to smaller targets is harder than applying turret dps to smaller target due to differences in the missile vs turret damage formulas however its moderately easy to outmaneuver turrets and negate all their dps were as its impossible to outmaneuver all missle damage so a target in range always receives some dps there are pros and cons to both formulas other potential examples a ham drake outputs 500600 dps consistently to 18 kms an ac cane outputs 600700 dps consistently to 2 kms but can only deliver half that dps to a target at 15 kms a hm drake outputs 350450 dps consistently beyond 50 kms an arty cane outputs 400500 dps to targets closer than 30 kms but drops off to 200300 dps for targets at 70 kms these numbers are different but nowhere near the missiles are obsolete level mr revelation you come across as very condescending and rude you sound like an old pot calling the new kettle black i do have the experience and knowledge to backup my statements additionally when you bring up cruise missiles rather than torps when looking at raw damage output you come across as so ignorant of weapon systems that i believe mr richard probbably knows more than you do regardless of character age in conclusion mr richards reply was completely reasonable not rude and puts the ops whine about missiles range being nerfed well within the perspective of yesterdays changes in contrast your post feels condescend pretentious and is full of baseless counter arguments would you like to try again or perhaps you should just forget it
and now beam or railguns have better dps than any other longrange medium weapon system in game and thus needs a nerfsee where this is going
hoped someone else would reply to the rest of your post and someone did so i only reply to this partthe same right that you have to make a quite personal attack on meno that is not the answer i want to makeinstead ill make a pointi complained about drones multiple times and then there were several replies some on a different stance than minessome that made me reconsider my stancein fact they helped mei have hoped i could contribute to the ops gameplay as have those posts to minethat i did it in the way that i have thats just me being a terrible terrible personbut i do hope the ops oppinion on the way ccp handles missiles has improved and maybe hell try out the new and buffed hams with rigs and implants for instance slight correction heavies did get a range and damage nerfyes you are rightlet me try and phrase it differentlyheavy missiles did unproportionately more dps than the rest of the medium systems after considering all the different factors according to some on the forums and apparently also according to ccp also they made hams look pretty bad the rest of the long range weapon systems didnt do that to their short range breathren in the same class that badly or at least i hope they do notthe fact that you mention both beams and railguns may hint at how maybe things could be more balanced nowhow off or not it is is naturally open to interpretation and discussionand ofc the unmentioned projectiles and their having lower dps but in return higher volley damage is also part of the balance they dont need a dps buff just as much as railsbeams dont need a nerf just because of raw dps numberswe want pve activities to require active participation and mirror pvp more closely stacking penalty for npc ewar thenUFFFDlock range under 9km from over 100 in a bs is not fun norUFFFDis two npc web drones making me crawl 10ms pvp sw900 x5 75ms
baseless counter arguments shakes headno one ever said dps the op said round ie volley and point to fact that 1600 took into account for some serious shield resistancesoracle stats 8245672 no implants or rigs drake hm stats 3703226 no implantsor rigs  drake ham stats 4111473 no implants or rigs raven torp stats 9395682 no implants or rigs hurricane stats 5504015 no implants no rigs all straight from eft or are we denying that as factnow i admit that the topr raven can output a lot of damage however i stand firmly by the point that your targets are limited to bss and bcs to be effective again turrets rare not as limited and point to fact any person i know whom flies a turret ship operates within there ranges and knows how to move around the battle field as needed in the case of missions and pve your generally able to kill anything before you lose your effective range i do thins useing the oracle in missions quite often it is actualy a pin to salvage due to bs and bc wrecks being 80k out from entry pointas reasonable is a variable term dependent on the situation it is sort of irrivilivant the discussion was about potential i do believe that was more due to the belief 1600 was a dps numberturrets are preferd for sniping due to range and instant damage until the recent range nerf the cerberus was capable of a hitting range above 180k infact the missles went beyond the maximum moded range of the shipi understand the frustration of the op because the drake use to be a superb ship for pve this is only the most recent in a long line of changes that have negatively effected it yes they still hit for some damage not that 17 is worth the cost of a missile also i brought up cruise missiles because i knew for fact after the changes they could not hit a frigate for more than 20 damage you expect a torpedo can do more i have not tried but it is my understanding they are meant to hit bigger objects than cruise missiles yes the oracle was a bad direct comparison however what is your statement about the hurricane it is the same class as the drakealso no one said anything else needed a nerf it is ccp whom chooses nerfs as solutions usually they nerf item a and then introduce item b to do the same job at 10x the costas for the personal attack i was board my statements were backed by fact however as posted above i think where your understanding falters is in refrence to the drake its ability to run lvl 4s has been effected and to switch missiles types or augment with rigs negatively effects the drakes tanking abilityalso the main complaint of the op was range not damage also beams do not have more damage or range at the medium level there equal now never said they did everything should be a bit different this quest for balance is one thing that is absurd i believe the larger issue here and one we can all agree with is ccp should leave well enough alone as the one guy said see where this leads some of us are old and set in our ways and we hate having to refit and rework all of our ships because they made more changes to a very old system anyhow you all ahve entertained me so my original post was worth the effort ohh and by the way gizznitt i was no more defending the op than you were mr richard us old farts have to stick together when one of us starts waving our cane around pbut really its a game who cares
that is where we read it differentlyin my ears op complained about missiles being nerfed again and again citing the current range nerf and hinting at damage with the oraclereplied to the constant nerfs with the buffs some missiles gained this expansion pretty much each of them apart from hmsnow if the topic would be named heavy missiles ranges are not what they use to bebut it had a generic missile in the name a statement with complains about how missiles in general are getting nerfed and nerfed again ive read it differently than you didyou entertained me as wellwe want pve activities to require active participation and mirror pvp more closely stacking penalty for npc ewar thenUFFFDlock range under 9km from over 100 in a bs is not fun norUFFFDis two npc web drones making me crawl 10ms pvp sw900 x5 75ms
if read you will in fact see i said over the years i have played missiles get less and less get this  years  my number one concern is that 35 fall off flight time is to much 1015 i would suck it up think like this if i took 35 percent of the money or say isk you made would you like thatsecond i said where is the comparable missile boat that can deal the damage of and i used the oracal as an example as it put out quite a bit of damagein real life calling a concern that a person has silly or that it a whine shows that you have no respect for an individuals thinking and your true character yet you want someone else to listen to perhaps your silly whine or rant about something the word here is hipacritmaybe some higher level of management training is neededmaybe you just need to have respect for othersa true leader will listen to all ideas and be respectful as he in return will get respect of his peersas this is a game i could be nasty and say some nasty things why when you get your emotions so involved in a game you have some real life issueseve has real life events people will always lie cheat steal too get what they want so the real life quote and for eve should be and is what i use trust no one and yes that is from xfiles
with so many people complaining about how the new bounty system works i had a thoughtwhat about two options when setting a bountybounty payoutanddurationduration would be a multipliersay you placed a 10mil bounty on someone for a 1 day itd cost you 10milsay you want it to last a week itd not cost you 20mil to place the 10mil bountywant it to last a year sure but itll cost youafter the time out the bounty expires and no one gets the iskit defaults back to the person who placed it like with buy orders
the point is to get ideas flowing they are obviously looking for ideas or they would not have brought it up in the csm talks beating a dead horse or not now is the time to bring up ideas for ccp to play around with next yeareditbeating dead horses gives us glue and we use glue for everything p
this illustrates while sizes between armor and shield are balanced the size scale is obviously not related to the ship and each ship uses a size a bit larger than the official size
so location driven sounds and music can make a good game even better that said i would support bringing the jukebox back if keeping location driven sounds and music remained as an optionissler
i agree with this 100 percent
um issler have you ever been in an mmo that had this its like elevator music from hell if someone wants to torture themselves with it they can be my guest but id like jukebox back
who are you to decidethe musicjukebox is a significant part of the product i buyplaying eve without music is not playing eve for me so now that i dont have the jukebox anymore i have to log out and log in again when the music for some reason stops to playfor hundreds of years my community has enjoyed cheddar cheese and pineapple on a stick  william ulsterman
blast you ccp
nah it was a bug they fixed it im appreciative that they havent forced a render
i support this and i will also suggest the possibility of adding a sex in station system
double
never going to happen of course frankly i dont play eve to watch virtual sex dolls go at it lets just stick to clean realism
like watching iteron vs docking all day
i agree that mass limits should not be touched however i can see a stabilizer preventing natural decay and keeping the wormhole from despawning until it actually collapses
while betrayal might be a desired outcome on the part of ccp it should not be achieved by  ui but by hard won spy effort
holy spam posting browser fail sorry 
the new ai has brought with it a new dilemma and that is the fact that they will always target drones even switching aggro from the playersthere are a large number of ships where drones are the only armaments and with the new system these become inneffectual in the pve environment the issue is how do you rebalanced drones so that they are viable in pve without making them overpowered in pvp it is easy to balance drones to survive in pve by making their tanks stronger or allow the drone bay to automatically begin repairing docked drones but most of the mechanics that would be used to balance them would in turn make drones too overpowered in pvp where players need to be able to take them out quickly so does anyone have ideas how to make drones viable against the new ai
need a more skilled forum poster to take this up see about getting them to add it to chat options in game as soon as some one replys to this and agrees to take this topic up and make a well written post about it delete this post after this way we all have a place to talk in game do what ever
or you need to create the channel and advertise it in crime  punishment
i think he quite clearly stated his views i happen to agree with himi think a good point was made earlier in theis thread jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i still think your average battleship will take an orca down in aprox 4055 seconds meaning protection is moot coming from anyone in your corp who would only have to lightly tank the bs to kill iti still maintain there is no way to effectively stop people from abusing it even if he pays with his ship hes still going to get an orca kill and that assumes a bunch of miners even have the skills to take him on with the protection theyll be flying hell probably just shoot all of them down toobut i realize im in the minority on this topic i doubt im going to see any change made to this despite no compelling argument to keep the loophole or any real way to prevent its abuseedit i also believe the other poster simply stating i think the mechanic is fine the way it is isnt as helpful to stating your view when they offer none of the reasons why they supported it at least jint quoted examples
you can always place a bounty on them  not supported it has been this way forever
thats my point everyone seems to be in favor of having to go through pointless work arounds for a mechanic that shouldnt exist but are just used to it always being thereand dont get me started on the bounties in retribution everyone in the universe has a bounty for talking in local chat or looking the wrong way at someone mostly meaningless
get a corpmate to fly a blackbird even if the hostile corpie is fitted to the brim with eccm a blackbird fitted entirely with ecm is going to land a jam cycle against a single targetif your combat abilities are really that lacking then the plan should not be to take him down but to stall him so everyone else can get away safely then kick him from corpthere is no abuse its your corp and your assets you are supposed protect it not the gamebeyond this being in a corp has always been about tradeoffs creating a corp give you the ability to set up a corp hanger and a pos but you open yourself up to war decs you have the capacity to let in who you want when you want and no one can force you to do otherwise but that means that those you do allow in gain the ability to be hostile towards you if they so wish which actually encourages people to be nice to each other lest someone in corp gets mad and decides to do something about it
this statement makes no sense while the time to down an orca 4060s is reasonable given a gank fit bs and a completely untanked no dcu orca i dont understand what is moot i realize that understanding what is happening and reacting takes a few seconds but getting a corp mate to uncloak in a falcon and jam a bs getting a corpmate to switch to the griffin and jam that ship doesnt take 40 seconds unless you are afk i think i understand now for some reason you think you need to kill the bs to save the orca this is not the case you only need to jam the bs so the orca can get away miners dont need to take out the bs first and foremost they could all release ec drones the orca too and have them jam out the bs you only need to initially get away and then you can regroup and decide how to deal with the rotten apple as shahfluffers pointed out that should be your strategy you know you first asked perhaps someone can explain why this is perfectly acceptable or how one might avoid this kind of abusei posted several reasons why it is useful which you completely ignored i posted several ways you can protect yourself which you completely ignored i then asked you extremely pertinent questions as to why this should be changed and your only response was essentially eve laws and hence its mechanics should enforce morally and economically fair behavior which is a fluff answer you havent presented a compelling argument as to why its a problem sure youve posted that some people have suffered losses do to this mechanic but so what but people suffer losses do to scamming corp thievery suicide ganking piracy extortion and much and more and ccp has a long history of not only allowing that behavior but promote it in their game and look shah fluffers just posted another reason to allow incorp aggresssion so why dont you take a step back and focus explain how the situation is unmanageable and more precisely explain why the ways you can currently protect yourself are inadequate
ill take these one by one i suppose this tactic is a possibility albeit a remote possibility you are suggesting that upon seeing a battleship warp into our asteroid field or on top of us if they merit a fleet invite we will have time to switch ships i find it unlikely considering they are piloting freaking mining barges it will take them at least 20 seconds to get back to a station if we kept them inside the orca this would involve ejecting from their ships and trying to switch as quickly as possible to the already drowning orca even if they respond immediately to this which is unlikely high sec miners will be adrenaline pumped and watching every second with their hands on the ejection button ready to go i still doubt this plan will workill go further more i have never seen orcas use in such a way ever small scale or large doesnt seem like a realistic job for an abuse that will only occur a very small percentage of the timeperhaps already having a ecm boat there for the soul purpose of ratting and guarding could be but i doubt a small operation would merit the loyalty or attention of such a guard and would most likely get a bs to do the plan he was supposed to prevent in all honesty why shouldnt we we need him there to prevent this from happening admitting he is the only thing stopping anyone in corp from doing this why wouldnt he do it himself again ecm drones are a better option and likely to be held by the orca pilot as well as potentially other miners i approve of this option and will implement it on the off chance i ever get in this situation they arent going to be 100 effective but its better than nothing if i am ignoring these suggestions it is because they dont justify the need to continue working around a mechanic that serves no one there are a lot of ways to get revenge in the galaxy corp killing doesnt need to be one of them are not realistic or defeat having the system having multiple corporations to maintain safety the system should not be so terrible i need to have multiple corporations the fact anyone does this is a cry for reform  convey that despite all the other ways pilots can expect loss in the universe this one should be kept tooi am not crying that the universe is a harsh place i expect it to be however this mechanic in corporations is one that does not need to exist and easily rectified there must be countless other ways to get back at a corporation you hated maybe join another one try to take it down any other way but allowing free kills on industrials just before getting kicked from corp is stupidyou will keep listing them im sure but i think everything said so far comes down to well we like it that way hasnt hurt us so far learn to live with itim speaking up for those that dont want to keep working around this for little reason

this is as we feared the information im receiving from other aggressors is about the same there is a hidden enddate variable to all the wars and child wars are inheriting parent wars enddate this means our proposed exploit of corp dropping and rejoining wont be effective both devs were correct in their assessment that this loophole is closed or at least very hard to time it appropriately to use it
helloi dont know if this proposal has already been stated or its already in place but maybe new players should get the mining frigate ship and its skill  already trained to level 1 at least  as part of their welcome packageplayer creationthankskitty
already been donenew player get those when doing the industrial tutorials
the title says it all with ccp changing over to separate ore holds and slashing cargo space of mining barges it is unfortunate that we can no longer get bonuses from these modules
im reasonably ok with ore hold expander rigs and perhaps ore hold expander modules however make the ore hold expander rigs have an appropriate drawback say 10 shields or perhaps 5 shield resistances make the ore hold expander modules also have a drawback say require 510 pg and perhaps reduces the structure hp by 15 like nanofibers finally ore hold expanders should suffer stacking penalties in short ifyou fit out your mackinaw to have a 70k m3 ore bay it should have under 10k ehp
or you could do it the easy way and make it work exactly the same as expanded cargo hold modules that reduce speed and agility which makes more sense mining barges and indies are already  easy to suicide gank and cant afford any shield or armor penalties a speed reduction is better as it gives a pirate more time to kill them while they align but will allows a decent tank
youre incorrect cargo expander modules reduce speed and structure they do not alter agility cargo expander rigs reduce armor these are part of the reason why industrial ships are fragile since a mining vessels primary tank is shields and structure to a lesser extent it makes complete sense for ore bay expanders to reduce the shields and structure hp then you can chose to operate a fragile ship with a huge ore bay and lots of mining yeild or you can sacrifice yield andor ore bay to make it more durable you shouldnt have the best of all worlds yield tank and bay but should have to make a fitting choice like every other ship in this game
hahahaaaa you were being a tard in local chat and someone took offense and bountied you maybe you should appologize and stop being a dik in local chati also have a snealy suspicion that you are trolling for more bounties but as there is a chance that you are really crying on the forums to get gamewide rules changed to suit your own playstyle then i continue to laugh in your general directionjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i need to test this bounty system out and youve just made yourself a better candidate than xenuria
you live in highsec how is having a bounty impacting your play at allyou do realize that just because you have a bounty youre not in any more or less danger than you were before the bounty was placed and that the bounty itself doesnt give anybody the right to shoot you
hey fellow spaceship pilotsi have been pained with this problem since i picked up this game if i want to log out and in of my account to switch characters it takes too much time and is very inefficient the game client closes and i wait 10 seconds for it to reopen and reload the title screen and all personally i think this is a waste of time and can be fixed easily to fix this issue i propose that once you log out you are immediately brought back to the title screen without the closing and re opening of the clientregardscinnabon
one of the complaints i keep hearing about is high security status players having bounties placed on their head due to personal issues the thing is the term bounty refers to a price paid to bring in or terminate a fugitive criminal a price paid to kill a innocent for revenge or a personal vendetta is usually referred to as a hit or assassination which are a bit less than legal but still prevalent basically my proposal is to separate prices on peoples heads into bounties and hit contracts bounties will be limited to players with a negative sec status and hit contracts will be added for players of a security status 0 or higher the difference between bounties and hit contracts is that bounties are legal and hit contracts are less than legal there will be a penalty for placing a hit contract in the form of a moderate to significant standings loss from both concord and the empire in which the hit takes place however this will not effect your overall security status but may make you an enemy of the state if you place alot of these
why not just call them all hit contracts i mean if you are really going to get bogged down in the legal details a bounty is placed on an outlaw by a policelike institution but all ingame bounties are put on you by another player that has absolutely zero legal authority as such all bounties should be renamed hit contracts ps while i like the idea of a sec status loss to the person that places the hit contract when a hit is made i really dont see the need i want to encourage people to place hits on everyone and as such see no reason to include a penalty to placing a hit
the standing loss is to encourage people to place bounties on criminals and discourage hit greifing on high security players however most pirates would not care and do this anyway it is just to cut down on petty revenge hits for things like you look at me funny
but there are many legitimate as in not petty reasons to place a hit on highsec status players perhaps i scammed you perhaps i am in a rival industry corp and want to see your operations hindered and i could go on sec status isnt all that indicative of how good or bad a person is its just indicative of one type of behavior they illegally shoot players in highsec and lowsec here legality means they dont have concords permission to do so but that doesnt mean they are in the wrong for doing it for example if in lowsec a neutral enters my fw plex and powers right at me in a very threatening ship i might not have concords permission to shoot them but they are there to shoot me by waiting for them to shoot first i could easily be giving them the advantage and ensuring my demise so i fire first when i need too
maby we could change the penalty so it stacks if you place a hit every so often it is minimal but if you place them day after day the standing hits increase in severity

ok then if it is a matter of materials then why not have something fill the gap between jumpnothing and jumpanything there is no middle ground if you consider blackops as part of the picture then that still falls well short of providing a middle ground give that the size of the cargo hold is around 500700m3also i understand that the ability to move items via a jump asset is not intended to be an individual asset yet for the guy willing to throw 300500usd at the game yes these people are real then thats exactly what it is and sounds like paytowin to me if winning is being in control of the market simply because your the only one that can really move anything then being the guy with the jf is the i win button hell for 8b it should be the i win button for the sake of balance i think there should be something to fill the role of some sort of medium jump transport it could be tech 3 transport that can jump 25ly and had a hold of 15km3 with some low slots i dont care what it is something is better than nothing
drones are still viable against the current npc ai in missions i know this because ive spent my time since retributions release doing l4s in a dominix ive lost a grand total of one light t2 drone so far and that was because i forgot to repair it and sent it out mostly dead to begin with if i can do it anyone can do it because im certainly no master mission runnerbut that doesnt mean no work needs to be done the ai certainly needs tweaks which has already been discussed in countless threads before when and why certain npcs target drones is not very intelligent right now and needs to be further upgraded drone ui and control from the players perspective could also use some love and updatingthe big change i would suggest though is increasing npc lock time against drones as it stands right now when they do target them it takes them almost no time to do so and start damaging them im not suggesting some ridiculous delay but something rather small that would give the drones a little more time to do something useful before getting shreddedand drones do take a lot of damage fast even with my near max drone skills including durability iv i think but i think the damage they take is good incentive to train drone durability up that said it should be balanced by a slightly longer lockengage time delay for npcs against drones i can imagine that drones without ship bonuses like the domis may get wiped out almost instantly
as a pilot who actively ganks corpmate orcas and other ships i disagree with any change to the current systemeverytime i gank a corpmate its always in highsec and their ships always have little or no defenses no corpmates standing by in combat ships no offensive drones no ewar no reps no logistics nothing your ships are fitted and designed to yield maximum mining efficiency and minimal defenseyou highsec miners just assume youre safe in highsec so you neglect even the most basic precautions an orca fitted with an ecm module or ecm drones wouldve haulted my assault easily offensive drones could have driven me away in sufficient quantityinviting a brand new corp member to a mining fleet with multiple orcas on the field is a bad call in several instances i was even told which pilots were in orcas and which ones to warp to zero new members should be on a probationary status you shouldnt straight up invite new members to your fleet within the first ten seconds of them joiningrun background checks i make little attempt to hide my intentions and actions a simple 5 minute check wouldve reveled to any ceo what shenanigans im up to even as i write this im looking for another naive highsec mining corp to join gank and hold hostage if youre a ceo of a highsec mining corp im trying to join and you somehow miss this posting then you deserve to get gankedthere was only one case where my attempts to gank a mining fleet were thwarted multiple hulks and orcas were in the belt but there was also a pvp fitted domi the domi was there to take care of belt rats offer remote reps salvage and most importantly deploy combat drones his t2 heavies tore my hurricane to shreds and i escaped at 20 hulltldr  youre not safe in highsec and youre not safe from your own corpmates prepare accordinglysummary of eves last four expansions
first post all week thats meant anything to me thank you for your inputthough ive never lost an orca and i still think the mechanic should be changed at least someones experiences might help shape recruitment policy
maybe corporation members shouldnt be allowed to shoot eachother in highsec still stands that regardless of where you go risk can happenfurthermore if they gunning for you if you run the corp boot them if you not quit play with people you trust once you got captials period and dont have a alt account or lazy want to save time and use others cyno chars in corp or alliance it is all trust if the person i know cynos me into a hostile pos with gank fleet that is my problem and not ccps freedom is the name of the game security and morality are gotten with smart decisions personally i only trust people who have been in a corp for a year to 6 months for cynoing
i disagree with your assessment of the situation yet am willing to discuss it rationally and without trolling or petty insultsi cant tell you why every highsec corpmate ganker does it only why i do it their motivations are as many as the bricks in the wall i do it because its easy i tried the lowsec piracy thing and found nobody for weeks i was lucky to find a viable target even luckier if i managed to land on the same grid as him those instances are extremely rarepredators go to where their prey is they follow their food source if theres nobody left in lowsec and the prey all moved to highsec then thats where the predators goto further compound things even after two revamps wardec mechanics are still just as broken as when they started so how do you initiate a fight in highsec theres can baiting suicide ganking wardecs and theres corpmate on corpmate ganking thats about it can baiting is pretty much gone sometimes youll see it happen in mission sites when ninja salvagers steal loot jetcan mining is all but completely gonesuicide ganking is very prevalent because the cost of your own ship is often outweighed by the cost of your targets ship andor cargowardecs are still broken because the aggressed corp simply joins decshield sheds off the wardec quits the alliance and is back to business as usual its incredibly difficult and expensive to get a wardec to stick to your opponent when they can so easily evade itso whats left corpmate violence its the one sure method of pvp in highsec that isnt broken its becoming ever more common because other methods of highsec pvp are broken or obsolete its far cheaper than initiating a wardec over and over its cheaper than losing your ship to concord the griefer has the element of surprise and knows exactly what hes going up againstif you really want to cut down the corpmate ganking ccp would have to revamp the wardec mechanics a third time and this time needs to put someone else in charge the employee whos in charge of wardec mechanics carries the preincarna attitude of thinking he knows everything and doesnt have to listen to anyonethen ccp would have to revamp lowsec to bring it purpose lowsec as it stands now has almost the same rewards as highsec yet its risk is far higher lowsec is worthless to industry and mining corporations prime targets for piracy if the industrymining corps wont go into lowsec what reason do pirates have to staysummary of eves last four expansions
that was one of my main points is that this only really comes into play in high sec anyway a lot of major orca losses occur in null during wars and greedy miners im just trying to improve life for smaller time highsec corps but im starting to see that this will have little impact on me living in sov space and any corporation i manage in the future will most likely be out there keep posting thoughts as people like despite my arguments im glad as many people took interest as they have
to further iterate orcas can field some amazing tanking power if the pilot wished to before the nerf i fought against an orca that used dual asbs and i could not break his tank since his cargohold was massive id run out of ammo long before he ran out of cap chargeseven with the nerf to asbs they can still tank pretty well its just that highsec pilots dont feel the need to do so theyre under the delusion that theyre safe and untouchable my autocannons disagreean orca with several ecm modules in the mid slots can easily shut down a corpmate ganker hell even fielding five ecm drones may do the trick they can keep me off of his back long enough for him to align and warp away or call for aida standard mining fleet of 5 to 20 members can easily tear apart a lone corp ganker if they were all at their keyboard and they all carried combat drones 20 members each with 5 combat drones equals one hundred drones on one target very few ships can withstand that kind of pummelingthe underlying problem isnt players unable to deal with this thread its that theyre unwilling or too naivesummary of eves last four expansions

it seems that this ingame feature will start to generate more foum alts with alot of bounties on their heads

you all forget one very valid point if you lose all the noobs u like any extra income for ccp and if they cant get more people it will cause them to stagnate and possibly shutdown
heres the thought processgoal 1 locate and recruit new playersgoal 2 grow the corp and teach the playersgoal 3 initiate somewhat controlled pvp where they can earn their isk build their ships and learn advanced pvp through trial and errorgoal 4 after growing the corp to a substantial size with most characters over 6 months old and plenty of pvp experiencing under their belts seek out a nullsec alliancethis goal is unattainable as previously stated we have been plagued with wardecs the new players cant do their pve so they run out of ships so they make alts or dont log in at allmy options from heredrop out of faction warfare andor tell everyone who cant deal with the war to drop out of corpdystopian future or not this is just a game everyone here started as a green nublet flying about in space going ooh ah to the all the pretty colors we all made bad fits we all slogged through missions we all were at a time when we had no idea what we were doing and were prone to mistakes the problem new players have here is veteran players who enjoy taking advantage of the new players ignorance these new players arent likely to hit the forums before they quit eve and look for something else i have made their case im going back to shooting stuff
soi have always wonderedwhy is there no option for arming a station in nullsec give it like four automatic guns that act like low sec guns do make it so alliance can set the attack options like on a pos this would make station camping still doable by a medium gang or one with enough rr but still make it slightly more difficult i dunno just seems odd that these player built stations with billions of isk in costscant attach even a gun to the outside
especially true when you can put quite good guns on a cheap ass crap stick in a bubble pos
it is obvious that ccp doesent plan on ever actually releasing the left eye variant of most of the eyepieces currently available in the game so why bother keeping a left and right variation when it is so much easier to just mark it as either or in character customization it is very obnoxious that the item exists in game but is unobtainable players should have a choice of which eye they want the gear attached to so please just scrap the left and right variations and make it a single item

yeah i get that point but from really looking into this case i really feel that its not covered here if ccp want a corp of players doing sciencemanufacturing to lure noobies into the game engage and involve them so those noobies are more likely to make friends have fun and start paying for the game then this mechanic needs to changei would love to be in the position where the game mechanics would allow for my corporation to build a titan and at the same time allow some 1month old player to me research his frigate bpothis one single change in mechanics can be summerised in a single statementallow a player with the rent factory slot or rent laboratory slot to install those respective jobs into corporation facilities without giving them access to delivercancel all jobs currently in production by the corporationits clear from the limited number of people replying to this post and no massive outcry that most people dont see the pure significance of the current functionality how many people may have tried eve and quit based on this single mechanic alonesimple questionare there any industrial corporations in eve the real answer is no there arent any at all the cloest thing you could find to an industrialist corporation will be a corp made up of half a dozen players who trust eachother due to rl connections or long eve histories these guys do t2 invention build jump freighter capital ships whatever their other 50 members are miners maybe doe a little pi and sell it to the corpimagine this change in place you could have serious industrialist corps imagine a corp with 500 blueprints locked down labs and factories in system a single member of the corp can come along drop the minerals in a hanger select to build 10 megathrons deliver and collect his ships and sell them or have them get sold through the corp and the corp pays them for their effortyou could have some seriously active and fun corps and if players are kept that engaged they are more likely to keep playing for longerps this response isnt purely directed at ronan more to others viewing the thread and thinking about the same thing
i have drone durability v gal cruiser v and a drone durability rig on an ishtar kitted for massive drone bonuses i launched my ogre iis against 4 elite cruisers and lost one before they had gone 20km and most of another on the trip back
i have no doubts about that and its exactly why it took me a single mission to decide theres no point in using heavy drones anymore which doesnt bother me at all i have other optionslike i said some changes and tweaks are needed but sending heavies out to 20 km is no longer a good idea use other options
use other optionswould you say use other options to a pilot flying a hurricane in a l3 mission if ccp suddenly decided to obsolete autocannons and arties
nope but that isnt a valid comparison since ccp hasnt made drones obsoleteyou can even still use heavies if you want just dont use them for things orbiting more than 8 km or so away and dont use them until cruisers and smaller have been destroyed you really dont need heavies for cruisers anyway since t2 mediums do just fine there and are generally ignored by cruisers right now or fit guns and ammo that have the appropriate range and tracking speed to take out targets in any holes you may have in your current drone coverage for a mission as dictated by size orbiting distance and what you expect the kill order to bethose are some of your options other options include using sentries all this works for me including using the heavies as stated above like i said before  if i can do it anyone canim not arguing that things shouldnt be adjusted more work needs to be done including adding in my suggestion of giving the npcs a small delay in how long it takes them to target drones which keeps my posts ot here what i am saying is that drones have in no way been made obsolete for running missions at least l4 missions  cant comment on others
no need to fix something that isnt broken
right so this has definetly been mentioned multiple times but its something that has to be reiteratedeve is chaos you cant just bring random people into your corporation adn trust them people need to earn trust giving trust freely si a weakness quickly exploited i know many corps have dualtrial periods for members before they can even join starting with them being blue but not joined flying some fleets then joining a training corpa nd eventually after proving themselves trustworthy get to join the main groupeve is never meant to be completely safe from anything including friends its a agme where survival is based upon solid friendships and proven trust if someone lacks either of the previous 2 its usually better to not let them have access to your stuff information channels or operation dates for your industrial activitiesand as stated before never send an indy that cant be alphad orcas on any run alone send jammersalpha ships to keep it safe
if you want a stupid rp reasoncorps have a right to deal with their own members however they like noone is forcing that member to be thereand finally an obligatory l2p
if everyone wants to continue to work around this rather than fix it fine seems to be popular opinion at least of players checking this threadi think its illogical to keep something thats only existence is to make life harder doesnt add value to game play and will only cause management issues and headaches but why look at it from that point of view its always been this way better to keep it
why did you join a corp full of members that would attack you and now you are blaming ccp for this   you sound like the kind of person that would deserve to get your ships killed
no one is blaming anyone here im simply stating the opinion that this mechanic is outdated and not neededthe biggest gameplay reason for corp killing to happen was friendly fire concording players for accidently hitting a corpmatethis is no longer the case and i feel the only thing it serves now is abusenot a lot of ways to interrupt this but everyone is going to get upset anyways i suppose
why do you fear this is good news then as you have forced ccp to fix the exploit
i fear that i found a new exploit to keep everyone trapped i will know for certain on the 12th

why not make it so that if someone is sitting idle and cloaked not using dscan or probes or whatever that after some time  say 10 minutes  they log out of local until they come back seems like itd solve most of the issues
it looks like ccp is clamping down on it from the patch notes today but now is a bug which stops us from accessing wardec options looks like the fun will soon be over though
most of the tactics we use seem to be about bookmarks but the ui isnt very goodthis is frustrating because we have better uis in the game already the market for instance allows for subdirectoriesthings i havent seen how to do easily yet includecheck box to filter out bookmarks outside of the solar system  which can also hide all directories that dont have visible bookmarks in themsubdirectoriesability to colortag bookmarksdate created field that can be used to sort by as well as alphabeticalability to add bookmarks to the overview so i can have them on my navigation tabbetter default name not just spot in x system put some identifying info in there to be able to distinguish which spot it is when i look down after a flurry of dropping bookmarks along a warp so i can say spot 19 was the one in the middle 20 was the one i dropped at 4000 km instead of hey three unmarked bookmarks yay

coming soon the removal of pvp in high sec from eve that after all would remove a major irritation for a whole lot of people ccp bring back jukebox i think its clear by the point that the only people that would listen to what you want to replace it with dont want it replaced
maybe heavy drones arent supposed to be used against cruiser sized targetsif the new rat ai means that you have to pick the right tool for the job rather than mindlessly spamming ogres at everything thats a positive development not something to cry and wail about because ccp is making missioners and ratters engage their brains for once
racing ships an idea i had to give players some more ships ships that are more for fun rather then used to reach a goal players already hold frigate races for fun why not make a class of ships for it as well as some modules for it there are some modules for low slots and rigs for speed but how about some for mid and high slots maybe a high slot module being something like nitrous that uses a charge or something this could having classes of race ships from cheap and slower to expensive and extremely fast maybe bordering on 1kms the high class being something for more end game players the only other good application for these race ships out side of racing would maybe be setting up safe spots in low and null sec this could also maybe be a collection of ships that has more player infuence in the design since they dont influence the overall game play of eve that much just a thought what does everybody think
if they have more than 1 midslot they will be used in pvp and even with only 1 midslot for a prop mod the will still be useful for setting up fleet tams etc furthermore speed is kind of a basic stat in eve there is a perfect setup with rigs and implants and modules and kills and fleet boosters that will create the fastest ship possible and anyone with less than perfect of the above will be slower so what exactly is the point of a racing ship there is going to be one and only one fastest ship model in eve
ive seen stabbers that easily get over 7ks anything over 4ks is very nice for making tacticals off gatesbut i dont think a specific limited fittings ship is required weve all found ways to get there from here quite quickly
this is one of those concepts that could be implemented inside a station  as a game within a game sort of thing you slap a bet down climb inside a flight simulator and racethere are a ton of ideas for things to do in this game that wont actually work in the game as it is set up these things should be worked into gameplay for stationdwellers simple as thatwis concept id give it a 1 but for real eve gameplay it just wont work
ccp would never do this because the afk miners would get too upset
ya theyre after us hard except i dont think they implemented the patch correctly because from our tests no one was able to escape even after toggling mutuality
luckily you are chased by retards so you prob have another month of griefing 
we do have a corp thats sitting on the sideline just holding mutual wars to see how many we can retain so far it seems to be in the hundreds eventually itll drop off though once everyone who wants to escape has escaped well just leave things as mutual and then go into a dormant state until were needed againill update the main thread with the ruleset for the current wardec system as i understand it shortly
hey all of you that want jukebox back feel tree to tweet to csmsummit your requests for jukebox back it seems that the csm dont like our point of view
i want my jukebox backplease start a petition to ccpsigned
1sooooo after the first twenty times of that thing playing through i asked how to shut it down and have never bothered with it since it sounds like music that would play on an old commodore 64 out of the games from back in the late 1980s i get that yo
i think the issue most people have with the change in sound system is that there is no option to controll it the dynamic location aware sound can still work with a jukebox just put check box inside the jukebox to switch from manual to automatic music selection ahhh genius to remove the system completely and not replace it with some similar system to change the music is criminal i am surprised concord didnt carpet bomb ccp for thatthere is a petition for this here
you trolls talk of lazy entitled players but you fail to realize that there are some ships that are designed for drones and only drones and with the changes these ships have basically 0 dps
thats odd if what you said is true how am i completing solo l4 missions in my drone boat dominix without ever having to use my guns and i can do most of them in good time even without those guns
how can people disagreeing with you and making suggestions on how to now use drones make them trollsalso how does having to choose carefully which drones to use on which type of ship mean 0 dpsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
as a succesful veteran subwarp racer yes subwarp racing is possible in new eden i think i should give my 002 isk on this topicin subwarp trackracing having the highest top speed isnt an automatic win on most tracks flying at 7 kms will actually make you fly around rather sloppy and your lap times will be worse unless you are really good at thrust control management while maintaining spacial awarenessinertia is an important factor but most important is the pilot skill and experience with manual pilotingwhile i personally dont use the highslots on my racing ships i cant think of any modules that i would want there that are not just copies of existing rigs or modules so it would not really add anything new for me like an extra row of pawns on a chessboard of course some creative person might make me change my mind by coming up with an amazing new module but ive not seen any good ideas on that front yeti also dont feel the need for a specific racing hull interceptors are quite suitable for subwarp racing and seeing as racing within new eden is kind of a tiny niche if anyone is still hosting subwarp races please inform me i would not want to waste devtime on developing racing ships
i know a song that gets on everybodys nerves

after looking at recruitment i have to agree its pretty useless nowit needs two major changes to make it worthwhile imv1 highsec regions need to be specified or at least if its amarr caldari gallente or minmatar space2 timezone needs to be specified as at present the eu and us tzs are completely mixed upit might become a lot more useful if the above are added but at present it returns far too many false results to be of any real use

some of the quotes in the original wayback machine
how about active self repairing drones drones that can repair their shields or armor when being attacked small drones will have low repping ability may be able to tank one non elite npc frigate with decent skills multiple npc frigates or one elite npc frigate would have no difficulty killing it medium and heavy drones follow suit similar to small drones sentry drones should be rebalanced as a pvp sniping droneor how about a module that when active remote repairs drones that are close by when this module is active and a drone receives damage to its armor andor hull it ceases its attack and returns to your ship to be remote repaired then it jumps back into the fightit would require a complete rebalance of drones though probably not the best ideas but its better than what everyone else is suggesting which is nothingsummary of eves last four expansions
why balance drones why not balance the aidrones are fine if you mess with the drones themselves you may unbalance pvp a bit more than if you just mess with the ai of the mission rats
i think it was intended for corpmates to practice pvp amongst themselves without having to resort to can flipping each other or so they can test each others tank fittings or they can take from each others canswrecks without receiving a suspect flageither way a compromise would be for corporations to have a checkbox if they allow corpmates to shoot each other or notif youre looking for an immediate remedy you can simply keep your orca pilot out of the corp yet in fleet or keep him as a one man corp in an alliancesummary of eves last four expansions

so much this as long as local is omnipotent cloaking is balanced maybe if they changed local so that you can only see people who have at some point been ongrid uncloaked with you such that if they leave grid you can still talk to them and if they cloak afterwards you can still see them in local for maybe 30 minutes or people who are in your alliancecorporation automatically beingb in local that kinda thing then we can see about changing cloaking but right now cloaking is perfect for its use

youre in luck with the retribution expansion came the mining frigate venture an ore ship with low requirements to fly and quite inexpensive average jita price is around 1 millionsummary of eves last four expansions

atm with the new gas ship with the frig trained up to level 5 i hear its better than mining with the bcs even though they use 5 harvs on them the ore bay is ok for c2 sites but for the c4s and up where i hear they have larger gas sites so they may have to take more than one tripover all im kinda happy about the venture not excited but happy lol
since we now have walking in stations ccp should give players the tools to make our own clips and movies with it give us the ability to animate our characters give is the ability to manipulate their movements give us more character environments im a fan of the clear skies movies but at the same time i was disappointed to see the creator use half life 2 characters and animations to complete the movies we have walking in stations now we should be able to use that instead of half life 2come on ccp give us the tools and let us make some amazing creationssummary of eves last four expansions
ccp need to do this player created content is a great way of advertising your game
the title speaks for its self especially with minor spawns in low level missions and in asteroid belts the use of npc jamming is normally ineffectual especially if your ship has a perma tank that can survive anything the current spawn has to dish out the issue is that it wastes valuable time and is annoying small trash spawns should not be able to keep a ship perminintly jammed for more than a few seconds at a time with a decent gap between jamming attempts anything else results in a stalemate situation where neither the npc nor the player in question can win especially if the npcs have warp scrambled you ship you can be stuck in a room for hours before you manage to take out just one of the frigates and lets face it most pirates if they realized they could not kill you would either run away or call in reinforcements not just sit there like retards and keep shooting and locking a invulnerable ship and while there are modules that mitigate jamming they cost slots and consume power which can literally destroy your intended fits functionality npc ships need to have some kind of link between them that prevent 3  ships from permjamming under any circumstances there need to be gaps at regular and fairly frequent intervals to mitigate the issues this was never an issue prior to retribution

you dont need to web an orca
i should think that the biggest gameplay reason was actually to keep player corps subject to sabotage and all those other ooh darkbad harsh universe ooh things that ccp likes in eveyou need to think carefully about who you recruit and if you really want to recruit noobs with dubious pasts protect your assets even from your own corp members bring your own alt as a guard use an alt corp for your valuables tank your ships and all those other things that also give you a defense against suicide ganking that fosters an atmosphere of trust between corp members because the corp members know that their recruiters are looking out for them and they know that they have ways of keeping themselves safe that in turn fosters an atmosphere of if you betray the corporation everyone else will find you and they will kill youthis certainly wont completely prevent awoxing or corp theft or whathaveyou but that will serve you much better on a corporationwide security scale than well no one can shoot my orca in a belt were safe now and maybe stop recruiting noobs with dubious pasts hold out for the classy scammers who burn yearsold alts to ruin your corporation utterly
the webtowarp function is extremely useful for moving orcas and freighters through suicide gate camps and lowsec not to mention just speeding up otherwise painfully slow logistics
eve is a dark game where anything is possible theft piracy space prostitution etcwhat you are proposing is basically the start of the end in terms of this gameplay philosophynext you will be suggesting that ships should be put back into the station and have to be repaired instead of blowing up and loosing all your stuffsdont get me wrong its never nice to loose your stuff especially to someone in your corp but that is eve and its why we love iti suggest that if you dont want corpies to blow up your shineys then be selective in your recruitment and keep expensive ships like boosting orcas in an alt corpother than than if you really have a problem with guildcorp mates awoxing or nicking your stuff go and play wow or some other game where a whiney mail to the gms will get you your stuff put backor as we say round by me go hard or go yard brahps u mad bro
yeah tell that to my friends who have saved their orca in a c4 coming from a c2 connector orca got the web insta warp bad guy fleet jumped in as soon as it got off granted this wasnt in high secit still helps the orca move faster in high sec to web it
here is a idea of how not to get scammeddont deal in weird items ever never ever if you cant use it or can properly gauge what it is used for or real value dont buy itin general dont do trading unless you understand what you are doing going back to the first point also officer mods well heck if it is a very rare item good luck finding a consistent price to begin with any trader worth his sack will buy with buy orders and sell with sell orders and never buy from sell orders or sell to buy orders if they out to make money have a feeling that this scam is considered a problem because of market bots or people behaving like them just scanning through items including obscure nonsense items through a program to see the largest gap in selling and buying price i am pretty sure that is it because no way in hell anyone but someone who is not using a program will find this obscure shitzulegit traders use margin trading and to lesser extent minimum buy orders the latter being for commonality that they dont want people selling them in quantity that are not worth their time to dock in a station to pick up
this isnt an issue at all margin trading and minimum units are both legitimate if not necessary mechanics just dont be so greedy next time and then you wont need a crythread 
if you treat all buy orders as possible but not garaunteed you are much much less likely to fall for a margin scam the reason you then actually look at the value of what you are buying you look at how well it moves and you dont buy stupidly overpriced and slowmoving items its pretty simple really edit there are about 10k threads on this already do a forum search before posting next timeps if you buy an item you accept the risks you may not be able to sell it for a profit just because you misjudged that risk does not mean there is an issue with margin trading
negative as time and time again margin scamming has been confirmed to be a feature
anyone not bothering to check the market history of an item deserves everything they get
its fun when people dont read everything or quote tiny bits and jump to conclusionsmy beef isnt that people do it its that it completely messes with the market datai want to look at the lowest buy prices for x y z units yet i get stupid person 1 who has a buy order for say 1 million trit up for 10 isk per unit but cant actually afford them when you try to sell to itits annoying and its stupid that it still exists and has gotten worse i see about 1015 of these scams being spammed into jita local at any one time among the give me isk i am quitting eve i will give you 2 time back onesyes it is effectively an exploit just like logging off supercaps and waiting 15 minutes was effectively an exploit even if ccp say it was working as intended they still fixed italso the wonderful log on log off mechanic that super cap pilots used to bounce out of harms way which was effectively an exploit but again ccp said it was working as intended then fixedi fully agree but is it not annoying when after that scam the price for that item the scammer used is warped and people seem to think its worth more than it iscaptainobviousjpg and you know what if you read them as well most have a point that it messes with market data then scam victims and trolls come along and derail the thread by demanding the removal of the skill
i brought it up because your post doesnt reference any of them at least not directly i have read most of the nerf margin trading threads and feel ive contributed positively to many of them although many people probably dont view it as a positive contribution when you shoot down an idea and while the threads are started by likeminded people the rebuttals found within are relevant so heres a few questions you need to answer 1 why does it matter if people manipulate the market and market data people manipulate markets all the time even without using the margin trading skills why is this a bad thing  note if your answer is because it becomes harder for me to distinguish between legit and illegit sales so what 2 how is the margin trade skill itself at fault for the scam in reality if i setup a buy order using margin trade yet i cant afford and you attempt to fulfill it what exactly is the problems with the way the order fails  example it automatically attempts to put the goods i was selling onto the market in the form of a sell order leaving me with additional brokers fees which i didnt agree to  this is a problem that i think should be addressed  example it cancels the order no goods are bought and sold  so there are no victims here i see no problems with this 3 what is the crux of the scam its your willingness to buy overpriced items if you dont buy goods at an overpriced value you dont lose money here why are you buying goods above their market value  because you assume you can immediately sell them guess what you were wrong you take a risk when you buy goods to resell for profit and when you cant resell for profit the person at fault is you so why is there any problems here  you do know that in rl companies that buy goods to resell them like every retail store in existence takes a risk that they wont be able to resell those items for a profit so what exactly is wrong with our game mechanics reflecting this
normally you cant mess with the market unless you have a whole bunch of isk and frankly that is fine however when it comes down to rare items that people want but arent willing to pay an inflated price due to the lingering effect of the scam it becomes a problemselling deadspace and officer item has always been a problem before the market allowed for them and they started of perfectly then people realized they can use the old scam and use it on thesethe problem is its hard enough to trade these items as it is without the extra input from stupid the skill is at fault because it allows the scammers to have no risk to themselves which honestly praying on peoples stupidity is fine but it shouldnt be risk freeit doesnt even require you to be active since the nature of a buy order is enough to get peoples attention the scam is just a rework of the dog scam
always nice to dream
instant teleporting is a bad mechanic the game would probably be better off without jump clones
interesting ideaand how do you think this will alter implants i know many pilots like myself that always fly with implants in their head so deathcloning is a fairly expensive option that i dont take very often i instead fly from point a to point b which is generally much much better for the game i think
it would be nicer if you just have a cooldown per jc insteada charge would be fine but i dont think you should be able to bounce around too easily
still a great idea
still want to see my dream become a realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
because we get these gifreakingnourmous mountains of bookmarks to scroll through really fast really fast i mean im leaving a folder for each system i go to and some of those systems its already annoying to scroll up and down finding things and im using naming to sort things too i end up feeling like its the most often used interface i have to use and its barely more usable than msdos its really clunky and annoying and it frustrates me and i have to fiddle with its annoyingness every time i jump
the pirates are just scared because they dont want a sb to drop a big steamer onto their gate camping party
now that would liven things up a bit

some thoughts on how to fix black ops working on a major hangover right now so its probably a bunch of bad ideas but here goesmake cov ops cynos work in hisec after all real black ops much like the honey badger dont care if they are breaking the local laws add a penilaty though as soon as the cov ops ships uncloak they get a 15 min suspect flag additionally the black ops bs would get a 15 min suspect flag and the ship that lit the cov ops cyno would get a 15 min criminal flag a smart cov ops fleet would not affected by these flags too much but we all know not all fleets are smart ones could also make lighting and brideing a cov ops cyno in hisec take up more fuel a new tech 2 cov ops carrier can fit a cov ops cloak but only 5 unbonused fighters mega nerf the sma and cargo hold as to not make it op with logistics give it 2 bonused bomb launchers or 4 bonused torp launchers not capital torp launchers but not the ability to use both at once cant be used in hisecalso have some ideas about making bombs work in hi and low sec but they are probably really bad lolbombs useable in hisec and in lowsec however if they explode within 7500 of a gate or station they do no damage also you get a 15 min criminal flag even if they do no damage to anything if they hit a non wt suspect or criminal you get concordedyes miners would whine horribly and it would be glorious however to help quell their tears we could add a module for an orca which would give a temporary pos shield effect a 10km bubble for 10 seconds would drain all the cap in the orca make it immobile for 30 seconds and you need 85 cap to use it recharge would have to be over 30 seconds as well also like the bombs to counter griefing you would not be able to use it within 10km of a station or gate also would probably have to balance it so you couldnt starburst non corp membersplease post all positive or negative feedback and or hate mail  like i said im sure these ideas suck but i think they would be fun
theres a limit too oh gawd im gonna hit it with my face i just know it sigh whyyyyseriously they wanna know why people get annoyed its because most of the game is in three windows that are all a royal pain to use overview dscan bookmarks

wouldnt the sentries merely shoot the bubbles anyway bubbles are completely different
awoxing in faction waras i understand the term its when a player of an militia attacks the other allied militia player without provocation or as an act of piracy they dont get standing penalty for their respective militia this is flawed they should be penalized somehow or dont appear purple at all
the relevant thread where brought it up is here
this was a problem before retribution the standing hits to your faction are easy to circumvent finally listing who is in an allied militia is a big help and saves a precious a column on our overview i would definitely not be in favor of changing the ability to easily see who is in an allied militiathe solution is to wardec the corp but i am not sure how long this lasts and therefore how costly it is also this wont help people in the npc militia
hello ccpdo you like gamemechanics which cannot stopped by players with modules orand starting concordwe can bump freighters with mwdbattleships and the freighters flip away like shrapnels ok sometime the corporation of the bumped freighter will come with some webbermodulesfitted ships and want to stop the flight of the bumped freighter but woops the webbers dont work on bumpinduced speeds so how i can counter this manveuver without starting concord
a complete revamp of the corporate management and corporate structure code would be the perfect time to fix this problem too
hihow about getting new players to stay by giving them the ability to quickly get into something give them 5mil or some number that makes sense of skill points to distrabute over their accountkeep older players happy by also giving them 5mil to spread around their accountthis would be a once off change so that forever after a new account created gets the 5milmoney will spill be a restricting factor for early progressionthink of it as we all go to school before entering the working world so we have previous knowledge prior to becoming a capsuleer
how about instead ccp rebalance t1 frigates and cruisers so that new players can be useful from their first few days and dont need 5m to competeoh wait
also google malcanis law
i have to disagree its more about what people want and from what i can see in current game mechanics and grunt line members where ever the fight is thats were they all want to be if that encourages more fights then more things get blown up more things that get blown up more demand on the market having a game mechanic that prevents people from making it to the action makes the game very stagnant fights come from players starting fights that kind of talent  dedication is very rare which is why you only see fights break out every once and a while but when they do almost everyone and there mother wants in on the action inb4 blob warfare if you try and come back and say travel by gate to get there then you really dont understand anything about the subject by the time a person traveled 40 jumps to get to the fight they would ether be dead via gate camp or the fight was already well over or almost impossible to get into the target system because of gates being locked down this would not affect implants due to the fact of cost people who keep a full set of implants in there heads dont do this pod express for that reason
an excellent suggestion allow me to quote as reference what to my knowledge is the most recent information about the pos revampas such i would still like to have faction pos blueprints and faction pos module blueprints reseeded into the game albeit with the changes i stated aboveqdoes this mean you want current faction towers in highsec to be upanchoredano let them be grandfathered in
agree the overview at the moment has a lot of functionality but the usability is terriblein addition to streamlining the overview interface eve should come with good presets for new players that are reasonable defaults for miningtravelpvppve

how about encrypted bookmark packs that are only readable by the client that can be installed out of game similar to the way overview settings are im sick of spending two hours importing bookmarks
nope
probably started out that way due to a bomb potentially affecting a massive number of objects and in low each hit would require a secstatus calculation  bombs would crash almost any lowsec node when deployedbut  they just rewrote the aggression code i think so perhaps  can certainly argue for the utility bombs not sure about vanilla bombs though certainly out from an rp perspective as the blobs they are designed to counter rarely spawn
i think bumping freighters just for the heck of it is a reportable offence bumping miners just for the heck of it on the other hand is not not sure whyalso to have a true proposal please put an idea not just omgwtfbbq my freighters been bumped for 3 hours help meh
bumping mechanics are fine youre just badps web the freighters before they get bumped
i like and i think this idea is just wrongquestion 1how close do you have to be to a gate to jumpa 2500mquestion 2how close do you have to be to something for it to decloak youa 2000m500m isnt much to play with so you would be finding yourself decloaking most of the time anyway i could maybe see this work with a wormhole because of the 5000m jump on it but i still think even as a hunter my pray should get some sort of small warning if they pat attention thats great if not well they go boom
you must be new to the game welcome to eveyoure referring to the cloaking effect after you jump through a gate correct the purpose behind that temporary cloaking effect is because many times your ship will appear in space before your screen loads it sucks having your ship blown up before your screen ever loads after a jump so ccp came up with a 30 second cloak effect to negate that problemif you want to stay permanently cloaked there are cloak modules for sale that you could fit onto a high slot there are even cloak modules that let you warp while cloakedsummary of eves last four expansions
so is it an exploit if hi sec noob mining corp for example forms an alliance with its own disposable  oneman alt corp which in the advent of war can quit the alliance taking with it a copy of the original corps war with it to another alliance lets say dec shield and adding that war to their ever growing list  thus entrapping the aggressor in their now famousinfamous permawar without the original corp being lumbered with the dec shield war listif not then would it not be prudent for all corps and alliances to install such a beastof course this gamedestroying weapon of mass destruction would only be unleashed if attack and with a colourful corp name and description would serve as a powerful deterrentwelcome back to the cold war
its not an exploit
dec shield offered this service for the duration of the chaos they were labelled dec shield ambassador xx
thanks for that i was unaware that was the case but these  ambassadors are they not generated by dec shield cannot a single corpalliance generate there ownand have them function in exactly the same way i mean no disrespect and agree that the current war dec system is broken just trying to get a handle on the whole thing and once again thank youany and all clarification is most appreciated
at this point the current issues with war decs have actually been patched so while decs are transferable the length is also transferring mutual wars are now retractable by the aggressorsand yes to your main question nondec shield entities could utilize the same mechanics to spread wars around
to answer your second question yes i would still do it because you wouldnt be able to hit me

i wish there was a thumbs down button for ideas like thisbut to add some constructive points here 5 million skill points would be a lot to start off with as a little nublet they can be useful in about 1 hour of training by learning how to fly a tackle frig i could maybe see starting out with race frig level 3 instead of 2 but just giving them skill points to throw around is a joke
if you gave me 5m sp when i started id have trained something daft
i wouldnt mind it being dropped down to about 12 hours keeps me from bouncing around with impunity but still allows me to do multiple things with my weekend
personally i think drop it too 23 hoursi always login with an hour left before i can jump clone please fixty
just like the thread please it really doesnt need that much explaining but a brief explanation of why belowintroduction of the warp to and jump icon was a wonderful thing  except it was put right next to the warp to zero button which is basically stupidmy proposal has 2 options but both can be applied1 move the damn warp to and jump key to the far right of the selected items box2 make the selected items box configurable and we will move the damn warp to and jump key ourselvesi appeal to anyone who has ever been in a fleet and suffered accidental lemmings derped themselves over a gate or wh or just assumed they pressed the correct iconplease support this thx
i would have to take an opposing stance the buttons grouped by common usage is greatleft to right align to  warp to  warp to jumpgreatmuch better than having them spread all over the placejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

as i am an industrialist at heart and i do see the benfits of a pi revamp especially the focos on team and corp activities got me hooked i think this change would drastically alter the game itself eve is already called excel in space by a lot of people its probably the most complex mmogame out there and adding to that with such a drastic improvement would make it even bigger but not necessarily better maybe i would have to read and reread it again but as of now i think they should make pi more worthwhile and teamoriented less tedious making it into a complex game itself while having appeal  will most certainly cost too much time and money and drive focus away from improving the core of the game ships in space and the interactions they create between space and each other its not a planetary simulationdont get me wrong its probably the most rounded out idea ever presentedfor that alone you guys deserve propsgotta spend money to make money a fool talks a wise man listens he who doesnUFFFDt wanna listen talks the most

sorry for wall of text tldr margin trading scam is an exploit but op does a poor job finding good arguments for thisi really dislike this thread cause while i feel that the margin trading scam is an exploit and something should be done about it the op mixes so many irrelevant issues into this and imo uses rather bad arguments to support his opinionso first off i think there are no problems with minimum buy amount rewardrisk of scamming manipulating the market required amount of funds for starting a scammanipulation or any other side issue i might have forgotten that was brought up in this threadthere is one particular problem with margin trading though and that is the ability to create invalid by game mechanics buy orders on an anonymous marketthere are basically 2 different kinds of scams and imo they should require different means to identify them1 purely technical scams using only game mechanics an example would be the minimum buy amount thing described in the op these should be 100 identifyable simply by reading the available info the minimum buy amount scam is identifyable cause the buy order lists the min buy amount if someone ignores that number its his own fault2 scams that have a social component or generally require some interaction by the scammer imo those dont need to be identifyable just by reading stuff it is ok that they require suspicion and common sense to be applied by the potential victim because the scammer needs to apply more or less clever interaction to make it work an example similar to the margin trading scam would be if the scammer sets up orders similar to the margin trading setup but doesnt use an automated way to make the order fail but instead deletes the buy order manually after someone bought from the sell order id be completely ok with that because manually retracting orders is a basic feature of eves market and people have to consider that possibilitymy problem with the margin trading scam is that it belongs to category 1 being purely a technical scam using only game mechanics but the potential victim cant identify it just by reading you have to apply common sense and a very specific knowledge of how the margin trading skill works which isnt available ingame to identify it because technically it all looks legit and theres no way for you to know the wallet balance of the other guy this would be much less of a problem on a nonanonymous market cause you could just avoid the unreliable trader who had orders failing in the future on an anonymous market this poses a serious problem imo id be very surprised if you could find a single payment system in real life that can have automatically failing orders caused by missing funds and that is also anonymousdirectly manipulating market data ingame would be a very bad thing indeed but its not possible afaik and i dont think you actually meant that manipulating the market as in supply demand andor price is completely fineby in reality do you mean in real life if so i already said above you probably cant find an anonymous system with automatically failing orders there the problem with how it fails is that on an anonymous market you cant filter orders based on the reliability of the issuer so you have to be able to trust the reliability of the order itself and of course there usually went time andor money into the attempted order fulfillment so there is a loss when it fails doesnt matter really if the stuff was bought overpricedi would argue against this game mechanic just as much if it werent used for scams unreliable invalid orders on an anonymous market are a very bad combination imo if there is a standing order which is not interfered with by the issuer like manually removingchanging it you should be able to trust that orderthere are several possibilities to fix this issue1 remove the margin trading skillits the easy and clean solution but the skill is very useful for legit trading i have it and like it a lot more dedicated traders probably depend on it much more i feel its not an absolutely necessary skill for the game so this solution could be done imo but it would be harsh on many players2 make orders come through no matter what and give buy order issuer negative wallet balancethis would mean the skill couldnt create losses for particular victims but making people have negative wallet balances opens a whole new ugly can of worms the problem i see is not so much the restrictions for the players with neg balance because it was their own fault to get there but since there is no real way to enforce players paying back their debt to the economy by going positive balance again this could be exploited to create isk3 make sure buy orders are always validthis could for example be done by checking the coverage of each individual buy order every time the characters wallet balance gets smaller and remove buy orders that arent covered anymore this would still enable players to use margin trading because they dont need to be able to cover all their buy orders combined but each individual buy order would have to be covered all the time personally id prefer some solution like this

i think everyone who played eve for more than a few weeks will agree that 3rd party tools are an invaluable enhancement of the game and can improve the game experience a lot today it has been 2 weeks since retribution was released and the 3rd party devs still havent got a proper static data export without errors by ccp most of the tools including the 3rd party devs  rely on that data to do their jobi know that at least some of the csm are aware of this problem but i think it cant hurt raising awareness a bit the current process for releasing the sde appears to be that whatever dev finds some time besides doing real work does a data export publishes it at some random place which could be twitter irc the tech lab forum or the fankit website and the qa process seems to rely mostly on the 3rd party devs coming back at him and telling him what was wrong with the released sdejust to make this very clear i dont want hate for the poor dev who did the erroneous sde releases after retribution who apparently isnt even responsible for doing this i want hate or any other emotion you can muster on the eve expansion release process which puts such a low priority on thisideally the release of the sde should be on some release checklist and because this data usually doesnt change a few days prior to an expansion and because it usually doesnt contain any big surprises which players couldnt have found on the test server already the sde release should be a few days prior to an expansion around the time when patch notes get published to give 3rd party devs the possibility to prepare their applications in advance also this should happen at a welldefined place and while i dont particularly care which place that is the twitter account of some dev might not be the optimal solution and dare i ask for some internal qa on the sde probably not but im doing it anyway

this is the best idea i found in all of this forum kudos on a very bright thinking 1
i think ccp should show us what they have on wis right nowthey have the technology and we have seen it before
no been playing for yearsmy toons i have now are only a little over a year oldi have 4 accountsand i know about cloak modules
really because you seem to be new to eve this is common knowledge and one would have to go out of their way not to know thissummary of eves last four expansions
well i was thinking about it but all i can find there was bugs in game and in the launcheri just thaught here will be better to make my voice heard still no matter where this topic is at i think its a very small problem that can be solved fast by ccp
oh yeah that would be awesome they are already too safe with my alt visible in local 
hey weve all got dreams here and im sure none of us are going to die anytime soon patience and we will all eventually see pi and dust develop into fully mature game featuresyouve got my vote though for ccp to see this through till the end
look no matter which side of this topic you come down onpro or con there is a very real issue of real money involved in thisthere is a weakness in the system that allows an unscrupulous player to exploit another out of a large sum of isk which in reality has a real dollar amount attached to it if i can buy play time with isk that playtime has a value of 15 a month which then translates to that isk now in effect having actual money value this margin trading issue allows players to steal real money from others using margin trading you accept a contract attempting to then resell it the person that issues that contract is the same that issued the buy order you were trying to fill unfortunately that person issued that order via the margin trading skill and did not have enough isk in their wallet to fulfill the transaction so any attempts at selling items to that order will fail your isk that youve spend hours days years accruing legally is stolen from you thats real money out of you pocket
scamming and stealing are completely legit in eve ccp welcomes it as part of the game most of the time the weakness in the system is either intentionally there or at least willfully left exploitable by our game developers corp thefts regularly amount to tens to hundreds of billions there have been several scams stealing over a trillion isk from other eve players i understand it sucks to be scammed out of a lot of isk it may take a while to recuperate from that loss please realize even when your lost isk represents reallife cash investment on your part or even if it is only a time investment its computer pixels and ccp fully supports players using ingame mechanics to pry it away from you final note if it is too good to be true it usually is think before you buy and you wont be scammed its really simple to avoid 99 of these scams and if youre spending lots of your hard earned isk you owe it to yourself to not be stupid
while it is currently legit that does not mean ccp welcomes itthis is how laws are made someone finds a way to game the system a law is made to close the loopholeunfortunately in eve the people  or the csm  cannot make or change the lawsjust because it is not currently illegal does not mean it is not a problem it means there needs to be change in the system and the start of that process is discussion not simply telling the people with the problem to stfu and play in the sandbox
you are right scamming being legit does not mean ccp welcomes it ccp welcoming it however means ccp welcomes itexcept its not a loophole but working as intended i think we might be back to the part where ccp welcomes itwhile it might be quite funny for a short while to have players making laws generally i would consider it very fortunate that they cantyoure right again i cant help noticing that youre pretty good with this logic stuff however it not being a problem means it is not a problemah i got you now this is not a logically sound conclusion just because it cant be proven that something is not a problem by its current legality does not mean that there needs to be a change because the absence of proof for a nonproblem does not constitute proof of a problemps htfu
you are right that just because something is legit does not mean ccp supports it however when ccp gms repeatedly allow it when ccp devs are openly nostalgic about their ingame scamming activities when ccps marketing develops game trailers centered around stealing and deception im pretty certain i can claim ccp welcomes it 1 you opened the thread up for discussion claiming its a real issue because people experience real losses perhaps i wasnt clear enough ccps entire game is built on real losses how is being scammed out of 70b isk different than having your titan sabotaged and destroyed a player in either case feels the same value of losses the entire game premise is that losses are real 2 scamming is a subset of how you can take a loss theft loss of shippod or simply market swings all cause losses so why should margin trade scams be singled out what makes a loss from a margin trade scam need to be addressed 3 i did not tell you to stfu i told you to play more carefully and to play smarter thats how you avoid losses in this game

cry moremargin trading is pretty much the only way we have in game to buy and sell on credit buying and selling on credit is a thing that is real every time you buy something and write a check or swipe your credit card you are using your irl margin trading its a thing and its important the fact that people can set things up so they are offering to buy something then they swipe their card and go oops declined sorry doesnt seem like its even a problemyou know what one of those schemes looks like now dont get caught by the next oneby the way it took me a few minutes to write this you owe me money
not sure if youre trolling cause this has been covered in detail so many times its not even funny isk doesnt have real money value plex doesnt have real money value nothing in the game has real money value for a player you dont own anything ingame and you cant turn anything ingame into real moneycry me a river this is eve if you dont like a harsh world im pretty sure azeroth is still accepting connectionsi respectfully disagree cause as ive already said in my wall of text the main difference here to such things happening in real life is the anonymity
two points a i think you are completely missing the target the technical aspect of a margin trade skill is not responsible for the margintrade scam the technical aspect of the margin trade skill allows you to put up a buy order that you cant afford but it in no way earns you isk it actually costs you isk the technical aspect of the margin trade mechanics is why you should not trust that a buy order will succeed i have not heard any good arguments why we need to trust in that buy order although ill admit that the reason people fall for this scam is because they do trust that buy order when they should not b paraphrasing your statement the minimum buy amount scam is acceptable because a player only needs to look at the minumum buy amount to identify it to mean if the data is right in front of you and all you have to do is take a close look at it to identify a problem then its alright guess what on any item in the game you can look at a lot more than minimum buy amount you can pull up its price history for up to a year in a nice graph or table format it tells you the average buy and sell prices and how well that item moves its all right there and if you take 60 seconds to look at it you can spot a margin trade scam very easily in your words if someone ignores those numbers it is their own fault
rob crowley wrote1 why does it matter if people manipulate the market and market data people manipulate markets all the time even without using the margin trading skills why is this a bad thing directly manipulating market data ingame would be a very bad thing indeed but its not possible afaik and i dont think you actually meant that manipulating the market as in supply demand andor price is completely fine i think we have different definitions of market manipulation when you corner the supply of an item to increase its price when you put up unfullfillable buy orders to fake demand i call that market manipulation and eves market economy has run very well for the last decade despite having individuals and groups routinely manipulating our markets  rob crowley wrote2 how is the margin trade skill itself at fault for the scam in reality if i setup a buy order using margin trade yet i cant afford and you attempt to fulfill it what exactly is the problems with the way the order fails by in reality do you mean in real life if so i already said above you probably cant find an anonymous system with automatically failing orders there the problem with how it fails is that on an anonymous market you cant filter orders based on the reliability of the issuer so you have to be able to trust the reliability of the order itself and of course there usually went time andor money into the attempted order fulfillment so there is a loss when it fails doesnt matter really if the stuff was bought overpriced two points a have you ever ordered pizza for takeout you call in with a unregistered phone place an order and state youll pay in cash you give an unverified name and tell them youll be there in 20 minutes they make the pizza and if you dont show up you dont buy the pizza and they dont sell the pizza that my friend is the perfect example of real life anonymous buy order system with automatically failing orders when i was in junior high kids often pranked each other by anonymously having pizza delivered to a classmate who may or may not have the cash to pay for it there are also many many many examples of other nonanonymous buy orders that automatically fail too people cancel appointments which is the same thing in essence companies cancel production orders and on and on and on sometimes companies make contracts to protect themselves sometimes they take note of unrealiable purchasers but most businesses deal with automatically canceling buy orders on a very regular basis and eat the loss as part of business in eve we have a mostly anonymous buy order system as such we unfortunately cannot place the reliablity of an order on the issuer it would be neat if we could this brings me to my second point how do you determine reliability b how do you predict the weather tomorrow ill give you a hint the weather tomorrow will be roughly the same as it is today how reliable is that prediction well how much has the weather changed during the last week or the last month if it changes every day that prediction is very unreliable in other words you should not place the reliablity of the order on the order itself you should place the reliability of an order on the items history its hisotrical price its historical movement rate gives the best although not perfect indication of how it will move tomorrow or the day after or the week after how does this not register that is your source of reliability if an item historically has major market swings especially if it historically has a slow movement rate then it is not a reliable product to buysell for profit yes you can still buy the item and attempt to sell it for profit but since it is unrealiable it is risky to do so and more importantly when you buy the item to resell you assume all the risks in regards to reselling it for profit rob crowley wrote3 what is the crux of the scam its your willingness to buy overpriced items if you dont buy goods at an overpriced value you dont lose money here why are you buying goods above their market value i would argue against this game mechanic just as much if it werent used for scams unreliable invalid orders on an anonymous market are a very bad combination imo if there is a standing order which is not interfered with by the issuer like manually removingchanging it you should be able to trust that order why is unreliable or invalid orders on our anonymous market very bad eves economy has been working extremely well for years and these mechanics are nothing new and havent been problematic yet rob crowley wrotethere are several possibilities to fix this issue1 remove the margin trading skill2 make orders come through no matter what and give buy order issuer negative wallet balance3 make sure buy orders are always valid1 i have never run a scam in eve and my marketeer utilizes the margin trade skill extensively so id be sad to see it go very sad 2 extremely abuseable i spend 1 month training margin trade v on an alt in a remote area have them put up a 100b isk buy order putting 24b in escrow i complete the order on my main and make 76billion isk that pays the plexes need to repeat the process on 70 new accounts and before the second month ends ill have trillions 3 this is probably the ideal compromise but i dont understand why we need to compromise to begin with you havent convinced me there is a problem that needs to be fixed instead you keep pointing out how morons are morons the ignorant dont know better and the unscrupulous take advantage of both
yeah these scams are headbashingly obvious scams are usually pretty easy to spot they all have to do with people going hey if i do this wacky thing thats set up in some offthewall way for no apparent reason ill get rich beware of these things they arent there on accidenti keep trying to get various kids i know to play eve so that after a few times of them running into things like this they will have learned basic wariness as a survival skill the scammer did you a favor there are people who do worse than this outside of eve every day the memory of this bit of foolishness and the memory of everyone pretty much pointing and laughing because you expect the world to take care of you and keep you from getting hurt when youre the one who stuck your hand on the hot burner or whatever will stay with you forever and maybe save you from driving your family into the poorhouse or something someday
i want to point something out with your reply rare items that only a few people want are risky they have low movement rate and an uncertain value because frankly their demand is very low i used to collect baseball cards and had a fair number of rare and valuable cards that were potentially worth a fair bit of money according to my market guides however it was hard to find a buyer that would purchase the cards at that price because there just werent that many buyers out there in the end i didnt part with the cards until i found a buyer that was willing to pay a price that i was willing to sell them for the same thing goes for rare eve commodities when you are dealing with a low movement item its value is very unstable and you need to treat it as a risky endeavor buy orders should be viewed as those market guides i used to price my baseball cards they are only guides however and not a garauntee of value realize you can always put up a sell order for what you think it is worth if a purchaser agrees theyll buy it from you if not you have to fiddle with the price until you find a customer realize that margin trade scammer that thinks your rare commodity is a good choice for hoodwinking the ignorant is actually doing you a favor they will  must buy that item from you which just increases demand for your verylowdemand item the only people that get burned with the margin trade scam are people that dont understand the value of what they are purchasing and choose to purchase an item above its actual value finally scammers do have a small cost to setup the scam brokers fees they also risk the scam not working and they risk some trader undermining their scam by undercutting their sell order people keep ignoring this because the scam profits cover the losses but that doesnt mean they arent there finally for truly rare andor valuable items there is an entire section of these forums devoted to connecting buyers and sellers
thanks for your detailed reply you raised some interesting pointsboth parts of the margin trading scam the buy order and the sell order are technical ie only using game mechanics without interaction of the scammer after setting it up and guess what too you cant identify a margin trading scam with certainty by using this cause as i already mentioned you would need to know the wallet balance of the issuer for this you can guess that its a mt scam but you cant know in other words simply reading the numbers is not enough you have to interpret them which might be misleading and which i would like to reserve for scams of the 2nd category where the scammer has to interacti dont think so and we both agree it is fine and not a problem however i think we might have different definitions of direct market data manipulation which in my understanding would mean manipulating eg the numbers of the market history after they became that datathats an interesting example and indeed i havent thought of it but at the same time i cant help noticing that this example while it proves that such things exist in rl is pretty much making my point you already mentioned how easily abusable this system is and so the only reason this system might work is because there arent enough silly school kids abusing it but this system is clearly not what i would call sound and solid and basing an entire economy even if its just eves on it should cause a slight headachequotethere are also many many many examples of other nonanonymous buy orders that automatically fail tooyeah as i mentioned its only the combination with anonymity that makes it problematic cause in those rl examples you mentioned the party who experienced a loss can just decide to not make business with the unreliable party againwhile you make a good point here how those typical mt scams can be called out with reasonable certainty when applying common sense to it this is not something i ever argued however its not so easy anymore if margin trading manipulation were used in more subtle ways which might already be happening its not like we can know or even just having accidentally failing buy orders if the buy order issuer didnt intend to go below coverage as i said before im not arguing against mt because its used for scams but because it is a bad system imo which doesnt create major problems only because not enough people are abusing it
his idea is to remove decloaking while moving systems with covert op you can warp cloaked but you have to deaclok while moving from 1 system to the other i think his idea is to prevent this from happening so a covert op cloaker is realy cloaked at all times inc moving systems
perhaps part of one of the teams for the next expansion could be assigned to an i18nl10nunicodehandling cleanup of the eve codebase eve seems to have issues with astral plane ie nonbmp code point  ffff unicode characters in that when they are pasted into the eve chatbox the resulting surrogate pair shows up as two discrete character glyphs instead of as the glyph for the original nonbmp character
very good idea1 would also be possible in regular pve plexes like 810s this would add significanty more fun and an nice increase in tears creations
ok so i searched for fw fixes in this forum and did not see any recent ones if i missed it i am sorryi play fw for the pew pew mainly and not the lp farming the whole lp plex farming idea to me goes entirely against fw idea my proposal is as follows in my opinion1 plex changing as current should not give any lp the only point of plex changing is to control who can dock at stations who can setup pos in system and who has access to fw agents if you want to dock at a station setup a pos or use higher level fw agents then your faction needs to control the system2 lp is given out for kills or pve missions but not for plexing3 pve agents should be as follows lvl 1 given out in high sec for a mission in lowsec lvl 2 given out in low sec of what is normally controlled by given faction lvl 3 given out in low sec of what is normally controlled by opposing faction is now controlled by your faction but not upgraded lvl 4 given out in low sec of what is normally controlled by opposing faction is now controlled by your faction and upgraded this requires that if you want to do high level pve content for fw corp you need to actually take systems and hold them4 change fw missions to be ones which require you to take a plex point or something with actual meaning if there are no plexes left to take then have missions be random go kill npcs5 systems should have a level of control such that it is possible for lvl 1 missions to be able to take back lvl 1 systems so that if one faction completely overruns another then the underdog can at least take back a level 1 system with frigates example amarr has lost all of its systems and can only do lvl 1 missions it should be able to do a lvl 1 mission in low sec for a place which has a plex for lvl 1 ship types if they win the system back it can open up lvl 2 agents if they win the lvl 2 mission it can open up a agent for lvl 3 etcin my opinion this will open up far more pvp action than the current system or the old system it still gives rewards for plexing but you have to actually do a mission to get them counter plexing wont do anything directly other than open up the agents in the system if you want the lp you either have to kill players or complete a mission
i agree ccp should also add louis epic overview settings 
i like some of these ideassmart filters should be contextual to your filter only filter checkbox options should be displayed that make sense in the context of the filter of the overview tab i am viewingi particularly would like to see better integration of the overview and the scanning interface
if you like this idea please vote for it clicking on the thumbs up icon at the top right of this page thank youhellothis topic contains two parts  a feature request at least an idea and a question concerning the right to do this with a third party softwarein eve there are lots of informations to keep an eye on  the overview the local channel the fleet window the watch list the scanner  other windows that players often use  selected item channels inventoryso with all these windows there is only little free room to see the players ship and the fight scene in spaceto circumvent the problem there are a few solutions  1  use third party softwares like gimespace ultimate taskbar unfortunately its a shareware that can stretch your windows desktop to whatever virtual resolution you want 3200x1050 or 9000x4800  any resolution reallywith such software if you want you can display a very wide eve client window with all your windows opened2  buy an extra wide lcd screen recent ones have up to 2560x1600 resolution but they cost a lot of money example  lg intros 219 ultrawide monitorboth above solutions are good but displaying an eve client with such resolution doesnt make it run faster on the contrary especially with old gpu cards3  use autohotkey or hotkeynet to simulate a keypress tab automatically each time your cursor enters specific area of the screenbut i dont know if its legally possible according to the eula rules to use such softwares to simulate a key press in this specific case could a ccp team member enlight me and this 3 point led me to this idea currently to be able to clearly see the fight scene like on this screenshot players can press tab key to minimize all windows pressing tab key again toggles windows states minimizedmaximizedso i think it would be nice if the interface could interact with the players cursor position some windows could be hidden according to the cursor position on the screenfirst of all there could be some options for this feature what to do if the cursor hovers windows areas    make windows background halftransparent x  make windows background filled with theme colorwhat to do if the cursor doesnt hover windows areas anymore  x  minimize windows    make windows background halftransparent   make windows background filled with theme colorchoose which windows must always be displayed  x  selected item  x  overview   scanner x  fleet  x  watch list x  local channel   other channels   private chats   inventoryhere is how it would work   the player undocks this feature would only work in space players cursor is being moved in the middle of the screen for example the player is using the hud or clicks on ships modules  all windows are then hidden except those specified in options see aboveso the only windows the player sees are  selected item overview fleet watch list local channel then players cursor moves to the right side of the scren hovering the area where the overview window is generally displayed  the overview which was halftransparent is now displayed imediately with plain theme color now lets say the players cursor moves to the top of the screen then all channels tabs would appear this is just an example with this feature a player could have a very clean interface without any window displayed at first and just by moving the mouse elsewhere on his screen all windows could appear at once immediately

rob crowleyalways glad to have a discussion a couple counterpoints you do realize you cant identify if a buy order with a minimum buy amount is legit or not it might be it might not be hence the minimum buy order scam also falls under your technical scams category i have similar feelings to you on scams i believe that a healthy scam should be avoidable by informed participants for example i think the stationtrade scam is unhealthy ill explain it in case youre not familiar the scammer offers to buy something expensive from their mark but requests it is done using the station trade window rather than a contract or market buysell order they open the station trade window and first insert the agreed purchase price then they use a lagglitch in the market window to quickly change the isk offered to a different amount typically much much lower than the agreed upon purchase amount on the marks screen it only shows the originally imputed isk amount and does not adjust when the scammer alters the isk offered amount as such the mark hits accept to complete the trade when the interface information is telling them they will get their desired purchase price but when the trade completes they dont and are left scammed in the station trade scam the trade window is bugged and it states you will recieve xxx isk when in fact you will not there is no information available to let you know the terms of the trade have changed the only way to avoid this scam is to not use the station trade window luckily contracts are a very easy accessible and safe alternative this is very different than a failed buy order which fails do to the margin trade skill because the transaction fails and neither the buyer nor the seller get anything there is no trick nor profit in that transaction there is nothing unfair about this exchange actually i have an issue with the automatic creation of a sell order when a buy order fails but thats auxillary to this discussion the scam in the margintrade scam comes from people using that buy order which they assume is legit or at least assume its an accurate representation of value they erroneously use that value to determine profitablity of a completely different transaction they improperly assess the value of an item and they completely ignore the risk that a buy order can fail an informed particpant understands risk assessment and will include an items market history and personal experience to properly assess the value of an item before purchasing it and hence wont fall for this scam

i had previously posted this in the ideas discussion forum but i guess that was the wrong place dont see a way to move or delete it myself but i can least repost the idea where it belongs a new way of cloakinga device that can enable my ship to masquerade as something else this device could use scripts in order to change for instance my hurricane to show up on scan as a maelstrom the device would work by boosting the signature radius and disguising it therefore it could appear as something bigger but not smaller than the current radius otherwise that would make baiting to easy and then nobody would go looking for a fightan army of nonesecond maybe a launchable beacon that you can set these beacons can put forth a signal that will show up on scan as other ships or maybe even wrecks for baiting purposes when your probing that solo ratter he has the ability to make you think that he has some friends along showing up on grid would allow you to see the beacons and the hoax for what it is figuring out what to do with local would be the problem hereim not sure of the practicality of these ideas or even if i would use them however it might change the dynamics a little nobody ever shows up to fight you unless they are sure they can win with these it might add a little uncertainty and throw in a little more of the unknown into the equationyou might show up on grid because you think this guy is cloaked as something else and then find out it really is a battleship or it could be that tech 1 cruiser just trying to bluff you into leaving him alone either way your going to have to put yourself on grid to find out

i think im one of the many completely stupid people in eve that have no real clue what to do with the recieved giftsthe ship okay loose it  what else do you do with shipsthe snowvballs shoot them at people i got that part aswellthe implant stick it in you head and loose it with the ship also easybut whats with the rest are they collectors items  or will they get usefull one dayor are they there to collect dust 514 in your hangar i seen that 450000 players play eve now so the goodies are not rly rareanyways merry evemas and a happy new dust 
they are collector items for people that want to collect them its like the baseball cards you collect as a kid they dont have any intrinsic value they are just something fun to try and collect assuming thats your thing if it inst your thing you can contract them to me

define greedy in terms of profit margin on an item please
three things stood out in the opfirst off its not an exploit or a bugbeing annoying is not a reason for changethen we come to the final doozy real lifewhat relevance does that have i cant warp between planets in real life does this mean we should end warp travel in evealso if you honestly believe you cant do this in real life i doubt your claim not to have fallen for this in gamethis scam relies on peoples greed and get rich quick mentality much like the send me 100 mill and ill double itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
so for this example we assume that margin trading issues dont exist and the buy order is technically covered in that case you can identify with 100 certainty if the buy order is technically legit it is because all buy orders are technically legit if no mt is involved if it asks for 10 items and you bring 10 items you will be paid that doesnt mean the buy order cant be used for a scam like if the issuer knows you probably wont be able to find 10 items but thats not a problem imo thats what i would call a proper scam as i said before it falls into my technical scam category but you can 100 identifyavoid it just by reading the buy order properly and noticing that youll need 10 items no interpretation or common sense required so thats fine in my booknow heres a little problem then you cant be informed enough to identify all possible ways of mt manipulationconsider this examplean item that is traded in rather low quantities has sell orders for 1 bil and buy orders for 800m a scammer has 1 such item and wants to sell it for as much money as possible he creates a buy order for 900m and uses mt to not cover the order now theres no way anyone can be informed enough to notice that this is a fake order because this looks like a normal thing that happens all the time and should you think that these numbers are suspicious then just use subtler numbers instead its about the principle this new buy order will likely manipulate the market price of this item upwards eventually cause it looks like theres increased demand and other buy order issuers might feel inclined to increase their order prices to match the fake order and sell order holders will maybe increase or at least not lower the prices on their orders i consider this a problem because the scammer increased the price of an item with a buy order while never risking that he had to pay the price of that buy orderi totally agree with you on the station trading thing scams shouldnt use technically induced lagthe thing is a buy order on the market is a promise that you can sell that thing for that price at that place at that time and you might spend time and money not necessarily on a scammers overprized sell order to make use of that promise so there is inherently a loss incurred if this promise doesnt hold trueas i said i dont really fight the mt scam as such which i think would survive in some form even without mt probably by just using minimum buy amount or by being logged on and manually deleting the buy order after the sell order sold which both are proper scams in my book and not a problem what im fighting is the crappy game mechanic of the mt skill which imo is hurtful to the economic systemi agree on the automatic sell order creation if thats what happens when you pop a fake buy order but thats another issuesilly troll logic while eves space travelling is not based on rl space travelling eves economic system is based on the rl one so anything in the economic system that is a problem in rl is likely a problem in eve tooi already asked for rl examples of working payment systems which have technically invalid orders combined with anonymity the one example i got so far is anonymous pizza ordering which does exist but clearly is not a very solid system and gets abused just not often enough to make it completely unusable though many pizza deliveries dont use it in this form because of the abusement issuesif you can enhance the discussion with more examples feel free to do so
even though i was actually quoting the op ill respondbased on rl doesnt mean its relevant to balance of a game mechanic based on doesnt mean just like it means based onmuch like throwing in the terms exploit and bug when they have no relevance to the discussion like saying silly troll logic when someone disagrees with an argument they are weak and irrelevant poor mans argumentsthose arguments dont enhance much at alljust as the eve market is based upon the real life one my point was more towards scam and scandals based upon similar things you cant fit the exact framework because no market in real life fits evesscams in real life go more towards making other believe something is worth more than it is so they think a quick buck is to be madewhatever the scam or scandal its all based on peoples greed and need for a quick buck even the banks have been at itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
well could you provide a reason then why the particular mt issue is only a problem on a rl market but not on eves what are the relevant differences between a real market and eves in this regardoh come on of course i could have used friendlier wording but you basically pulled the equivalent of the old you cant expect consistency in a story with dragons and magic trolling im pretty sure youre too smart to actually consider it a serious argumentthats a rather bold claim i have to admit i cant name any specific market with an anonymous broker system in rl but i would be quite surprised if such a market didnt exist at all i would expect something like this in stock trading maybeyeah i think with the exception of maybe the op everybody in this thread agrees that scams as such are fine in eve however that doesnt mean that the mt mechanic isnt crappy and i dont want a crappy game mechanic to stay just so one more scam is possible
i know the secret to destroy the margin trading scam it works surprisingly well would you like to know
no
one is in a game and the other is real life the affect in one is disproportionate to the otheryes the stock market may be similar but not the same this is another reason why real life comparisons when talking about game mechanic balance simply do not workmuch like insurance in eve and real life you pay to insure and get paid when your vehicle is destroyed but look at the details and the whole comparison starts to fall aparti honestly dont see it as crappy simply because it doesnt solely rely upon the mt skill it needs people to fulfil buy orders in order for the scam to workthis is the point when people have full control over their own actions whether they check the market history of an item or prices in other regions is down to them but if you pay massively over the odds for something without checking prices first then why complain about the mt skill laterdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
just a friendly little reminder  bump to help put a little christmas cheer on this proposalhappy holidays and seasons greetings to everyone for their supportdmc
im not sure if this has been brought up yet but with the new ai npcs in missions are targeting drones even if youve already drawn aggro to yourself this has been making combat missions extremely irritating and difficult for me as a droner and im sure im not the only one having problems with it i feel that this brings the value of drones as a weapon down far below the other weapon classes and should be addressed
someone didnt read the dev blogs or skim the forums a week after the expansion came outnpcs switching targets is intentional more than intentional that was one of the bigger features of the expansion targets can include drones drones are still usable they just require more fineness and less afking my advice slap a target painter on your ship not only does it help drones apply damage easier but the npcs rate ewar as a bigger threat and will thus primary you
using one of my mid slots for a target painter is a significant hit to my tank i fly a rattlesnake and therefore still a disadvantage whether intentional or not i feel this is unfair and that is why i brought it up
my alt uses a rattlesnake too trade in an omnidirectional tracking link the target painter will provide most of the same benefits except for rangealso bear in mind that drone ships gain a wide range of benefits compared to turret or even missiles ships you dont use any ammo or capacitor to deal damage allowing your ship to operate relatively independent with sentries you can change your engagement range faster than it takes for a hybrid gun to swap ammo see pull in one set of sentries and deploy another you have versatility in what ships you can engage eg lights for small ships heavies for battleships sentries for rangeedit also your claim that this change is unfair was already discussed to death weeks even months ago it still went through
the solution to this problem will likely be addressed in the next year or so with some kind of revamp of how drones are used that is my guess anyways ccp did say that a drone revamp was high on their priority list

the only reason margin trading is allowed to exist in real life is because there is accountability for actions and orders accountability which is lacking in eve if orders fail if trades go bad there are assets which can be seized and liquidated to compensate the victims if accountability is not present margin trading as a parallel should not be presentas it stands margin trading is a vital part of eves economy that lets traders leverage their assets and increase liquidity and without it much of the bulk buy orders that are key to trading would disappear removing margin trading is not an option but giving buyers more information on buy orders would be much welcomeda simple example would be open to tweaksif the buyer does not have sufficient isk to fulfill the minimum buy amount allowed the order is shown in redif the buyer has enough isk in wallet and escrow to fulfill the minimum buy amount but not enough for the whole order the order is shown in orangeif the buyer has more isk in wallet and escrow than the complete value of the buy order the order is shown in yellowif the buyer has lots of isk available more than the total value of all total market obligations the order is shown in greeninformation available to a player should be plentiful and accurate so we can make the best decisions in our situation this lack of information regarding market orders is a oddity in eve the best metaphor for margin scamming right to the rest of eve regarding the unreliability of information would be like thisyou see a hauler in lowsec but it could also be a bait tanked drake the only way to know for sure is to bump the ship experienced players might be able to determine what the ship is by looking at the behavior of the ship but the ui will only tell you it is a hauler now how many players would be happy with that situatimagine the rage that would ensue if combat ui was not absolutely accurate or if a module was introduced that let you camouflage your ship as another thats what margin trading depends on right now the inability of the eve market ui to give the needed information
im sorry but i cant really answer to that if you just claim that the markets are too different to compare but you dont go into some detail and provide some arguments as to how they are different exactly and why that means that the mt mechanic is not a problem in eve when it is in rlyeah as i said im not fighting the scam im fighting the game mechanic of the mt skill which just incidentally happens to be used for the scam too there are a lot of use cases for the mt skill where you wont be able to see that the buy order will fail by looking at market history or any other use of common sense
thanks finally someone agreeing with what ive been preaching in this thread im not sure id call it leveraging your assets as mt in eve will work without any securities and i guess that often buy orders are covered in the future by selling already completed parts of the order but thats not important really i dont think the mt skill is that integral to the economy as you think professional traders which i guess are a small minority on the market would need to have 4x as much isk to put on their orders or alternatively just make new orders more often imo not a game breaker but a mild inconvenience as i said before its not my prefered solution thoughi dont like this solution though because while it would solve the mt issue imo it gives way too much information about the buy order issuer imo the information that is missing is about the order not about its issuer and allowing people to gather information about someones wallet balance is not something i can agree withhow do you like my earlier proposed solution of automatically removing individual buy orders as soon as they become uncovered its even easier to implement than yours and while it does limit the abilities of professional traders a little bit compared to now i feel its easily manageable to keep your buy orders individually covered while still making good use of mtyou know how you can avoid falling for this apply a bit of common sense lad a hauler in lowsec is obviously too good to be true if you werent so greedy to go for a hauler killmail and just settled for a mission running noob caracal you wouldnt have fallen for this you also couldve looked at the killboard history of killed haulers in that system but you just like to jump into lowsec uninformed dont you

sorry whatwhen you asked what the difference was i assumed wrongly it seems that you were already aware i dont think the eve market is like any rl one i was pointing out that scams in real life affect people in a far more disproportionate way than any eve scamplus eve is designed to include scams as part of its game play they even advertise it as suchdo i have to mention why scam are bad in real life what exactly are you missing herebanks have recently found themselves having to pay very large fines for scandals of late the libor scandal springs to minddifferences lets list one simple difference shall we the skills we buy and train if you can point to every skill and a counterpart then be my guest but like i said the mt skill is not solely responsible for the scam and it can so easily be avoidedas far as the skill is concerned many many players use it for exactly what it was intended for it works well so doesnt need changecommon sense comes with looking at the prices and finding out what a product is worth i personally have never had an issue with this and wouldnt blame an unrelated skill if i didnow lets ask you about something you statedcan you show me proof ive never seen anything from a ccp dev regarding thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

i originally proposed this idea in october 2011 the thread got an incredible amount of interest for features  ideas four whole pages and i had a few people call me into taking it to the assembly hall i never did the thread is linked and my original post is below it might be worth reading the thread the debate on ideas was actually very widespread and improved some of the points i proposed in my op
as a player who semi regularly kills corpmate orcas and other shiny toys i understand your concern however this is not a game mechanic problem but a lazy ceo problem and a complacent player problem residing in highsec is a terrible excuse for not fitting a tank on a ship or taking even the most basic security measures i wrote a blog post about how to avoid such problems arising
still slower than the mwd trick

because its a cloaking device not a 100guaranteedabsoluteinvulnerability devicebesides have you ever tried catching someone with a cloak coming through a gate that fraction of a second between them hitting warp and cloak isnt much to do anything at all
i would like to see my ships value in the fitting view and in any saved fittings this would help in deciding whether or not its worth it to risk a ship for a particular task it would also allow people to see what they are getting into when they view a fit and are considering looking at it
hello friendsi am proposing a slight change to the way the selected item window works right now it displays approach orbit keep at range etc this is perfect however if you double click in an empty portion of the window the window minimizes so in the heat of battle if i am trying to spam my warp button and accidentally click on the empty portion below it minimizes and in the second it takes me to double click it to maximize it again i am disrupted or scrammed this is a game of seconds and milliseconds when the ui is causing me to lose precious moments i find it necessary to bring it up in the public forumproposed resolution simply make the empty part of the box do nothing when double clicked rather than minimizing the windowthank you for your time
so the game also has things like a notepad internet browser calculator etc those exist outside of the game will ccp take those away as well what about the chat system there are plenty of other ways for me to chat to people outside of the game so why not free up some more of those valuable resources by removing talking why even have portraits when there could just be an external site for people to upload pictures in fact im pretty sure there are some other games that have spaceships in them too so why not just let them handle that sort of thing so you dont have to worry about it ccp1
i liked the jukebox i dont run multiple eve clients while i do run full screen as such it was nice and handy i also recommended to new people that they download the euni class recordings into a custom play list so they could learn about the game while playingi also liked the ability to simply advance when not in the mood for a given tune or pausestop it if something important came up  such as voice comes issues or the likei do miss itthat said if its extra work keeping it up to date and if it causes issues in other areas  leave it gonethe more focus on game mechanics and fixing the ui  the happier ill be if it is a difficult part to keep going id much prefer it gone than having it potentially prevent other fixes from coming outi just dont know how much extra work was involved again if its not a major problem to keep it around please do restore it if so i can live without it but it is missed

itd also be cool once the ships are interlocked after a ram to be able to have a company of dust mercs board the other ship and capture iti can just hear a cfc carrier pilot on comms to a dustbunny stand by to repel boarders
maybe as another mechanic i prefer the idea of ramming capitals to ensure death to the pilot or at least the ship
if eve was the real world i could see this being a good idea in game im not sure these would be neededthe first one would be thrown out because so many people use cloaked eyes first to see what they are attackingthe second one would work in wh space because of the no local but again so many people use cloaked eyes i dont see either one of these validunless you just wanted to scare the hell out of your corp mate and make him think a 50 man bs gang just jumped in to your wh
recently ccp has been making changes to stop afkrelative afk isk farming with changes to static respawn plexs and indeed the ai changes to rats so they retarget drones etc for the carrier pilots however afk cloakers sitting in systems are safe they like the afk isk makers are having an impact on the game without actually playing it and the people they are stopping from doing stuff have no way to hunt them downproposal 1 introduce a variant of the combat probe that can detect and pinpoint cloaked ships meaning that if a player wants to stop hostile isk making in systems they have to be active ie warping around bookmarks in systemproposal 2 introduce an activity timer to logoff pilots after a certain period of inactivity defined by player interaction with client not their computer systemwould love to hear thoughts on this issue i have no problem with people playing the game in a way that causes a detrimental impact to the money making of other players however there needs to be a way to combat a cloaky whos only purpose is to affect other players while watching netflix etc
until the afk cloaker starts making isk while afk there is no problem
obviously there is the concept of eve is anything can take anything but a cloaked ship is pretty much invulnerablei am not saying that cloaked ships are bad far from it however they should not be untouchable as they are currentlyadding a probe for cloaky ships would allow people to activley seek combat to clear out systems whilst still allowing the cloaky ship some form of defence ie ur a cloaky in a system using your dscan and you notice sisters covert combat scanner probe in the list you then know you have to move around rather than just go and watch netflix safe in the knowledge that your fing someones play time however if you have logged in cloaked and gone afk to watch a film or even logged in then gone to work you could then be probed out and destroyed
when i have a way to jump into a populated 00 system on a random roam and have a decent chanced of grabbing some poor random then and only then will i agree that cloaking detection is neededas it stands right now afk cloaking ships is the only viable way to attack the industry of a null sec system without bringing in your own thousand man fleetnot supported
not really cloaking ships are a viable way of interuppting industry not afk cloaking shipsif your gonna sit in a system to stop them making money thats fine but leaving your character in someones system 237 whilst your away playing wow or watching eastenders on the telly that is wrongim not saying people should not be cloaked in a system to disrupt industry just that they should be at their keyboard doing itif i have a mining barge in a belt and i go afk watching a film i have a very good chance of being popped so why should someone go afk watching a film or whatever and have no risk associated with italso if you are at keyboard as the op stated its not an issue cloaky ship sees probes moves position
nope afk cloaking is working as intended
in the 10 years of eve onlines existence no one has ever lost a ship to an afk cloakerthread
well for starters while mining you are making isk the cloaker is not and cannot make isk while cloakedsecondly would it bother you just as much if the guy was docked up in the same systemi am talking about changes to the way local worksnikk covers it best
i could see this being helpful this would work for distributing bookmarks tooi want 5 stacks of 1 bookmark to hand out or for sleeper loot my corp use to keep their sleeper loot out in high sec and wait for prices to go up you split the stacks 5 people came along and you do the math splitting the stacks 20 items in 5 stacks1
im missing the jukebox a lot too im a guy that actually likes ingame music a lot and i loved to switch sometimes to my fav below the asteroids song it made me go pownage on big battles and kept me company for when i locked myself in a whi also liked the quick ability to pause it for voice conversations or when it was unwantedso please give it back if it is not a to big problem i saw some great idees here already about making it a option
i want my jukebox back
of course we dont use them all the time can only use the ones in the system im in at the time however its damn nice to jump into a new system rightclick and find a full menu of safe tactical and scanning bookmarks readily available from the last time i was there
as a member of a large wormhole alliance i can tell you stabilizers of any kind are bad mkaycurrently the only difficulty in a c6 is logistics and if we all of a sudden have a way to keep whs open until we collapse them ourselves well then we no longer have to worry about scanning for a highsec to only find eols we cna just lock them open and bring 1012 bestowers in and out then force it closed would make thinsg way too easy
i just came back to eve after a long break and this drone change is by far the worst thing that has ever been done to the game was this done by team supernotfun or whatit was already annoying that you couldnt fight sleepers with drones which kind of rendered an entire skill tree useless but now you cant even use them properly anymore in missions as it stands currently this change does not add even the slightest to the game it isnt even adding any challenge as all you need to do is watch the targeting of npcs and hit retreat once you are no longer locked and buy an occasional new drone if you had lagwhile before i was strategically playing a mission i now sit there and watch my drones drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out drone in drone out totally not fun at all
for everyone saying that i just need to pay attention id like to clarify i do not afk during missions very often in fact i use my drones in passive mode so that i can choose my priorities for them to attack and try to better manage the aggro no matter how i handle them since the retribution release im losing drones every mission because they cant get out kill a ship and get back in the bay before one of them dies ive had to go back to using my raven and im still losing drones when i need them to take out elite fast frigates
easily worked around get corpmates andor friends to bring your right to the limit then go and wreak mayhem
thats divergent gameplay if you want to restrict peoples options in combat then do something with aggro mechanics but itd be pretty amusing to see freighters smashing into each other in gank attempts especially considering the cost of freighters that the gankers would need to employ
aaaaaaaaand up
like the op i suck at eve and cry on forumslets try to learn how to play the game and then go to the forums now couldent that be fun
still the best solution to everything is to remove local as per wormholes i suggest you go back to ratting in your golems its all fine as the cloakers are away from keyboard zero risk
tldr lower rl plex prices increase revenuehappinessso i was looking at plex prices compared to monthly subscription rates with monthly you pay from 1095 to 1495 depending on the increment plex on the other hand are 1750 per unless you buy one at which point they are 1999 prices are in usdfirstly i am going to ignore the whole ccp is screwing us qqq line they are a corporation their goal is to make money the problem is that plex are very elastic if someone is buying them we can assume they are also paying for their account so they really have no need for it they can always go out and farm isk or not lose as many ships during that paycheckon the flip side i have friends in game who are playing from plex to plex and if anything it takes the fun out of it one of the appeals to newer players is that you can pay for eve using in game cash however when it turns into a second job to keep your account up and you have to spend more time farming for your plex then actually playing the game this is also the bittervets god help the poor noobie running lvl 3s in a myrmidon my proposal is simple just lower the price of plex to be more in line with monthly payments and make it more beneficial to buy more of them the same way it works for monthly honestly even just lowering the price of the multipacks would help why buy a six pack when you can buy three packs of two at the same price this also helps those of us with low resistance to impulse buying wreck our wallets more often lower prices means more plex sales for ccp cheaper plexs for players easier accessibility to eve and general better lives for everyone
we need a new mechanism build in the forums to prevent ppl from making topics about  i think this will be the next best thing since introducing covert cynos
i agreejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
put in under a sticky then move all new topics there so people can read how their brilliant idea was shot down 3 years ago
this post is concerning the inclusion of a new market option for both hisec and lowsec markets the introduction of generic products and services as a failsafe against non sufficient product availability and extrenuous price variances this new system would create a new product for each product listing but using either a hisec csm or lowsec isd brand schemaswhy competing generic brandssome corporations only work in certain areas the two major divisions of hisec and lowsec gives each group and their regions a more fair coveragecan anyone create generic brandswith respects to csmisd provision and ccp developers everyone should be enabled to create generic products the competitive environment for time sensitive market activity expands to provide npos and regular corporations greater coverage to reach their preferred customers by producing generic as well as their normal brandsdo generically mean lesser qualitypossibly if the corporation that produced it insisted on it for quantitative purposes but all csmisd products would be approved for mass distribution to the publicwhat steps should be taken for generics to be implimentedby filing petitions on the main ccp site creating alliances and formally presenting a resolution you will be in position to represent your favor group of hisec or lowsec products and market shares before ccp and its developersyour input on these issues do matter please respond to this post concerning if interested
proposal 1 sheesh i can see you put a whole lot of thought into that so with just two clicks someone can launch a probe and press scan and know if a cloaked ship is in the system well done you just broke wormholesseriously this has been suggested many times before try reading the forums before posting the same tired i dont know what to call it wanted to say idea but that word suggests some intelligenceproposal 2 what about people in stations outposts or poss they are showing up on local too and are also uncatchable dont you think they should be treated the same as people using cloakesjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i want it back can not imagine any reason why it has been removed it is like devs do not play or care this game anymore so they better keep their hans offit almost really flipped me to just dowloand the music and not to sub this game anymore
i came back from a break and was well aware of this changebut right now it is a bit too harsh imhono i am not afking but while my hobs ii are trying to shoot down an enemy frigate that is dampening and scrambling me i lost 2 in a few seconds due to many enemies targeting it since i was unable to shoot anything because i could not target anything at the end of the mission i had 1 hob ii left i really dont want to think about my next blockade where i am mostly constantly jammedas a gallentean i dont really like this change
if you are looking at the ship you are doing it wrong this is internet spreadsheets simulator not some fancy spaceship game
how about finally getting custom bloody roles and access like every other mmo under the bloody sun
eve becomes angels fall first planetstorm i approveseriously though ramming should become a thing for all ships whenever they feel like it crushing a frigate in a mining barge would be hilarious
if this was the case id like to see a system with some sort of mjdesque module implemented thatd be cool
yep scamming is as legit in eve as anything it goes right with the deception aspect of the gamepersonally i dont do it though even in internet spaceships i am trapped by my morals
perhaps just bumping for blackmail purposes as bumping is a very useful tool for other purposes especially in pvp
elaborate
tldr seed civilian mods and weapons everywhere in empire via npcs so i am not required to have a logistical supply line or carry my equipment with me to some far flung area of the mapsuck it up op weve all been there and part of the challenge of this game is making do with what you have and planning around it
do you want the unreliable estimated prices or actual market prices either way work it out yourself its not like the market changes at a whim or anything
and then everyone were hurricanes and the belts were empty forever
once upon a time we couldnt warp to zero on a gateso we made book marks honestly your idea is pointless put up a drag bubble and setup your gate camp to uncloak people
all the location aware system seems to do is cut the playlist from 60 tunes to about 5 virtually all the music in eve with the exception of the instrumental heavy metal that used to play when going into a deadspace plex is gentle ambient music that could be listened to in any situation
convo spaming was good too in pvp especially in shooting carriers
hehehe
ummmmmm yeah whatever he said just do it please
thank you jack logansi appreciate
i totally agree
i detected players who are placing low bounties 100k on people it seems to be affordable for almost any rich player to mark the whole eve universe wanted i think this an exploit of the bounty system and renders it useless i ask you csm and community for a change edited conclusion see new topic subject
as you appear to be upset about the low bounty threshold ive added 100m to your bounty enjoyand to the proposal itself no theres no good reason why it should be 1m instead of 100k giving everyone 100k bounties is hardly an exploit and the idea that it makes it useless is laughable
come live with us for a while then youll find out just how horrible an idea the op really isseriously trying to limit 00 afk cloakers would cause hell for us wspacers especially when operating well away from ones home basehow would you deal with running out of cloak fuel when you are a covops working random routes out of a hostile c5 fly 30 j to empire and back strongly risking the route collapsing out from under you
the only way to rework bumping is to remove it completely ie make the ships fly through each other its not like the physics are in very central role in eve anyway
i concur with the learned dutchman
bribing npc factions and corporations for standingsremoving your ciminal flags and resetting your security status to 00 by payng a fine proportional to the severity of your crimesmatching the price on your head should nullify the bounty contract
so basically any pirate or 00 person who is rich enough doesnt have to worry about doing bad things in empire anymorei can see a rash of suicide ganking and wardecs happening after this
so my ideas are simple and quality of life stuff1 fleet templatessave fleet wing squad configuration and names for them simply click the upper left corner and select a saved templatei would love this we always make fleets and having a template could save me a bunch of time building it2 fix boostersanything so people in fleet or wing get boosts properly also assigning boosters and such needs to just work3 dragdroplet me click someone and drag them to a squad or wing position
ive recruited a number of friends and seen them leave because there simply wasnt enough casual things for new players to do and id like to add a few ideas on how to help give newbies reasons to stay make mission running fleets more exciting give players additional goals to reach fex give style pointslp isk or whatever for doing a mission right instead of just flying in and shooting left and right cowboy style a mission could award you style points for not using certain modules that would draw attention or affect a nearby anomaly or whatever else makes sense in the situation or perhaps just a simple boast system that increases rewards if you fly a ship with only t1 fittings no armorshield tanking fits or adding a strict time limitmake the skill queue accessible from api smartphone appsevemonetc or increase the queue time so you dont waste time training skills to lvl 5 you dont really need yet because you want to go on a christmas vacation make exploring a shared experience let people meet and work together or against each other without it just devolving into pew pew pewaction make events that are accessible for newer players like incursions or wormholes and make goals for different career specializationspveers explorers miners haulers etclower training time on skills i think the fact that you can spend a few months specializing in something you think you want only to realize that mining wasnt the thing for you can be devastating for a lot of peoples patience with this game i dont mind it im one of those people that enjoy doing lots of different things in the game and i keep myself busy but really think of the childrenmake logistic ships and other ships that give a strategic advantage other than more guns available soonermake mission specific objects highlighted in the default overview and add a shitton of tooltips to help explain mechanics like tracking signature radius etc and maybe add default fittings for some of earliest available ship classes to prevent confusionsort of off topic but some ship designs really look unsound i love my drake but it looks like its meant to combine with other ships to form a dragonzord and getting a new cool looking ship is something everyone looks forward to also a complimentary plastic surgery every now and then to fix that nose you messed up when you first created your character would be nice as a new player you dont really want to spend ca 580mil isk for a nosejobi hope this is the right placeform to submit this and id be happy to hear more suggestions im not trying to make the game easier just more accessible for new players to get hooked on it gets lonely in space you knowyour ideascritique is welcome even if this thread goes unseen by the powers that be i still enjoy discussing ways to improving the game that nurtures my addictive gaming problemhappy new year
right
