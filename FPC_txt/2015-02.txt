why should someones vote be somehow nullified just because theyre part of an alliance why is the game not actually played by members of major alliances and what happens when the evil big alliances start bloc downvoting the heart of gold downtrodden little guyalso if they have it so rough how do the little guys keep managing to get themselves elected
just dont fill in all 14 choices
you see this here this is my degree in politics and public law i am now shaking said degree in the general direction of the eve forum servers and wishing mean nasty hurtful things upon you ingame
leaving a link to another thread here in case any devs particularly the art department is still reading
stopped reading hereyou knew when you signed up for the game at least you did if you actually read the eula and tos that eve online is a pvp game if you dont want to pvp go play some other game or hope and pray for the lastest vaporware of the month to be releasedeither htfu or gtfo
i suggest asking for a very large amount of isk
this reminds me  i must complain to my local butcher about him not catering to vegitarians
ok this one gets added to my signature
op i dont think this is the game for you
i always find it surprising that someone can play this game for any length of time and just not understand the basic premise upon which it is built
yet everything you need to do that is already in the game and at a hell of a lot cheaper price than this ship would be a small pos fuel to run for a few hours for your day trip sma guns and ammo will all easily fit into a blockade runner cost less than 150mil and can all go up in about 20 minutes having a ship that would potentially cost at least ten times what a basic small pos setup would cost more than likely somewhere in the range of 2030 times is not reducing the barrier to entry
the idea of a force fieldprojecting ship is not a new one  a cursory look at the features  ideas subforum where this belongs would show thatim not against the idea in fact i like some things about it this sounds like it would make an excellent forward base in a combat operation
that is another use for it especially if you have a small group that is effectively stuck in enemy space until help can arrive due to current jump limitations or as space expands lord knows there would be systems without stations so set up a safe drop this ship into localization mode and then do worki am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sorry may english is bad but i cant write in any other forums where samebody is undersand my l language and interested in this things  and if you dont understand what i read and aree you interested in this things may send mmy ingame mail and i try to explain it there and yorry for a long text dcalm down the star citizen is coming in 2016 there you can guard yourself with transportship not yust watch your daying ship and you can do other thing not yust pvp i think the way where the eve is goin now is going to the end of the game the updats are fun but if you want to live in highsec you will need for biger and beter skilled corp to use this thing them in nullsec i think it is funy because if you have not skills and you are not in big corp yu will yust watch your butiful ships in the station i think the noob farming is not so interesting way to make pvp but now this is the most profitable thing what you can do yust stand in front of jita with your frands in owerkilled ship in dockrange of corse and wait for reds 024 it may wery fun but im on the bad side of this genital we are in war for 35month with one weak break the first was not problem but the secund it was wery fun because one 35years old caracter farmd us yust because it is fun and now nobady hel us wit the 3 war because they are frends in one sandbox game you can do what you want and yes if you want it is mining simulator or the space wersion of the farmville because it is a sand box game but it is not a sandbox game it is one pvp game where you can do same industrial thinds if your envairoment want to you do thet because if you do industry you are not so stong and your cargo is may expensive so you got always gank and wars yust because it is a sandbox game where you can rotate your ship on the station it is the most usefull option for the players who want to make isk with industry in hs i think if it is not change in the close future the game will be die when the competition will avalivable but this game is to good to be yust a memory i hope samething will hapend with this unbalanced system because 50m is wery cheap for noobfarming i want to pay 50m to the concord to decline the war ageinst us i think its may fair because you can make decision if you want fight you will not pay if you want you will pay for the concord not for the corp who wared you
at the fanfest csm panel last year

you know you dont have to vote for all 14 right by the time most votes hit their 5th or 6th candidate the vast majority of their voting power is expended
you know that so many people go around telling people at 1 you have to vote for all 14 or 2 that if you dont vote for all 14 youre wasting your votes and that came from people who were on csm 8 so its hard to blame anyone for believing they did have to fill out all 14the stv is not really well understood even by its advocates its kind of hard to get behind or participate in something you dont understand
the idea of constituencies is not a new one and best answered with questions if a player has alts in high but belongs to a null alliance which constituency does he belong to do we have to register to vote declare our allegiances before the actual campaigns begin can you change your registration if you have chosen a new lifestyle would there be a minimum residency requirement could it be gamed by an organized portion of the electoratenot to mention all the groups that would be bypassed if you had only the big four of high low null and wormstv is matthy and confusing for some and yes i might be one who encourages people to fill out more of the ballot then might be needed but that is because i want to be sure their vote counts for something better to have your ballot contain some extraneous names than to die because you only write one name    and they didnt get in or another name but they were already in and didnt need your voteshow me a better way and i will support it but going back to first past the post and or constituencies doesnt qualify for that supportmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ill be honesti only really care about the first few names on my ballot the rest are mostly mushed in names that incumbent csm members recommended
i must admit that is very strong and well explained point of viewi concede i was wrong and now advocate stv voting as a simple easy to understand and unexploitable asset to the csm voting process which encourages participation and diversity
im voting for aram kachaturian eves french prophet and progod the best fc in the game because theyre attractive and witty in real life
i do what i do every year which is to take the quiz and enter the results as votes and get the same results as every year which is none of them win
yea having been a mostly high sec dweller moving to null is way more fun and safe
way much safer than low
that is why we need the abstain option
what specifically do you look for in a csmhave you considered the possibility that your expectations are unrealistic if not one of the several hundred candidates who have run for election in the past few years is even close to what you wantif not have you considered running yourself since there is clearly an unserved constituency
btw i am following this thread and if you have questions about what it is like being the highsec csm guy ask awayyou are taking up a hard task because while a large percentage of the game live in highsec they do not organize nor do they really care about the metagame elections included hopefully leeloo and the rest of the ccp community team can generate some more noise this year and we can get a decent turnoutsome will tell you that this is nulls year    with expected sov changes yes and no the changes are coming but the game is a whole not isolated instances any change in one area has an effect across the whole of the game even when they are talking about a part of space you know less about you have the right and the responsibility to represent your part of the game and ask how it wide the effects will bemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
hi mike thanks for stopping byi think something like a popup on logging in for the week of the elections would be a good thing like i have said we get several popups in the runup to downtime every day one week of popups on logging in with the elections coming would not be too much more of an inconvenience then we could at least be sure that no one missed out on voting because they didnt know i hope that the changes in null will bring us high sec carebears also fresh wind aside from the game mechanics i hope that the changes in null will make it more exciting than it previously seemed to be and more accessible for someone sitting outside and watching
i feel the same way ive been in nullsec and liked it but trying to maintain myself out there is stressful i just dont play the game enough anymore and as a result if i want to join in on a fleet starting out there i have to gather my things and ship out a day before in preparation because thats actually easier than staying out there sometimes
what would you feel would make you change that feeling cause csm9 is looked upon in general as one of the most easy to reach and open onces with twitter scype eve radio sessions weekly updates from several members fixed chat sessions and even ingame mails i think not to mention quickest minutes ever so i woudl liek to know how you dissatisfied and how to change it
ahemhi we would love to hear from youexecutive editor csm watch  writer cohost of the cap stable podcast  twitter lanctharus
your evesterdam speech was solid you will have my votebtw is the voting open
most of those resources you have listed have been completely unknown to me completely until nowand even still i cannot find much advocation from you as representative of the playerbase and provibloc specifically in the the year i have been playing eve on this account  most of which coinciding with your continued tenure in csm 9  i have been made aware of but one advocation that youve made to ccp regarding jump fatigue and its impact on null travel with jump fatigue and i only learned of that two weeks ago through speaking with the executor of a provibloc sov holding alliance regarding the concerns i have regarding our representation through you to the csmthe closest advocation for a specific idea without going gray pouring through all the media mash is a tweet you sent out on the 23rd of januaryUFFFDa sovereignty design with the goals including spreading fights over a larger area and removing the requirement for hitpoint grindingUFFFDthat sounds great and i wholeheartedly agree in fact most people would however it lacks specifics whatUFFFDs more is that itUFFFDs missing your thoughts on how the sovereignty mechanics in eve should be rethought this is nothing more than a statement of general sentiment from the playerbasehow do you think taking a system in null should work specifically what burdens should an aggressor or system defender face and ultimately triumph over to take sovereignty in a system do you think certain mechanics of sov warfare in itUFFFDs current form should be removed entirely and replaced by new ones if so what are theythese are the sorts of questions that go unanswered and this is simply for one of many issues you have mentioned in your platform i am fully aware that there is an nda legally binding you from releasing details from the csm summit and communication between you the csm and ccp but surely your personal opinion isnt under such constraints correctanother recent tweet youve sent out was rhavasUFFFDs full disclosure i have no idea who this guy is UFFFDearly thoughts of the csm x elections and the end of csm 9UFFFD he writes the followingUFFFDi havenUFFFDt been able to get excited about core i have seen a lot of cheerleading but not a lot of constructive activity a lot of UFFFDgood fightUFFFD tweets but that doesnt equate to csm quality for me i havenUFFFDt seen any real communication of substance maybe the summit minutes will show something different his constituency does seem to like him so while i donUFFFDt endorse him if youUFFFDre a provi person and like what heUFFFDs done go for itUFFFDwhile those arenUFFFDt my words those are my sentiments exactly i feel as though the entirety of your platform is simply that of geographical representationi hope you understand the message i am conveying and how disappointed i am to be doubtful that our csm representative from provibloc is representing us well as a region and coalition and the playerbase in wholeregardless i am looking forward to that en24 post and i wish you among all the other csm x candidates the best of luck
newbros need all the help they can get big 1 from me
bobmon sat down with the cap stable podcast for an interview
just a couple of questionsif elected to be on the csm how much influence do you expect to have on the future development of evedoes your channel function as publicity for your campaign to get on the csm or does a position on the csm function as publicity for your channel
im an optimist but i understand that my influence as a csm member would be limited to that of a very vocal communicator i dont have illusions that i will be doing more than bridging the wishes of the community to the strategy of ccp and vice versa i also understand i would have only one voice among many csm members but thats why being a good listener and taking a diplomatic air have valuerealistically speaking my channel functions as publicity for literally everything i do in the videogaming world but it should be obvious the channel is not a tool for the purposes of winning a csm race or even for the purposes of eve specifically i have been making youtube videos since 2008 because gaming strategy and humor fascinate mei dont see the csm helping my channel particularly most people whod be aware of me or my corporation already know about my channel
greetings before i get started i wanted to go ahead and introduce myself i go by erika mizune however i also go by dj yumene for those of you who know me from eve radio i was introduced to eve through eve radio by several of the staff and listeners when i joined curiously to find out what it was about i have been playing eve since 2011 or since 2010 if you count my first account that let lapse because i couldnUFFFDt get into it so it took me until my second account this one for everything to really start clicking i started to fall in love with the game and the beauty that it held i also have made some great friends over the time because of this great gamei am asking for your support in voting for me as a representative for csmx i feel that i have the drive and the passion with the community at heartmy playstyle includes mainly the industrial route i live in sov nullsec i mine manufacture run inventions run a hauling service and pretty much anything in between i have always loved the industrial side of the game but at times it does seem to be also unappreciated granted there have been a lot of changes to the industrial side of things including the introduction of teams even though they didnUFFFDt turn out well the idea was good and does need tweaking so iUFFFDm happy to see ccp looking at that and am looking forward to seeing that come into play againone thing that i feel most people can agree on is that most industrial work is tedious and boring especially mining you sit there and mindlessly shoot a rock until itUFFFDs depleted and then it poofs out of the belt with really no UFFFDrewardUFFFD as you do with other jobs you can do in eve for instance when you go out and pvp and run missions you chances at loot and extra isk to go along with it when you kill npcUFFFDs or other characters when it comes to industrial you donUFFFDt really have that feeling of UFFFDrewardUFFFDthere is also the point that a lot in the industrial side you have more risk than reward industrial ships are pretty much defenseless when it comes to being able to fight back when they are in the process of getting ganked and killed and they are scrammed and webbed it was also taken away a long while back the ability to use a pos remotely when it came to installing jobs you used to be able to start the jobs from the station and select a pos module so you didnUFFFDt have to risk your bpoUFFFDs by flying them out to the pos however that is no more as you have to place the bpUFFFDs inside the pos modules since that while itUFFFDs little things and i know ganking happens but with any other types of ships you have the ability to defend yourself and actually fight back it would be nice to see this on more industrial ships adding just an extra high slot to barges and exhumers would be nice in this case and would make a load of difference in my opinionwhat i would like to see especially on the mining side is to make it more interesting or exciting maybe adding some kind of UFFFDbonusUFFFD when you mine an asteroid out completely an idea that i have had for a bit is the idea that when you deplete an asteroid is that the fragments that are left over scatter around the belt and you can maybe find a extra ore pop up this is just a rough idea of something that i think would add something new to the mining pool and add something cool as a reward for mining out a rock completely like you get when you kill an npc or other player but i think if we could get more of these UFFFDlittleUFFFD things then it would make mining more UFFFDexcitingUFFFD and UFFFDfunUFFFD than tedious and boring thatUFFFDs just one of the ideas that i had for the industrial side of things another thing that i feel would be more storyline development which is something that i donUFFFDt feel is worked on very much i know we have had bits and pieces here and there but i would like to see something furthermission i feel could be also heavily improved on this is something that i had done heavily when i lived in highsec however over time it started to feel like no more than a grind i felt like i was in wow grinding some daily to get some gold isk reputation lp so i eventually stopped unless i was doing them with someone else when sisters of eve missions came out i was very heavy and active doing those as well however i fell into the same UFFFDgrindyUFFFD feeling as i did before so i eventually stopped doing those as wellUFFFDdamsel in distress needs you to save herUFFFD rolls eyes her again hasnt she learned by now canUFFFDt i just go there and blow her up for being a stupid moron she keeps getting herself in this mess let her get herself out of it geeze  i donUFFFDt know how many times i have done that mission but i think it shows that the mission are all so repetitive and there never seems to feel like there is any build up i would love to see more storyline driven missions and keep it freshbut in any case these are just some of the thoughts that i had and wanted to share i do feel that i am very well rounded in this game even with my playstyle mainly focusing on the industrial side of things i have also taken part of nearly every other aspect of the game as well and i think having that will come handinhand for someone being on the csm having more knowledge aside just from one area so i feel that i would be able to speak up for all aspects of eveand with that i think that is enough rambling and that is all that i have for right now i look forward to what this season holds and best of luck to the others runningthank you 3

so you turned up for sod all meetings what everwhy didnt you do a post for the csm yearly review

i sat down with sion kumitomo for a csm x interview
sionin that interview you claim that xander breached the csm nda on his podcast you also assert that ndad information makes its way to people in a nonpublic fashion which you discern through peoples posts and so forth thats a rather presumptuous claim to make given you lack anything really in the way of evidence do you feel that given that ccp arent keen on having people do that sort of thing and the fact xander is still a full member of the csm without incident your allegation is still true csm members have been ejected for far less than what you are accusing xander of and he remains on the csm your thoughts on that it certainly comes across as rumor mongering which is rather petty to do during a campaign which is rather sad to see you resort toalso protip you need a better mic the one you used is pretty bad and you should use the 30 it takes to get a better one unless of course you cant afford it
wow on one hand you are trying to discredit sion by sighting that you have some kind of inside understanding of what makes ccp trigger on csm ejection and then on the other hand you are trying to push him down even more by attaching his mic and possible income levelsince when was space ships about your income level
say what you like about that interview it was the most controversially listenable one yet and i include xenurias weirdfest in that
if you mean referring to ccps past treatment of problem children within the csm is having some kind of inside then sure i have intimate understanding of how the csm is handled by ccp also if you took the quip about his mic as an attack then you are very sensitive to internet forums endie is right it was a controversially listenable interview even without the mic issues please dont feel the need to rush to your alliance mates defense when he is asked for further clarification im sure hes fully capable and mature enough to respond on his own
yes i am rushing to the defence of my alliance mate o7
anyone whos read my posts knows that im not exactly sions greatest fan as a person he is to be frank an abrasive jerk as one myself i am qualified to say so and he applies the term to himself however he does have at least one of the two essential qualifiactions to be a good csm he cares about the game and he cares about the csm it doesnt matter tuppence whether id want to go drinking with him it matters if i think he will energetically and sincerely pursue ccp to address the issues that are important i am confident that he would if reelectedthe other qualification is to be an effective team player to avoid alienating people who are not required to use the csm as a resource and to demonstrate that the csm can be a professional cohesive team my confidence here is not quite so emphatic sion has been pretty clear about what he wants from ccp i hope that he will also realise that more will be required from him to earn that commitment from the devs and restore some of the bridges that have been  if not burned then he will surely admit pretty badly scorchedhes capable of it if he can redefine his style in his second term in this way i think he could be an extremely effective csm member and help turn csm x into something more useful than the current team
good idea so what we talking about 12 hours or 24 hours really need you to expand on this idea
cough
are you like 12get out
why because i realize often times csm members get mentioned in reviews and reports about eve and having a public figure for the game being named psychobitch might attract some unwarranted negativity towards eve in those casesand i was just bringing to a point aswell i have seen people with less offensive names get renamed by ccp for being against the toseula so was surprised one as blatant as ops was allowed
first i find your name offensive so please change it second please disconnect your internet third if you would be ever so kind stop
it is not afk isk generation when people have to form up and defend that rental space perhaps our rental program is vastly superior to the rest im not a huge fan or swaths of rental empires you would see these start to shrink if some things like structure notifications went away it is really easy to know your losing rental space when the very moment it is attacked you are notified of it no matter where you are in the game
only as a result of people adjusting to the changes since that initial shuffle to consolidate sovereignty things have been generally quiet i went from having around one capital fleet a day to one to two every two weeks
drop caps on targets closer
also a wonderful dancer
you said that would stay between us
what is your position regarding lnaw eves most illustrious corporation
i think cas mania should try harder in matching the rest of you when it comes to the family picture
what about big vs small organizations thingshould big ones be made somehow less mobile bureaucratic beacause there share size even if such thing is possible
1 for leaks and the tears it created
they already are running a coalition the size of the cfc or n3 is a gigantic amount of work and theres a hell of a lot of organisational friction
what i am not a fan of is that in order for the small organization to have any meaningful participation in null requires not just the blessing of the larger ones but having someone on staff who has an it background right now it is either join or die with no room in the middle for a variety of optionsim not implying a large organizations have it easy but the bar for entry into null should not require becoming part of a coalition or waiting until you have thousands of players to forcefully take a single system away from the large organization
what do you think the qualifying size ought to be
1 the active small group should qualify more than 0 the inactive large group

just a few questionswhy would this ship be shield tank rather than armor like every other soewhy would it come with defenses why not allow the ship to support a few t3s and finally give t3s the ability to resubsystem then actually allow the players to defend themselveswhat is the major ease of this vs the small pos discussed above why devote development resources to this rather than just allowing for a more fuel efficient xsmall poswhy soe vs ore it seems like an ore bsbcsize ship would probably fit this role better allow it to seige into a similar thing but with ore compression capability a modest fleet hangar array with repairrefit support sizable holds for specific raw materials such as ore raw gas etc something kind of like a rorqual lighttheres more to daytripping in wormholes than exploration might be interesting to give it a jumpbridge range limited to industrial types only to help get resources back into hisecpast gatecamps who knows maybe this will be the ore t3 battlecruiser but then again there is probably a dozen things that these capabilities would break
i would like to know if the nda is stifling andor narrowing out of game opinions from bloggers podcasters and other eve media personai would like the nda not to fall under the nda and like the csm white paper to be open to the publicso future csm candidates know what to expect between a future role as csm member and ccp games before signing the nda source
well as jester pointed out in his post the nda is under nda should it be public i dont see why not but its not my call or anyone on the csms call to make i can tell you that it doesnt restrict us from giving our opinions on things but it needs to kept in mind when talking about anything related to the csm many csm members will err on the side of caution since breaking the nda can have rl consequences above and beyond anything done in game
sorry mike but this is why you would probably never accept any suggestion i make i believe that the mere act of voting is a positive act worthy of a persons effort while you consider it a waste of time unless the vote results in helping someone achieve quota i actually think it is worse if you vote for a candidate you dont feel strongly about or even know much about than to cast a ballot that does not result in casting a vote for a winner but on the bright side if you look at the csm from a market research perspective the stv will get the most out of the limited sample that will select the members of the focus group
the supers have been part of the game for years and talks nerfs have all been done over the years no body rarely uses them unless they dont care to lose them from big fleet battle only big alliances have access to them which is great if you use them at this time i would have to agree with some of community members on a new look of how we use them in battle at this point i agree on few things which should be done it should not cost arm and leg to build them and rarely see them used i want would like too see them all goo boom more at less of the cost to build them heres how we can do this maybeall supers before patch will not be effectedall supers built after the patch75 reduce in hit points75 reduce in cost of building them allow them to dock in player own stationskeep them different add new concert too the superstitans  bring back new weapons then just dpspeople would like to see area of effect back lets add new ew types like etc drones become ununresponsive x mount of timesupers  lets add modular type of fighters or let us even fit them they cant be signedgoal here is too see more get built to go boom i would like them used just as much as other capitals jump in dye replace repeat as needed 
i can assure you that people do not want aoe dd back or do you think dropping one ship firing that and demolishing an entire fleet is good gameplayas for supers the ship you are describing is called a carrier as an aside what do you think would happen if someone with a fleet of these new supercaps would do if they got into a fight with a cfc n3 or pl fleet of current supers
nope super proliferation includes small alliances and even unaffiliated corpsi will take five of whatever it is youre smoking
its interesting to speculate upon but it just wouldnt affect the outcome even slightly abstaining from a candidate is the same as not putting them on your list
they have withdrawn 
the top 14 which the quiz gives are the ones closest and they are where my vote goes to cant remember the quiz name but gets reposted always near the time
proof
your pretty much a shoein for the wormhole vote the people respect you my question is that is there any other promising wormhole candidates i havent checked if asa is rerunning
1 will vote
glad to see you running again mikeone of the few that i see getting involved on a daily basis with the player base not like most that you never hear from between election campaignsmr epeen
every year someone from code decides to declare their candidacy and then ends up dropping outso tell us why we should bother reading this thread since it is likely a waste of time why should we take you seriously what can you offer us that this is not the yearly code election trollmr epeen
the main concern i have with your being in the csm would be that code seems to have a problem with respecting anything organized outside itself see last years atx so i would wonder if you would respect what the csm is and what it does based on the amount of time and effort in explaining what you believe in and all the responses i am somewhat convinced that you wouldnot saying i would vote for you but at least you seem serious about it
1 from methat being said can you highlight specific topics pertaining to the npe and actions you would like to take to address them are there any particular changes you are confident to implement with the empowerment of a csm member
1 from me when i joined grrka who belongs to naga and therefor to bni i got thrown into the meatgrinder of f9e with several hundreds of bni newbros in maulusUFFFDs and the most impressive part outside of all the pl supercaps was the morale of bni f
jayne simple question for you how would you go on about introducing more small gang into 00 warfare
1 will vote
jayne youre just a demagogue advocating for drastic changes and appealing to your npsi base and youre right npsi groups arent just pvp groups they are political entities that have their own motives i question if those motives are good for the game or notand to be honest the argument that npsi groups are different therefore there will be no political alliances is  poor at best i dont havr to imagine such a peversion of rwo social groups because they already exist in eve and in the real worldbut please continue to dodge the points im making and hide behind your im an fc in spectre noob stfu you dont know what youre talking about its time to deliberate about your proposals
im sorry to say that in light of todays discovery i am unsure that these qualities are present in you i was browsing through evekill zkills and eventually evewho and i found your page
i think he meant to say damnit khoid unfortuantely his tweet got lost in translation
youve made your point and ive told you that i dont agree restating it is neither going to help nor change my answer when neither of us has anything beyond our words and our opinions thankfully i have experience in these kinds of communities and you dont but its still my word against yoursalso of course im advocating for changes that are appealing to my npsi base that is the playstyle that i enjoy and the people who play eve in similar ways are the people that i specifically want to represent on the csm thats the point
what a strange questionthe tweet is certainly authentic which you could have easily verified
well it isnt about whispering sweet nothings in peoples ears its about maintaining your composure and not blowing your lid it just surprised me that is all i wonder what could illicit such an angry response toward that player not me i mean you dont need to be so defensive with me im simply not familiar with the issue
the story is long and honestly not worth discussing if youre truly interested in the backstory a check of our employment history and a read through of his articles on en24 should suffice
i sent a pm anyway back on topic in your vision for npsi will there be a chance for things similar to corp thefts and other fun shenanigans
in all honesty stop trying to swiftboat jaynethe whole drama affair was pretty much manufactured by seraph for a personal grudge
several good candidates this year ive got my eye on any updates to that hope of making regionsclusters of regions more self sufficient in terms of resource availibility for null or do you see the upgrades to wormholes as a viable replacement to the jfs of old as a tether to jita i only ask because that seems to be the normal means of moving goods to and from hisec nowas a relatively new 1 year player its kind of annoything that everytime i try and help the alliancecoalition im in with industryinventionproduction the answer is always its just easier to import it if you want to help train t2 haulers especially considering id like to be able to fund my roaming addiction with industry skills pi reasearch manufacturing rather than ratting or mining
i dont think jita is or should be the answer for nullsec i think local industry and production as a means of supply is much better think about it if you will a few nullsec guys running back and forth to jita doesnt offer much in the way of meaningful gameplay however sourcing and producing locally would have many more people in space doing things those activities are buds for conflict drivers reasons for people to come and raid those people or interfere with their activities which gives meaningful reasons for defense  patrol fleets if it were my call id nuke the jf and give it the same fatigue and cooldown as other caps UFFFD
thanks for the interview
oh my glob yes take my vote mister ravinnehe is pretty spot on with the changes that need to happen with the npe and how to make exploration better for everyone now this is a candidate relevant to my interests

i would like it so that over all mining yield is nerfed but in return we have some sort of mini game thats actually fun and winning that game gets you more yield than what we currently have this way its actually fun to be active while mining and you get rewarded for itmaybe im crazy but i love doing relic and data sites
bump thread receive conflag
unless active version comes with some added perk that has direct implication on just simple resource grabbing mechanism in either way the idea isnt to maintain the status quo of the market but rather to make sure that active mining is able to compete with an army of bots at which points yes chances are they will be on equal footing in terms of raw market impact but the difference is taht a newbro flying a venture actively mining might be able to keep up with 2 botted accounts afkmining also migui 1
vote for migui 1

hello capsuleerswe the cast of the cap stable podcast have been busy these past couple of months recording candidate interviews so that the community can make an informed decision on who they want to choose to represent their interests on the council of stellar management xyou can listen to the candidates individual interviews on our dedicated csmx page
oh no apparently i sound terrible on that podcast oh well thanks for the interview guys edit are the five in the selection banner your top choices
looks nice thanks for putting this together
great job i will make this thread sticky 
those are the five most recent interviews
as a tru elite pvper gorski is my manpls advocate the introduction of faction tracking disruptors and i will vote u kthxim shocked about xenuria postings tho gorski ur very bad
edit apologies to xander because i somehow always confuse xander and dj funkybacon
just listened to your capstable interview on the way to work you come across as being very professional and well balanced unlike some of the other candidates they have interviewedi think endie and yourself will be a great team working for the good of the game
in your interview on cap stable you mentioned that you feel the csm is a meta game entity can you elaborate on that more and without breaking nda give some examples
thanks for bringing up an excellent point on the need for greater transparency and visibility into the csm protocols do not currently exist to allow csm members to truly hold each other accountable or for the voting public to hold their elected representatives accountable so it can indeed come off as rumor mongering this is something im going to attempt to tackle next term should i be elected again as is i entirely understand your reticence and am sympathetic as to how it could appear to be petty with any luck this will not be an issue next year pending some badly needed reform actions the closed door nature of the csm ill serves the purpose of the institution from one jerk to another i consider it high praise where you see the most of me is in alumni though which i explicitly rope off for trolling i couldnt run a team of diplomats seventy directors or any of the other peoplecentric organizations i run if that was my normal mode of interaction with people its a matter of definitions though metagame has evolved in eve into a verb i got metagamed they metagamed me it was originally used as noun used to refer to actions taken beyond the ruleset of a game that had potential impacts on said game an elected space council meeting in real life and shelving their space persona to talk about business game implications rules and other such is thus by definition a metagame entity this is distinct from the csm is metagaming players which is both a misunderstanding of term usage and patently false
solid response
when you say that protocols do not allow for csm members to truly hold each other accountable what do you mean an internal reporting system or something similar what would you publicly say the csm should do to be more open under your ideal settingshow would you suggest the voting public be enabled to hold a csm accountable a formalized body that runs as a check  balance of the csm a more structured process outside of voting a year after a csm has more or less been deadweight the only real example i can cite recently of the public holding a csm member accountable for their actions was when major j silva got outed for account sharing which saw him ejected from the csm

hello there wormholers of eve onlinei am bane cortex a long time wormholer and player of eve i am looking to becoming part of csm x the main focus of my campaign is to solely aid ccp in the further development of wormhole content and mechanics there are a few things i would like to focus on if i were to become part of csm x would be as follows anomaly mechanicsin relation to anomaly mechanics there are a few things i would like to look over there is a definable issues for corps living in whs mostly c5s with the randomness of the spawning of lowsec entrances to holes this make corps living in these worm holes have to go through great wait times to be able to get to any content along with that being said there is also a large latency with spawn times on combat sites as well i bring these points to the tables solely to aid in the creation of more content for players home content should be as important as static content balance wormhole effecti would like to point out black holes and cataclysmic variables at this point these along with some effect make certain wormholes undesirable this is forcing corps that want to so content into wormholes where they may require more ships or skills in order to create content the effects on wormholes should be more even across the board to make it so there are no wormholes left out creating more content for players make wormholes more accessible for new playersthis strongly follows suit with the last two points i made there is a strong need for content to be explored more and possible have more mechanics made so there is more interest in wormholes for new players wormholes are a great part of eve online and every new player should be able to explore then refine corporate interface  ie bookmark issuesi know there is a corp management page updating coming but there has always been a large issue with having multiple corps in the same hole it is understandable that ccp may only want one corp to a hole but there is being looked over and there should be accommodations made so multiple corps can coexist in a single wormhole under the same alliance lower class wormhole contentthere has always been an issue with the skill gaps between wormhole class levels with that being said i would like to look into ways to ease the transfer of players through the levels of whs so they can get a chance to see the entire content this game offers as is stand c13 wormholes are excellent for starting up wormholes corporations they provide decent content but do not allow the number of sites and isk require to fuel poses in these hole so new corporations can get a foothold on low class wormhole space i would like to see c1c2 and c3 whs be viable content for players more wormhole systemsi know over the years there have been additions of more whs but i would like to see a steady increase in the number of wormholes as the player base for wh rises as it stands it can be a very tasking and difficult process for a corpotation to fine an empty wormholes to live in fix ore sitesthe creation of more ore sites for wormholes would be a great addition for eve online and would allow there to be a larger player base for doing wormhole mining i do believe that mining minerals in a wormhole should be more viable than it currently isthe list goes on for potential ideas personally i feel wormholes and wormholers make up a critical part of eve online they do require more attention and i would like to do this for us allfeel free to reply with question i will gladly reply
care to expand on them a bitid love to hear your ideas and reasoning behind each of those points
ok a few questionsmy campaign is to solely aid ccp in the further development of wormhole content and mechanicsdo other eve players not matteryour platform anomaly mechanics what is this balance wormhole effect check the hyperion change log please what needs balancing after that make wormholes more accessible for new players isnt this what low class holes are for ccp has made scanning etc far easier already too or do you want to put gates in for them to come in refine wormhole mechanics how so what mechanics again too vague for me to have feelings for  consistence of context for wh players isnt rolling our solution we do it pretty good no content make a new chain please specify refine corporate interface  ie bookmark issues would be nicer if it was more user friendly not sure what you would want changed exactly though lower class wormhole content remove it or add more and how and why make c1s viable content they seem to be inhabited so it must be viable not sure what you are getting at ps blue loot for their sites went up in value more wormhole systems specific finally and completely against this already added shattered holes and enough empty systems around already fix ore sites again how if this is the make them need scanning down bandwagon of early 2014 iirc please given reasons i still see as many miners in wspace as i did before the changes 1 or 2 rarely per fortnighttldr care to be more specific seemed like throwing anything there for the sake of it with no clarification and some points calling for change but not specifying how cant decided if its positive or negative without knowing what you wantregards and good luck with the campaign o7
welcome bane it is good to see another candidate with the time and commitment willing to spend the effort required to represent the wormhole communityi as many of us are very interested to see just what you have in mind the core ideas are sound but as they say the devil is in the detailplease give us the opportunity to support you by expanding on the points you raise we do need more to go on than just a few points from the wormhole little things threadi suggest you reach out to corbexx he has been a masterful csm and a good example to follow if you can convince him of your merit and have his support you will gain many supporters he has earned the respect of the wide community and if you can match his efforts insight and communication abilities you will also prove a worthy candidategood luck and i for one will watch with great interest
i dont mean to be probing but something seems a little off some more indepth explanation would be good but i have some concernszero posts on the forumwhat seems like 0 wormhole experiencejust left sniggwaffle been in and out of themjust started a alt corp for yourself claiming wormholes your corps been around for 3 days your the ceo with 1 other guy in itsomething doesnt pass the smell test ill edit or remove this if more information from the candidate arises everybody deserves a fair shot
if i had to guess id say he wants in on the csm and thinks wormholes will be the easiest category to challenge
i will be adding to the post later today a expanded version of each point i posted originally also i am not picking wormholes because they are easy i picked wormholes because i have almost solely been living in wormholes since their inception i feel this is my strong suit in eve and i think there is room for improvement in this aspect of the game
the corp i am in currently in part of a wh alliance bust almost every corp for the past few years that iv been involved with aside from sniggwaffe has been in whs
thats cool but i still cant put some of your history together one of the first things people look at is the kill board this month catch last month nullsec more nullsec and more nullsec the most ive seen out of the kill board regarding wormholes outside of what seems like a 6th month long layoff happens to everybody is a vargur and a mack in w space that and your loss of a guardian to a bomber  i would love to hear the backstory on that one you seem to be primarily nullsec now to be a wormhole candidate doesnt mean you can never leave wormhole space but it seems like you havent sacrificed to bob enough to really be put on the pedestal of a wormholer if i am wrong here please let me know i have no issues with correcting my above assertions now if you are a guardian pilot i can get why the kill board looks like that fly logi myself but lets get past the conspiracy theory for a moment is there any wormholer you know in your corp or alliance who can speak to your character play style personality while i may seem a bit skeptical we really dont know who you are at all what makes you want to be a wormhole csm candidate what are your opinions on the previous and current wormhole csms that being corbexx asayamami dei two step james arget chitsa jason have you spoken with any of them regarding their experiences future or past changes etc
my name is bhock and i am one of the contributors of the capstable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
i fully endorse pantsufanhe was a brilliant leader of bungle battlement coalitionhe has experience with dealing with the fallout of being scamedhes got extensive experience renting and the consequences of failing to pay rent to landlord allianceshe has intimate knowledge of what causes fail cascades having had 2 fail cascades occur under his leadershiphes extremely understanding of his players needs thus why he insists they not rat without an fc to keep them safei fully endorse him for csm because i feel that ccp completely deserves to deal with him after foisting phoebe on usno bastard ever won a war by dying for his country he won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country
i endorse pantsufans candidacy for running for csmi look forward to actually being interested in reading the minutes of csm x if he wins should be full material that will lead to enlightening discussions about eve
i fully support pants and xenuria for csm under their tenure surely rise and fozzie will pull their hair out move onto riot and we can get some ship balance that isnt centered around drones or 5 man low sec gangs

would you qualify goonswarm federation as a large active or inactive group
if i had to pick one considering their size in membership i would lean on inactive this of course fluctuates depending on the time of year and what is happening in game
lnaw endorses marlona sky victory is assured
hello marlonawhat do you think should the balance be between ease of livingqol and the ability for organizations to leverage the same mechanics on the strategic levelfor example jump drivesbridges allow players to move quickly between points this can be used by individual players to bring their nullsec good to highsec for sale for courier groups to make deliveries and of course for massive supercapital fleets to smash many different targets across many regions or used tousing that for an example jump fatigue both limited power projection and made it slowermore expensive to live in sov null its generally agreed that this is a good change and the collateral damage to residents was well worth it is there a balance point where changes to mechanics use in sovwars would impact daytoday life too much to be worthwhileon a related note how big should the homefield advantage be for defenders of sov on a grand scale on a tactical fleet fight scale on a roaming scale
this is a really good question at the current state of null industry in regards to gathering resources within null it is dire the good news is ccp recognizes that right now null depends on jita as much as it would like to walk away it cant that is why industry related ships like haulers freighters and such have a nice 90 bonus to jump fatigue it means they can still perform the necessary trips to and from jita to supply their efforts in nullonce ccp is able to revamp industry side of gathering local resources to a level that makes sense then such a bonus can be removed as it is no longer needed i know moon goo is one of those things that is shipped to high sec and sold as an export but i feel like that needs to be expanded upon even parts of low sec and maybe even high sec could have some things worthy fighting for and controlling such things could then be shipped into null at the same time it should be possible to find such items in other parts of the game but no where near the occurrence in its native regionthere is near infinite possibilities that can be done to make null space very desirable while at the same time not making it 100 selfsufficient trade is very important and creates opportunitys for conflictas far as taking something too far the answer of course is yes this goes for everything in the game you have to find that balance for any new mechanic or revamped one having several options as slider where ccp can easily make small adjustments here and there that is capable of evolving with the meta and player population jump fatigue has several sliders that can be adjusted as i have said before as long as we get a sov system that is occupancy based one that is not dependent on grinding structures and immediately notifying afk empires their system is under attack the jump fatigue will feel a lot betterright now everyone flocks to basically one major war front because anyone outside of a major coalition trying to take anything sends out a structure notification instantly the defending coalition has an insane amount of time to mount a defense and repel the nonbloc force that is trying to take just one system if having sov meant an alliance actually had to utilize the system at some capacity outside of stabbing a tower on a r64  then we would see blocs and alliances begin to spread out across their territory if they didnt then their territory would shrink due to it being nibbled away at by groups at the bordersand very important is it should not just be profitable to be active in these systems but should be enjoyable to do so players do whatever it takes to have fun even if it means taking gates for 7 hours with capital ships to deploy to where the content is the strain on their jump fatigue is soul crushing but if the fun was only a handful of jumps away you would not be stressing the jump fatigue left and right there simply is no reason to cross regions at a time in a couple minutes to find what you are looking for when it is simply next doorthen we finally have a dozen or so different brush fire wars in null conflict spread across many many server clusters which of course means far less tidi of course this does not bode well for those who like to sit on a throne having 40000 players at their beck and call after all  why would anyone follow someone who is in no position to aid them from the other side of the map more leaders more blood in null more conflict more pew pewjump fatigue offers a huge home field advantage while the invaders are having to slowly trudge their capital ships across systems to get to your front door your capitals are already there some people complain that their capitals and supers were nerfed with jump fatigue but they are looking at the glass half empty as a defender using such toys you can use them with the confidence that you will not be hot dropped by everyone and their brother from all four corners of the map in a couple minutes this home field advantage scales up the larger the entity that inhabits the space obviously of course the more people you pack into one part of your territory the more open you leave the rest for another group to start another front where you dont have your heavy hitters you will need to balance your forces out between ensuring a successful defense of a system and maintaining control of the restbut capitals already on home defense under jump fatigue should not be the only thing out there that falls under home field advantage it could be something wild like deciding how you want a grid to function in regards to effects similar to unknown space perhaps the ability to lay mines because your alliance has sov again near endless possibilities but it should never be so over the top that opting to blue ball is the best option and you hope the invaders give up
in the end defenders should want to fight even outnumbered and or outgunned there should always be a way to engage the enemy at some capacity even if you still lose bombers originally or so i thought were meant to be a tool for those outnumbered had something to fight back when massively outnumbered but it just turned into another tool for the large blocs to use to oppress small nonbloc entitieswhile there should be different things that fall under home field advantage nothing should ever enable afk empires if they are not there using the space there should be nothing for them to use to keep a very small group even just a corp of 5 pilots from taking it from them without them knowing about ituse it or lose it
ive restored a couple of posts into this thread and edited a few morewhile criticism is fine keep away from personal attacks or your posteriors will be handed to you under the forum ruleskeep it clean and civil peopleccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
are you sure you want to take on the responsibility of a csm from what i understand they tend to lose allot of playtime ingamestill you would be an excellent candidate
i am perfectly fine with this
marlonaive really enjoyed your blog your substantive posts on the forums and way back when your flight of a thousand rifters that was one of my first large fleet fights i experienced as a new player and one of the only events i didnt die immediately in so thanks 1i guess my main concerns for every csm candidate are whether they will be able to 1 stay professional and 2 devote enough irl time to the job both of which seem to be fairly difficult based on pastcurrent csm history
that was an amazing time i think everyone should do it at least once glad you had a great experience coming into the game be sure to checkout scott manleys video about it there have been some who have been elected with a misconception that it was just a free trip to fanfest epeen competition easy work or something else entirely so when they leave the csm early or at the end of their term they tend to lash out openly that it turned out to be real work from what i have gathered you get out of the csm what you put into it i plan on putting a lot into itif it becomes obvious i am having zero positive effect then i have no issue with stepping down and letting another person try a different angle i want what is best for the game and the players  even if it means having someone else on the csm instead of me to get that job done
the potential that i see here is for a fob that is not directly tied to a moon i like the idea of being able to set up shop in the deep black rather than attached to a celestial in sovereignty systems this would allow for more covert action as the sov holder wouldnt receive the announcement that someone had anchored a pos at one of their moons also the ability to tear down and redeploy at a moments notice would be a game changer for small corps like mine with limited manpower not everyone can have an army of alts at their command everything i do i do on my mainedit i do agree that this makes more sense as an ore vessel than soe
the concept of a deep space fob was exactly what i was going for have a scanner set up a safe and deploy this ship to operate from for a few people i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the nda can cause an altered mind set meaning a blogger podcaster or other eve media personality was about to comment on a topic but then either has to refrain or reword or alter hisher opinion entirely that heshe had in mind sometimes this can be a good thing though i often type a reply or view and leave it there not hitting enter coming back later to look at the meaningwording and if it conveys the message properlyfor your example not bringing up confluence because you assumed that particular site itself was ndasource
the actual contents of the nda are pretty much trivialdont talk about things which ccp talked with you about but hasnt oked you to talk aboutas you might expect
after a while it can get kind of hard to remember where you heard things from
which is why you err on the side of caution if not 100 sure you got info from someplace public dont talk about it
ndas themselves are fairly boilerplate legal documents i havent seen ccps nda for the csm but i can fairly guess what the provisions of the csm nda are very likely unless theres a provision about the wearing of underwear during all times while communicating with the csm and ccp the provisions of the nda are standard for any techgaming entitythat all being said i sincerely doubt ccp would alter their nda even if it was made public and members of the community started having hissyfits about certain provisions its a legal document not a guide or a public accounting statement
no i agree voting is always better than not voting i just like to see it have the most effect but i agree that voting is good periodmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

just some advice for csm xi be more active in the community at large youre not seen much on the forums and most people ingame wouldnt even know who you are as far as notable occurences go i think the only community related event of note was someone being pissed enough at you to vandalize the monument which prospective voters would only take away as you having done something to  people offso its a little late for rep building csm x is lost for csm xi should you choose to run i say you should wander a bit outside your constituency and provide a little for the playerbase maybe start up another npsi group those are becoming popular again or maybe organize players to make a new lowsec block or hell make a highsec industry empire for all i carebottom line is if you want a chance of election for csm xi you have to be more public with yourself and a little more friendly with people who share opposing or even differing viewsyes nullsec blocs get people elected by mass voting because their leadership tells them who to vote for that may seem unfair but realize that the number of people who follow their word willingly to the letter says something about their personality and leadership qualities within the community making political results from their choices completely valid and ok theres is the power of community backing and of social status youre going to need to work on those skills to make it in any electionedit some spelling errors were bugging me
if you think the csm is a popularity contest that requires the grinding of rep maybe your playing the wrong mmo
you really are something its almost like you are proud of how little you know and desire to shout it from rooftopsbefore you run and fail next time id suggest that you before even starting your campaign studies the election process a little that will ensure that you dont trip yourself over claims that goons or other null sec entities have placed you lowest on their ballot list and this is somehow to your disadvantage you can also collect evidence for other points so when you claim that soandso percentages of your constituency is female you actually can show that to be true and not as we all know an illusion youve made up all on your ownyou might also before you run evaluate whether you want to scream foul when the candidate with many votes win over the candidate with close to no votes as a joke candidate im not sure you can grasp the finer details but the general gist of any voting process is to determine which candidate has the biggest support among the voting population for null sec candidates that support is huge and comparatively larger than other groups due to what seems to be a voting null sec and a scarcely voting high sec for you that support is close to nilso why is that well it can be for a number of issues one is that somewhat like parties in real life the null sec candidates have established bases behind them people who trusts the leadership enough to assume that whatever candidate they found is the right candidate you also have organisations that holds various forms of rallies remind their members to vote and make the process easy you also have a generally higher quality with null sec candidates who are selected for their eloquency apparent intelligence diplomacy or competence in many other areas with some candidates their competence and their reputation outside their own small group is what gave them enough votes to be succesful in their bid for electionobviously these are both structural and personal assets that you dont have or are unlikely to havethen you have further problems such as your gaffe with yt videos that one time you ran or the lulzsec hacking association and posts in here where many of your claims are unfounded and the rest are insignificant or simply the product of someone elses success and your lack thereofso for many good reasons the easiest way for you to get elected is to buy secondary accounts and vote for yourself with them or to change character style platform constituency and much more and hope none recognises your name both of these options are possible for csm 11
are you familiar with the term selfcaricature
popularity contest i do believe it is indeed a massvoter based system and yes if i recall these systems rely on voter recognition the key to which is being recognized positively by the voters which does indeed require you to interact in constructive and bondbuilding ways with the greater community outside your 100person constituencyso yeah you gotta grind rep just like the mittanni had to just like seraph had to just like twostep had to etc etc etc
the csm is not something you can twist and bend to fit your argument everything you have said is not only incongruous but humorous when stripped of bias i again suggest that you play a different mmo if grinding is your thing
please elaborate for me enlighten me where did i go wrong in saying the csm elections were popularity based and that past winners actually had to work for their reputation before they were elected tell me exactly how either of those statements is false
thank you capstablenet

i advised you about some of your corp having xenophobic comments in bios due to you going for the csm your response was to wardec my 1 man corp and block communications from me with the above comment end of discussion and you talk too muchwould you say having a xenophobic tendency or allowing it in your corpalliance puts you in a good position to be a csm candidate as a lot of eve players may find that objectionable
1 for bamthe difference between bam and everyone else isbam doesnt have to make promises about what he will do for eve players in a future that has not happenedhe can just point to the past and show what he has already done for eve players
bam has my vote and endorsement he is without doubt one of the shining pillars of the au eve community you can kiss my babies anytime bam
1 i know first hand how much work he puts into the csm had him message me asking opinions on certain things and has always been reachable for when i had concerns definitely the sort of person you want all csm members to aspire to be like
was reading the csm minutes and just saw this part corbexx asked about sites from different classes spawning in a given class of wormhole for examplecould you have a c5 site occasionally spawn in a c2 hole and the other way around fozzie said thatwith the new distribution system the way site spawns can change and the csm discussed whether thiswould be good or confusing the general consensus was that it would be fine as players would look upthe different sitesmajor 1 on that idea corbexxfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information

thanksmerci we have seen visible influence like input broadcasting be banned as it was ridiculous to see whole fleets manned by only one player this was visible the community condemned it and ccp actedi am afraid that a few power players with a lot of ingame or out of game money affect the game for everyone else in a much less visible way by using large number of accounts rigging some parts of the game to their profitone simple example is afk cloakers i play solo and i need all the few alts i can pay subscription for to generate my ingame isk sometime when times are good i can pay for those alts with isk but i do need all my alts to be doing what they need to produce ingame i cant spare an alt for days in a remote system staying cloaky in order to paralyse activity there only rich players can afford cloaky campers alts as they do not produce anything for them directly but they are influencing the game with very little risk and a lot of isk this is just but one example of the potential influence multiple nonproducing alts can wieldhaving all alts public from a change of the eula will make this influence more visible and put a risk on the players that would chose to keep their alt anonymous to influence the game nous avons vu une influence visble comme la rUFFFDplication de touches UFFFDtre bannie puisquil UFFFDtait ridicule quun seul joueur puisse contrUFFFDller des flottes entiUFFFDres cUFFFDtait une influence visible la communautUFFFD la condamnUFFFD et ccp a agitje crains quun petit groupe de joueurs puissants et riches affectent le jeu dune manUFFFDre beaucoups moins visible en utilisant un grand nombre dalts anonymes et en manipulant certains aspects du jeu UFFFD leur profitun example simple est le cloaky afkje joue solo et jai besoin de chacun des alts dont je peux payer labonnement pour gUFFFDnUFFFDrer mes isk en jeu parfois dans les bonnes pUFFFDriodes je peux payer ces alts avec des isks mais jai besoin de chacun dentre eux pour faire le nUFFFDcessaire et produire en jeu je ne peux pas avoir un alt qui ne participe pas UFFFD ma production et lenvoyer par exemple rester cloaky dans un systUFFFDme lointain pour y paralyser lactivitUFFFD seuls les joueurs les plus riches peuvent se permettre de placer des alts cloaky qui ne produiront rien directement mais ils influencent le jeu sans grands risques et avec beaucoups disk cest juste un des types dinfluence que de nombreux alts nonproductifs peuvent crUFFFDerrendre tous les alts publics parun changement des termes et conditions rendrait cette influence par un petit groupe de joueurs riches plus visible et introduirait un risque pour ceux qui voudraient continuer UFFFD influencer le jeu par le biais dalts anonymes

answering thesewe actually did discuss the question within code do we want to take csm seriously or field a joke candidatei argued for taking it seriously the at doesnt shape eve in any way so i didnt mind us not taking it seriously although i wasnt involved in the decision some people thought our antics there were hilarious some thought they were childish the actual story was that we missed the deadline to get higher skillpoint code supporters like myself that were not formally part of the alliance into the alliance and so the team we had to field was basically unable to compete to win they couldnt deal with opponents tanking against kintherm damagewe could lose graciously or we could bet against ourselves and lose like trollson the csm however its been a real issue that there isnt anyone on the body that understands the highsec predator gameplay mechanics well and there also do not seem to be people that understand how riskreward balance changes in highsec can alter the balance of other regions of space for example the tiamat antiawoxing changes will result in increased safety for the more careless highsec miners this will lead to an increased mexallon supply gamewide and hence an increase in supercapital proliferation a change aimed at highsec that has only tangential direct impact on lowsec will end up having significant indirect impacts on sovereign nullsec its a bad thing for the game that the current csm is comprised of mostly people that either do not understand this or do not carein this situation it was easy enough for me to defeat the arguments of a couple of people who will not be named that wanted a joke candidate i dont believe anyone in code still supports treating the csm as a joke  this was wrong i still feel the impact of the at is minor
this sort of displays a lack of understanding of the organic nature of the sandbox which is surprising considering some of your other statements theres plenty of ways the at effects new edenafits and comps used in the tournament can trickle into usage bthe market surely is at least somewhat impacted by so many teams scrambling to pay the entry feecat ships weave their lossmails into the rich storied canvas of new eden dalliance structures may shift in response to be qualified which in turn may result in meeting and interacting with people you wouldnt have normally which obviously can have a big impact on the way you play the gameeteams that do well generally have much more street cred than teams that run away like scared children which impacts all sorts of things is this fit good is this a gang i should run away from again i would at least think twice about engaging a camel empire pilot but a code pilot the butterfly effect does not just stop because you want to partition the at from new eden
i accept your correction
um ugh okay while its nice to see code actually taking something that isnt ganking seriously for once this sort of offends meso firsties ive taken to importing minerals to deklein because someones gotta do it i have zero issues getting huge quantities of compressed mexallon bearing ores and my largest buyers are our supercap producers the ones that supply themselves also have no trouble just an anecdotesecond some hard data
the null sec part is under heavy nda my piece on summit for eve4 is nda checked by ccp today so i hope it to go up if you get excited by me is a thign you shoudl decide i am on comms 350 days a year always answering csm questions my mail twitter and personal convoys are also always open also cva forums hold updates on csm or my allaince its true i am no media attention freak judging by the votes i think i represent provi very well but rateht then to defend my self feel free to chat me up one on one rateht then a forum where peopel UFFFDlways will find a stick to throw atm i wrote my ccp internal first rea tion on sov making eve 24 peice lining upcap stabel and a csminterview just got back from week with ccp seing fanfest already on horizon plenty of stuff to be busy with if u doubtfull i presesent you well what woudl u thinks better convoy me and chat with me or post it in here i can also quote a post of a fewllow csm member of goons who says how he sees my csm term but in the end u make your own judgement or run for yourself by all means
swiftboat im not familiar with the term i did not mean to stumble into something i was not suppose to know about i didnt mean any offense
its an american colloquialism for a political attackfrom wikipediathat tweet has a fair bit of context during the csm 9 campaign jaynes target in the tweet put out a lengthy accusation claiming that jayne violated the eulatos while metagaming because of how jayne implied he was someone else while using an alt character the piece called jayne unfit for the csm due to this behavio the supposed violation of the eulatos appears given jaynes consistent activity over the past year to have been ignored by ccp as a whole it was also the author of that article who used the situation to troll and throw out personal attacks towards jayne in his first csm 9 thread which caused the isd to lock it when jayne opened his second csm 9 thread that same behavior continued by this person with isd removing the posts for numerous rules violations this context is useful in understanding what would prompt jayne to create that tweet it has been roughly a year if not longer that jayne has had this single person obsessed with defaming him this is the same person who supports doxxing of peoples real life information since its hard to determine if you were being sincere or not with that string of questions pertaining to the tweet ill err on the side of optimism and say that you were simply unaware of the context simply put to take that one tweet and ignore the years worth at a minimum of context and say jayne isnt capable of composure is a fallacy

a n00bie only zone could also create unrealistic expectations and a false sense of security the rest of your platform is good
mannyhow you you like to see supercapstitans balanced and their future role in the game
im still interested in whether this is what you were trying to say
these things fall somewhat outside my platform but here are my thoughtshisec in generalin general i really like hisec i know that may sound strange but for me it is the only area of eve that always feels like an mmo it feels vibrant and alive with people who will respond to you in local instead of fretting over opsec you can see interesting ships pass by and not  your pants worrying they will yellowbox youwardecs and gankingi dont have a problem with ganking bumping or wardecking in concept these are all things allowed in the sandbox however i think the options available to the victims of these acts are poor especially with wardecs there is something wrong with a system when the best solution to an entity wardecking you is to quit playing the game or dissolving and reforming your corporation primarily there is no fiscal incentive for most victim corps to fight out a war so giving up is usually the least fiscally damaging optionas far as suicide ganking the best suggestion ive heard not mine obviously was to change how security status affects you that dropping negative will very quickly give you a suspect timer because yes ganking people constantly is suspicious this makes it so that ganking is still just as possible as it is now but one cannot cruise around with impunity until the millisecond before turning on his modulescloaky campingi rely hugely on cloaky camping for my activities so i have a lot of experience there on the one hand i think 90 of players overreact to having a single neutral in system they imagine the worst and are paralyzed with fear heavens forbid they lose a single ishtar on the other hand there should be some kind of counter to longterm cloaking what about a deployable structure that disables cloaking within x au around it but requires active anchoring ie you must sit at it to anchor it something like this could force the cloakys hand especially within a set area and time frame but it also requires the launcher to correctly guess the campers intentions and also limits their own option to cloakultimately i think cloaky camping should be addressed but i dont believe it is a gameruining problem that should be prioritized over other more important matterseve changesas far as changes to the game so far what time frame do you mean because there is a big difference between changes in the last six months versus alltime changes to eve
a deployable wouldnt work if you were to deal with perma cloakies it would have to be a ship or a module on a ship give the players the ability to hunt cloaked people while that would benefit the nullsec camp it would mess up a good hunk of wormhole space heck well have people inside a enemy hole for months watching their movements trying to capitalize on what they dogiving them a defensive module that would destroy the scouts ability to scout what effects one area of space effects all areas of space some with benefit some with negatives just be careful with what you may ask for because it may wreck a different area of gameplayfyi good email to the corp last week keep up the good work we need actual happy players out there
i support this product or servicebut chance how can you honestly say that changes like the addition of the jump fatigue mechanic have had no effect on eve gameplay while it may have little effect on highsec denizens and players without the need or skill to use capitals it certainly does affect basically all of nullsec especially the blocs
lets go with since you started playing what changes have you liked what have you not liked
sorry not sure where you thought i said anything like that you quoted me asking which changes someone wanted me to comment on indubitably jump changes have affected eve i think only a fool would dispute that
i somehow misread what youd written i blame it on the cold medicine disregardi still support chance for csm x
you have my vote the failed high sec antimatter delivery was hilariousim also surprised to see my sec status suggestion mentioned on your platform ofounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
whoop whoop more eve radio at csmtotally agree with your industrial views mining is totally boring and the so called high sec is alot more dangerous than mining in null or even low in my opinionindustry needs to get more exciting or atleast not as boring as it currently is to be a feasable gameplay optionyou have my vote and i am looking forward to see what you will do and change in the csm x
daww thank you 3 much love and dont you know it not too keen on the idea of nerfing the mining yield to be honest but i do like the idea of a mini game maybe a scanable like datarelic sites belt that has sections that you have to crack to actually get the ore in therethat would be interesting i think indeed highsec can definitely be very dangerous i have actually felt safer since moving to null and mining i agree therethanks so much for the support
erika my sweet you deffo have my vote you can pay me back at evevegas 15
aww thank you orvis and most def you know i will be there ive been ready for eve vegas 15 when the last one was over hehe
keep it up erika hoping to buy you and orv a drink in vegas
you definitely have my vote erika not only do you know the game you are a team player which is what eve online is all aboutgo erikahugs
aww thanks 3 and yes you must we will all have a drink together cay hugs thanks so much girl 3
you know i might just vote for you
they say that the csm is the last stop before some players bail on eve you wont bail after your terms will you cause i like your podacst too much to vote you out of evealso what do you make of the funky bacon mess
both of those are excelent questions and neither deserve an answer i can form at 1am with a drink or two in me i will try to put out a full answer tomorrow for now i will leave you with my tweet
ok now that i have collected some thoughts about this let me try to tackle these issues ultimately my love for eve is less about eve the game and more about eve thepeoplewhoplaythiscrazygame i donUFFFDt expect my attendance on csm to change my opinion of the eve community dramatically or stop me from thinking of new things i would like to do to engage in it while i can say nothing now that will prove how i will feel in a year i have no intent that this will be the pinnacle of my eve life a lot of podcastersbloggers have become csm members in the past with various amounts of success however i think that most that have made this transition were of the UFFFDopinionUFFFD type i tend to try to be a more UFFFDinformativeUFFFD public personality not that i am short on opinions  what i can say to you is that if it does turn out that being on the csm begins to conflict with my enjoyment of eve or my enjoyment of making content for you i will simply not run again as for the funky bacon post i think this is more telling about his expectations for the csm than how the csm actually operates there are plenty of people who i have known who are part of the csm and are happy with the collaboration they have with ccp while the csmccp relationship is by no means ideal it is trending in the right direction design and development for a game like eve are enormously complicated if you go into the csm thinking you will get your way because of the will of the voters you are looking for disappointment i am looking to help wherever i can because letUFFFDs be frank this is an amazing game and being part of the csm is an amazing opportunity while i would love to see some of my visions come to life in eve i am not so naive to expect ccp to bend over backwards to do so i want to make things better not show off how great i am
helloiUFFFDm thoric frosthammer i am currently the chairman of get off my lawn a founding alliance of the cfc coalition and iUFFFDm running for csm x i began playing eve in 2004 took a break came back with a new set of characters and have been playing with some interruptions since 2006 there is very little of eve i havenUFFFDt seen i started in hisec moved to nullsec to join friends in ascn down in feythabolis and have since spent time in virtually every region of nullsec with several nullsec alliances large and small there are very few things in eve i havenUFFFDt tried iUFFFDve been a miner a pos farmer a pvpUFFFDer a mission runner a wormholer an industrialist and most recently a market manipulator i have served as a director of many corporations i have run spies and scams my main focus at the moment has been guiding the unique group of folks known as lawn in helping anchor our portion of the cfc in fountain and i have become deeply familiar with nullsec politics sov warfare and sov holding i have been around for some of the biggest wars and battles in null history from the first titan loss all the way to br i have watched eve grow as a game and as a social experimentmy breadth of experience which includes everything from line membership to top level alliance leadership hisec to nullsec has given me both a deep appreciation for the remarkable achievement that is eve and some deep skepticism about the directions that ccp is currently taking i hope to join some of the other cfc representatives in pushing ccp harder to listen to the players that are at the root of eveUFFFDs successbecause i believe that eve at heart is about social structures i am deeply concerned about a few issuesfirst attention needs to be paid to bringing new players into the game and keeping them here that doesnUFFFDt necessarily mean dumbing it down or making it easier what keeps them in game from years of introducing new players to eve is immediate access to a social network players who become enmeshed in a group of friends or allies right away stay longer in my experience i would like to move ccpUFFFDs focus from shiny ui and ship skins into the realm of engineering basic changes to the way new players are introduced to other players i want to see changes that get someone who sees those shiny new UFFFDthis is eveUFFFD ads linked up to other players in a way that encourages them to stay on past the learning curve in a way much more meaningful than listening to the jibber jabber of an npc corp channel iUFFFDd also like to see changes to the tools available for corporations to recruit such players the most viable entities in eve are those that know how to bring in new players and make them welcome letUFFFDs see if we can spread that knowledge and to some extent make it implicit in game structure more players means an eve that will last so that all of us can continue to enjoy it second ccp needs to remember that they are at their worst when they start ignoring the wishes of their players i have played virtually every mmo since muds were a thing and they all fall down when they start believing their UFFFDvisionUFFFD is so pristine that it has nothing to gain from listening to the thousands of players telling them they arenUFFFDt enjoying it ccp has learned this lesson more than once but they seem to forget it periodically i believe weUFFFDre at another such point some of the changes implemented though i believe they are positive in general such as the faster development cycle have had the effect of insulating ccp from player comment or giving them the impression they can safely ignore it it seems to me ccp has been particularly aggressive in ignoring the input of the csm in recent years while simultaneously holding it up to shield themselves from criticism i hope to hold their feet to the fire third ccp seems to have a particular axe to grind at the moment against some of the larger entities in the game these entities have been the most successful at creating a culture that brings people into game and keeps them there the answer that ccp seems to be pushing to prevent stagnation in eve is to break these successful entities apart instead of learning the lessons of their success to improve the game iUFFFDll say something controversial here that will no doubt earn me the enmity of certain factions of eve stagnation isnUFFFDt the fault of large coalitions it is the natural result of game mechanics that reward risk averse behavior thatUFFFDs where the focus should be you can create good rewarding mechanics that both encourage social structure and penalize risk aversion this will drive conflict and content this doesnUFFFDt mean iUFFFDm against the idea of creating a space for small and medium organizations not everyone can be a goonswarm or a pl or even a cfc or n3 member not everyone wants to be as the leader of a small to medium alliance myself i am eager for opportunities that will allow an organization the size of my own to shine but doing it at the expense of larger organization isnUFFFDt going to grow the game the larger orgs give something for the smaller ones to aspire to they drive the greater meta of the game and create a lot of the intrigue and movement that have kept the game fresh for better than a decade my hope is that we can find a middle way that gives us all opportunity i hope to earn your vote and be a strong voice for the player base on csm x thank you
thoric for csm savethelance
here take my vote
my vote goes to frosthammer good luck
my name is bhock and i am one of the contributor of the capstable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement

as a proud member of lawn and the cfc i support frosthammer and hope you will as well he clearly states his history and aspirations we know where he stands and he will have my vote
thoric frosthammer as a csm member would be a benefit to everyone in eve you got my vote
im trying to figure out how to not make this sound rude but failing miserably why should i vote for you over any of the other nullsec candidates also as a player that participates in conflicts on a smaller scope primarily in low sec npc null and wspace how would your ideas and support for large coalitions affect me finally since you mentioned new player retention in conjunction with corporation management and advertising what are your opinions on the upcoming change to allow concord to interfere with corp on corp violencefounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
bebopmy ideas arent specifically related to support for large coalitions the point im making is that stagnation and the lack of a place for smaller entities in nullsec arent the fault of larger coalitions people are blaming the wrong thing stagnation is the direct result of goals and systems that reward both n1 combat where the bigger blob always wins and risk aversion blueballing when you cant win the n1 war there is also the general issue that once youve taken a sufficient volume of space theres simply very little reason other than because i feel like it to conflict with your neighbors again it creates a balance in favor of risk aversion and elimination of conflict larger coalitions will always exist but what needs to happen is that reasons for smaller scale conflict need to be present and systems need to be in place to overcome the tendency toward inertia more movement more conflct these things create space for new entities to fill in the ecosystem of eve this includes smaller entitieswith regard to the concord changes i am of two minds as ive said one of my goals would be to see ccp discover new ways to hook new players up to a social network as soon as possible on one hand the concord changes allow greater ability for hisec corporations to make themselves available as a social network for new players without fearing immediate loss or carnage on the other hand as ive also indicated i dont like dumbing down the game its longevity is directly related to its deep and complex gameplay my take on the concord changes is wait and see if on balance the social benefit and an increased number of new players living past the learning cliff outweighs the reduction in complex gameplay it is a win if not it should be rolled back as ccp did with teams as to why you should select me over other nullsec candidates i think perhaps i bring a new perspective that may be a little different than some of the voices youve heard before i and the alliance i manage bring a slightly different style of community to eve and the cfc and weve been pretty successful with it recently i have also seen nullsec from virtually every side i have been part of the small independent alliance finding its way into new space the big hidebound dinosaur alliance sliding to its death the powerful juggernaut that is the cfc and even a pirate npc space corp here and there on an alt i have run an alliance and ive been a cog in the machine i have a pretty good grasp of the full range faced by a wide variety of nullsec players
ive had the distinct honor of working with thoric in his capacity as alliance leader in the cfc he has been a tremendous asset and isnt afraid to make difficult leadership decisions he leads a tightknit community which speaks volumes for his abilities also his people throw amazing parties
what are your views on creating alliances for people that give you abuse on a regular basis
marcel tayn  ill vote klapen for csm x

the new citricioni phello my name is dominik and i am 25 years old i have played eve for a few years now and in the past year i started to work on some personal projects in eve one such project was my corporation stille gewalt which coincided with another project which is an npsi community under the same namemy primary focus in eve is low sec pvp where i engage in all flavors of pvp from small to large scale fleets which i achieve through interacting with the eve community through my npsi groupmy npsi group has become quite popular amongst the german playerbase and the greater eve community you may have joined one of our fleets or attended one of our events such as our carrier events when im not doing community work i am a low sec pirate fc corp ceo and alliance director for one of the largest alliances in minmatar spacewhether i am flying the banner of my npsi community or alliance i am dedicated to finding good content if elected i would strive to provide ccp the necessary feedback and suggestions to help guide the game into a contentrich environment for all types of players and playstylesi believe with my experience with interacting with the many different players and playstyles in eve that i would be a prime candidate for csm xthanks for readingcitricioni
so ive been giving a lot of thought to syndicate latelysyndicate is a very unique region in eve it is npc null is situated geographically close to hi sec which makes it logistically viable for an aspirant group trying to live there its proximity to active areas of fw also positions it well at the same time npc null is a great place to get your feet wet  none of the aggression rules and penalties of low sec or gate guns and none of the overhead or hassle of sovereignty one would think that these two factors would make it flourish with new life new groups and people just trying to live on the edge dotlan routinely puts syndicate as one of the most violent regions of nullsec however if you think about it this should seem very odd why compare it to any sovereign nullsec region how much value in minerals moon goo dead space loot and raw isk does that region produce on a daily basis compared to syndicate what if we compared how much isk in losses a region generates compared to a composite value of how much a region produces while i do not have hard numbers on this and i would do a thorough analysis on them if i had them id wager that syndicate would pretty much be king of such a metric it destroys far more than it is capable of producing now one could argue that the value and resources of sov regions cannot be so simply tabulated as they are spent on wars that span multiple regions making this comparison a little unfairhowever it does make one think about syndicates financial situation namely it does not have that many ways to fund itself clearly there is lots of interest in the region but on a whole it cannot support that interest autonomously more goes into it than comes out of it basically it is a playstyle that is craved and desired far more than it is supported compare that to faction warfare which by and large does support the playstyle it fosters now it would be a shame to homogenize its resources with sov null it should be distinct and different entirely just that a bread and butter way for npc nullsec residents to earn income is called for i realize things are not as bad in some npc nullsec regions via really good lp stores but some of those regions are not as geographically viable as syndicate is and barring player made star gates they never will bewhile you couldnt ever guarantee that any changes would have the desired effects in an ideal world youd have the runaway barleguet effect in npc null  by putting resources out there in space bottom up resources youd create a self feeding loop of content think about the weekend after they released the mordu spawns in lowsec  how many people went to look for them how many people went to go catch people looking for them and how much content did it create you just need to get the ball rolling and space begins to fill up with people reasons to set up market hubs form alliances and get rowdy
original post has been updates with additional information and refining of topics
in relation to your question regarding my views on previous wormhole candidates my answer is ad followsthere will always been room for improvement in everyones veiws of the same content with that being said i have always been in support of at least one wormholer being on the csm wormholes are a great part of this game and help make eve online the great game it is i would rather at least have one of us in there than none 
thank you o7
ok now there are more details but it still seems like you dont know the wormhole playerbaseim not sure what you are getting at here you want more lowsec connections for cap movement less so you dont need to close to pve i live in a c5 with a low class static i get a heavy high once a month for freighter usage null secs for cap movements every day and low secs once or twice per week for cap movement too for cap movements i scan out bigger chains and move them through multiple chains if i have to for closing the null secs are more of an irritation either way it looks like you want to reduce risk if it was for pvp in low sec you would go down your own chain and use sub caps if you want more heavy low sec connections move to a c5 with an upper class static conflict driversok i know people living in both of those system types in c5 and c6 since hyperion they are making it work having holes which are better than others is a conflict driver there are a lot of good systems empty currently making the bad ones better isnt going to make more people live in wormholes and generate content its going to make it the same number of people living in wormholes whilst removing the eviction content driverps can you please look up their effects since hyperion still seems you havent realised they have changedwormholes are not high sec and still they cater for new players with c1 and c2 sites i started as a new player in a c3 ccp has made it easier to scan removed the ore sites from scannable anomalies made it near impossible to forget probes made the astrometrics skill not limit the number of probes you can launch etc i think enough has been done for themyou want alliance bookmarks that is a good thingthey make plenty of isk just need to know how the problem is incursions give a brand new player much higher iskhour thats hurting the wspace populationhit quote limit 5 will double post
i find them every day and there is the wormhole sales on the forum and the big addition wasnt over the years it just happened with phoebe i know a lot of people who mine and live in wspace their mining alts live in high sec because of the safety creating more ore sites wont change thatsorry but you seem way out of touch with the playerbase you claim to represent guessing you have had a long afk from eve and wormholes
if wanted to get into wh space but i always felt like it was kind of scary for newer people
can you please tell us what type of wormhole you been living in and what you been doing in the wormholes  tell us some more about you please
1 derelict pos i would agree that a mechanic to would allow taking over or forcing a tower to degradeif gone unfueled for a period would be useful and have been discussed a lot of people including myself use holding towers on moons to secure them for militia alliance use anything that opens up resources to players is good adding or changing a dynamic that allows for small corps organizations to be proactive and organized is good2 catering to novice style players i would not advocating to adding game content or revamping mechanic platforms to suit a more lamen player mentality having said that i will point out that i am not turning a cold shoulder to new players i encourage recruiting new players into fw it is the best way to learn pvp i new player in eve is still amazed and intrigued with the game and the content and that is an awesome thing eve is a game layered with information and content and then you add the social and political facets to the game and it is very easy to get overwhelmed eve is not for everyone and that is what makes those that remain so special3 csm council focus my goal is to bring and maintain a voice advocating low sec pvp stability and interests in fw for all factions null sec has far too long been the focal point in eve and some of the greatest players and game play goes over looked and left to endure an outdated system just implementing a few small revamps to fw low sec could add so much content and a more consistent mechanic that would attract more players and organization4 voter education brother honestly my game time is always occupied with militia and alliance ops diplo and chores i am a slave to a list so long m8 it is even funny i am going to have to pass the mic to ccp on that one i think the responsibility of attracted voters and raising awareness for csm would fall to ccp devs perhaps they want voter awareness to be low so they can control the votewho knows it is eve do your part for free elections victor fw5 cats yo  cats i have two outside that are huge jungle feral hybrids and one inside that holds it down cheersmo
1 recon changes i am in favor of the class changes it adds a new depth to the class and adds tactical content to fw 2 booster range i am fine with the current mechanics for boosters attention needs to be applied to other areascheersmo
1 opposition votes true i am and always have been an amarr loyalist i do not think there is a neutral fw low sec player if one finds ones self with a militia tag then one ceases to be neutral my voice on csmwill not preach favoritism towards the empire or advocate for buffs to energy weapons my voice on csm is to raise the awareness to certain low sec and fw mechanics that can be streamlined it will stress the importance to ccp to not turn a blind eye to those grinding the low sec lanes in and out of concord cross hairs and raising the call to arms for fw my platform promotes a more secure and stable war zone for fw players thank you for your time see you on the field brothermo
1 devs again drawing dev attention away from null to low sec and fw2 publicity i think that being on the campaign road and the publicity for my faction go hand in hand whether it is for good or for bad that remains to be seen publicity for any any faction is publicity for fw and that is good3 warzone favour being biased to my faction on the council would serve no purpose and be counter productive to what we all need to accomplish for fwin summary a few specific items are the revamping of low sec pvp mechanics between fw and non fw players in fw sites also adding content that promotes a more factional dynamic to tlf pilots i say stay frosty stay loyal fight the good fight for honor for glory for fwmo
i apologize for the late response m8 thank you for your time1 fw missions to my understanding running the exclusive fw missions available from your npc militia corp do not sway system sov in any way the lp may serve to keep a corps or alliances war chest full but that should be a viable source for funding a war effort as well as accumulating standing2 fw plexing true there was a time when the plexing mechanic in fw was broken and a single fw site farmer could set a system to vuln in a day or two thankfully those have been changed and fw is on the right track for greatnessmo

pretty much thisndas exist for one reason  to protect some party that needs to share information ccp with some other party csm to facilitate operation that is their sole purpose it wouldnt matter if you knew the exact provisions of ccps nda to the csm  its very unlikely they would change it just because doing so could limit the protection of the data theyre sharing and that is not in the companys best interestsevery nda i have ever signed boils down to the followingwe are going to tell you things we would not otherwise share because we have no choice if you blab about this information we will sue you so hard we will literally own your dnagovernment ndas tend to include the phrase and possibly charge you with treason or violation of national security and lock you up for the rest of your natural lifeviolating an nda is not something one does on a whim the reprecussions may not necessarily stop at zomg permabandeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
the only things which are of any real interest to players wrt the nda are the things behind the nda which arent specified in the nda other than what we tell you and exposing those kind of negates the whole idea of the ndaand its a constantly growing list all the random chats in private csmccp channels are covered
is some of null sec too safepossibly it requires more shrinking of null blocs making them viable in less systems so more alliances can fit out there
that i can agree with the way you make it more dangerous is by allowing cloaky players their tools to compete with larger entities through asymmetric warfare get rid of jump fatigue for cloaky shipsblops
yes which is why i enjoy your attempts to run very much its like a carcrash only its political happening in slowmotion nobody gets hurt and i can go back and rewatch if i want i know i havent been supportive before but at this point i would like you to run again and again because its hilariousso for the sake of everyone with a desire to laugh please do continue to runits not every day we get to see such a perfect specimen of the joke candidate
i am sorry that you cant grasp the palpable irony of your statements
i hope you win just so i can see the car crash then i can start a pool on when you would be kicked out why you would be kicked and what exsucse you give for being kicked it will be fun entertaining  and profitable
maybe you should update your sig then
yeah i dont care that much
i think i can imagine how just like this thread so far the csm will be discussing a topic with ccp xenuria will pick a fight with a dev walking by in the hallway not even involved adn completely ignore all actual discussion happening in the roomon a related noteim still waiting for my answer xen about my complete misunderstanding somehow of how public elections work because my highly inferior brain cant seem to see past this big illusion you can perceive so well about how a democratic election is totally not based on how many votes a candidate gets and those votes being dependent on whether or not people like that candidates history because hint hint that is exactly how elections work waht you state in this thread as your csm goals mean nothing all people care about is their prior experience with you which so far means you have 3 groups 1 of voters who are part of your 100 man constituency you hang with that no one knows or interacts with the about 80 who have no idea who you are compared to the other candidates and the other 10 who only know you from the monument incident and and only know that you did something to make someone angry enough to commit a crimeand im not trying to troll or derail anything ive asked you legitimate questions in an effort to help you and your chances of not only gaining a chair on the csm but interacting with the greater community as a functional human being all of which attempts i might add were either ignored by you or were responded to with a very im not going to even try adn get elected holierthanthou attitude
i can see it already rip cas in advance p
you talk to much csm posts are not the place to fight for your personal head spins have issues with peoples bio create a petition

i too see people doing elite pvp in tinkertanked t3s and unstoppable marauder flagships in tranquility the innovation that goes on in the at has far reaching consequences indeed the fact that everyone uses nothing but the drone meta shows how the at reflects and even dictates the general sentiment of the balance of ships and modules
meh i used the word trickle intentionally no need to jump on it yes you do actually see some rather heroic marauders on tranquility from time to time as well as interesting solologi fits or other gimmicks you just need to know where and when to look obviously tranquility and the at are very distinct environments from each other
minor edits made now that im typing on a computer not a phone the content is unchangedmarauders are insanely powerful in highsec the only reason that they arent fielded there much is that the entities who would fight over objectives in highsec generally prefer hit and run strategies this is part of nongank highsec combats identity  you have fewer clues as to the capacity of the opponent to escalate because there are always neutrals in system and they might be out of corp alts of your opponents with standing corp invites they can dock take and be in combat with you inside a minuteadditionally marauders are stigmatized as pure pve boats due to their history prior to the introduction of bastion mode their purpose was to combine 90 of the pve capabilities of a vindicator with 50 of the utility of a noctis this has now changed marauders broadly speaking outperform pirate faction battleships in general pvp engagements in highsec if properly fitted unless your entire operation is based around playing to a unique strength of a pirate bsthe strengths of marauders however do not suit other areas of space because they are extremely soft to capital ships they are still underusedthis is an interesting digression but i reiterate my point  i was wrong to claim the at is irrelevant but the original argument  that code regards the csm as too important to eve to troll  remains
you have the support of all my accounts highsec needs a voice from someone who will not dumb it down
nothing in eve is too important to trolljust had to add that sorry carry on folks vote sabriz
i understand most of the discussions around nullsec sovereignty discussions between you the rest of the csm and ccp are restricted under nda but your ideas are not even disregarding sovereignty changes you are free to tell the whole world about your specific contributions to csm and your specific ideas for csm x should you be reelected to a second term regardless of the subject matterunfortunately you still havent answered my question and havent given me a single specific idea or contribution you made to csm ix though you keep referencing the en24 article i sincerely hope that will answer all the questions i have about your candidacy and platform however i wont hold my breathregarding your displeasure with me posting on a public forum and your referencing your regular posting on the cva forums cva hasnt found us worthy for positive standings and so our proviblue alliance is denied access to their forums almost entirely regardless i believe any dialogue between a csm candidate and a his or her constituency should be a matter of public record i believe your platform should be too and that is why i post here without giving a thought to mailing or convoing you in game regardless of your availabilityas i said before i look forward to that article and potentially a more specific answer to the question ive been asking what did you specifically contribute to csm ix and what do you intend on contributing and advocating in csm x should you be reelected
made piece on eve24 about wintersummit and other stuff
loved the
your en24 piece throws out some ideas for nullsec but the emphasis seems to always be on more as i understand it one of the major problems in sov null is that theres terrific income for people who can run the 810s and the 1010s and who get to them in time but theres not much for the average line member especially if theyre newyou hear people talking about moving mission agents out which would solve that problem but from the csm minutes it sounds like ccp wants to move away from missionsso what you would you think of this there is a more or less static average wealthhr available in nullsec one way or another the more settled the space is the more consistent the income is the less settled it is the spikier it isin other words the wilderness would have long odds but potentially vast rewards while settled space would support a more consistent income with the two averaging out to more or less the same over time this would support people living in sov in the most important way while still offering an untamedwilderness vibe for explorers to enjoycomments
thank you for the support everyone special thanks to those who have worked so hard to help bring the election and candidates to the player base at large the amount of time and effort you are putting into this is absolutely amazingmy application is officially submitted for csmx ill see everyone at the poles
npsi fleets like spectre managed to keep me in the game after i had quit out of rageim happy to see someone like jayne run for csm he has my vote
pardon me if im intruding on any discussions and also for attempting to fight jaynes battles in his own thread but i strongly disagree with you ive flown with npsi groups like spectre for the past few months and i would agree with the fact that theyre political entities but they behave on an entirely different wavelength than the big coalitions like the cfc as far as i can gather after flying in these fleets the only clear goal npsi fleets have is to generate content for anyone willing to take the time and put forth the effort of joining up for a fleet which is unlike big political entities like the cfc or n3 whose goals are to make moneycontrol sovetc im not going to pretend like there is a 0 chance that jayne could have some ulterior motives in his campaign but coming from someone who understands these things to some extent i have trouble imagining what exactly those motives might be if there even could be any also your initial argument on npsi communities evolving into only two power blocs is flawed as well there is plenty of crossover that happens between the different npsi channels a la spectre advertising for bomber fleets in the bombers bar channel or spectre getting notified when an rvb ganked event is starting not to mention that there is also crossover between public fleets with different goals for example recently bombers bar a specialized pvp channel and warp to me incursions a pve channel did a cooperative fleet this kind of thing would be incredibly unlikely to happen amongst the big null blocs i still have yet to find two competing npsipublic fleet channels that have bitter rivalries against each other to the point where they have to send in spies to see what theyre working towards a more likely dystopian situation is that they would all clump into one group which is also unlikelyi agree that a lot of jaynes points center around benefiting the npsi community but isnt that kinda the point of the csm to try and benefit the type of gameplay you enjoy the most im not gonna play the fool and say helping the npsi community carries as much weight as the need for the sov rebalance or the need for changes to hisec but i can directly see how these proposed changes would benefit the npsi community which is more than i can say for some proposals ive heard
i think temporary standings inherited from somebody or not have a big potential for abuse  disguising as blue neutral red by just having the right fleet boss or setting a flag also a mechanic like this would foster corps to be more restrictive in regards of their members joining npsi fleets what makes sense imo is to allow additional mutual standings towards other fleets trade standings

were you affiliated with the followingj234421  lawn wormhole specialists back in 2011 i think they were pretty inactive by thenif so youll be on my ballot for the nostalgia i am feelingwe removed you 
thoric you have my votes too 
i like him wait wha
no my wormhole period was unaffiliated with lawn or that corp  i just hung out with a small group of friends you may well have obliterated us however we were pawful
good job on the interviews thanks 
yep great job on the interviews guys
more of a roundabout meta question for you xanderwhat qualities in a candidate do you think makes one the most electable what qualities would actually make a candidate the most effective once electedand makes a candidate good to work with on the council as a teamare any of these qualities mutually exclusive
i didnt vote for xander in the last election i thought his personality was to explosive for the csm he proved me wrong and i will be voting for him this time around
thanks for the great questions angryqualities that make a candidate the most electable well without putting too fine a point on it being a senior member  candidate from a 00 makes a huge difference whether it is fair or reasonable or not if you are the candidate in a 00 bloc that trumps just about any other quality its the nature of the beasti think though the question you are actually asking is what qualities would i like to see in a candidate before they are even elected i like to see someone with a proven history of interacting with the community whether that be in alliance forums or twitter or a blog or here on eveo or whatever  i like to see someone who has went out of their way to interact with other players outside of the gamei personally like to see someone who understands their particular fields of the game anyone who tells you they know everything about every part of the game is lying is able to back up their own particular point or argument when necessary but also understands how to listen to opposing arguments and back down with it is correct to do sothey need to be able to communicate effectively with other council members ccp and the player base while also being able to effectively prioritise what is important in any situation they also must understand that they will almost certainly be working with someone in the other 13 members who have distressed them in game in some way being able to put the meta aside is imperativeand understand that you will need to work hard at certain times particularly around summit that was doubly so when we had to do the minutes ourselvesi think that kinda answers questions two or three as well but i am more than happy to answer any followups you have angryas to whether they are mutually exclusive well put it like this i am of the opinion that there are no perfect council members on csm9 some get a lot closer than others but we all have things we can improve on  we are only human id like to see all of the above in a council member but i realise that i myself am not perfect and try to be tolerant in the foibles of others
much better intro thumbs up
all excellent questions for starters were you aware that csm members are heavily discouraged functionally banned from saying anything negative about another csm member in public regardless of truth value as for the rest i will likely treat it elsewhere at length this isnt to be dismissive instead theres a great deal about the csm that i have yet to say and as yet havent and most of it ties back into these admittedly difficult problems
one of my previous accomplishmentsbookmarks on grid show up in tactical
i have spend most of my wh live in both c5s and c4 wormholes i been in them for quite some time as far as myself i have been in a few different wormhole corps probably my most know would be the aesir i came into possession of that corp when dmitry wizard stepped down as ceosome personal information about my self would be that i am 22 years old and i am nearing the completion of my computer science degree game have always been a large part of my life and so has eve online
well this is one of the main points of my campaign  i do agree wormholes can be very scary
im friends with dmitry and knew the aesir from the ragnarok days but i dont think ive ever dealt with or heard of you unless you are running on an alt im on my last leg of the game but ive been in very active in wormholes since their inception and i am skeptical of your experience personally if i saw your corp history alone id say you look like an alt but to each their own ill discuss my thoughts on your ideas belowi lived in c5s for a loooong time and if we really wanted content we could always make it if you are having issues with content in your wormholes it may be the people youre playing with i think you may need to diversify your experience before proposing changes like thisi dont support the concept that wormhole effects need to be balanced to be more aligned because they dont want to diversify their skill training wormholes arent rookie mode and to be good in wormholes over time you should have a more diverse skill portfolio in my time in wormholes ive flown tons of various doctrines and ships and when our guys wanted to play in a particular bonus we would create shipfleet comps for a doctrine train for it and test it game mechanics shouldnt be altered in this caseno create a better scanningexplorationmaybe wormholes tutorials or missions but absolutely no changes to wormholes to make them easier for new players it isnt new player content so if they really want to live and play in wormholes go for it and learn through the losses the best wormholersplayers learn through loss
i have almost always lived in wormholes with other corps within the same alliance and i do agree with you that it is clunky and needs work but we always found a way in this case id like to see your thoughts on changes just to see your perspective bettercorbexx and his focus groups have already done a ton of work to help with lower class wormhole pve and improve viability as it stands though growth naturally pushes groups into the higher wormholes i started in a c2 in 09 then a c4 in 11 then c5 1112 then c6 in 12 then we bounced all over as mercs and such just having fun but mechanic changes dont need to be installed to make groups go into higher classes and some groups prefer the lower classesneed more detail as to what exactly you want here i dont think diluting the wormhole population by created a ton of wormholes is a good idea some increases based on checking stats and metrics on population and classesbonuss might be fine but dilution is dangerousthis is good also add ice belts for our scratch players some disagree with me on ice belts but this is a personal preference look forward to your feedback
thanks rob for writing down your minds i do absolutely agree with you bane cortex sorry i canUFFFDt say how much i disagree with all of your ideas except alliance bookmarks
dear bane cortex i m glad that you want to pick up the torch where many other big names have left their markand i shouldnt be interested into this topic but by bobs dead hands what the actual fudge your proclamaration sounds like from 2 years ago and and you smell like a carebear but we can fix this because you could be what this place needs to finally be like incursionsso lets have at it shall we there is a definable issues for corps living in whs mostly c5s with the randomness of the spawning of lowsec entrances to holes this make corps living in these worm holes have to go through great wait times to be able to get to any contentokay i may be tripping here but are you saying that an open lowsec connection is a problem for a local populus in extend if a low connection is up you cant do anything i always considered them great for capital and logistics purposes and some even use them as a good source of pvp i mean thats why people go to the jsigs to have pvp rightor are you saying you need more connections for more pvp because that kinda seems to work for thera and i highly endourse that since lowsec is kinda semi good small gang micro pvp but lets move ona large latency with spawn times on combat sites as wellare you saying the provided isk in class 5 wormhole is not enough in extend are you fudging me man you really want to reawake bob right by besus butt please tell me you have thought about exploring the options of isk your connections give you if not i m tending to sense a carebear and thats an unwanted title for a csm yes he needs to know how to make isk but making more isk as a campaign point  i m beginning to think you are not so long in wormholes as you may think  make wormholes more accessible for new players scanning changes odysee corp bookmarks 3rd party mapping tools there are soooo many good things that are aimed at new players and new players are using them class 1  2 is great for the minor explorer new players are coming into wormholes  sure most of the time they end up as dead afk heron on the highsec but they are there but i honestly doubt that any new player has the solo ability to come in set up a pos and go beserk i mean  skilling a good dread for wormholes takes litterally years how deep should they go if they only can fly a cruiserwhich brings us to the next point we kinda need to talk about and i almost flipped my fudge reading it because i had to read several timesi would like to see c1c2 and c3 whs be viable content for playersnow you are just shitting with me right righti will just say this people have  carriers in c1 and c2 space and considering the enviroment i would say thats  legityou see lossmails of 2b legions dieing in c3s while ratting you really think those people wouldnt do that and die if it wasnt worth itie corp bookmark issues fix that into ccplease alliance bookmarks google it its a thingfix ore sites hahahaahaahahahahahahahaahahahahahaa sorry i dont want to go into metrics but its a fuckton if you break it down actually besides not having ice the other minerals are supplied in abundance which  i bet that there is more off then in all of nullsecmy question is how long do you live in wormholes to consider yourself a longtime wormholer because your ideas are more blend then anything else may bob ashes have mercy with your souli ve been away for over a year quite happily depressed nullseccer now and i would have more potential to be csm then that  so before you say i just attack and be mean lets see what you actually should take care of to be a csmyour platform as it stands is actually lacking any understanding about the culture that is now imposed under the whcfcnot once did you say bob but thats actually a minor did you ever have a sit down with other corps like fcftw noho or csms or small c2 corps to listen to their issues can you pinpoint your agenda regarding the changes behind the mechanics you deem changeable and why best explained by spreadsheet and lets get on lazerhawks level and throw fudging stats out have you ever had a constructive discussion on the wormhole forums but lets conclude this rage fest because ive been bottleing it up to not post anything wormhole related  kinda cant stand the place hi everybodyhere are my questions which actually matter why did kill it with fire saw winter coming why is the n silent why is the venture the most overpowered ship in wormholes why didnt you talk about nomads as a potential prospect why did mobile structure had such a double edged impact on wormholes and where do you see the future why arent wormholes anomalies its gonna happen why is maxdel so scary who is bronya mothertouching boga and whats the deal with mister long penis in extend did you ever try to talk to longinous spear thera boys and following up on thera jovians why is corbexx so handsome and jack miton not posting what dusette is the sexy one what did pell helix saw coming where were you when wspace was burned to the ground who owns the system with the most freighters deployed in space why is it guten tag  when you meet aztec what impact do you see for the t3 changeshello i am bert and i stopped this  in 2014

since one of the primary unofficial duties of the csm is to generate drama for the entertainment of the average player the number of deleted personal attacks in this thread should be an excellent recommedation
the measure of a man is both made by those who love and those who hate him or hermmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
so many isd posts in here you would think they were the one running for csm im glad they are smiting the trolls in here though if anything it assures me my views on shaking up the stagnation of the game is in fact the right path still i find it funny they have nothing outside of personal attacks to hold against me
you want to avoid the law find niches in the judicial system to get what you want fine i have no problems with that but war declaration is an official way of going at someone with guns blazing and should thus cost substantial amount to discourage warspamming if a particular alliance can have 100 wars active theres something very wrong with the system
i fail to see the reason why you would want to limit the number of active wars ccp has introduced many mechanics to drive conflict and one of the biggest gripes people have about the game is political stagnation  ie people not fighting each other like they are supposed to wars are not a problem to be fixed  they are a mechanic for conflict generation and as such should be nurtured developed and expanded if you personally for some strange reason actually dislike wardecs then you are in luck because ccp has already thoughtfully provided you with a whole list of options for avoiding evading nullifying and rendering irrelevant any wars that might be declared against you

you have just been emasculated sir
that sounds somewhat painfull
they are upset that i am not given their insults the attention they feel appropriate the isd normally show up just before this thread turns into a huac meeting
ah that explains it
when did i insult when i read back to you what you said to us all i asked was whyhow do you believe yourself qualified for the position when your greater community presence is so littleyou refuse to answer this because the only answer you can give is not beneficial to your campaign so you choose to ignore it rather than take the other advice i gave you that is to recognize you do have a barrier to csm entry that is not being set by the big bad alliances trying to shut you down for speaking the truth or whatever it is you argue these days the barrier you have is that you do not participate in the larger community so you do not have enough peopel who even know anything positive about you to get the votes you needtldr realize you have a problem thats easy to fix before csm xi get involved with the larger community train noobs make forum posts get to know big named people and for the love of whatever deities there may be just try and make friends once in a while put the holierthanthou attitude in check and just get drunk with some fellow eve players and go on a lowsec roam or something
in my opinion ganking should be a group thing which takes effort hyperdunking isnt my favorite thing in eve but since my campaign is about more evil i am not against it

the cap stable podcast sat down with bam stroker recently for an interview you can listen to it here
1this is a nobrainer
dude tyrant scorn youre such a douche he was praising me for being a man about a situation that puts your podcast on the list that i run for the community i did it because my site is for the community as a whole so i disregarded your arrogance and egocentric attitude and put your podcast on my list even though personally i dont like you so if youre not going to vote for him because he praised me well youre seriously in the words of the legend ernie harwell looooooooooooooonggggggggggg gonei can easily remove unnamed podcast from the list if you so wish i have no problem with that just send me an email on my site listed in my signaturewant to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
firstly he never named you pukin and harry didsecond mike was giving chyph3r credit for doing right by the community and giving you media links on his site despite past personal feelings personally i doubt anyone cares about your endorsement any less than my own but seeing as how your defensive victim complex has reared its ugly head yet again youre giving credence to why chyph3r is in fact the bigger man hereeasier to throw a tantrum than take a minute to comprehend eh eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
pro tip for newbros to be good at eve you have to vote for mike azariah for csm because if you do his awesomeness will just magically enhance your gameplay no joking his awesomeness is retroactive as wellpro tip for veteran players voting for mike azariah will not make you win at eve because voting for him actually has the reverse effect winning at eve  not playing the game duhprot tip for bitter old vets htfu and just vote for mike azariah your going to do it anyways you bitter old fork harri and chyph3r are going to do it and so should youpro tip for all pilots mike azariah is not in the cfc nor has been been assimilated or emasculated by the cfc as some may have accused him of his magic school bus program is legit and is not a scam even though he has a huge bounty placed on him as a gimmick by many of us in the eve media just recently mike azariah has been wrongly accused of betrayal by a non factor in the eve media who is the host of legacy of an ahole podcast that person owes mike azariah a formal apology for being incompetent on his fact checking and for letting his personal bias toward another podcast taint his comments towards mike azariah lastly if i wasnt married and i was batting for the home team i would certainly do mike azariah however i am just going to have to settle with voting for him with all my accounts even the extra accounts that i just renewed in order to vote the cfc block list because my dear leader has ordered me so
you will get my votes corefree ts3 hosting
i am glad that there are people like core who have true passion for eve passion which extends well beyond just playing the game investing his own spare time in parallel with family and job is a noble thing to do lately discussed funky bacons acions clearly shows the reasons a particular csm member was there to some their own agenda and attention seeking stunts are more importanti am happy to see that core is nothing like that hes actions show deep love for the game the fact that he is keeping a positive mature hardworking and joyful attitude towards everything despite the fact that it takes huge effort to be on csm shows that he is doing what he likes at the same time hes always being open and forthcoming to questions regarding the ccp and csm affairs i have huge respect for what he does and i frankly can not imagine where he draws such an energy from to do his job raise the family run fleets and yet have the clearness of mind respect and will to actually help ccp with steering the game towards improvementi will vote for core because i feel that he is not only representing the playerbase towards ccp but allso ccp towards the playerbase i believe that ccp is gaining from this relationship which means that well have a better game and even more fun o7
it nice to see you running again sugar you have my vote
personally i dont understand what youre bringing to the table if you were to be in the csm except for an increased interest from the general player base towards the csm all of what ive read so far from you in this post is basically claiming your views are the same as those already released by ccp or other players i want to know what will you actually be bringing to the csm when it comes to suggestions your own suggestions for gameplay development
why is this wrong as soon as these people join a corp or organize in an alliance they have marmite forsaken deadly fingertips pursuit and so forth on their heels and cannot do what they want to do people already tell stories about incursion communities like tdf isn tvp and what not why should they further condense into something that gives them no gainsif i as a business oriented person want to make profit i do not want to risk  under the current horrendous corprolestitle system  to give other people the slightest chance to ruin it from inside i cannot give people specific and restricted access to anything in a corp other than fully open or not at all which opens the floodgates to my demise and their victory however i am not interested in my demise nor am i interested in providing others with content where i pay for it and dont get anything other than ridiculing in return so why should people join corps if this will only expose them to other high sec camping people as soon as they raise their head just a micron too high believe it or not i am in such a position with my activities on a weekly basis
look another csm candidate who wants to be space famous
i am already famous enough for my liking now is the time to put notoriety to good use
this guy inspires create content and he does it with humor smiles and a bit of sarcasm but better yet  not corrupted by bittervetness and negativity people actually like being blown to pieces by this man  because he has passion we need new eyes new blood new strength in csm   its a new dawn a new age a new expansion cycle  i do not believe you need to know every aspect of eve thats why there is more than 1 csm you need passion and an open creative mind more than playing years  my vote is going towards the innovative positive progress of eve   chance ravinne  norsel outo7
besides being a nice person she is a single woman we have a clear winner here 
just sits and shakes her head lol thanks for the support
i will definitely look forward to the mining and mission changes you want to get in

im one of those newbies who stayed at eve because of his help at first stages1
10 pages with hate and violence in a german eve board why nothing here 
you got my vote after meeting you in person in eve vegas and getting to shake your hand i was highly enlightened with your true personality and character i was very much impressed you dont just represent goons or the cfc you honestly represent the betterment of this game that we all love and the surrounding community you and some of the other incumbents are exactly what we need on the csm and i dont say that lightly your hard work last year on the csm shows even though many have turned a biased blind eye or are just plain ignorant and cant see itthank you for your time and effort this past year representing us the eve community as csm9 and good luck with the csmx elections looking forward to another year of having you on the csmvote for sion kumitomo
interview done the other day looking forward to it being posted
hello my name is ariete i am looking to represent the wormhole community with the objective of improving wormhole spacei first started playing eve in 2003 and have been playing since then over the years i have spent time in high sec null sec and wspace i joined my current alliance sleeper social club in 2012wormhole spacewormhole space thanks to corbexx is in a relatively good shape what would good to look at again areblackholes  they are still troublesome and under used giving them a more better use in wormhole spacefrigate wormholes  either a reduction on the amount that spawns or remove the mass regen from the wholesone upcoming problem that i can see coming up is strategic cruisers wormhole space use them quite differently than known space in wormhole space they are the workhorses we use them for scanning boosting ewar salvage and pvp for those that live in wormhole space we need to keep strategic cruisers flexible many of the subsystems are rarely used these could be repurposed to other roles for example to use micro jump drives more different types ewar better logistics to greatly increase their versatility without over powering themsovereigntyi am in favor with the principle of sovereignty through utilization what i mean by this is that you using a system would gain you sovereignty over it through living mining fighting industry etc other corporations could come in and reduce your sovereignty control by using your space ie running you sights pvp and destroying your structures they would also be a natural decay to it so inactive system you would lose it eventually null space would be much better off with a player based system rather than a structure based sovereigntynew player experiencei think the best way to improve this aspect of the game would be to make the new player experience more inline with actual gameplay for instance in one of the missions the rats pod the player to demonstrate both the podding mechanics and the risk of being podded the current system for mission running perfectly effective as it is however i believe that changes could be made to introduce players to faction warfare wormhole space navigation and actual pvp which would greatly improve the realism in the new player experience for instance a mission might take two new players to the same ded space pocket and have them engage in combat another aspect of the game that is crucial to the new playerbase is the new isis system i believe that this system could also be utilized elsewhere with an isislike system representing not only the ships of the game but also the module tiers as well perhaps tied in with the ship isis this would make planning for skills dramatically easier for newer players csmthe csm is an elected body that works as a representative voice for the players it is designed to help the players relay their ideals to ccp and in turn helps ccp relate to their playerbase recent incidents have shown this system to be both effective and ineffective depending on the situation these kinks in the system are getting fixed and i would like to help the improvement process in any way i can over the next term of csmif elected csm as your my hope is to work coherently with the rest of the csm team ccp and the playerbase at large to create an even better new eden for all of us to live and die within

q and a from proclus diadochu1 what is a detailed background on your gameplay experience since youve started playing the gamei first started playing this game in 2003 when a friend of mine introduced the game to me we mainly spent our time in high sec mining killing rats etc when my friends moved on i moved with them i still kept coming back to the game from time to time running missions and killing rats etcanother set of friends decide to play eve they got themselves set up in null space and got sovereignty of several systems out in catch  we did pvp mining industry etc we had good fun in trying to keep the space we hadafter that alliance folded due to a few reasons ii got playing other games i came back a few times again running missions in high sec and chilling out i started to get involved with the communities in eve like rvn ganked and eve radios lemming leaps this lead me to join rvb which i had a great time in and taught my a lot about small gang and solo pvp in evean old friend of mine got involved with eve uni at the time he later joined up with sleeper social club i started talking to him and got interested in the wormhole space so i started to get training up my skills and learning about wormhole space life once my skills was good i joined up to sscin ssc i have took part in many fight and sieges often been the reason they started i like hunting down targets in wormholes and null sec the roles i do in fleets are often ewar interdicting and combat hauling no bullets no pew pew2 have you ever been involved in the political landscape or corporate leadership within evenot in eve i have ran guilds and similar roles as csm in other games like star wars galaxies i like the community and meta game in eve it provides a richness and life to the game3 how do you intend to reach out to the playerbase you wish to representwell i am arranging for there to be a wormhole debate later next week only one other candidate has got back so far it will be held on our ts details of this will be going out to the wormhole community this weekend later today i have a interview arranged with capstable there are other things in progress as well4 why did you recently decide that you wanted to represent the communityi have actually been thinking about doing it over the last couple of years i have been wanting to invest in to the game and its community after talking to some friends i decided to go ahead and run this year knowing that there is going to be some fundamental changes to the game we have to make sure we get good representation and voices for the wormhole community into the csm5 what is your experience with poscorporate role mechanicsin our home i run a pos for myself and a few others i know how much of they are a pain at times getting config starbase to sort out one small problem on your pos could mean been able to offline others as for corp roles that i have had i havent had any we have a good team of people in the corp theres been no reason to have roles i help people out with there problems i understand the mechanics of it all6 what is your experience with t3capitalsishtarslogistics class shipsthe only ones i dont fly of those is capitals and to be honest i have no desire to fly them i fly strategic cruisers drone boat like gilias vexor nay issue etc i fly hics and dics i fly logistics from time to time sub cap wise i can fly mostnow are ishtars and strategic cruisers op well yes when you have 100 in a fleet like you have in null sec but in wormholes space when a fleet size is 3050 caps t3 logi support for a big op then no they not which is one problem we are going to have soon there going to get nerfed because of null sec we need to make sure they are still viable for us in wormhole space7 what is your experience with mission runningminingbeen running missions lvl 14 and mining since i started dont do them as much now that im in wormhole space we run sites huff gas etc when i have done them i have found the to be fairly repetitive same as most mmos would be nice to see the missions revamped put some new life into them as they are what alot of people do in eve8 what is your experience with researchmanufacturingtradenever got into the industry side of eve i do a bit of trading and hauling nothing major9 what if any is your experience with sovwe all know theres no sovereignty in wormholes years ago when i was in null sec we was fighting to protect our space eventually we lost the space ahh good old times in drow mechanics wise i understand the processes of it all it seems a bigger pain than sieging and evicting a 20 tower wormhole
1 i support the above message
howdymy name is stupidgenius charante and i am one of the cohosts of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
looking forward to following your campaign personally i like your spartan style new player experience model and id love to hear more about it would you opposed to a set of exploration missions that introduced a more controlled wormhole environment to teach basics to rookies then step them into a more aggressive training curriculum leading them to live or die experiences in their training similar to the podding and pvp examples your providedalso do you miss rcc o7
a spartan style new player experience is not what is needed but a more realistic experiancei agree with you about wormhole exploration you get to scan out a wormhole aura shows you to bookmark it on both sides and you get to scan down different sites and kill a few sleepers you warp to the bookmark you saved and jump back
i think you misunderstand what spartan style isit is through realistic experience if the development plan was to create exploration tutorials for wormholes it would likely be good to be a controlled environment to some degree to ensure that players dont exploit it and farm new players but the later stuff could be perfect for pvp podding or whatever also try to understand that you dont know what is needed since no players have all the informationstatsmetrics you have an idea what you think this game needs as a representative of the playerbase dont tell other players what the game needs be open to discussion and not too polarizing
proc speaks the truth your platform is sound just remember to treat this as a race to fame the people must know who you are if they are to vote for you cap stable podcast would be a good start
already booked into the cap stable podcast also looking at having a wormhole townhall sometime next week
so why the sudden interest in making wspace a better place what makes you think you have what it takesim asking this because you entirely lack visible history on forums or even ingame you never took part in any of the countless discussions about state of and changes to wormholes never suggested anything and i dont recall you being active in representing any group of players im not trying to attack you here but please understand this makes it extremely difficult to judge your character goals and capabilities people are not very likely to trust someone they never heard before
well that being said i am a slight latecomer to the csm runnings lots of rhetoric lots of old arguments lots of regurgitated facts about how life is living in nullsec or high sec or in between is and how it should be fixed or what is broken and what is working just fine usually for the person running for csm i might add loads of comments about how i added loads of people to eve probably most of whom just simply burned out after 2 weeks and never played again but this is a bigger issue these issues are ones that affect all of the regular accounts old or new that log onto eve not just new players not just null high sec not just ratters or scannerswho am i in game i am soelent i have played eve on and off for the last 10 years or so i had an account back in the days of bob and was even involved in the beta at one stage but that email and sadly that account were lost a long long time ago how upset i was at the fact that my piece of steve that i had from bob era wars was devalued so greatly i am also the only member of the ccp guard appreciation society but couldnt get anywhere to print his face on a tshirt for event this weekendoutside of game i am mike 30 year old science teacher in one of the most difficult areas of south wales in the uk eve for me is more than a game first and foremost i log on to eve to socialise with my friends and as i am sure you can all relate to i end up spinning a ship whilst i am doing work for work or marking or otherwise being busy with other noneverelated thingsthe game has allowed me to build up solid multinational country friendships all over the worldmost importantly the game allows me to explode things whether this is a rat another player in pvp an asteroid or isk from my wallet replacing the stupidly expensive ships i just warped into a gatecamp with there is no other game that requires this level of skill andor planning at my point in the game as with any otherswhy csmwell i did ask myself this and then when i thought about it and the conversations myself and alliance mates and corp mates and friends had had it turns out that actually our ideas arent to far differentso why not why would any person not want to take the opportunity to contribute positively to a spectacular game that has so much more potential than it already has i want to see eve fresh for the next 10 years its been going strong for over 10 why not anotherwithout trying to sound arrogant or egotistical i feel i am pretty good at sorting problems out and actually enjoy it i have an inherent ability to look at a situation and see what is most often the simplest or most appropriate solution to it i am good at itcombined with my passion for this game i think i would be pretty good at this and representing the interests and needs of the playersof course i have my own personal ideas and agenda for the game which are probably shared with a lot of other players who wouldnt want it slightly different in some areas if asked and i am sure people would all have their own way of doing things if they had creative control but but but that is not what i feel being a csm is about being a csm is not about ones self its about representing my people to be read corp alliance and evemates in no particular order for the best possible outcome for everybody after all pros and cons of suggestions have been weighed and all affected parties accounted for one of the greatest challenges facing eve is new players not one csm candidate veteran or even ccp dev can agree otherwise i have been playing solidly after i returned for the last 3 years i am competing with players who have 150 million skillpoints and i feel the pain as a reasonably well equipped well off and skilled pilotit is difficult for even veteran players to easily train into a different skillset let alone a new pilot starting the game with no vision or idea of where to gothey are 10 years behind 100million skillpoints under and simply cannot compete in a lot of areas this needs to be addressed
my ideas and suggestions  well when i say mine i mean the ideas of the people whom i play eve with as much as my owni appreciate its not new players that will be voting in the csm elections but starting areas starting quests and a return to the race bloodline and ancestry based bonuses i feel could be looked atcurrently you start as a new player and are thrust into this astronomically complicated world as i mentioned above elite dangerous has a lovely set of offline tutorials which would be so beneficial to new players in eve it cannot be ignored you would get the game and spend the first 2 weeks or so playing through these tutorials online of course racking up skill points for rewards learning the crafts and piloting skills and forming a solid basis in eve the idea being that when you leave you would be a freshly trained and knowlegable pilot with a little bit of isk enough skills to be a viable character starting out wherever you may choose and enough knowledge of the game to be able to make reasonably informed decisions about where to go and what to do the skillpoints would not be allocatable until the completion of the tutorial say a total of 5million or so if you played through the whole lot and a set of cheaper implants a small token of appreciation would be a ship of your choice up to say a t1 cruiser with fittings of your choice to float you out into the universe also and in addition to that a lot of pilots including myself trained some skills with no particular vision or direction and are for the most part completely useless how many of you have a small tangent of trading skills or mining skills on your pvp pilot etc we get a yearly reset of attributes why not a yearly reset of one or two skills to relinquish the skill points from said skills to be reallocated elsewhere as we see fit  certain skills would be exempt from this for example combat ship skills station dockable supers  now dont get me wrong the station is a finite resource but the ultimate end game in eve is a supercarrier and titan for a lot of pilots as soon as you get into one that is effectively it for that pilot you are locked in now most are kept with holding toons andor on a specific super toon and require huge efforts on an alliance and sometimes individual scale to build and then fly they are the reserve of the rediculously rich andor the well catered for alliances why not change the station mechanics slightly to allow a limited number of supers to dock on the outside of the station and become a feature of that station itself  imagine a marina with 5 or 6 huge yachts docked up along side and then replace that image with a station with 5 or 6 supers it serves a number of purposes the first it allows people to utilise super toons outside of actually flying the super and second it would serve to spread a corp or alliances supers out around sovereignty within eveinterceptors and frigates vs battleships a lot of my corp alliance and people chat to generally feel this needs a bit of a rebalance lets put this into perspective i love flying my interceptor and frigates around but if i and a group of friends were running around as soldiers in real life and came upon a tank ie battleship and pull out their pistols it isnt even going to scratch the armour let alone blow the thing upthere is no reason an interceptor frigate or otherwise shouldnt be able to pin that battleship down none at all that i can see even start to eat away at the shields but considering the battleships would have shield generators the size of half the fleet it should be near impossible for something that small to explode it thats what cruisers and destroyers and battlecruisers are for now the simplest approach we came up with was having a damage modifier on weapon size vs sig radius ie if you are shooting a battleship with a frigate size weapon it will reduce the damage accordingly
there will of course be much more to follow i can always be reached in game if i am on just chuck me a question if you want to mail me thats great too or just post in this here topic and i will reply asapi am an open blank paged book guys and girls i have my own ideas but they are unimportant so ask away
can you explain how these two ideas are remotely in agreement with each other
absolutely these are mutually exclusive statements however and that should be born in mind a new player should be able to join a fleet and be of benefit to that fleet with the skills he has tackle small support dps against appropriately sized targets more importantly with the abilities he has gained from the training changes if any new player progression should not however be restricted to being linear if a new player wants to rock out in a battleship they are more than welcome nothing is stopping a new player training directly into a battleship as the training is in no way linear aside from a few prerequesite skills it still takes abotu 10 days to be able to sit in any race battleshipwith regards to the damage scaling  i regularly witness groups of 5 or 6 interceptors andor frigates taking out battleships with ease which shouldnt be the case there is no issue with the tackle and no issue with specialised gang fleets ie an interceptor or 2 with a bomber fleet as bombers and torps are inherently antibattleship weapons but this small change would introduce a mechanic thata made battleships viable fleet weapon platforms againb increased diversity in pvp more cruisers more variation in fleet composiiton etc i am not saying that all utility of interceptors or frigates is taken away but their roles potentially streamlined an interceptor is for interceptingdog fighting with other small fast ships destroyers for heavy dps applications cruisers for larger ships with more punch and then leave the nichUFFFD ships bombers more or less as they are this in my mind could me implimented as a straight weapon size vs hull size penalties small weapons lack the penetrating power and hence dont do the damage to the 3200mm of armor plate however larger weapons wouldin terms of damagefrigates  100 frigates 100 destoryers 85 cruisers 75 battlecruisers 65 battleshipscruisers  85 to frigates 90 destroyers 100 cruisers 100 battlecruisers 95 to battleshipsand so on and so forth with regards to ishtars only change that needs to be made to those if any is to remove the bonuses from sentry drones and apply them to heavy drones only they retain mobility and dps but sacrifice the ability to apply that dps with such impunity easier to kill heavy drones for example
greetings i am trinkets friend you may remember me from such forum topics as trinkets friendly wormhole advice column various fi threads and not much else i have a blog you may read this blog to find out a bit about how i think i do some youtube videos but not many as i forget to activate the recording most times i run prolapse tbgrl alliance and sudden buggery bugry corporation this in no way entitles me to any respect just a kind of deep enduring pity here is my terrible manifesto of things i will do while avoiding deep vein thrombosis on the flight to icelandhighsechighsec content is dominated by boring mining and war dec griefing i think eve needs more valuable and varied content than camping 44 in instalocking ships or circling belts before being ganked no capital rr i will agitate to prevent capital access to high security space in any manner where capital rrs come into play if you think that code or marmites or any organisation full of cowardsauce mouthbreathing gatehugging cretins will not utterly exploit the hell out of even rorqual rr on the sivala or niarja gate or dodixie jita or amarr undock then you have your head ensconced firmly buttockward capital transit pass capital transits of highsec for a 50m isk 24 hour license fee to concord sure i have a dread effectively trapped in thakala id pay to avoid space aids getting it across empire i will agitate for tags for standings i screwed my amarr standings harder than a carpenter screws a door to its hinges far too early in my eve career and i cbf to do the 4 hours plus of the bloody epic arc to fix the standings and you can only do the cosmos missions so many times with the success of tags for sec i will promulgate and agitate for tags for standings new player experience this is a vital part of keeping eve strong ccp liquid and the community growing i will work on improving the npe particularly with the 50 of players who go out solo missioning and never discover a corporation and the social aspect of the mmo i will agitate to put more leaders in the npe to let new players access corporate content loyalty point rebalance ever seen a khanid navy 1mn mwd no wonder why that is ever wondered why derelik and khanid are so dead maybe its because the lp cost tag cost and usefulness of the modules you can buy from the stores is so out of wack its not even funny i will agitate to have ccp rebalance the tag cost lp cost and mission availability of all highsec faction missions to improve rewards interest and content lowseclowsec content is accessible to everyone and generally fine however theres a few things i think need some work and i will go in there batting for you pirate scumfw missions i really detest the lp payouts for something farmable by alts in bombers million lp per hour harvests are entirely too common whilst this results in deliciously cheap faction ships it is stupidpirate faction missions and content i want to see pirate faction cosmos style missions a better spread of pirate faction content phat loots and more exploration content to drive or lure more people to live work and exist in lowsec such as aridia solitude etc nullseci see nullsecs problems as being its general emptiness and this is driven in part by the massive amount of rentinggoing on where whole regions are leased out to riskaverse bears by colaitions of greedy spitballsi will push for activitybased sov control i want to see for example shadow of xxdeathxx lose 90 of its sov simply because no one lives there i want to see small alliances of clueless noobs move out to the echoing halls of abandoned stations existing like space moss between the toes of the monolithic coalitions a real nullsec ecology not a monoculture of instadocking farmersskynet carriers screw them in particular i will not support anything to do with risk averse assigned dps wormholesi will be corbexxs stunt coq we will form a team voltronhuman centipede of factbased investigations of what really makes wormholes tick what is really wrong with them and how to improve their content i will table flip like a pro when we get ignored by ccp railroading content onto us which we dont need i will try to get poss fixed without ccp greyscale style nobubble poss i love the bubble and all its foibles i will get you titleassigned smas sensible corporation role and title management pos security i will get you universal one size fits all subcapital assembly arrays because what industry in wormholes really needs is 4 different types of arrays to build shipsi will get you a softnerfed proteus i will attempt to get you a viable cloaky loki and cloaky tengu that carry more than 250 dps i will get you a laser legion which doesnt suck i will sadly be agitating to nerf a few things too like the guristas ships and mordus shipsyou will get a relook at wr effects admit it its a bit ridiculous in a clownish way but most of all wormholers you will get sensible analytical and indepth brains representing you on the csm incursionsi will contact teamspeak and agitate for a feature which detects whiny entitled incursion fc speech patterns and replaces it with a recording of catherine zeta jones saying primary the jita nagamanen or whatever this will improve incursion viability 100 fold instantly
i will also be going for crossdressing capabilities for avatars in the nex store boy george style makeup for duders and crocs footwear
1tf has been one of my favorite wormholersbloggersvideocasters in this game not only did i get the privilege of flying with this gent for a while but i can confirm that he knows the community he intends to represent i think that along with corbexx 
im happy to see you running id just like to ask you this i bet you can see whyhow do you plan to balance out what you believe is right and needed with what your voters and constituency will think and want you are clearly very good at making your point and having it heard but it is sometimes quite different form what the restmajority judging by forums of wormholers would want
you want to keep ccp liquid whats wrong with sober and solventlp rebalance any blog posts out there or soming that explain what is wrong for the people that ignore lpjust nerf fw lp into the ground pleaseget corbexx to endorse you and ill place you above him in my voting list
please vote for tf for future epic moments of wife aggroand because he knows left from right mainly the aggro tho
just out of curiosity with regards to your taglp cost rebalancewhat do you think about a dynamic taglp cost where most farmed factions npc corps are too specific i think as you can game the mechanics easier require more lptags and those factions which are less activity require less tagslp it would mean that players need to check more and compare more for who they run missions and move around more to find juicier lp stores than just caldari navy for certain items it should obviously depend on the availability of modules if there is only 1 lp store faction supplying a thing it should not suffer from overfarming as there is no other choice it is rigable and manipulatable if not implemented correctly but what do you think about it
if this is a serious run you got my votetf you need to publish yourself a bit more didnt notice you till i was actively looking for wormhole candidates on this forum there is corbexx you and one nullsecr mascarading as a wormhole guyyou probably want to jump onto podside or cap stable podcast
you do realize that if you advocate for a dps cloaky ship on the loki and tengu you basically shoot all t1 and a good chunk of t2 cruiser ships and quazi force people into the realm of 400 dps at 30 range dps 80000 ehp cloaky cruisers im somewhat disagreeing here but its not because those ships in those configurations need help but because we really shouldnt have covops cruiser setups that can tank like the dickens output sizeable damage with no real significant downsidethe dps of the proteus comes with the sacrifice of mobility you have to be within scram range in order to apply significant damage thats the downside there are others thats the most glaringgiving kiting setups that can cloak on a dime and do significant dps will cause problems you know your stuff i just disagree with you on that point still keep the good fight going
thread locked at the polite request of the opregardless the position the op took in this campaign which is not one for me to judge approve or condemn in my position as va of isds ccl division it saddens me to see we had to intervene in this thread on so many occasions isd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
i think if they did allow walking in stations it would just make the game worse people wouldnt undock sounds like it would go the way of mass effect and your giving people too much to do within a station and not having any need to undock calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
there is at least one csm 9 member sion kumitomo who wants to push for greater csm transparency and a more open systema first step could be to so in the near future we can have more open debates about the csm and its membersmaking the nda public would show debaters eve media and the voting constituents the bounds currently placed on the csm by ccpgames within the csm can operate source
adding to thisit also show how to phrase a question towards a csm member or the csm as a whole so they can answer it without saying nda
the case against voting for the csmthe csm is a focus group for eve onlinesource
here is sion kumitomo csm 9 goon opinion about the csm as being limited now as a focus group 4 minutes into the cap stable interviewthe csm should be really focused on having a player agency in terms of legislating the process and the rules by which we play a sandbox game and to have that kind of influence on the rule setsource
actually all voting is popularity contests
you should try taking advice because every time ive read a post from you its not trying to discuss anything you either say read op or post a link or just insult people i might bee a goon but im not even that mean
there is a saying in my country he who fits the shoethat being said i only said current csm guys bashing on xenuriaand last time i checked your forum alt is not a csm guyalso bashing does not mean an insult by definitioni do agree that if someone asks a legitimate question then that could be awnsered normally surehowever i understand the sceptical attitude since most people just want to see xenuria burnif that was me i would be sceptical also
i think we can say we do not want xenuria to burn we just want someone that knows what they are doing as a csm member xenuria wont answer the honest questions from a few people and he claims they are trolls or insults if he can not or will not answer honestly then why would we want him as a csm member answer we wouldnt
fair enough however i still dont see why you are asking questions to xenuria or even care about what he wants to do on the csm reasoning behind this is you are in goons so you allready know who you must vote for and also your guys spot is a guaranteed spotbut who knows you might actualy be interested in this csm competition
i had an interesting discussion with some shadow cartel who were camping me in aescheewe were discussing my proposed term limits and one of them i forget who made an interesting point he said that term limits could hurt the independent vote because if a really good independent nonbloc candidate is elected so many times and there is a term limit that value is lost no matter how amazing that person is they cant run againi said that this was my point no matter how terrible or sparkling fantastic a csm delegate is they shouldnt be able to be csm forever votes provided term limits keeps systems of election fresh and moving my platform is very deeply rooted in fairness and as such i would sooner see the same limits and or rules applies to everybody or not applied at all doing the ethical or right thing isnt about what is easy or even what comes naturally the csm should be a meritocracy not some grandiose popularity contest or a social status symbol enforcing term limitations assures that new people and new ideas are present
that is an appeal to novelty fallacy a member being new is unrelated to their meritfurthermore the csm being an elective process at all is at odds with the idea of meritocracy each voter has their own idea of merit and many of those ideas are mutually exclusive are you suggesting there should be some measure of merit and csm reps should simply be appointed on that basis if so how would that workyour stated position contains very serious fundamental errors in reasoning would you care to revise or clarify to address these problems
i understand your point but i think you are misunderstanding the context of my statements being new is not better merit wise i didnt mean to come across that way i mean to say that in an ideal world people would be voted on not because of what alliance or corp they are from but because of what they can offer ideals and actuals are not the same that said it helps to consider them both
from a political science perspective the metric for merit in an election is fairly simple getting voted for is the objective standard for how well youre doing the road to reach the votes is the hard thing to measure and where much disagreement lies and of course what to do when then elected but the election itself is largely that simplein a sense this is because all elections are popularity contests that require a reputation good enough to entice people voting for you  although in some democracies the bar is very low due to other candidates being really bad or the rules being bent in one way or the other when xenuria tells us it doesnt want to work for this reputation it shows either some lack of understanding or a lack of desire to win a seat for whatever reasonnariya kentaya i gotta say i admire your persistance you seem like you genuinely want to help and i dont get why xenuria bites the hand trying to feed it your advice is sound mostly even if i think this is a case of pearls before swinetrue although i dont think we have to fear this particular candidate personally i find the thread entertainingthis is my version of driving slowly past a carcrash to get a good view a version where none gets physically hurt and where the centre of attention has actively persistently and willingly put itself in that position oh and its related to my field of study
fully support corbexx for csm 10hes done a great job as the wspace rep in csm 10
hi corbexx if you interested i am holding a csm x wormhole debate i have sent you a in game mail with the details
mike i tried talking to you in private about the issues between tyrant and cypher honestly i tried burying this when i came on board but it keeps coming up i even publicly thanked cypher for adding legacyofacapsuleercom to his podcast website even after he called me names for having a different opinion then him  cypher called anyone who is against the isboxer changes cnts and bitches  someone on podside threatened harm to tyrants family over some stupid eve argument  on podside on a live feed ccp seagull was called names id rather not repeat  cypher proceeded on 280 to say that tyrant is a hitler supporter really  there was about 6 requests that came in before our interview with ccp manifest asking us to push him to condemn or flat out ban cypher and anyone else involved for the comment about ccp seagull there is a growing call to have ccp police podcasts and blogs because of these statements on podside none of us want that you said with them i only stayed for a little while ive never done that with anyone else you commend cypher for adding legacyofacapsuleercom to his podcast website but dont even attempt to call out all of these other issues then take a swipe at us we brought you on because we liked you as a candidate and a person however now we feel a bit slighted for reasons i cant really discernedit oh and i forgot i happily donated a billion this to your magic school bus program months ago you would think that would buy a bit of goodwill
i am sorry you guys feel slightedi have been listening in and even taking part in the twitch portion of your casts for the last two funky and manifest as well as the time i was onrl precludes me from being able to stay full time for most casts but i do my best with the ones i do show up on i feel like a kid caught in the middle of a parents divorce i dont want to take side and i am willing to work with you both but each time mom and dad get together things blow up and not in a good wayeach podcast is different your loac has been doing great one guest formats podside is a different beast it is the equivalent of going out with a bunch of eve folks getting drunk and talking about whatever crosses their minds there are hours that have no eve in it others that are finer focus just like going to a sports bar for beers sometimes you watch the game other times the waitressesi said it before and ill say it again i mean no harm no disrespect trust me if i do want to disrespect you i will make it very clearmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
im more than willing to take a side here id say in this heated exchange mike is clearly the better manyou guys should take a moment to cool off before posting and also try communicating with a person about disputes or tension and see if theyre willing to work it out before you openly accuse them of anything two times out of three youll discover it was a misunderstanding and they meant no harm one time out of three they go out of their way to make reparations id wager mike would be in that last one out of three time permitting and if you had a good case for damages
i tried replying from my mobile but it apparently didnt sendmike  no problem i understand trying to stay out of this fight back and forth as i have tried doing as well but i have a vested interest with tyrant and also he doesnt seem to be the aggressor in this fight from trying to be objectivestaying neutral is a tough thing we just felt a bit slighted by your comment after we supported your candidacy podside has a few people who seem extremely hostile to other media and even to ccp employees the statements on a live podcast about ccp seagull are completely unforgivableyour a great csm candidate and you still have our 100 support sorry this dragged out longer then it should please do come onto our show whenever you want either on twitch or even on the live audio your always welcome

i read the article multiple times praying for one specific contribution you made to csm ix i was really hoping i could get that one measly question answered but unfortunately thats not the case the most i could find was this in reference to sovereignty mechanicsplanting your flag visually and in a way that matters invest if you work hard for something you are more likely to defend it feeling of achievement  you earned this you worked for it mastery being able to be good at something defending again thats the general sentiment of most of the playerbase and your platform seems to be simply a summary of general sentiment of most players at the lowest common denominatorprogodlegend posted on a reddit post that asked players what they expected out of the csm he wrote the following reply to somebody asking what he contributed to the csm during his two termsive been involved with most of the tiericide ship rebalancing in some shape or form and i was heavily involved in getting the jump freighter phoebe changes rolled back some if you want a few specific examples here are a couple there are more this is just off the top of my head the phantasm having a 5th low slot instead of 4 was my suggestion hacs having a high cap recharge rate was part my suggestion and part rises really good ideathese are great references to specific contributions progodlegend contributed to the csm in his tenure and it contrasts greatly to what you have posted the following weeks let alone your campaign platform on the first page of this threadplease core tell me what you contributed to csm ix specifically and why i or anybody else should cast our ballots for you i would love nothing more than to be confident that our one and only candidate from provi is representing us well and is being productive for the remainder of csm ix and will continue to do so if reelected to another term on csm x
you do realise you just answered your own question
what i am saying is hero can recruit players with the ships and skillpoints hero can purchase chars from the bazaar and the ships i dig hero i think they are absolutely cool however if you choose to be newbie centric then you automatically place yourself at a disadvantage skillpoint and asset wise however there are devices in which to circumvent the situation but asking for the game to be balanced around the style hero chose is not realistic eve is a cold dark and unfair universe the path you choose to go has its benefits and cost having a gazillion newbies gives you a great zerg force and thats a huge benefit but numbers should always have some counter otherwise he who blobs the hardest wins aka nc 10 and cfc

chance is a big part of what got me rolling solo bomber pvp and helping to restore sergaljerk to its glory as the best small gang covert ops corp in the game hes inspiring hes charismatic and he seems to have an attitude that suggests he really wants to improve the marketing of this game and get more players inmore players  more targets  more deliveries  yeschance your opinions on hisec are quite valid but bumping and hyperdunk setups having no consequence is something many players find toxic do you think its a good idea for suspicious activity that leads to setting up a gank to generate a suspect flag which offers the opportunity for counterganking to become a playstyleexample im flying a bowhead hauling thirty quadrillion isk worth of idunno compressed marauders some hoser slams a machariel into me and knocks me off my alignment i attempt to realign and he bumps me a second time at this point the machariel goes suspect giving him a choice risk being fired on or risk me warping off suicide ganking right now is too formulaic and player skill has almost completely left it at this point  everythings solved adding this element of risk and counterplay would put a lot of fun back into itsure i might ship my bumper down to a stabber but it would definitely not reduce the number of players suicide ganking heck it might become a good way to get fights in hisec too through escalation and baitbumping i get a couple bumps on with my mach and his stratios buddy uncloaks to try to countergank now weve got a fight on our hands and it has turned suicide ganking into a form of bidirectional pvp it would also open up the game to more new players that dont understand or like the concept of bumping having no consequence to the bumper which is absolutely stupid from the perspective of both law and physicsby the way i love your idea of a cloaking inhibitor this would create a very interesting shift in playstyle  but theres one problem gate camps  and cloaking being one of the few ways to escape certain styles of bubble camps just keep that in mind if the design goes forwardanother question what do you think about faction warfare plex farming personally i think there is a large part of the community that has a problem with it and i had an interesting thought about how to solve it what do you think about interdictors being able to launch warp disruption probes but only inside a faction warfare complex that an interdictor could normally enter its definitely not a hard counter to them warping away they can mwd out of the bubble unless you land a proper tackle but it certainly adds an element of risk to a playstyle that is currently much like suicide ganking very solved and very stagnant
thanks for the support
welcome to the racesomething ive been thinking about recently that id like your opinion on since youre clearly more of a miner than i am it occurred to me that mining including ice and gas huffing is one of the only industrial professions that requires you to be in space running an active module to do anything pi and industry run just fine while youre sleeping hauling at least requires you to be in space pi industry and hauling all scale up to the point where its very easy to get at least a linear benefit for each alt added to the task mining scales well because the amount of attention required for each individual boat is relatively small and more so in areas of space with huge rocksgiven that wouldnt any attempt to make mining more interactive reduce the ability of any individual players operation to scale up given that nullsec mining in particular seems to be done by a handful of people mostly because theres a strong bias against mining among most alliances what do you think the outcome would be would miners trade scalability for more interesting game play per bargeare my assumptions wrong thats always a possibility
greetings and thank youand of course i will try to go ahead and touch on everything and yea i did focus on mining there because is it the most active part of mining compared to the other indy related professions i dont feel that making mining more interactive will reduce a players scale personally in this case the one that i mentioned about a asteroid scattering and potentially dropping another rock to mine  its not reducing their operation if anything its giving them something new to look forward to it also adds to a nice little reward for mining the rock out to full say you completely mine out a rock of veldspar a much smaller veldspar appears and the units are small but its a different type that yields more trit  that is just a rough example or course so something like that i dont feel would reduce any operation it would simply be adding something rewarding and interesting and interactive if they dont want to go after that drop they dont have to but its there and possibly make it even so that if you dont start mining it in a certain time say an hour then that rock scatters with the rest and you loose it kinda like a normal drop if you were to get a wreck for killing a npc or player but again thats just a rough idea but i hope that answers your question on that partas for pi and moon mining the two passive income yea we do have that but there are also other ways to make passive income as well ie looking at say research agents or even selling kill rights yea i consider those two passive as well although setting up a planet and a moon do take a lot more effort imopi  you need to open your planet view while in space in order to place command centers cloaked or pos up and then once you get in place you start trying to scan the planets to find what you need and then place command centers and your buildings and whatnot this is time consuming more than anything imo but the end result is passive income so you cant really complain theremoon mining  this is the same as pi but instead of scanning moons you shoot a probe at a moon and wait xminutes depending on the probe you are using and then your results pop up from there you set up your pos and moon harvester silos some defense and fuel it up this too is tedious but its also passive income so cant complain too much there either though you do have to calculate the cost of running the pos and the profits youre getting to see if its worth it so theres that if your not taking that into account then you could be paying more for the pos than what you are mining which isnt a good thing there so anyways i probably went on a tangent there  i can write a lot when i get going  but in any case i hope it answered your question in regards to the miningthanks
well you definitely have my vote for the election about the improvements you want to push on the mining im all in favor of improvement mining hasnt really changed since the game launchedimho tho it is because its a good system alltho it would benefit from a minigame that would improve revenue and lower it if you dont play iton the minigame any industry needs tweaking to keep it running at max effciency so id like to see that you constantly have to adjust your mining gear bypass hard rock direct to soft rock  the bonus ore you propose for mining out a rock could for example be implemented as ore samples that scatter when depleting a roid add the ore samples into your ships analyzer the minigame and your beams get better modulation yielding more orealso about the defense of mining ships imho theyre good as they are one on one they shouldnt be able to win against a combat ship its a commercial ship ffs combat ships should have free reign over them but with a friend watching your back properly fitted they guarantee your friend a killwhat couldshould be added tho is that asteroid fields become claimable allow corporations to set up mini poses in asteroid fields they dont have a bubble but they do allow you to anchor guns and hangars it provides more safety for miners if you add a mining array it might provide some passive income and mining in a claimed field would give you a criminal timer for thieving and the guns would open up on you big pro it would further more small scale conflict in the game over one more resource hey were allready fighting over moons and planets why not over asteroid beltsmy five cents 
greetings thank you for the support as welljust going to touch on the suggestions as well which they are all interesting suggestions i also agree that mining has never really changed we did get new visuals which are nice but it didnt add anything UFFFDgameplayUFFFD wise the minigame sounds interesting with regards to the ore that can drop after mining an asteroid being ore samples that you have to analyze before you can actually mine it does sound interesting i would like to play with that idea further though as for the adjusting i am not sure about that one because if you get the t2 strip miners you have the crystals which do in a sense UFFFDtweakUFFFD your strip miner so that you can yield more unless i am reading that wrong on that part i think thats fine the way that it ison the defensive mining ships im not saying they should be able to win over a combat ship but more rather adding a UFFFDget awayUFFFD defense for the instance that i stated adding an extra high slot that can say be used for a nos to drain your target and better your chance to get away it would add more flexibility in my opinion it would be nothing more than that you could have a friend watch your back but a ganker in highsec for instance isnt going to go after a mining ship that has combat defense with them well they can but its not usually likely unless they have friends close by they would have to be offgrid somewhere or docked which by the time they come out to defend you it can be too late if their fast enough at least in this case you would have more UFFFDoptionsUFFFDinteresting idea on the passive mining however im not to keen on the idea of making mining passive and belts claimable like that belts should be open to everyone mining should remain active as in you have to be in space and activity mining the ore in space
well consider it a base configuration after that youd have to start the minigame open the controls of your minerseg it could show you a scan of the asteroids youre mining akin to the pi overview would also make the ore scanner more viable d which could show you harder and softer spots harder  husk softer  valuable ore so youd have to pinpoint your laser to where to mine and allow miners to amp their lasers but do it to much and it results in heat damage this way active miners get rewarded and afkminers get penalised i live in lowsec and i mine their happily truly no boost needed hulk with cloack  uncatchable yes you sacrifice some revenue for reduced risk mining in a venture is riskless and if you engage a squad of procurers fitted with neut and ecm drones youre nuts imho any change right now would make barges opwel my point of view on it is that it drives conflict the passive income is what we fight over in null and low we fight over moons in low and empire we fight over pocos staking our claim and fighting over it is what makes eve come alivei do agree not all belts should be claimable but you can limit it perfectly to sec status of the system eg only 7 and belowon top of it it fits perfectly in the storyline of the empires losing power and by only allowing more easily destructible structures to be deployed it would be a boon to small gang warfare
ashterothi you just jumped to the top of my voting list

dear sion kumitomocould you please post your 45 page summary of dynamics in 00 and how things interact  because csm x might have an opportunity to influence ccpgames new sov mechanics and currently you are the most qualified csm 9 member that understands nullsec by posting it we could have a better and open discussion that helps along the processregards a freelancer
why is he a jerk because he cuts through the bs and gives you straight talk more csm representatives like sion pleaseand sion straight up owned xander and the other selfpromoting donothing csm members which was great
oh and does ali aras shop at talbots
grrrrrrrrrrr goooooooooooooooooonim voting for youfix heavy missiles
if im about ill try and be there for the town hall i could do with knowing as soon as possible though
hi angrod if your interested i am holding a wormhole debate for the csm x election i have sent you a in game mail with the details
hi bane if your interested im going to be holding a csm x wormhole debate i have sent you a in game mail about the details
ill go so far to agree with you that interceptors online do not make for fun gameplay especially that particularly nasty bout of nothingbutcrowsrunningawayfrommorecrows meta the game had going on a year ago but the solution isnt to penalize all frigates notallfrigates etci respectfully disagree with pretty much everything else you said in fact ill flip it right back around  if youre annoyed that your battleship gets ripped apart by frigates maybe you should get a caracal to sit with you instead of wishing your ship were immune to frigates having support and involving more people in gameplay is a good thing rather than making it impossible for people to interact unless they are this tallalso have you tried including battlecruisers in a roam comp lately i have its ugly
theyre all difficult i tip my hat to you i worked in pembrokeshire taking school groups climbing for a year and it nearly killed me deprived would be an understatement to describe many areas in south wales im sure the skills you need for dealing with 30 unruly welsh kids and their parents will put you in good stead for the csm
fcons rent is past due please forward this to your leadership
its not personal but the general feeling is that battleships are no longer a viable choice as with battlecruisersflavour of the month at the moment is ishtars and the more i see ishtar fleets countering everything and anything thrown at them the more i see the only counter is to run more ishtars vs them with the same fit doesnt really make for a decent game either oh another ishtar fleet lets get the ishtars out again gameplay gets boring after a whilewith regards to immunity no not immune less vulnerable to i appreciate if someone rocks through with 30 frigates its gonna make for a small gang of hurt but that is not what i am talking about and i am not suggesting that you could sit there for 4 months and hit a battleship with a group of 10 and it never even start to crack but i feel there should be limitations of each ship with regards to what and how they interact with other ships much like real military shipsfrigates for fast support scouting and tackle cruisers for more damage and some ancilliary supportbattlecruisers for the real meat and then battleships and carriers on upin essence to make a successful fleet you would be looking at targetting specific classes of ships you would have to make the fleet with those targets in mind andor take a nice rounded fleetthese roles need to be more clearly defined in the game and hence the suggestion for limiting weapon size damage vs hull sig radiusi want to be able to pvp in battleships again i want the frigates to play just as important a role in pvp as they do now but without the ability to nuke down a 3billion isk omnitanked pvp battleship with little or no ability to counter them without reshipping or have a counter fleet losses should be relativeone suggestion that was made was point defense weapon slots ie a module that isnt low mid or high that gave specific defense vs certian types of weaponssystems etc there are many ways to broach these problems and its about finding the best one that fits best into the gameplay mechanics at hand and the needs and wishes of the populous in some respects its a square peg for a round hole itll need a little shaping and pushing to get it through but it can and will go through
i think in regards to strategic cruisers hes just suggesting it would be nice if the tengu loki and legion covert ops variants were at least capable of doing the same sort of damage as combat recons lest wspace become combat recons online they could then fulfill a heavy tackle role whilst still being a contributor on the damage output and the combat recons can lay down the ewar
behind the silk screens of a chinese wall which you get in the csm ndas etc you have to be able to divorce yourself from ingame allegiances pet hates eg the corax etcetera if presented with evidence by fozzies metrics for example and do whats best for the game andor communitynow sometimes this may mean for example if the roteus needs a pg nerf to balance its uber tank and the evidence and arguments are ample i will have to accept that a nerfed proteus cannot mount 5 x large smartbombs if i have to give up my smartbombing proteus in order to see viable cloaky legion dps and loki dps then so be it i understand what balance isthe constituency can be quite rabid and kneejerky at least on the forums cf the last time something happened to wormholes i think ccp has made it clear they have a vision for eve and will do what they think is needed  the csm is there to moderate the process and provide feedback ccps effort in pr have been abysmal lately lockageddon so the csm should be there to provide a pressure valve
i think we can stratios the stratios here which sort of 600 dps  60k ehp and sentries for damage projection your cloaky prot has a dps envelope of 250550 700 and 60140k ehp right now balanced yes you can fit rails to cloaky proteiiwith decent tank and decent damage projection and reasonable speedtry fitting a cloaky arty loki and see how you go thats my point to my mind theres no real competition from lokis and legions with stratios and proteii you may disagree but to my mind upping the cloaky lokis potential dps envelope from 220270 to 220400 isnt beyond the realms of rational
1 would vote
im going to read that as i will try to get you because tromping into the csm saying give me this is probably not going to end wellotherwise 1 for a solid and engaginglywritten platformquestion given that ccp has said that sov is next on the menu what are you going to bring to the table on that subject i know its not your forte but the odds are approximately 100 that youre going to be in real and virtual rooms with ccp developers over an extended period of time discussing the subject and with only 14 people on the csm theres not much room for abstention so what are you hoping to bring to the table
im seeing this alot from people for some reason everyone thinks ccp will be doing nothing but sov or null stuff and its just not the case there will be tonnes of other stuff going on along side this poss roles npe balancing stuff loads of little things the list goes on another example of this was last summit which was null focused had a grand total of 2 hours out of 4 days of meetings
just for the record i dont believe that im essentially asking what he brings to a subject which will come up and which is outside his core competencybut thanks for the clarification
thanks for posting my interview charantei will also be guestfcing and answering questions about my platform and campaign during the spectre fleet at sunday 2359 eve time approximately 7 pm estafter that i plan to spend a few days vacationing in lowsec and fw so i can answer justforcrits questions on lowsec with slightly less ignoranceafter that what will i do next stay tuned and find out
friendly bump is this allowed quafe
hi csm  i am running a new thread asking for thoughts on having a central account management facility to help in particular people who have and operate more than one paid subscription account i took my idea to ccp who suggested i run this past the csm i would appreciate  even in brief  if the council could vocalize their thoughts by following this urlthreadto be honest i am looking for all input as i feel there is validity to thisregardsmultiple accounts in need of a unified account management facility
i tried this being diplomatic thing today and it went something like thisthem what do you think of bot miningjen back in the day i would have been tempted to sniff their ip address and deliver a program to their ram which would nuke their boot sector and partially flash their biosthem do you think that the order is rightjen i think that if you do not enjoy mining with its social and relaxing aspects then there are plenty of other things to do in evethem so you do believe in the orderjen the order is a nonfactor in my life everyone is entitled to be a part of what ever cult or religion they choosethem  
dont know if this is relevantbut i think alliances should have a lp store system like the big npc corps you can trade in the npc corps lp at a 31 changeable rate
quotei think we can say we do not want xenuria to burn we just want someone that knows what they are doing as a csm member xenuria wont answer the honest questions from a few people and he claims they are trolls or insults if he can not or will not answer honestly then why would we want him as a csm member answer we wouldntquotefair enough however i still dont see why you are asking questions to xenuria or even care about what he wants to do on the csm reasoning behind this is you are in goons so you allready know who you must vote for and also your guys spot is a guaranteed spotbut who knows you might actualy be interested in this csm competition quoteyou know i can and do vote for who ever i want so do most goonsi care and ask him questions because his stated goal is to fix a system thats not beoken in his eyes it is but thats not why we have the csm it is here to help ccp bounce features off up coming patches for the game not hey how can we make the csm better i want and so do most of the eve players someone that wants to improve the eve onlive not csm onlineif he wants to fix the csm he needs to go get a job with ccps legal team and rewrite the purpose of the csmphone is on the fits might fix this post when i get near my computer again
your evaluation from a purely political science perspective is accurate  elections assume that popularity and merit are one in the same therefore when someone indicates they wish to have a meritocracy rather than a popularity contest they necessarily must be using a different definition of merit and by extension not wish to have an elective process at all it therefore follows that xenuria is running on a platform of eliminating the elective process in favor of having a csm appointed accoring to some unexplained measure of merit by some undetermined individual body or process while this is a good clarification you run into a new problem  we do not live in an ideal world people vote the way they vote and no amount of electoral reform can stop the electorate from voting on the factors they deem important to vote on to do so would in fact destroy the purpose of having electionsas i explained above it seems that you are running on a platform of objecting to the process of election for csm candidates this conclusion is simply unavoidable based on your stated positions while nonelective processes are not automatically without merit  elections are not automatically good just because they are elections and nonelective procedures have certain theoretical merits actual practice in history tends to indicate that since we do not live in an ideal world elective process is the best thing available to usit is however possible that the csm is an exception given your objection to the realities inherent in elections who do you feel should appoint the csm should certain ccp devs do so if so which ones
i think at no point should ccp be in charge of hand picking or selecting who should be on the csm just because a system is flawed in no way means it should be thrown out in favor of something even more flawed
but then later you say thisthese two statements are somewhat at odds with each other in the first you deny that the metric for merit in elections are popularity and your reputation as a candidate while in the other you implicitly acknowledge that very system and states that it is better than a system not based on popularity and reputation as a candidatewhich statement do you think best represents your opinionskiryen obannon my quote and comment wasnt meant as a correction but an elaboration sorry if it seemed otherwise
instead of playing shoots and ladders with logic how about you ask an actual question about my candidacy if you have nothing to ask i have nothing to say to you
you dont have to be so mean when someone points out youre logic is broken i like the guy hes honest with you dont be such an ass just because you can not keep your own platform straight also he did ask you a question i trust you can find it hint it has a question mark at the end of it
maybe we are looking at this the wrong way in regards to dreads in high sec instead of escalating high sec action why dont we limit towers to medium size to make tower taking more compeditive just a thought
tora seriously you couldnt recognise evil if it slapped your arseyou change your mind so much i am suprised you even know what day it isvote tora for csm x if you want no response to questions and no idea why he is there damn he doesnt even know why
that does look excellent open and book marked to read it with more sleep under my belt
man you lost it hardin short eve is a game ccp is the company with earning money in mind being a company you need to be professional and people you work with need to be professional too signing a nda is a rl pleadge to a company that comes far before every in game problem personal oppinion or ingame pledge bad luck for youdosis facit venenum by paracelusit is the dose that makes the poisonas in medical druggood overdosebadmancsm are for input of oppinions and ideas to reflect the playerbase bevor changes might be done they can decide nothing and the influence is limited worse sometimes they are surpised by the facts ccp created but are powerless to change something and are bound by the nda
as always code is not in the slightest way coherentso if you did not take the at seriously why should one believe you mean this really serious because you said so codies said theyd take at serious was that a lie that where some other codiesmore than one time codies hide behind the lie roleplay more than any other of of postings writen by codiediplomats your posting here are really officical comments from a codemember thank you for for confirming some of my posts the whole discussion about why code ganks falls back in placeas lucas already pointed out your position is solely based on codewishes ignoring and rejecting the vaild wishes of other paying eve players there are miners and pvelers the reason why doesnt need to bother you as a player or a codie worse as a csm candiate i expect you to consider and respect them to the concept of respect is something codies have a problem with respect reading forum and blogposts want respect but vastly disrespect others that does not workanother thing is that you like many others overestimate the influence csm can take ccp will listen to advise thy get from players but in the end ccp will decide what is going to happen as lucas stated the csm should not be biased to one type of playstyle but to all possible playstyles the whole point of csm is not to make eve a better place the point is to make eve interesting for a great variety of playstiles therefore constructive thoughts for all playstyles are required you are not elected to be president or governer that makes decissions you will be less than a lobbyist cause you lack incentivesthis is not about code matters it is about csm stuff if sabriz really gets the job you wont be there its even assumed that she will handle that on her account to get my vote she would need to think out of the codebox as i worked through this thread she appears not willing to do soas per postbumpingsabriz if you think those bumps of lucas did you do any good without good answers you are mistaken we will see if codies have enough alts to boost you and even if you get the job you might be surprised how powerless and without influence you are
mate if u wish to nail me on something by all meansi am extremly hapoy u picked the things tht are so crucial out of my eve24 piece no matter how vaque remmeber nda they are so incredibly crucial i coudl write a whole page about it even now u mention those to represent null sec and make sure they dont screw that up omg u want to hear soecific stuff i made it possible to and so on if anything i hate that attitude scroll up and u will find a reference of sion one of the main goon csm members ofc thats just his opinion on me i hate too sell my self and i have shown i dont need tooi hve listed countless times what i am involved with if u watch my eveamsterdam speech it holds a frw including pi acces too all in null big thing for provi also trony on cva forums posteded earlier this hear stuff a csm is for me not having 14 individual agenda s to get their name on a change it s the dead of a team tbhagain i offer too convoy me speak to me on comms as 150 peopel do daily while we talk csm and eve
core youre misrepresenting what im trying to do hereit is not my intention to nail you on anything i simply want to know what youve done on csm to warrant reelection ive asked now many times over instead of answering my question headon with specific examples of what youve contributed to csm specifically as i have requested youve merely mentioned broad discussions all csm members are involved with and claimed credit for all of the csms contributionsyou also say you hate to sell yourself and claim you dont need to which can be chalked up to admittance of the suggestion i made earlier that your campaign isnt that of substance but simply that of purely geographical representationyou keep deflecting and dodging i find that offensive and deceptive especially when asking such a simple and benign question what was a simple personal exercise to keep assurance in you as the representative i and so many voted for has turned this personal feeling of doubt in your representation of us as players to the csm that you state you hate i ask for one specific example of meaningful contribution you point me to your eve amsterdam speech which is simply a review of what the csm does in general i ask again you point me to an endorsement of another csm member which is completely offtopic i ask a third time and you reference the cva forums which i and so many others are barred from viewingyoure also insistent on a private conversation why you cant articulate and address my doubts in your candidacy in a public forum for discussion such as this one is doubly as concerning than your nonspecific platform and lack of apparent track record which you have had many opportunities to elaborate onill ask again in addition to a few more additional questions what have you contributed to csm ix specifically what do you intend of contributing specifically to csm x and why havent you fostered a public discussion and opted to post to gatedwalls of the cva forums and wish to speak to dissenters privately rather than address their concerns in a public discussionas i said before i would love nothing more than to be once again confident that the one and only representative to csm from providence is representing us well as a coalition and as a general playerbase as a whole
a god amongst men 1 on my voting listthe only reason not to vote for him is that he will not be able to dedicate as much time helping the new bros who want to brave null secnot bad bloke for a aussie which is also a big plus
i actually came here to read the sky thread however once done laughing i spotted this thread1 like endorse and whatever else i can do to approve this person for csm xthe game needs more people like sugar and everything ive read this year says you should be 1 on everyones list well not mine as i have to vote for hero people but certainly in top 3 
a campaign ad for suger kyle she has my vote
with endie on the csm working with manfred and ccp i cannot think of a better team to boost eve into the direction of succesendie is by far a man that has done anything what eve has to offer and knows just about anything you can imagenif there is one man i want to vote for its you and i am 110 sure he is the best man for the job
im not aware of that or do you mean that i should form a corp and invite other people in it so that they can ruin my eve ambitions ridicule me in the process and that nothing else is going to be in there for me that this is the right way to do it in this case i certainly have answered my question and given a nice reason not to form corps or only to form personal corps and limit interactionfun fact not even gankers and advocates for more group play and interaction do this there are so many 1man corps of gankers and many of them even stay in npc corps to avoid just what i described above  and most likely organize in loose groups outside the disadvantaging formats provided by the game now someone explain me is this also wrong in so many ways or is this the right way all of a sudden and it just depends on on which side you are whether you play the game wrong or right would be interesting to see the candidates opinion on that
got my vote  good luck
from newbros experience all the way to null logistics and from low sec improvement to sov null manny seems to have a well rounded agenda as well as the experience after almost a decade of playing this game to ensure that he will have a positive contribution to this years csm1 vote
a fearsome man on the battlefield and behind the curtains but a genius on everything related to eve onlinevote this man into that seat and eve will become a much better exprience for all playing itgoodluck sir manfred you have my axe o
glad to be of service o7i am concerned the eve codebase doesnt provide enough support for bump triggers  plus there are so many interactions naturally at gates and stations that innocent players could get flagged without having done anything wrongccps attempt to address this with their latest higgs anchoring rigs is a step in the right direction providing modules that give players ways to avoid bumpgriefers but still requires planning and tradeoffs by capsuleers id also like to see changes to the security standings system though its a very sensitive area and should be treated carefully this is a very good point and not something i had considered perhaps a more balanced structure would simply cause all cloaks to slowly draw more and more capacitor the longer someone is cloaked in system so a transport passing through for a minute wouldnt really be affected but an afk player would be caught with his stylish grimdark pants down i literally know nothing about fw balance so i cant really comment intelligently here it sounds good in theory but its also counterintuitive id rather see ccp make changes to the way rewards are determined than to upend the meta entirely with a singular exception to longstanding rules about empire space
 ah alright so i did misunderstand that thanks for explaining that there for me i see where you are going with that now now that does sound interesting there and it does make sense though it sounds like instead of a minigame that it would be simi
yayyou have my full support and i vote this will be cool as well cuz i have also had ideas over the years but not had any real way of finding someone to suggest them to i did push kinda hard to one candidate years ago about ship skins and its finally coming so ideas do get serious treatment by ccp via csm again so cool and there arent that many ppl who have the qualifications to serve on csm but you definitely have them in spadeslemme know if you need anything done to further your candidacymintaki
thats great and thanks mintaki for the support 
thats a good middle ground imho  alltho id only give it to the procurerskiff since those are the ones designed for operation in hositle territory well i think it would make for a more granular eve it would give smaller corporations a chance to claim something make it easier to challenge other corporations look at it as an intermediate step between empire and low secand it would encourage cooperation between carebears and pvpers to work together more it would be an ideal addition for small gang warfare outside of fw
yea i agree there id like to see it on the skiff and procurer as well macinaw and retreiver was the first that had popped into my head to write as an example lol giving a chance to smaller corps and alliance that does go into how i feel about nullsec currently with how stagient it is its very hard for a smaller groups to claim anything with the way it is right now unless you know one of the main power blocks you cant expect to really go very far which is discouragingwhat i would like to see on that regards is to get rid of those power blocks a lot of them have systems just for the sake of having them because they can meaning they dont actually use them what i would like to see on that end is that if a system isnt actually being used by the holders alliance then that sov should drop or something to that extent thats a rough idea that i had for a bit and something like that would open the doors for smaller groups wanting to claim their stake it would also help if coalitions were recognizable ingame i did place these maps side by side to show the difference
i dont agree with the pi templates idea i assume it is to lead ultimately to share templates like overview settings i consider it a minigame of sorts and those who play it best get the best results forgetting links is a nub move that deserves the face palm upon discoveryall other things are good thanks for running
i have a question in regards to being a participant in the eve media community with all of the leaks the controversy surrounding several eve media participants going all the way back to the start of csm9 and now with the latest drama surrounding funkybacon do you think its wise to run i personally as a content creator think at this point in time its gonna set you back as a content creator in time as well as in having a voice that can speak his mind openly without the nda lurking in the backgrounddont you think being a content creator would serve the community a lot better then you could as a csm 
some other csm candidates have been discussing me and transparency of late i felt it only right that i added to the discussion
ive asked this question to other eve media participants be it podcasters bloggers or video casters so i will ask you the same questioni have a question in regards to being a participant in the eve media community with all of the leaks the controversy surrounding several eve media participants going all the way back to the start of csm9 and now with the latest drama surrounding funkybacon do you think its wise to run i personally as a content creator think at this point in time its gonna set you back as a content creator in time as well as in having a voice that can speak his mind openly without the nda lurking in the backgrounddont you think being a content creator would serve the community a lot better then you could as a csm 
in your op you state that youve been playing since 2003 and have played in high null and wormholes and your stats support that you began really pvping in 2012 based on the boards it seems that you either did a ton of pve from 0312 or you didnt really play much until 12 you have a couple losses with the first in 06 in gonditsa then a loss in 08 then a couple in 11 and then you really get in full swing in 12 being quite active with ssc this is all based on not having a complete list of your charactersaltswhateverweve never interacted that im aware so i dont know how much experience you have in the wormhole political community not that it isnt dissimilar to slinging a plate of spaghetti against a wall but you and a couple other wormholers have recently come out of the woodwork the last couple days and some want to know more about youi dont play much at all anymore but i do enjoy the csm campaigns each year the csm is a great opportunity to impact the game and it is a neat concept within a gaming community that said i invested a very long time in this game and a very large amount of time with wormholes since 09 and i pay close attention to the players that intend to represent this communityplease expand on the following1 what is a detailed background on your gameplay experience since youve started playing the game2 have you ever been involved in the political landscape or corporate leadership within eve3 how do you intend to reach out to the playerbase you wish to represent4 why did you recently decide that you wanted to represent the community5 what is your experience with poscorporate role mechanics6 what is your experience with t3capitalsishtarslogistics class ships7 what is your experience with mission runningmining8 what is your experience with researchmanufacturingtrade9 what if any is your experience with sova what are your thoughts on your current wormhole opponents corbexx angrod tf and baneb why should players vote for you over them
here you go proclus diadochu1 what is a detailed background on your gameplay experience since youve started playing the gamei first started playing this game in 2003 when a friend of mine introduced the game to me we mainly spent our time in high sec mining killing rats etc when my friends moved on i moved with them i still kept coming back to the game from time to time running missions and killing rats etcanother set of friends decide to play eve they got themselves set up in null space and got sovereignty of several systems out in catch  we did pvp mining industry etc we had good fun in trying to keep the space we hadafter that alliance folded due to a few reasons ii got playing other games i came back a few times again running missions in high sec and chilling out i started to get involved with the communities in eve like rvn ganked and eve radios lemming leaps this lead me to join rvb which i had a great time in and taught my a lot about small gang and solo pvp in evean old friend of mine got involved with eve uni at the time he later joined up with sleeper social club i started talking to him and got interested in the wormhole space so i started to get training up my skills and learning about wormhole space life once my skills was good i joined up to sscin ssc i have took part in many fight and sieges often been the reason they started i like hunting down targets in wormholes and null sec the roles i do in fleets are often ewar interdicting and combat hauling no bullets no pew pew2 have you ever been involved in the political landscape or corporate leadership within evenot in eve i have ran guilds and similar roles as csm in other games like star wars galaxies i like the community and meta game in eve it provides a richness and life to the game3 how do you intend to reach out to the playerbase you wish to representwell i am arranging for there to be a wormhole debate later next week only one other candidate has got back so far it will be held on our ts details of this will be going out to the wormhole community this weekend later today i have a interview arranged with capstable there are other things in progress as well4 why did you recently decide that you wanted to represent the communityi have actually been thinking about doing it over the last couple of years i have been wanting to invest in to the game and its community after talking to some friends i decided to go ahead and run this year knowing that there is going to be some fundamental changes to the game we have to make sure we get good representation and voices for the wormhole community into the csm5 what is your experience with poscorporate role mechanicsin our home i run a pos for myself and a few others i know how much of they are a pain at times getting config starbase to sort out one small problem on your pos could mean been able to offline others as for corp roles that i have had i havent had any we have a good team of people in the corp theres been no reason to have roles i help people out with there problems i understand the mechanics of it all6 what is your experience with t3capitalsishtarslogistics class shipsthe only ones i dont fly of those is capitals and to be honest i have no desire to fly them i fly strategic cruisers drone boat like gilias vexor nay issue etc i fly hics and dics i fly logistics from time to time sub cap wise i can fly mostnow are ishtars and strategic cruisers op well yes when you have 100 in a fleet like you have in null sec but in wormholes space when a fleet size is 3050 caps t3 logi support for a big op then no they not which is one problem we are going to have soon there going to get nerfed because of null sec we need to make sure they are still viable for us in wormhole space7 what is your experience with mission runningminingbeen running missions lvl 14 and mining since i started dont do them as much now that im in wormhole space we run sites huff gas etc when i have done them i have found the to be fairly repetitive same as most mmos would be nice to see the missions revamped put some new life into them as they are what alot of people do in eve8 what is your experience with researchmanufacturingtradenever got into the industry side of eve i do a bit of trading and hauling nothing major9 what if any is your experience with sovwe all know theres no sovereignty in wormholes years ago when i was in null sec we was fighting to protect our space eventually we lost the space ahh good old times in drow mechanics wise i understand the processes of it all it seems a bigger pain than sieging and evicting a 20 tower wormhole
thank you for taking the time to answer my questions  look forward to your capstable interview and i was chatting with corbexx about your wormhole debate last night and looking forward to following that venue aswell id encourage you to increase your visibility in the wormholes and fi subforums and if you havent already id encourage you to begin reaching out to wormhole corps and alliances to meet with them on their comms for interviewschatsbest of luck
there seems to be allot of  well confusion i supposethere is a few different areas of multiboxing that tend to get blended do people own multiple accounts yes do people play the game with multiple accounts yesthe question is how do they play the game with multiple accounts specifically how do they do itthe main situation is that the typical human cant do two things at once without assistance from programs machines automationnow a person can train themselves to be that good switching accounts back and forth to input commands but people have a limit to the speed of doing that before mistakes are made when you get to this level a person then needs assistance to reduce the mistakes made this is where automation comes in lets talk about three basic commands approach f1 targetif you have three accounts switching back and forth to input these three commands takes time skill and there is a lag where mistakes can be made i may be able to tell my three accounts to approach but i may forget to hit f1 i may forget to target i may forget to do one of 100 things we all see this as acceptable in the gamethe problem i have and i can suppose most of the community does is when the person uses a piece of software something to automate those three commands so they dont have to think about it reducing mistakes and making the person a more effective pilot three issues come up with this aspect of gameplay and it is a method of gameplay the player is relying on automation to multiply their effectiveness meaning that there is no requirement for them to train to obtain the skills to manage three accounts as all they would have to do is now manage one and the others will follow in suit it should makes them a worse pilot but whether it does or not does not matter as their margin of error has shrunk to almost zero their total focus is just on one single screen pressing a single button and not mass managing multiple accounts and inputting commands to them all the software handles that since the margin shrinks to zero they can multiply their effectiveness by increasing their account numbers beyond what any normal human can manage the automation removes the person from interacting with the game as a whole there is no need for grouping no need for organization you show up with your army a single person with their own mercenary force to perform a role that takes a organized group months to train for done flawlessly every time the best way to handle a situation is by dealing with it yourself forget the group you can handle all of one aspect of the game yourself want your own fleet with no mistakes make 30 accounts and manage them all at once no arguments no yelling no organizing its just you with your army of  slaves automated multiboxing has been a plague on many games from people taking over areas of a game themselves lineage to communities banning the practice absolutely in order to force people to organize and interact project 1999 weve seen armies of multiboxers in games and the only people that like the multiboxers with the automated software is the multiboxer everybody else sees it as spoiling the game play from pvp arenas full of solo multiboxed pvp armies to the handling of entire aspects of a game due to the ability for a perfect play bombing wings in eve now does anybody have a issue with people playing multiple accounts no do they have issues with people playing multiple accounts through a piece of software i do i cant talk to you i cant interact with you i cant group with you because you do everything perfectly alone with no need for my help my interaction my capabilities my own skills screw you up there is nothing i can do better than you because your software inputs are faster than me there is no need to relay a command to me because it takes 3 seconds to get to me over coms and for me to react when you have already targeted shot and probably killed the threat essentially i am relegated to a support role while you direct perform star and handle the entire main stage of the performance if i was not there it would not matter as you would log in another account add it into your input program and become more effective without me i have zero issues with people having 2 3 4 7 10 200 accounts i dont care if they log them in at once to perform a project i have a issue with them being able to be better than everybody by using a computer input program to replace me now if you have 200 accounts 200 monitors and are able to interact with them all manually then damn you are good but for you yourself to press one button perform the task of those other 199 people and never have any error or mistake made but your own you kill the interaction and soul of social gameplay because why socializejust my feelings on it with that said what part of the multiboxing community do you represent what is it specifically do you want done or seen for eve i havent really read an actual stance
amen this is probably the best statement ive read on this subject sharing the concern i have on this topic well written phoenix and i sincerely hope that any players that join the csm to represent the playerbase share your concern for the protection of eves social gameplay
ive asked this question to other eve media participants be it podcasters bloggers or video casters so i will ask you the same questioni have a question in regards to being a participant in the eve media community with all of the leaks the controversy surrounding several eve media participants going all the way back to the start of csm9 and now with the latest drama surrounding funkybacon do you think its wise to run i personally as a content creator think at this point in time its gonna set you back as a content creator in time as well as in having a voice that can speak his mind openly without the nda lurking in the backgrounddont you think being a content creator would serve the community a lot better then you could as a csm 
true im not mittens right hand man i dont run a rental empire i dont rat in a carrier or even an afktar but i have done my time in nullsec on 3 occasions from stain to delve to nc dot like i said i will be supporting and depending on ccps willingness to listen providing feedback to them on occupancy based sov this is because i believe that the game needs more reasons for people to fight and two whole regions of space being permanently transferred in an instant from one rental empire to another to perhaps never be utilised doesnt sit right with meif youre familiar with the r3poz story an exbugry member has been part of that this stuff should be happening more often occupany based sov should be a catalyst for conflict right now a band of neer dowells terrorises a ratting empire and stops a whole region ratting for a month and nothing changes except the small band of aggressors get ground down by sheer numbers while the farmers take a break for a month and pay nc dot to evict their annoyance in the future if you dont farm the region constellation or individual systems enough they should fall off the back of your truck no monthlong breaks while you rat blue space safely  you wont be going back to your home your assets and towers will be lost your landlords impoverished and more and more predators will move in sure it will force people to play the game smarter but nullsec is boring as hell safe as hell and empty where my experience comes in from wormholes is being able to see a vision of a game where you take a calculated risk every time you get out of pos in a wormhole your ship can be killed no warning no chance yet we thrive and prosper and we develop skills in pvp pve flying fighting making money and getting over the sense of whiny entitlement i see a lot of nullsec as being entirely too risk averse and preserving their entire way of life is about maintaining security blankets versus bringing on more fights more content more excitement as a wormbro ill be there to ask questions and drill down into the motives and reasons behind why people do what they do and why ccp thinks that one thing is better than another why one choice in balancing is better than this or that theres a lot in this game where the consequences of changing one thing can impact greatly on many others not that you see that from most feedback which is onedimensional qq the other way to put it is this  i have no vested interest in the current state of nullsec or indeed wormholes if it looks sensible i wont have fear of losing income prestige status and territory holding me back from saying its good not that the current csms nullsec representatives seemed overly negative about the recent changes far from it
hi trinkets i am sorting out a wormhole debate next week if you want to take part i have sent you the details in game
im curious do you understand why wardec organizations run so many decks at one also what are your experiences with wardecs in gameyouve heard about it so that makes you qualified to talk about it i always laugh when i hear about how easy bumping is if the target has not taken precautions against it yes its easy if on the other hand theyre flying with inertia stabs are in and fenirnomad or smaller ship or have a webbing alt or microjumpdrive fit it is far from easy in addition to at least passable skill at manual piloting bumpers have to contend with glitches that cause them to pass through ships without touching them and issues with bumping through grid walls and having targets literally dissappear in space without logging off add the complexities of bumping for hyperdunking and no this is not an easy role if any sore of precautions are takeni guess pve game mechanics that benefit corporations might be a good idea i feel like its kinda tackling a symptom of the problem than the actual problem though the problem being bad leadership in corps if you post about that in fi i will support it but i cant vote for someone who demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about the subjects he complains about no bumping is not allowed on these forums except in very specific cases i cant be bothered to look them up right now if you want to bump a thread encourage discussion in that threadfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
so problems for walking in stations are 1 animations and life like reactions to other players2 a purpose to walk in stations aside from gambling and socializing3 limited dev man power4 rpers would never leave station5 limited cash to fund development6 lack of servers to run it1 so we know eve can make great game trailers why cant that translate into nuanced character animations hell why couldnt eve make a scifi tv series like clear skies using in game animation and make their own library of nuanced animations entertain people make a revenue stream train more writers train more animators think star wars rebels but for eve id watch it pay per episode even2 so hangin with friends and besting people in games of chance or skill aint your thing how about opening your own corp or alliance hq on a promenade which also double as a store front for your corps own unique ships and equipment tiericide was good now make eve like a 4x technological space race someone wants to sell cap boosters with a larger capacity then the norm they research and sell it always a wip always getting better always a time and isk sink also gives us a reason to have our own paint jobs since we could have custom ships based off old hulls add pirate agents in some of the high end bars that capsuleers might frequent even in high sec hidden agent missions off the books rd espionage with hacking off computer terminals or relays3 games like fallout and even dying light are allowing user generated content into their games why not an mmo it involves and inspires the player base and allows them to contribute thus cementing them to the community what was so wrong with the second life analogy null sec alliance make isk charging other corps rent for their space why not allow someone who knows maya or other dev tools access to creating content hell no mans sky has an army of computer programs bashing away at type writers making whole ecologies and planets for their human overlords why cant the ammarrians over at ccp do the same you get transaction fees for all user generated content that sells4 not that its a bad thing jk the eve novel the burning life described the capsuleers as living at the top most isolated parts of the station so the capsuleer promenade would be limited to the corp hqs slots corp office slots store fronts that it could hold alliance hqs and offices would be on outposts then a smattering of social areas like dance clubs and eateries have four promenade types for each race to start5 ccp has never had a problem asking players for cash before hey buy this shiny new limited offer ship andor paint jobhmmm cant resist pirate rookie ships only 120 mil a piece must have the set plex for charity has been done numerous times how about put your money where your mouth is and let eve players pay for the content they want to see you have player summits all over tell us with stats and charts you need x dollars to support y people over z time to make us our content not pay to win but pay to push the game in the direction we want a cash cow csm you know like those other guys with the fish tank and alien lobsters do6 stop giving away your old hardware repurpose it could have used those old servers for walking in stations or player created deds or back up on the fly support for when server load gets heavy watching to many american hoarders episodes and scaring yourself neat and clean we love you just the way you are ccp duct tape messy cables and allwell thats my buck twenties worthso before the motto was harden the f up now its the best ship in the universe is the friendship with that kinda turnabout i still have hope eve can weather this storm dream big dont just plan small
any csm or people running for a spot on the csm care to comment on the future of walking in stations as a feature and where its sits on their list of priorities for eve
i also agree this should be an ore ship with some kind of direction scanner interference within the bubble you can be scanned out but not just fluked upon the ecm burst wouldnt work well with other soe ships is what put me off soe needs a covop carrier ftw
again ndas are typically boilerplate legal documents go and google an nda and youll probably find most of if not all of the language found in the csm nda minus specific content that is applicable to ccpthe csmetcafter that we can discuss the joys of red liningwhich i sincerely doubt happens with the csm nda but who knows
i hope a future csm transparency initiative invalidate any non applicable claim of nda by a csm member even if the nda is not unndaed
that could be really interesting the alliance leader or who ever has lp roles can set up an lp store in their sov controlled stations with doctrine ships gear etc in itthe more people your alliance has set red that you kill the more lp you gatherwar targets should be at a fixed rate to that say reds   lp x 15this would help subsidise your most active pvpers and ensure that active members are getting the gear supplied rather than neutrals and reds buying up the stuff and raising the prices or hauling it back out of null sec
i also believe there will always be a subconsious bias based on where you live and how you play
all right fair enough but then who should or do you think that the the process should remain elective assuming that the current process is flawed and ccp simply picking csm members is more flawed  the first of which we can stipulate to for purposes of discussion and the second of which is a perfectly fair assumption for you to make and one i would agree with  this statement is tautological clearly if a problem exists we should not replace it with a worse problemhowever if a system is imperfect but any identifiable alternative is even more imperfect then the present system is already is as good as its going to get and reform is not practical on a better note for you you identified 2 specific issues  potential votemonitoring by power blocs and various means of vote manipulation but you are not pushing those issues very hard and i havent seen either a strong argument for why its important to fix them nor hard data indicating the scope to which they are real problems rather than theoretical oneswhat i would like to know from you is specifically what a reformed csm selection process would look like in your view and why it would be a net advantage over the current system what i am looking for especially is is it an actual problem with this particular system or are you running on a platform that essentially amounts to taking issue with the fact that certain people are getting elected
my platform doesnt amount to an issue with specific people getting elected i am of the mindset that reform is a good thing so long as it is reasonable and affects people fairly i appreciate your logic in the context of alternatives but i think your looking at reform as a all encompassing effect on the state of being of an entire process if i have a car that is by far the best car when compared to all the alternative cars this shouldnt mean i cant swap out parts of the car to make it better i dont wish to change the csm in its entirety merely reform aspects of it that i feel are problematic vote manipulation by means of large scale account purchases and monitoring are in my view all part of the same theme as they relate to my platform the process should be fair or at least as fair as an internet space election can be made
but how specificallyanyone over 21 can runanyone can vote for whoever they wantwhats not fair except that people are voting in a way you disapprove of
plentythere are currently no term limitsthe erotica 1 policies do not extend to csm or csm candidatesthere are no rules or policies against buying votes with isk or other ingame items and servicesthere are no rules or policies against coercing people to vote by ganking or campingthere are no rules or policies against the wholesale purchase of eve accounts for the sole purpose of using them for vote paddingthis is what i feel is unfair about the process and if elected i hope to change
your feelings are just hurt because we kicked your butt in our last wars making you cry in a serious csm post and kicking your butt in a war is evil enough if you want i can add a grrr sol for you
best csm yet 1
a couple more have announced they are running i think there is a wormhole town hall coming up for people to ask questions which will be a good time to see what people are like
some interesting clarifications between 2 cms x candidates that both were in csm ixto me it simply confirms that having more than one term per individual is detrimental to the health of the players representations support only one term per player and vote borat for csm x
here it isif you dont like it i will pull it down and try again
i loved it especially the endingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
the problem i have with the at situation is that its an official event and it was in part ruined because code decided to troll thats no different in my eyes from wrecking an event at fanfest if you dont want to take part dont take partim actually quite surprised you consider it as irrelevant as you do people running for csm obviously care about eve and the at is a big part of eve turning a section of it into a joke and a scam for isk is pretty disrespectful and it undermines the whole event i do understand like you said though that you werent involved but is it something youd consider doing in the future id hope that the people im voting for wouldnt
i love hearing this from the inveterate carebearhypocrisy tastes good in the morning the likes of you who have been trying to smother pvp playstyles in this game for literally years do not get to lecture anyone about self interest
exactly so why not elect a csm member who represents the highsec content creation playstyle someone who can give insight to ccp regarding wardecs suicide ganking baiting scamming and other such shenanigans highsec villains get up to sabriz has extensive experience in these as well as industry and corporation mechanics so would make a most excellent csm to represent these playstyles you are correct that we need a balanced csm that represents all parts of the player base and that includes highsec wardeccers and suicide gankers
i dont think that code really made a conscious decision to troll the at a few of our people were interested in the tournament and put our names into the hat but most of us had no interest in it at all hence we were not able to put a serious team together nothing was ruined and the response was disproportionate to the offense many teams have failed to turn up for the at in the past and it was never a big dealnevertheless nothing of value was lost the at is not a big part of eve it is a sideshow  an event of interest only to a minority of eve players my personal opinion is that the at is exactly the sort of instanced consensual consequencefree pvp that has no place in eve online frankly it is the sort of thing that the new order is supposed to be opposing on principle a true alliance tournament on the real spirit of this game would be held in a neutral system somewhere  perhaps thera for example so that we all could observe or interfere or gank the teams enroute to the tournament now that would be an at worthy of this game
 michael machi fully understand cores stance on the i made this and that happen  thing that you want to know about and that he is not trying to do thathe just doesnt want the extra attention something like that gives him and wants to do his csm wo
personally i would rather have a csm representative pushing for the big fixes the game needs for survival that respects the nda and delicacy of such changes than a csm who can pin his name to half a slot change here or other tinkering that while nice for those that can fly said ships will do squat to keep the game alive longtermcore has clearly gone into bat for major changes and has been influential in many ways and he has made those efforts as clear as he can if anyone is still confused go back and reread it all and put some effort into understanding rather than repeatedly coming back with nitpicking irrelevancesspeaking as one of his regular fleet members he is massively committed to delivering content in the game and as others have pointed out has attracted a good following for this that said this coexists nicely with other fleet specialists in provi which has made provibloc whether you love it or hate it a great place to play the game for the last 3 years that and his experiences back many years have given him a great insight into nullsec from major moongoo milking coalitions through genuinely small gang fighting and here i mean less than 20v20 to the current provicatchthunderdome meta he has earned the respect of blues and reds alike and whether its win lose or draw he is always back to go again and that determination alone is worth having in the csmyou ask what has he done for the playerbase he has influenced plenty and long may it continueresoundingly 1
cap stables lanctharus recently sat down with endie for an interview
you are not disagreeing with jayne here dude he means the current corp mechanics are wrong in so many ways for all the reasons you have quite elegantly narrated with several paragraphs of text you took the ball and then ran with it 500 meters in the wrong direction
no the opportunity for theft would imply that these groups would be able to hold assets or structures in the first placethese societies are not meant to replace corporations which means that they shouldnt have wallets assets structures etc social metagaming sure like a coup detat or an awox but anything more than that would require these groups having the ability to own anything valuable enough to steal which would encroach on the niche currently held by corporations
two things herefirst the members of the csm are not junior game designers they dont get to sit down at a computer and program their own ideas willy nilly  they are better viewed as a focus group or advisory committee whereas the truly optimistic might even consider them subject matter experts this is to say that i dont get to decide on what area of gameplay is developed or iterated upon simply that i can advise ccp on which changes are good or bad depending on the development roadmap that they have already decided uponthis ties into my second point ccp is indeed already working on this feature but it is still in the very early phases of development they dont know what theyre going to do to the system in fact they dont even know everything about the current system all theyve managed to do so far publicly is an agree on what to call this new proposal day 1 minutes page 14 societies having brought this to their attention of ccp is only half the battle through presentations forum threads and personal conversation weve been able to make this need known the difficult part is making sure these changes actually target the pain points present in the current system and dont go the way of industrial teams  that is great in theory but useless in practicality thats where i hope to play my part i will use my experience and my contacts in order to advise ccp on how these changes would affect both corporation management as well as a social groups such as the npsi and incursion communities this is similar to the sov redesign ccp knows its a problem they know things need to be changed and in order for that to be carried out they need players who are knowledgeable in that area of the game to help them thats the key to making sure that ccp delivers a good product cooperation between the players and developers with the csm serving as a liaison between what is desired what is truly needed and what can actually be deliveredthats the role i hope to fulfil
rivr im confused as to what it is exactly youre asking because from what youve written it appears that i agree with youwhen i say that being antisocial is wrong in so many ways im not saying that its a suboptimal or invalid playstyle im saying that its unfortunately a necessary playstyle based on the mechanics that currently exist what i would like to see is for the optimal playstyle to be a social playstyle one that encourages the interaction with others and the formation of groups my statement in the op refers to my desire to eliminate any barriers to the formation of groups that are both social and effectivethe existence of one man corps are a bane but necessary for many people to operate in highsec honestly id rather people stay in npc corps then use the corp mechanics simply to acquire 0 tax and isolate themselves in the process one of the strongest parts of this game is the community itself and its simply a shame that some playstyles operate at maximum efficiency when working completely alone thats what id like to change
i am glad to see manny running for the csm i have known him for many years have flown with him and for him on numerous fleets and operations i cannot think of anyone more qualified to be on the csm especially at this all too important time where what happens in the next year will have major impact on our game very few can bring mannyUFFFDs experience and perspective to the table in dealing with the serious changes sovereignty that are in the pot right now my vote is yoursbest of luck bro
yes just fly over to fanfest beers shall be had
why not just make a t3 exhumer type ship that could fit an advanced shield unit in a highslot which would basically make it invulnerable for xminutes unless neuted etc  would be time to get some new industry ships looking at how the majority of development lately has been pvp and sovwarfare relatedyou got my vote oo
thanks for the support as for the t3 exhumer it does sound interesting and i have seen this idea pop up in the feedback and suggestions forum but im not sure how it would work i dont think it should be invulnerable i think thats a little bit too much imo so that would need tweaking and yes i do agree there that it would be nice to get some new industry ships
yeah a t3barge would rock alltho i agree with erika invulnerable would be op but yeah give the t3 the extra high slot have it fit a covops cloack give it a overheating bonus to shield tanks make it a really tough nugget to crack as a pvper you wont know in advance wether its bait or a miner that got caught off guard and give it a drone bay to fit large drones
that would be a beast barge 1
that is an interesting point perhaps a better drag drop and more intuitive tools would be enough it would be something i think you would need to test to see how it feels thanks for that i will keep it in mind
yeah the piui is horrid and needs a good upgrade asap besides that templates would be a good idea since setting up picolonies is a painful unfun process with all the clicks you need and those who play it best would still get the best results since not every template can be used on every planet equally dumbasses can share their faulty templates all they like theyll still get bad colonies and headachesjust imagine someone making a nice template for large ice world extraction and imagine someone trying to setup this template on a world just a little bit too large or think of someone not taking his skills into account when trying a new template shared from someone else hilarity ensues still enough face palms for everyone involved
ashi will say that ive read through this thread and as i did i started liking your campaign more and more your conversation with rixx showed very well your comprehension and thought process like rixx ill say that i intend to have you on my list aswellso in your op you state that you are playing in wormholes right now and as ive been heavily involved in the wormhole community and was a wormhole candidate for csm9 i want to know your views on wormholes better from your perspective getting involved in this area of gameplayive been a huge supporter of corbexx over csm9 and he has been the most exceptional csm representative for wormholes and although you are playing wormholes now you talk very little about advocacy as a csm representative unless i missed itthat said would you mind expanding on the following1 what wormhole experiences have you had thus far2 what are your views on the development and changes to wormholes from inception through hyperion3 any thoughts on future changes or ideas youd suggest for wormholes4 would you support a furtherance of lore based wormhole content that is player or developer driven bothcomment i am very impressed by your support of lore based content and agree with your points on the topic5 what are your thoughts experience and ideas on pos mechanics and future development6 what are your thoughts and ideas on corporate management changes or developmentthanks for running for csmx and i look forward to following your campaign
it would just have to be something that is toyed with to see how good it feelsnot all development can be done from the comfort of an armchair you know
you probably have never setup a factory planet being able to share a factory setup that isnt dependant on positioning could lead to a p3p4 product market crash and the massive demand of p2even if you setup a template for the initial setup of say the launchers the silo and the processors while just leaving out the extractors is enough to be worth the 1020 minutes saved in repositioning a colonyapart from that i really dont know how you can make linking easier as so many people have preferred setups and build ordering automating the routing request for example could just become a headache for some people dont get me wrong the doubleclick fest is laughable but i really dont know how else to do it unless you create a specialized minigame app over the mobile platform for it
there is a lot of redundancy and extra right clicks in the process you could streamline the pi process this isnt a terribly annoying thing to be conquered you shouldnt have to dread managing your colonies
i have 3 factory planets and 26 extraction planets across my two accounts besides that i dont have strong feelings for or against template sharing i would like to be able to save templates of course an uiupgrade to reduce clicks would be a nice consolationprice too honestly after the last time i relocated my two pialts and the colonies of my industryalt on the same day i got a cramp afterwards i dreaded moving planets so much i put off moving the colonies of my main for several months just because i hated all that useless clicking so much at this point i would accept even several consecutive market crashes if we can get sensible pi out of it
may papa gnome represent the great gnomeland of lawn at csm x
i have been flying with thoric for a while now irl he is a professional and will bring a high level of maturity and level headiness to the csm he is experienced in eve as well as working with others and will be dedicated to cultivating strong proffesional relationships between the council and ccphe has my voterish
go get em thoric you have my votethe dude lebowskii recruitment director  big diggers
i would like to o7 to lex rip no one has every called me a  with more loving care lex m8 you always knew the best way to insult mei literally cannot say rip enough timesi was more than thrilled to have made new eden renegades alliance now a shrine to lexo7 lex your clone has no upgrade costs in the heavens of jove space later this week i will be releasing a freighter full of conflag the doves of this internet spaceship world free into space to pay tribute to lexo7 m8 
remove them completely i would sayclicking this thread i had hoped there was a worm hole representative from a small corp or alliance
i did reply to your in game mail friend
my first post  here details who i am and what i do as well as an introduction to a few things to stand for this post is more in depth comprehensive list of just a handful of the issues i feel worth campaigning for to make the game betterso my manifesto list of stuff that needs to be fixed or that people think needs to be fixed after attending event spectacular event btw if you are in the uk and nashh kadavr see his blog here is doing an event please come along it was great stay tuned for his next one i had a chance to speak with some real life people they do exist outside of eve and with that in mind chat about some csmy type stuff so i now have a better more comprehensive list of stuff to campaign forthis is in no particular order except the new player thing thats top top top of my list of things that needs to be sortedoffgrid boosting for combat boosts reduction and or sorting ie no off grid boosting the command ship should be in the battle or at least give reduced off grid boosts if it is done with impunity we have all been there small gang rocks through the first scout then a cloaky nullified stabbed loki with full halo set and oversized ab or mwd making it unscannable andor uncatchable if you do manage to scan it down and giving that group of interceptors 50100 boosts depending on how its set up i think this has been on the developement timetable for some time as fozzie and some others hate the idea of offgrid boosting why have immunity for your boosts ishtar rebalance this is a difficult one as mentioned above but it does need to be looked at seriously as aside from machariel and or some other extremely expensive ship the only really effective counter for ishtars is more ishtars the biggest problem facing eve  starting out the learning cliff as some described it as is is one of the biggest threats to the playerbase that eve has people sign up play for a week cant really figure out how or what to do and never convert from trial to full game as ccp guard said at the weekend the eve playerbase is the best marketing tool the highest figures have been seen for trials after battles like that in asakai and br5 but the conversions from trial to account remains low this is my top most priority as this will keep the game alive for the next 10 years potentially furtherdockable supers talked about in my first post a limited number of expensive slots for supercarriers to be able to dock at station 5 per station total and only able to utilise if you have an office in that station refundable skills similar to an attribute remap once a year two extra for new accounts as a bonus the ability to refund the skillpoints from a particular skill or two provided that it isnt a required skill to another skill and limited to certian skills only ie no ship skill refunds for combat ships such as gallente battleship a modification to the training queue for anyone who has played dust regardless of whether you have a skill in training or not your skill points accumilate into a pool similar to the unallocated skill points that we all got back when learning tree was removed from the game this would be good for eveonline so if you finished a skill you could allocate the excess at a standard rateobviously picking a skill and placing it in the training queue would gain the attribute bonus to training time so the incentive is still to fill up your queue but this would allow a little more flexibility in terms of training specific skills where a required skill falls outside of your normal play time say 2am etcremoval of jita no just kidding but the introduction of a system that tracks and deals with some of the isk doubling service type spambots  you all know the ones  that populate most of hte highsec tradehubs would be nice i am not saying that the practice and art of scamming should be made illegal under the games tou but you would have to physically have to be at the system playing the game to do it so no more afk making millionsthe introduction of a player submitted content system not game mods like in say skyrim or uigame improvements as in wow addons etc but if there is a really solid really well thought out and careful lore based storyline or event that it is feasible to introduce into game but would need ccp help then a formal way to get this to the ccp devteam so that they can discuss this further and possibly impliment the storylineeventthing in game homeworld style colouring of ships for those of you old enough to remember homeworld and additionally those of you who have played pirates of the burning sea you will remember you had a large element of control over how the ships colours were represented in game if we take the vexor for example it has grey panels blueish panels and some logos around the ship homeworld 1 and 2 and potbs both allowed you to select a colour for each of these parts of the ship from an rgb based colour list if for example i wanted to have a black hull with yellow details and bright pink decals i could have and i could do this for every one of my ships individually with the changes to the way ships are skinned in game i think this would be a spectacular opportunity to be able to fly in line colours with your alliance or corporation in a doctrine ship b higher res better corp logos additionally in addition to being able to change colours of panelssections of ship skins have the ability to apply your corp andor alliance logo to your ships this list isnt exhaustive but contains a top list of some of the things i would love to see in eve
consider my gauntlet thrown down for this debate
worf without make up is that you while i do not agree with all the changes and opinions you express i do like the way you write and the attitude it seems to convey 1
tfcan you maintain the same level of involvement and activity that corbexx has brought as a wh csm representative for the duration of the termif yes will you also be able to maintain tf wormhole advice column and your existing duties as a ceo of a corporation and alliance
thats a good question and a difficult one to answer corbexx spent a hell of a lot of time grinding every conceivable type of wormhole pve so that he would have hard data to present to the csm and in particular ccp its in the minutes where he fact checksbody checks ccp which was demonstrably ignorant of how poor the reward was and the result was the increase in blue poo buy orders your question is basically predicated on the notion that such epic feats are required not only of all csms but at all going into the future aside from the fact that it has by and large been done and the fruits of corbexxs labours are apparent i would turn this around and say  what epic feats of grinding ought i do to have an equal effect on the gameto answer that i can only say that i have a considerable amount of dissatisfaction with wormhole poss and in particular the efforts required to go into sieging them out i am sure there hasnt been any analysis done by ccp or indeed anyone to the extent that i have done the sums and come up with a solution which i wont share because its so damn effective to structure grinds in subcaps theres a lot i would like to do to guide poss into a different sphere of utility for people who use them as more than a fuelusing cash machine in nullsec handling moon goo and reactions for instance youre free to read my opinions on the matter on the forums and elsewhere nullsec cash machines and moon harvesting crud can stop being a pos and be a different type of orbital module imo most moon goo poss are just smalls with no guns pretected by the threat of a blob of blue donut supercaps yoloing onto field to defend the rf timer andor remove anything jimmied up in the wrong place often the biggest detriment to sov changes is the removal and flipping of poss and all the amazing gameplay attendant with onlining and offlining poss slash sarcasm hashtag bluedonutfreed from needing reactions and moon harvesters the pos can become one or several types of starbase defensive hardpoints aka deathstardullstardickstardampstars with lots of ehp and the like maybe an industrial starbase with a one size fits all modular industrial setup like why the hell do we need small advanced small medium advanced medium large advanced large capital and supercapital assemblies to manufacture more than one size of ship in a wormhole or any pos you need to overinvest in pg hogging pos trash you want to see me get riled up and devote hours of effort to something its ranting about poss its coming up with insane pos fits really ask around for those whove seen our pos insane and cunning ways of taking out deathstars sekrit methods at play and insane amounts of frustration at managing them and yeah you are right this all takes time and i do spend too much time probing chains of wormholes whilst simultaneously running an eve corporation two companies in real life part time keeping my wife happy and the like id rather work smarter and avoid repeating corbexxs odyssey of ratting to put the numbers and the ideas well thought oout factbased and reasoned ideas before ccp and id love to spend less time probing and more time orbiting a 140m ehp dullstar in an oracle because poss are super fun
this man is a genius and the guy who taught me as a four day old newb to fly in wormholes can flip flippers and generally take the road less travelled i am also the ex bugry dude who had a blast fighting the blob in repo but the real star of that show was bei artjayhe is knowledgeable lucid and bloody hilariousgot my vote
thanks to johnny up there i have been lulled into spaceship politics and you sir will be getting my vote hat off o
nonsense di will not say that corbexxs effort with the pve project was not an epic amount of work for someone to put ini do hope that a csm representative maintains a certain level of visibility and activity not something you have had a problem with i also do not expect the same manner of visibility and activity of corbexx as every individual is different and their impact should be judged solely on their actions alone as others have pointed out in this very thread your leadership and knowledge is also a driving force behind your corporation and alliance and i would be hard pressed to ask them to lose you to burn out or other means
to give you a leading question is not the thing that rubs industrial pilots up the wrong way the inability to turn the gank around as it stands they either have enough dps to blow the ship away too fast for the escort to do anything or they do not
if ccp set up a kickstarter and public investmentdonations page for a proper dev  art team who have experience developing and creating a modular system that wis would need id throw money in that pot for sure realistically how much of an investment would it take for a proper first release 1 mil 5 mil 10 mil i remember i got into eve for the first time after seeing one of the first wis demonstrations from quite a few years ago thinking i need to jump in now before they release this and everyones a part of thiswith the amount of  that star citizen has received for fish tanks and vanity ships id think people would want eve to add this aspect to their already vibrant and successful game
a kickstarter project is probably the only realistic option well ahead of the crazy generous millionaire possibility
actually one of the huge advantages of the new ondemand way that they will be loading eve assets is that functionality that might otherwise be added to another game client can be added to the overall eve client without actually increasing the filesize for people who never use the wis featuresi would hope that they could do this with project legion and valkyrie also eve unity anyone
imo on 1if ccp wanted a tv show they should have made on for the sole purpose of expandingprogressing lore start with the books and chronicles and once those are done move the plot forward with entirely original episodes set to show the background fo eve what the npcs or important characters are doing maybe throwing in hints for upcoming changesprojectsexpansions like for instance with the latest t3s could have cameod in the background of an rd dock as a half built destroyerit would be like star trek or star wars except lots more large fleet fights and better character development and intrigue than ds9 ever had
people want to include combat in wis why not have a boxing arena or something to that effect and then a means of betting on iti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
screw boxing i want my yugioh inspired mindclash battles
i didnt say i wanted to limit the number of active wars as in numerical number of active wars out of maximum example you have 80 active wars out of 150 allowedi personally strongly opposereducing the costs of initiating and maintaning the upkeep of wars thus making everyone think about what the war and keeping it alive will cost themwars dont generate content or conflict when a 1000 man strong alliance declares war on 10 people those people will turtle up in stations and weather out for the duration i dont see that as an increase in conflict generationwhat would increase conflict generation would be an option to declare yourself as a free target by others who have declared the same basically turning your pvp tag on minimum duration  1 week im quite certain almost nobody would use that
this blog post other feedback that i get and various things i have gleemed do give me some misgivings
quick note to say thank you for the work over the last year and to say you have my vote for this year
someone already did the math to make mass purchasing of accounts an issue for 5k accounts is 75k us also im pretty sure ccp would be ok with that since it adds money to the piggy bank so ccp wouldnt care probably the other two are part of a sandbox game if you dont like it play a different game why are you so against a way of playing a game also if people are doing a good job like most of the csm9 have done why need a term limit other than to make it easier for you to get a chance at a free trip to ccp hq
i have asked you before to please stop flaming my thread if you dont have any questions that arent loaded with incendiaries than stop posting
heres a question that you obviously missedwhy are you so against a way of playing a game
a purely practical question thenhow would you commit any of the above actsi personally know i wont do any because 1 and 2 are impossible to verify and why bribecoerce people when you cant know that they did as bribedcoerced to and 3 because its hilariously stupid due to the costs and because the organisations with enough isk to buy plex wholesale already have the votes on handso now my interest is piqued how would you in practice do any of these
when i ran for csm lots of people i know in game cheerfully offered to sell me their votes for amounts varying between 100m and 1b per vote that seemed to reflect the general perception of the going ratei counteroffered to beat any offer any other candidate made by at 1 iskif memory serves i believe i paid out a total of about 6 or 7 isk to get elected which was a relief because i didnt actually have the 6 or 7 trillion isk it would have taken me at what they and you seem to think it should have and it would have been a little embarrassing to have started my term with the biggest scam in eve history
also what do you mean by erotica1 policies breaking the eula is a disqualification before during or after electionnb merely telling people what they dont want to hear is not yet an eula violation
i am referring specifically to the misrepresentation portion of the policies that resulted from erotica 1 players are not allowed to impersonate other players or misrepresent themselves in the context of identity example a csm candidate could lie and say they are endorsed by somebody and the rules about misrepresentation would not apply to them
my questions1 theres a lot of back and forth over the supposed cloak camper issue where do you stand on it2 ccp has stated the pos code is scary and havent done much work on it is this something they should work on should they replace the pos system with something else if so what should the replace it with3 since you started play what are some of the changes you liked dislike what do you think could have been done better4 ccp had a disagreement with csm member funky bacon so the rest of csm and ccp created a new skype channel for the purpose of his exclusion  if this happened to you or another csm how would you handle that situation
can you give an example of this occurring or mattering if it did
1 i am not very experienced with cloaking or camping so i would defer to somebody who was 2 i think what they mean when they say that the code is scarey is that the amount of time it would take to actually fix it would take away from other problems being fixed my understanding is that legacy code is a time vampire for ccp which means they will only really commit to it if there is no other choice3 i loved the removal of clone costs i used to be very averse to pvp because of how expensive my clones had become and since the removal of clone costs i have been roaming alot more i disliked some of the faction warfare changes specifically the respawning of npc rats i would rather have had a single strong rat than a few that respawn over and over the clothing could use some work 32 x 64 texture resolution is just inexcusable at this point in the games history if you cant make something that meets a minimal standard of looking better than warcraft or some other muddy art style than dont waste time making it work on something else 4 i am not picking sides but i will say that exclusionary tactics for the purposes of spite are foolish and counter productive its one thing to disagree with somebody and its another thing to circumvent their ability to express themselves as a member of a team if it happened to me i would keep my cool and try to address the issue through the proper channels i am very interested in settling or resolving disputes i think flaming or throwing mud only makes matters worse as a member of the csm i would put my personal feelings and affiliations aside for the benefit of the effort that the csm stands for i will give you a specific examplelets say i went to all the systems where the cfc has sov sitters i tell everybody in local that i am the official first choice for the cfc ballot and that they should all vote for me because i was endorsed by le mittani face himself i would be misrepresenting myself in the context of impersonation as it relates to the erotica 1 policies however as a csm candidate those rules do not apply to me in the context of the csm i am allowed to buy cheat scam coerce all to get votes its stupid just because i wouldnt ever do something like this doesnt mean nobody will
the change by ccp was specifically that players and groups were not allowed to say they are someone they are not you can are allowed and since every actual scam ever requires it to some degree encouraged to claim relationships with other groups for the purposes of subversionwhat you are not allowed to do is claim you are someone else by name or title you cannot say you are a recruiter if you are not as thats claiming someone elses identity by virtue of title and you cannot say you are x or y as people because that is claiming their identity by association of an alt or somesuch phrasingfact is you are allowed to say you are a goonswarm ballot pick just like im allowed to go into n3 space and say yo im a friendly dont shoot trust me as long as you are not claiming someone elses identity its not against the rules or are you suggesting from now on all scammersthieves should be required to put im going to empty the wallet if i ever get director on their recruitment request else theyll be in violation of the rules if they ever do stealedit to your specific example as far as my knowledge and experience of the changes go you can say you are endorsed by the mittani you cannot say you are someones alt from goonswarm saying your endorsed by the mittani is perfectly fine because your not misrepresenting your identity your misrepresenting an association which is entirely different
and the discussion of the interview is up
if theyre not providing any rationale for a ban its because ccp security is concerned that giving the person a reason would give them information they could use to work around the ban its for people that violate the eula so baldly that theres no possibility that they were acting in good faithif you make csm you will eventually learn how seriously team security takes this kind of operational security but then you wont be able to tell anyone
there is also the fact that csm is not a two things that people seem to think that we arewe are not the internal affairs of ccp so we do not double check all the bans to make sure they are right we see the stats of bans and the effects we may advise on the wording of rules and such but ccp security are trained professionals whose job it is to keep the game cleanwe are not the human resources department we have no effect on hires or fires nor should we this came up at the beginning of last term and the smart thing to do is stay clear and send condolences to those who were laid off and to those left behind congrats to people who move on to new jobs and new futures these are people and their livelihoods act accordinglymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
1 ultimately we simply need csms that will help stem the tide of continued nerfs to the game we love tora and sabriz will do that others will not in fact there are way too many pansies on the csm as it is and we dont need more of them to just nod
interesting interview by cap stable of ccp leelo and ccp falconthe main points that i like from their hour long discussion are the following csm is truly seen as a focus group on a wide range of subjects not just for new features and game design but also broader aspects of ccp activity like marketing communication localization   last years switch to six week releases and the recent integration of confluence across teams in ccp a collaborative project management tool i am pretty familiar with already  will make csm x the first csm with direct input to the various project via confluence with a visibility up to three releases down the road although there are still super secret stuff that even csm will not see  being on the csm is not anymore a chance to get to fanfest for free allowing more focus on the summits organization and the responsibilities that being on the csm entails leelo is in favor of more transparency in regard to each csm members activity and contribution great news down with the dead weights it is very natural in a democratic process that large groups are represented just by the weight of their constituency the csm stv voting process does allows for more independent members to still be elected totally agree on their analysis vote for me les points principaux que je retiens de cette interview entre cap stable et ccp falcom community manager and ccp leelo rep pour la communautUFFFD russe et responsable du csm sont les suivants le csm est vraiment perUFFFDu comme un groupe de discussions sur de nombreux sujets pas seulement limitUFFFDs aux nouvelles fonctionalitUFFFDs du jeu comme le marketing la localisation les ventes le changement lan dernier du cycle de sortie des nouvelles fonctionalitUFFFDs ainsi que lintUFFFDgration rUFFFDcente de confluence un outil collaboratif de gestion de projet avec lequel je suis dUFFFDjUFFFD familier  fera du csm x le premier csm avec un accUFFFDs direct aux divers projets en cours et une visibilitUFFFD sur les trois prochaines sorties il y a encore des fonctionalitUFFFDs trUFFFDs secrUFFFDtes que mUFFFDme le csm ne verras pas  faire partie du csm nest plus une chance daller UFFFD la fanfest au frais de ccp ce qui permettras plus de concentration de resources sur les sommets et les responsabilitUFFFDs directes du csm leelo en particulier est favorable UFFFD la publication de rapports dactivitUFFFD des membres du csm bonne nouvelle pour UFFFDliminer les poids morts  il est tout UFFFD fait naturel dans un processus dUFFFDmocratique de voir les plus grands groupes reprUFFFDsentUFFFDs par le poids de leur voteurs le scrutin UFFFD vote unique transfUFFFDrable utilisUFFFD par ccp permet aussi UFFFD des candidats indUFFFDpendants dUFFFDtre UFFFDlus je suis complUFFFDtement daccord votez pour moi
not really going to comment more on the at incident after this post ill reiterate i was not eligible to be part of the code team due to the alliance membership tenure criteria and so paid no attention to what we were doing had the decision been mine to make i would not have entered a tournament that codes nature as mostly an alliance of low sp alts with very focused training means we had no chance ininterestingly my corporation virtually none of whom met the eligibility criteria last time could probably field a quarterway decent at team now as weve recruited some higher sp people that have long supported code like myself but we dont have any intention to appeal the at ban or to apply for an exemption for individuals that werent involved part of eve is that actions have consequences and im ok with wearing them
quoted for truth  qualityf
where do i buy that shirt
okay let us take that on the face of it now let us say that i landed up on csm ccp come to us with a change they are thinking of putting through i am the sort of person that would look at it from different angles might even agree with ccp but argue against it until i am satisfied that all knock on effects and consequences have been thought through on a game mechanics level that might be rather usefulhowever it misses something it misses out on the player bases general sentiment how people feel about the changes i like the jump fatigue changes i would like to see black ops and industrials fatigue bonuses reduced if ccp listened to only people like me there would be a lynch mob catching the first flights to iceland csm and ccp need people like core on the very face of what you critise him for doing and being
corebloodbrothers is a really cool dude who works hard and provide a lot of good feedback i would love to see him on csm x
i really enjoyed doing that interview although the friendly approach lanctharus took did perhaps tempt me into some politically controversial statements
it is your duty to make controversial statements nowit may as well be your pleasure too
i dont see me running with the ball in the wrong direction it is eve that we are talking about ie the only goal is to cause other players mischief 1man corps are the only way to spare you from that to a certain extend how would you want to change something that works in perfect accordance with what eve is about everyone vs everyone obviously any change revolves around a full replacement of the current corporation system with something new something better what are your ideas on that do you also keep those people in mind who give a flying scrapheap about social and simply do not want to interact with others what about them brute force inclusion or will these people also keep their way of playing the gameside note teams were not useless its useless players who do not invest brain into the matter to me teams were a fountain of good uses even though initially i was strongly against them both in terms of industry enrichment as well as intel tool to find juicy stuff to cause harm to why do you see teams as useless
i disagree one man corps are the very opposite of an everyone vs everyone playstyle these proposals arent meant so spare anyone they are meant to empower new and existing groups if you want to play eve alone as a nomad or as a hermit go right ahead im not going to stop you from doing what you enjoy whats not fine is that an optimum playstyle is forcing people to play like hermits in order to guarantee their safety andor profits i didnt ccp did whether or not they were useful they didnt see widespread use and were widely forgotten this emphasizes my point that no matter how good a tool is it doesnt matter if players dont use it the reasons why the players choose not to use the tool are irrelevant
to be fair industrial teams werent deemed useless just not what eve needs right now the ideas been shelved until other aspects of the game are updated
agreed the biggest issue with supers is that theyre too vulnerable solo or in small groups but when massed have a nearly unbreakable spider tank dont forget that the battle of br was decided by titans coordinating their dds to alpha other titans
the csm is in dire need of a harry saq hmmmthat sounded better in my headperhaps it would be better if i started with introducing myselfmy name is harry saq and i have been playing eve on and off since the game was first released i have quit and renewed my accounts for similar reasons most do mix of rl and just grrrrr eve and have a special place in my heartexcelspreadsheets for this wonderfully frustrating mmo the thing that has always intrigued me and continually brought me back was the enormous potential this game has the reasons i have left and disavowed all loyalty externally was for that potential being squandered not necessarily intentionally or maliciouslyin other words i have been through the cycles of love and hate and made all the mental proclamations and conspiracy claims imaginable to account for the greatness and shortcomings of this game similar to what i am sure most seasoned and even new players have so instead of offering a litany of nuanced stratagems or wild fantastical hopes and dreams i might have for this that or the other thing this game could do i would rather like to offer my services as a player facilitator and advocate for quality game change that focuses on a better experience for us alleve is only a game however it is a game that dares to throw us all in one universe and offer us the tools to both shape the places we reside as well as hang ourselves most embarrassingly and painfully over the lifespan of eve ccp has taken many funky steps in various directions to do everything and nothing in an attempt to both commercialize their product to a broader customer base and fulfill all of our wacky idiosyncratic desires and theirs as welland some of their desires are kind of scary of all that has been said about ccp it cannot be said that they havent produced something worthy of attention and as of late it can also not be ignored that they are starting to grasp how to actually release the potential this game so promises through incremental changei have seen several topics over the effectiveness and use of the csm and i feel some of the more recent trains of thought simply miss the point any change process has a development life cycle and alot of the time catalysts to change are incredibly subtle in their origin and sources of influence some see the csms place in that lifecycle as the final check box in approving some upcoming release or an entity that must be listened to during backroom talks and strategy meetings some have even lamented over their influence being overshadowed by bloggers and popular websites regardless of any stated purpose or intended role the csm has implementation of any process always settles into places not planned due to human factors both in usefulness of those involved and how their messages are carriedthe csm has been around for awhile and quite frankly is only as effective active and useful as those in it what i plan to bring to the csm if elected is an active reasonedrational voice whose agenda is to facilitate the change process so that the game remains challenging engaging and worth logging into regardless if my personal preferences are catered to or not the csm is as useful as we make it if we are not included in the conversation than we must be proactive in seeking out and engaging in the conversations that matter so rather than lament whether i am being listened to or whether a release was approved by a council i am on i will seek to actively represent the player base by presenting the perspective of those that play when the opportunity is there and creating that opportunity in as many ways as possible in other words both the player base and ccp have unique and sometimes conflicting perspectives and motives that need to be navigated through in order to make a product that continues to capture the imaginations of those that play while drawing in many more new peeps to play with  that sounded slightly dirtier than intendedelect me and make ccp reason with your harry saq
how do you feel that living in null has effected your industrial side for better or for worse and at the couple changes you described regarding an extra high on a bargeexhumer why do you feel an extra high would be better than say more pg so you can fit a large extender or a bonus to shield extenders or an extra mid instead of high so you have a higher chance of surviving an empire gank give you more time to get backup if youre stuck in null regarding missions do you have any ideas already on how you would like to see them go or something added to make them less repetitive
im on the 6th pi development ive had to breakdown 5 times im no stranger to the pi cramp lol having extractor planets im sure youre no stranger to repositioning the heads now and thenif ccp could lets say create a pattern for the extractor nodes like the new probes setup that alone could save much timealso if we could do group routes instead of doing each factoryprocessor individually that too would be great i know ive tried many times to ctrl click a group and do it all once but it doesnt work like thata third thing they can do is remote access to launch intotransfer from pocos unless someone can make sense as to why we should have to be in space in the same system not docked to do this this is the future dangit
if the only thing that changed was that all the dialogs that amount to are you sure were replaced by a single make it so button so that all your design was virtual and the interactions modeled until you finally decided you were ready and done that would eliminate much of the redundant clicking immediately
have known migui ingame for a while and canUFFFDt think of a better csm candidate1
by the way cap stable interviewed ccp leeloo and ccp falcon
finally had time to catch up on some of the other interviews that was nice thank you
sion i have a question about something you touched on in your latest cap stable interview regarding the reality of the csm versus what you imagined initially before being elected to the csmit also has to do with agile with scrum and im basically wondering how much of an impact the shorter development cycle has on the effectiveness of the csm my naive impression is the shorter development cycles reduce the lead time available to youeves new release cycles are two weeks longer than the development cycles prescribed in agile with scrum is some of that additional time used to incorporate the csm into parts of scrumalso does the csm participate in scrum meetings perhaps via conference calls such as backlog refinement meetings sprint planning meetings or daily scrum meetingswhat provisions have ccp and the csm implemented to integrate the csm into the development process since adopting agile with scrumthe cap stable interview of ccp falcon  ccp leeloo released today included discussion of csm 9 in the development process ccp leeloos description of csm access to the develpment road map sounds oneway and delayed by a week between updates is there anything youd like to addfor example on which side of the scrum master does the csm reside
removing them could be an option however how would you deal with the shattered wormholes a reduction of total mass and removing the regen would mean they wouldnt last so long and be able to collapse them
what nullbear isnt but seriously folks for those that dont read titles my name is aiwha and im running for csm 10 you might have seen me shiptoasting around the eveo forums or in a local chat ingame im an active member of s2n a la n3 a la bob 40 or is it 5 now any way if youre cfc were the bad guys grrgoons ect if youre not were the good guys and if you dont care youre lucky but thats all besides the point the point itself is you should vote for me as a member of your tenth csm to ccp ive been an eve online player for six years and in those six years i have been average ive run level iv missions in highsec with the occasional frigate roam to lowsec and did okay ive been the tiny inconsequential alliance nobody gives a  about in nullsec and gotten beaten to death by a more serious power and did okay ive done a little faciton warfare and did bad it was bad we were bad i am so so sorry about that now however s2n and n3 are one of the big superpowers busy making angry eyes at each other whilst furiously milking our renter cashcows for isk to throw at each other while my lifestory in eve pretty much revolves around nullsec on the side ive also dabbled in wh living and exploration highsec manufacturing and the exciting counterpart to skill queue online researching blueprints online which is fun in the same way staring at a cake you didnt actually make in the oven is funmost of you dont care about that though most of you care about why im asking for your vote i want your vote because odds are i understand the basics of your lifestyle i understand enough that i can voice your comments and concerns to ccp when shown the upcoming content to eve online and do my damnedest to see that your concerns are met with the response that they deserve i want to be the guy looking out for the best interests of everyone i want your vote because i want to listen to your story and represent your concerns to ccpthis is the part where i tell you things that i personally want to see changedintroducedadressed im going to try and keep it short simple and organizednullsecmoar structures not timers structures stuff that can be blown up to make other people miserable ihubs are nice but why are the ihub services not like station services why cant i spend 8 hours in a sb blowing up that sexy little wh generator thats just asking for it moar stationwrecks destructable stations personally i think thats the holy grail of sov warfare  hellcamps if they wont undock burn it to the ground remove keblob while giant 2000 fights can be fun to hear about theyre a little less fun to actually do we need to find a way to spread all the love and lag around so that its not just the big guys grinding against each other all day buff blops just a little bit so sbs and bloppleships can be the those daggers in the dark they all were born to become wormholesmore newbies wh space is desolate its not dead but its very empty i want to promote more ways for newbies to see both the riches and danger of wh space and become a new generation of crazy mad max capsuleers more movement originally ccp designed wh space as a place for us to temporarily inhabit before returning to known space the forefathers said  that and pioneered the modern wh lifestyle and ccp thought that was cool as  and let them stay i would like to see more options for expeditionary style gameplay in whs as well as the current lifestyle more people moving around means more chances for pew too industrypi rework pi needs a little love i mean its called passive income but goddamn my finger hurts from all the clicking blueprints remember what i said about watching cakes bake earlier if you read it its boring you stick it in a slot and wait till its done give people the ability to speed up their blueprint copyingresearching by doing something besides just training patience to v mining less clicking than pi but equally soul crushing it needs help minigames interactive in capsule strippers something anything highsechighsec is pretty balanced actually at least in my opinion tank your haulers and dont whine when somebody tanks their haulership balance t2 resists for recons faction dreads 2nd racial dread at least you know just for variety i like dreads loreits getting kind of awesome keep it up more events like the t3 destroyer introduction with in game consequences would be coolsee something you like see something you dislike have an idea or concern that isnt addressedeve mail meallow me to repeateve mail mei will read and try to respond then write down everything i can from anyone that asks and if i am elected will keep a semi organized folder of your concerns on hand for all discussions with ccp and the rest of the csm i dont want to just be a csm i want to be your csmas an avid forum warrior i will do my best to answer any questions comments or concerns you want to leave here thanks for your time fly safe
these arent bad issues to address keep presenting your ideas to fix them

battleships are underpowered but nerfing frigates is not the solution the real problem is that hacs and t3s outperform battleships in nearly every way
whichever way is best the battleship situation still needs to be addressed as with all others as viability whether battleships feature some form of point defense andor frigatesinterceptors are weaker in terms of damage vs battleships that is to be discussedeither way they need sorting
how comfortable are you with math because it seems that the problem is that there is a pivot point beyond which sig radius becomes especially punitive and battleships are on the wrong side of that pivot point coming and going their vast footprints make them easy targets for bombs and all weapon types south of doomsdays and their weapons cant hit anything with a small sig radius battlecruisers are in a similar place except that they use the same weapon systems that cruisers do except that they die to everything so theres not really any reason to prefer them to cruisers then you bring hacs and t3s and attack battlecruisers into the discussion and the discussion is overwould you feel comfortable contributing to a discussion involving what amounts to a complex geometry problem or would you prefer to state a preferred outcome and leave the math to others
when i said i was a science teacher i could have been more specific i teach physics to 1118 year olds 1618 would be a level which is advanced requirement for entry to most universities so having a look at the signature radii of the different ships would be something i would be interested in if that offers a potential fix for a problem without reducing the utility of other ships elsewhere or alternatively making other ships more massively powerful then i am all for every avenue we stopped using bcs a while ago in nullsec  bubble kill the anchor 6 bombs fleet dead might as well lose 200 dps and take ishtars tengus or torp bombers
1i went to null in a t1 incursus and had no one in system for 22 jumps where are these renters even they speak of my pirate journey
1 you dont think that the ability to run a lvl 4 mission that can net you 90000 lp in tier 4 does not influence the war you dont see how doing a single mission in t4 can help the winning side spend the 10 minutes of a single mission to bump a passing lvl 0 system up to lvl 3 with a laugh instead of a grunt to a faction that cannot run these in a ship it takes 1 month to train into cannot be easily caught and can make it through the entire warzone safely with a shrug to 30mil if it is lost if you dont see how unbalanced this is for the winning side i dont think you understand fw stabbed dplex infuence how tier affects alt fw missioners that jump from one alt to another to run these for the winning side how much market influence nonpvpers have on the items pvpers depend on also or how ridiculous it is to tilt the scale back to the losing side against the large collective farming horde that sustains t4 through the measly donations of the fewfor the above to not be true you would have to introduce a mechanic that forces dps to be on field for defensive plexing now too and create a restriction to t2 hulls from entering fw mission complexes done mission spammers out caracals which can be fought and caught and chased from system to system still viable still in solo pvpavoidance lp gains also outthis alone is the biggest failure of the southern fw zone and how annoyed pvpers are at the failure of fellow militiamen to keep the plexing battle up this is one reason why caldari can never sustain tier 4 for long the majority of their players begin the mission life while gallente keep bumping their systems down as gallente cannot run these in bombers but only in ships worth over 100mil1bil2 fw may be on track offensively plexingwise but not defensive plexing not when an empty frigate hull can hang on a button afk and wait on a timer and not when a losing faction is getting the shaft on t1 rewards that dishearten the green and unfocusedplease review what i think are facts currently being seen in the warzone and review your answer this option to fuel the wareffort as you put it should be availble across all factions you may say yes they already are but there is a reason nubs in gallente milita get shut down when they ask for bomber fits for missions create an alt and try and see what answerslaughs you get this change will not only affect bombers but doing them in t3s as well which take quite a bit longer to skill into and hurt much more to lose it will hurt you as much as it will hurt us that do them in ishtars or strat cruisers
the solution above gets very little feedback from others but it is the cleansing fire we need to smoke the farmers out and renew the small gang in your war zone itll sting now but the amputated infection will save the body
just wrapped up the vote for me spectre fleet which was exhausting and satisfying even if i spent half the fleet podded i spent a solid halfhour before the fleet talking about my platform with the different members of spectre fleet which i will elaborate on later i spent a solid 2 days before that arranging everything finding good spots to hit figuring out which doctrine to use arranging a premade fight etc thanks to jayne fillon and mike azariah for helping arrange the whole thing and providing extra atrons for quick reshipping when fleet members got repeatedly blasted the fleet involved a roam into nullsec and a tour to faction warfare and while many ships were blapped quite a few juicy kills were had the most interesting part was a question asked during the fleet preparationsomeone asked how newbros would learn to duel rather than just blob everything the question resulted from me talking about getting newbros involved in pvp one of the members groaned saying the last thing eve needed was more newbros learning to blob blobbing has been a large part of pvp for me mainly because ive learned the concept of a fair fight in eve is laughable at best but not only does that deprive solo pvpers of content it also leaves newbie pvpers ignorant of combat intricacies that get lost in throw all the ships in tactics the dual mechanic is nice but that doesnt nudge interested players towards it by itselfso what if there were competitive missions from there an idea is shaped special hisec missions involving travel through cramped wormhole spaces where frigates fight 1v1 above lost planets a form of instancing the respective governments provide speciallydesigned ships and modules to the players for the mission regular ships cant travel through these microholes after all players can customize their fits for each type of mission and the game remembers these fits and provides them each time they repeat the mission an expansion of the rookie ships and civilian modules from something used solely by newbros and cynolighters to a platform for the purest dueling eve can offer no t2 or deadspace modules no implants no boosts just you your skills and your opponenti find the idea intriguing and wonder if this could become a unique feature to hisecnote this is extremely similar to my previous idea of providing free respawning lowpower shipsmodules to new players for a week to experiment with and could probably be tied into it its a shame how rookie ships and civilian modules are outgrowndiscarded as quickly as possible and i thinkhope they could play a greater role in the education of eve newbros with some tweaking
this question was asked of me in the brave subreddit im reposting my answer here since its a succint summary of my thoughts on the newbro experiencequestion if you could change 5 things related to a new players first days ingame what would they bewhat the newbro experience is currently missing is an emphasis on exploding cheap ships and exploringexperimenting wormholes are a key facet of that emphasis on wormholes wormholes are the easiest way for newbros to dip their toes into lowsec and nullsec and figure out which system they prefer tutorial goals set in lowsecnullsecwspace goals like mine some arkanor or scan down a wormhole gas site or see a warp bubble would help newbros realize theyre not restricted to just hisec starting out emphasize cheap ships blowing them up a newbro spending all his cash on a giant ship and subsequently losing it stupidly is the kiss of death for new accounts likewise an emphasis on applying for corporations without being scammed by them veteran eve players are more likely to keep playing even if they get scammed out of everything newbros arent a way to quickly get blown up over and over again to start without going through buying and refitting everything again perhaps change the rookie ships and civilian modules so if you get blown up in a rookie ship it respawns at the next station you dock in with the same civilian modules you had outfitted in it thats notably a rather big idea and prone to tweaking as i ponder what consequences thatd havei suspect the biggest obstacle to outfitting a new ship and returning to space after getting blown up isnt the money to buy it but the time and effort finding all the parts and refitting it its a nasty speedbump if you just want to get out and try again especially if youre a newbro that doesnt yet get the finer details of fitting
day 1 of lowsecin attempt to understand more about lowsec a region i am wholly ignorant of i resolve to spend a couple days in lowsec the end of the spectre fleet last night gave me the perfect opportunity to move there for support on this endeavor im relying on advice from spectre fleet the stay frosty pirate corp and a group of test members that are vacationing in lowsec to thirdparty faction warfareafter noticing how quickly my security status plummeted after a bit of thirdpartying on the spectre fleet i decide the only way to do this for any length of time and still be able to visit jita is to join a side of fw proper here i hit my first snag i need to leave my corporation to join fw unless my corporation also joins fw my corp isnt too keen on getting shot at by npcs in hisec and i dont want to leave my corp so the only option to join fw is to dust off an alt i buy a plex activate his training queue and hop onto him in the first time in monthshere i hit my second snag i want to join the gallente militia so i head to a gallenteowned system in caldari space i dock up at a station and try to join factional warfare and the only option is to join the caldaris confused i fly to another system and try again still just caldari it takes several tries before i realize it depends on the faction of the station you land in not the system itself i head to gallente space to find a gallente station i find one in a caldariowned system dock and join the gallentes only to immediately to be denied access to the station market the caldari owners do not like you i blink for a few moments trying to process that i cant join gallente at a gallenteowned caldari station but i can join them at a caldariowned gallente station and immediately get banned from redocking at the station for doing sonext i want to find a corporation involved in fw to do some group assaults my initial search produces a laugh when i find an ad that combines newpilot friendly and minimum 15mil sp requirement but then another chatter in the stay frosty public channel refers me to his own corporation their advert looks appealing but they have a full api requirement im not too keen on the thought of sharing my mains emails in brave so i tell their recruiter upfront im an alt and ask if they can make an exception despite being referred by a corpmate he turns me down we have enough trouble with spies getting in asis we cant make an exception i get the feeling itll be extremely tough for me to find a fw group that will take me in if a 130man corp has spy troublesin the meantime ive made my first fw pvp fit an afterburner atron that should fit the kingofthehill gameplay of fw gathering all the components requires visiting 3 different stations which makes me nervous what if i buy components at a caldariowned station i cant dock at wish i could filter the regional market by can dock at station once thats done i jump to find an active fw systemmy first rookie node only t1 frigs allowed has me nearly shoot a friendly rat and earn 0 lp for controlling it for 15 minutes apparently the system wasnt contested enough so i move on my second one a small node frigs and destroyers allowed i quickly warp out of when i see 2 destroyers camping the site my third another rookie node i finally hit paydirt i see an enemy merlin orbiting the node when i warp in he flees before i can fire the first shot i shrug and begin orbiting a few minutes later a neut frig warps in to thirdparty me its a close fight but he has an edge in damage so i burn away from his scram and warp off with halfstructure with that i dock repair and call it a daythe players actually participating in fw seem outnumbered by the players thirdpartying it probably due inpart to being required to leave your corp unless your corp joins fw as well i wonder why that requirement was implemented in the first place and what effect it would have if it was lifted could be interesting if there was a privateering mechanic that let players fight for either side on a whim without leaving their corpi plan to try out more of lowsec in the upcoming days now that ive established myself
tldr  wants lowsec turned into highsec so can pve morei guess with all this he still wants the rewards of lowsec missioning calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
op has been added to watch list may his death be big and expensive from one carebbear missioner to another  stfu
ya i agree lets move the frivolous newb harassing to low sec not high sec if a large group of dedicated pvpers want to fight go to low sec or null or wh space all youve accomplished is makin sure ccp doesnt have the funds or fan base in order to grow the game bigger better faster how many tens of thousands of players have been driven out of eve so a few hardcore players had something to laugh about or time to kill find your ego feeds elsewhere not at yours and everyone elses expense could ccp make more opportunities for fights with new game mechanics or more reasons to venture into low sec for sure so maybe people should be lobbying for better low sec content instead of making war decsantirecruiting easier
had a fruitful chat with some random people i found in eve today
ok now were getting somewhere i presume that the below list you provided for another poster lays out the areas you think are problematicfirst the erotica 1 policies to my understanding any policies surrounding erotica 1s behavior had to do with treatment of people online in various formats not misrepresentation of who one is i am unclear on how this relates to the csmon to the othersterm limits  i am unaware of anyone serving more than 2 terms on the csm but i could be mistaken however this aat least seems to be true for the vast majority csm members commit a great deal of time are unpaid and lose much of their actual gameplay and seem not to run anyhow after 1 or 2 terms so i dont see why term limits are needed as it appears selflimiting can you explain why they are neededpurchase of accounts this seems to mean money in ccps pocket if it is done and appears to be impractically expensive in terms of reallife dollars seeing as the csm is purely advisory and a tanginble benefit  the financial health of the company that makes the game  is demonstrably helped why is this a problem what should be done and why is it practical can you explainon the ganking and ingame vote buying again the csm is purely advisory and these behaviors are in keeping with eves tradition history and market appeal why are they problems that need to be solved and what is your proposed solutionfinally one other question  obviously the csm will not spend all of its time on your issues what do you plan to advocate for when not dealing with csmselectionrelated items
i am happy to do whatever else needs doing
you really didnt answer any of my other questions so im still curious to know why the issues you are running on should be regarded as problemsas for whatever else needs doing what does that entail are you saying you should be elected because youll be happy to do all of the typing and other grunt work csm members seem to do that is an interesting plank in your platform
do you ever answer questions
here we see why youre a bad candidate several questions to your platform no answersthe same with me earlier the same with many people earlierso again lets clarify your platform is for all i can see irrelevant to the game to several areas of game design your answer is id defer to someone who knows and while its positive that you would only speak up when you know something i dont think a silent csm member is proper your platform seems mostly born out of a lack of ability to acknowledge why you dont get elected its because people dont vote for you and do vote for other candidates candidates they like and support and who will champion their issues thats the basic function of any democratic process yet you want it changed the specific issues you bring up are either nonissues or so impractical theyre also nonissues your lack of understanding of both the csm the election process and at times even your own platform is problematic you are unable to answer questions and strawman them if you ever refer to questions youve receivedthen we have your history your own claims of your constituents and what genuinely looks like the classic megalomaniatrope and you wonder why people dont see you as a respectable candidatethis has nothing to do with fear of your platform by the way im very amused by your antics and as said before in this thread i would like you to run again and again and again because i enjoy watching your flailing at even the easiest thing in a campaignlastly i just realised what your slogan could bexenuria because i do whatever needs doing unless its answering questions talking sense or ingamerelated vote xenuriayou can have that one for free
lorelei you have my support maybe the op title could be a statement rather than a question i would like this to be eves yeari have a dreamthis galaxy will rise upand live out the true meaning of its existancewe hold these truths to be selfevident that all pilots are created equali have a dream that one day on the red hills of minmatar the friends of former carebears and the newbies of former sov owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhoodi have a dream that one day even the waste land of low sec a space sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of barrenness will be transformed into an oasis of thriving systems and conflicti have a dream that our four types of space will one day live in a galaxy where they will not be judged by the alliance they are in except goons  but by the content of their character i have a dream today
thanks to cap stable for interviewing me and for all the good work they do to shine the spotlight on wouldbe csm members  inform the community 3also gotta bwarp my own euphonium i received an award i picked up the community mvp award in noirs black mark awards for 2014
gevlon goblin raises a good point in his blog todaywhat the point of players corp for high sec solo players with the current wardec mechanics
i agree that was good
i am trying to think of a good one for podside its difficult to decide on the video but i do have an idea of what i want to do and i am working on gathering video and finding good audio from the podcast
mikes a good guy and a great csm member
updated the third post with a recommended voting order this is subject to change if other exceptional candidates are brought to my attention or for that matter if other fair or good candidates want to make a crossendorsement deal
sure something of value was lost something which unlike mining barges cannot be simply purchased back i seem to recall cannibal kane actually posting that he was at least miffed that code hadnt taken the tournament seriously as he one day hoped to participate  if you cant take his opinion as an authority on hi sec content creation as worthwhile i think you are a little daft you lost credibility you lost face good luck trying to get those backi could just as easily disparage ganking as something that only appeals to as well as only being relevant to a minority of eve players i wont though because im not so pompous and full of my own self congratulatory drivel that i have to vomit it up all over the place i would recommend actually participating in the tournament before you make a judgement but thats sort of impossible now isnt it
look vic sabriz has stated quite clearly and one would have hoped finally his views on the events surrounding at while not wishing to discourage meaningful debate on any issue relevant to his candidature my feeling is that he has now sought to draw a line under this particular incidentno doubt hell correct me if im wrong
im actually happy sabriz responded to my posts that post is entirely quoting and responding to haedonism bot
application formally submitted with all required supporting documentation passport scan etc
thanks sabriz now i can be really lazy
you have a lot of good points and suggestions for how ccp should go forward with the hisec changes and out of all the candidates flying under the we want a better hisec banner i feel your proposals stick to the spirit of what eve is abouti do have a couple questions and forgive me if youve been asked them earlier but i just want to know your opinions on two things hisec related in particularso the first thing id like to hear was what your stance on ganking is in its current state im sure you have some form of opinion on this since youre in the most infamous ganking alliance imo ganking is a very legitimate play style but is somewhat risk adverse as you go in fully aware that youre going to be losing the ship youre flying and as a result there is little to no risk to the ganker i was wondering if you have a plan to add risk to ganking or if you disagree and feel ganking is in a good place as issecondly i feel as though nonfw lowsec is for the most part pretty dead compared to hisec part of the problem i feel stems from the fact that there is little reason for hisec bears to move into low when the risk outweighs the reward for example how miners can make equal amounts of money mining in a 08 system as they could mining in a 03 system i was wondering if you have an opinion to the lack of reward vs risk that noncombat oriented playstyles have in lowsec and if so how you would change it if you could
the ganking stuff has already been discussed short version ganking needs more activity from white knights to make it more interesting for both parties this thread does contain a few discussions of ideas to work in that directioninterested to hear what sabriz has to say about low sec though
hi vic i get that thx
ganking both of freighters and of miners isnt totally risk averse ive lost an ishtar and a hyperion to killrights related to ganking although im somewhat of an exception to the norm as i gank on my main and do not run 10 in fact sabriz has always been 08 legal and almost always 10 legal ganks can be disrupted which normally results in a ganker losing a ship for no gain its just that while antigankers can effectively defend an individual specific freighter particularly if the freighter pilot trusts the antigankers they cant protect everyone where antigankers can be effective is teaching the pilots of noncombat ships basic opsec  something codes most vocal rivals at the moment refuse to do i post a lot of courier contracts as a trader and see a few repeat names that accept them often  these people never lose ships despite often carrying highly gankworthy cargoes such as a recent contract where i had someone move 24b worth of t2 ships or another where someone moved 35b worth of tech 2 componentscurrently theres two main factors that disrupt 10 operations in highsec  faction police and players being allowed to shoot you id endorse changes that keep the sum of these factors about the same but increase the power of players to disrupt ganksbut most of all the mechanics of mining encourage players to spread out and outside deep null where belt rats are more of a factor strongly discourage players from bringing any sort of combat escort to mining operations i would strongly endorse changes to mining mechanics that made bringing combat escorts more worthwhile sites with both lucrative ore and rats would be an interesting starting point and id endorse a claim system on these sites akin to what steve ronuken has proposed in the past where one corporation can claim a site via some method possibly driving off rats and mining that site then becomes a suspect level offence for other people balance would be key however  as any change to mining throughput could increase supercapital proliferationas for risk versus reward in nonfw lowsecfirst mining  lowsec is arguably the most dangerous place to mine and has terrible rewards as for suggestions one thing i have proposed before is changing the 105110 density ores to be higher perhaps 140200 putting very few of them in highsec and more in dangerous space mining in tama probably wouldnt ever become worthwhile but mining in quiet low might be worth considering if you can get a moderate amount of 200 quality ore and a good deal of 140 same caveat about supercapital proliferation applies here of coursesecondly missions its not just that riskreward calculations favor highsec over lowsec its that the reward for efficient highsec mission blitzing level 4s in semiblinged marauders are higher than the reward for efficient lowsec mission running level 4s in tech 2 fitted hacs or cloakcapable t3s even before you consider risk level 5s have different issues payout wise as their payout is almost entirely in low to medium demand lps and the small number of people blitzing them hyperefficiently can crash those marketsthird and related incursions even the addition of a bpc worth tens of billions to the drops and 50 higher payout doesnt make lowsec incursions close to as lucrative as highsec ones where you can just use blingfits and do the sites much faster constellation control amplifies this  lowsec incursions generally have a higher degree of sansha control when sites are attemptedone suggestion i have is rebalancing mission payouts and incursions so that higher level highsec missions pay primarily in lp but sites in more dangerous space pay both isk and lp this way the more people that run missions or incursions in highsec the lower the payout becomes and its a noticeable dropoffanother suggestion is expanding on the theme of burner missions changing them so that a pvp fit is required ie the mission target tries to warp off this change would require rebalancing of the rat stats making them involve a few more jumps and making them more prevalent and more lucrative in lowsec more people traversing gates in pvp fitted ships would revatilize low somewhat
you got my vote core  keep up the good workfor the critics out therethe way corebloodbrothers writes and talks about eve and csm is straightforward and full of passion for the gameive flown with him for quite some time now and although he is not the best of writers or a self promoter hes genuinly caring for the game and the players his way of typing and explainig shows that he wants to tell his opinion and views not windowdress and paradehe could use a campaign manager for that but on the other hand this is just the way he is getting things done and work hard instead of applauding minor accomplishments convo him when you have questions get on comms with him watch the videos and reports on evenews24 he has great views on sov and nullsec i vote for core not because hes just a great guy to fly with i vote for core because he actually believes in something and is willing to work and stand up for those believes
my capstable interview is assessed in their weekly roundup show starting from the 51 minute mark
well you cannot avoid everyone vs everyone in a 1man corp you just make yourself a less attractive target which works only so long you do not raise your head out of the melange in any case any concrete suggestions or ideas on how to enable a social effective way to interact that gives people necessary tools to remove unnecessary risk you may say that my billions in minerals t2 mats bp ships modules and assets in general to help others are just pixels but it is pixels i have invested a huge amount of rl time and rl money into and therefore it is only logical not to expose that to theft misuse leeching lazy players and so on any concrete suggestions whether ccp in the end heeds them or just pushes forward their own ideas is impervious to me i am supposed to cast a vote for you
dear god can i vote for you 14 times
thanks for the support it is appreciated
why are you tolerating in evenews24 rasist comments users posting under the name russians are new ebola or crap like uneducated barbarians are you doing something to moderate this or prevent iti hope this does not reflect your own opinions or the opinion of the owner of the site but you are responsible for the content of what is posted
we try to moderate the comment section as much as possible however you have to understand that we can only do something about these posts after they have been posted i will check it right now to see which ones i can find and react accordinglyalso i like to point out they are not en24 made comments they are people commenting on our site the only thing that reflects our opinion is our posts except those with disclaimers we also focus on game related information whatever happens in real life is out of interest and we will not comment on it at all
figured i would respond to a few worries1 yes im a media guy as people like to call me but i manage a team of writers nothing will change if i am lucky enough to become a csm member i will still post battle reports videos and everything else2 if i for any reason have to go inactive for a long period therefor not able to work correctly as a csm i will step down3 all the drama that happened in the past weeks aint me thats on their names please dont see that drama as a connection to eve media guys running for csm i do my own thing which i will keep on doing nomatterwhat4 nda doesnt mean you cant enter discussions write articles etc it means that you cant talk about specific ccp ideas and their plans pl has an nda too and you dont see me break it while still discussing eve5 im not trying to get eve on rails i want to give people more options also not a good idea is still an idea which you need in order to get the right one6 myself  en24 has never had any problems getting in contact with any ccp employees and me being csm would not benefit in these contacts at alllast but not least the number 1 rule on en24 is that everybody is free to write about whatever they want we are a bunch of eve players who enjoy to find out what happens in our favorite game and like to write about that the term media sounds way to serious en24 is a lot more chill zone
he is already space famous so this is an invalid pointcan you find anything better to say maybe ask a question or something
i like your downtoearthness and lack of fear to try unconventional things if your videos are any representation of what youd bring to the csm youve got my vote
this is a severe handicap when it comes to making deliveries in lownullsec
sorry um what are you campaigning on besides representing players all of us are campaigning on that but most of us have some kind of focus were specifically bringing to the table do you have one
i am campaigning on providing an unbiased player perspective with a focus on meaningful and quality gameplay i do not believe bringing an armful of baggage in my specific wants and desires but rather my knowledge and experience with both the game and process management real life experience in order to facilitate change based on the amazing amount of data already available from the payer base and the development teams defined vision resources and capabilitiesthanks for the questionin terms of focus i have been playing for so long i dont believe it is about pigeon holing issues but looking at the game holistically and ensuring that change doesnt bog down into overly narrowed focus on singular game playstyletype so new player experience highlownullsec life pve pvp logistics industry subcaps caps mechanics balance etc are all aspects of the game i have lived and both prospered and suffered withi am also not married to any particular style or mechanics niche i happen to live and play in null sec right now so obviously sov is a big issue but the game is much bigger than just that and i am thus interested in the greater development of the game more importantly how do we get from where we are now to where the devs have stated they want to take us to be able to contribute to that conversation it is important to not be solely focused on my current life in null sec and not be blinded by not wanting to change how i play or worry about my current assets losing value and allowing that to turn into patch work narrowly focused thinking that misses the overall pointi have already been through the logical dont tough my  and eve is just about  lifecycles of thinking now i just want the game to meet its amazing potential where the sandbox and emergent content through player interaction all play into making unique player driven experiences possible making it possible for each players individual goals to be met and where personalizationcustomization and a sense of ownership allows players to feel like the things they make and the actions they take are uniquely theirs and matter in the bigger pictureso really not too much i guess 
however if i were biased  it would be in the following wayccp has stated that they want the players to drive contentccp has also stated that players should drive new eden and help shape our surroundingscurrently things are predesigned by ccp and handed to uswhen we make things they are not ours atleast there is nothing unique about them when we build something from scratch it is somehow the exact same as all othersnew ideas continue to be slanted in the UFFFDhave it your way as long as it is one of these limited choicesUFFFDships are all preslotted preattributed and preskill bonused so that our choice is usually just to do what some dev thought we should with very minor variations and usually less efficient variants one of the biggest misinterpretations of how this sandbox is presented and how it plays out is that the players invent discoverinnovate produce blueprints designcustomize manufacture and distribute assets in a player driven economy where we are really just walking a very rigid predefined path to make the exact same stuff as the next guy one would think based on the terms used that personal choices and uniqueness are intermingled all along the way to make a ship unique and not just all at once in the very sterile UFFFDfittingUFFFD portion where none of the aforementioned even matters for all we know if the trend continues into how the new player made jump gates are developed we will just be autopiloting through a series of predesigned and optimized choices with only one solution think in terms of mixing the hacking minigames with dotlan where we are just clicking through choices but really the path only goes to one place and it just took time and luck not skill or personal initiative to get there we wonUFFFDt really be shaping anything just playing out a very slow and expensive minigameskin licenses are another great example we will soon be free to customize our ships with a paint scheme as long as it is one of these choices we already predesigned for you and oh by the way you have a bunch of weird nonindustry type hoops to jump through to get them and they arenUFFFDt even intrinsic to the ship in question just another perishable hassle ridden postproduction no marketable value addon think insuranceinvention needs to be actual invention exploration needs to be real discovery manufacturing needs to allow for player customization and uniqueness so that both quality efficiency and style are a value factor pve needs to play into pvp shooting npcs should be a primer to shooting players with similar loadouts and trainingand the list goes onthis game has a long history a ton of knowledgeable players enormous potential we all feel it after we have unsubbed for any given amount of time a great narrative and a surprisingly good mechanics structure really terms and placeholders for both world economics and player lifestyles it is just a matter of having the will and fortitude to implement change that takes this game to the next level where self sustaining emergent game play becomes a reality ccp has shown signs that this is now possible it has looked really bleak in the past with their new design philosophy and actual practice they just need to get from here to there with player perspective input of all typesthe reason i am running for the csm is to both represent the player baseUFFFDs current quality of life issues and help keep this big picture perspective in the forefront and ensure that questions are being asked along the change cycle that drive in these directionsquality of life is where representing the player base comes in and where my priorities will be placed whereas the remaining pipedreams mentioned are my underlying biases in terms of how greater future change can be implemented and what it should build towards
its actually been better personally there is only one mineral that is hard to get out here which when we need we usually head into highsec to get it mexillion aside from that i have no real issues and i find it safer out here vs being a highsec miner better ore as well the only time our operation has really been effected is when our system was under heavy traffic by gorgon and they have attempted to take it over but we readjusted our operations and now are back to being pretty steadyas as far as the extra high slot its to give more options  in this case of the extra high slot it would make better sense to give it to the skiff and procurer since those two are meant to be able to tank and hold off pretty decently the high slot vs power grid i think that the high slot would be beneficial because it can give you a better chance since a lot if not most are usually solo and again gives you that extra option for survivability and not having to rely on having backup at all times extra shield doesnt give you that even if you have backup that backup may not get to you in time so having that extra option if you choose to go with a skiff or a procurer would be nice
hey first sorry for the delay in responding i wanted to think about how to go about this i also wanted to release my post about scouting firsti do not see myself as a wh candidate first and foremost while i now live in one i am far less experienced than corbexx for example which is why he has my vote i try to look at eve as a whole so i do understand a lot of wormhole mechanics and grievances i also know a lot about corp management which is a big sticker for wh dwellers as well1 i have lived in a c1 for about a month and then moved into a c4 a few weeks ago before that i would daytrip as part of exploration2 i think that the mechanics around whs themselves are in a pretty good spot for the most partwh timers system effects sleepers etc the mechanics around living in one corp management and poss are a mess fix those and you will see a lot of problem whers suffer from go away i do know there is some stagnation in the meta on the higher levels so shaking that up would be good low level sleeper exploration sites are total garbage3 i have a pretty comprehensive scouting reform that i would like to suggest that would directly impact whers also fixes to the minigames such as pi or hacking could improve common activities of wh dwellers 4 i support putting things into whs adding new ones to be discovered without putting them in patch notes and having continued mysteries where ccp puts in the clues and we figure it out and ccp incorporates our actions into the canonical lore we are seeing that more now but even more can be done5 i wrote an article on my vision for poss linked in my original post6 corporate management is a total mess thankfully reform is well underway i suspect that by the time i took on a role as csm they would be pretty well wrapped up with this all that said i thing fundamentally the idea of roles isnt totally broken but simply isnt clear and there should be a ui to test your protectionsfor example you can test as a role i can action to check to ensure all levels are controlled also default roles etc etc there is a lot of little things that can be done and i am very happy that ccp punkturis is working on it
ill leave this here for you to use if you want to
thoric is great guy you will find him open and honest he been a good friend in eve and great leader of our group null secindy moons pve pvp sov holding and cat herding so from the null sec side he been there and done that he does what he says and you can count on him thats why i voteing for him
what do you think should be done about the new player experience to help with player retention you mentioned not wanting new players to grind for plex to sub their accounts but you didnt say much else about the npe
i think that players should use the trial to actually try the game the metagaming is so hard that we arent likely going to let trials in in most corps or alliances sadly but this said the tutorials or something else should have a way to showcase the game better to the newbroseve is a dynamic place it is not only killing the same rat a million times before you are done it is not only about rocks many newbros are fooled into thinking that missions and mining are the best thing to earn money as a newbro and they stick with that until they give up because grinding 800m as a newbro is hardbut there is a lot of stuff just to try out there why arent we showing them exploration wormholes ninjagas mining even getting eyes over one of those huge fights that come up into the social media whatever eve is a real living thing made up by players it breathes and it is amazing but we have to show them how amazing it can be without having to wait weeks or months or forever until they suddenly make into a corp that does that kind of stuffeve is a game about meaningful decisions but you cant decide without knowledge and without anything to compare take a newbro into nullsec have him die to a gatecamp give him another ship and teach them to be careful show them to use dscan and stuff to venture into the deep space without being completely alone or relying into having lucknew player experience is showing them why we love this game despite all the huge wall that the learning curve is we dont need a flat learning curve either but many things can be improved the first two weeks of a character that can dramatically change the decision to subscribe or to leave forever because lol grinding internet spreadsheets online etc
this candidate is legit two fisted standup guy his website  podcast after tmc is the goto resource for eartotheground journalism you have my vote a return player who followed the meta in the form of crossing zebras
you keep referring to barleguet for those of us who are new what exactly does this refer to
barleguet is the only named system in placidwaitokay so barleguet is actually a system in placid that outside of historical context is rather unremarkable it is nonfw lowsec off the beaten crowded path with a few l5 agents it is usually quite empty and devoid of content as most nonfw lowsec tends to be many moons ago when brave was just forming under the auspice of maximizing fun per hour they made this system home in the course of a few weeks local went from hovering at 34 to being a stable 130250 or more at all hours of the day their home station became as well stocked as any secondary hub full of new opportunities for competitive trading no matter the time or how big or small your gang was you could rush to barleguet and find fun and even reship on demand silly fun was never in short supply repeated welping of cheap ships trained many newbies into hardened pilots planet sevens belts were perhaps one of the better places to get good with dscan and find threats or targets people camped roamed dropped and otherwise had fun based a simple concentration of people however brave outgrew barleguet and headed for sovnull that may be natural ecological progression but it was a very sad day indeed for placid and syndicate  where else could one go for instant contenta premise of my campaign is that against all odds a group of moderate size was able to live in poor unremarkable space and in doing so that space came alive if low sec and npc null was made even slightly more competitive for newer players with bottom up resources accessible to non veteran players we could see people doing far more interesting things currently far too many people get trapped in hi sec waiting for sp or isk to accumulate enough before venturing out it shouldnt be that way risk and reward should be in synch
not empty quoting not empty quoting your impression is correct the shorter development cycles usually reduce the lead time the csm has as far as i know no none of that time is specifically blocked out for the csm and certainly not two weeks worth the csm has stakeholder status on one team and do sprint reviews with them right now the provisions are mostly provisional the csm has been added to confluence which may help us keep better time will tell how it works out in practice but thus far i am optimistic roadmap accessibility is something im keeping a close eye on its likely to be key to keeping the csm looped in and able to engage in a meaningful way in the new release environment the csm isnt really part of the development process at all nor do we have a formal placement within the development process or structurethe business specifics i cant engage with however for answers there it is probably best to target your questions to ccp all i can say is that ccps structure and how ccp seagull runs it makes a lot of sense
thank you for the clarification stakeholder status was another unclear term in my mind and i wondered how it related to ownership in the sense of scrum player stories are one thing i thought the csm would be perfect for i dont mean to say devs are at fault for not being subject matter experts in your cap stable interview you addressed the matter of indepth knowledge and mentioned that individual players outside of the csm are likely to have the most experience in specific areas of the game still wouldnt the csm be ideal for providing player stories for being bound to an nda while very close to individual playersin your latest blog post on tmc you closed on the topic of csm integration into the development process access to the road map is great but wouldnt it be better to have access to backlog items and player stories player stories strike me as a mutually compatible piece of data between the csm and scrum going forward into csm x this topic of csm integration which you mention consistently strikes me as very important to the function of the csm and communication between players and ccp being an invested player my hopefulness and faith in eve depends on this communication process i suppose this isnt much of a question and i mostly just want to say you are addressing the csm on a level that is reassuring and i enjoy hearing about questioning the process of the csm with a mind for reform
hello siondo you still log in to the game and fly spaceships etc
any suggestions with jump fatigue
reduce the fatigue bonus on industrials and black ops
let me address your 3 main points however on a quick side note i agree that social interaction is a nice function of eve but not all players require or want such but still want to participate in parts of the game that normally require it this is a social argument that ccp will need to address separately if this is a legitimate concern to them i will not address any of your points with the premise that social interaction is required because it simply isnt as much i do like and prefer it some do not slaves are a lot easier to manage than corp matesall three of your points argue automation letUFFFDs separate this out into 2 more solid arguments automation within eve client and automation outside of eve client this debate can go on and on until ccp issues a static statement saying what is and isnUFFFDt in their mind automation part of the current multiboxer concerns so they have declared that input broadcasting is considered against their policies you use the term automation like these programs are inputting commands for us while that is correct in the case of input duplication that is not necessarily the case of the status quo since the eula update currently you are required to enter a click or keystroke for each and every command to a client i need to release a video explaining this to people to show them how it works currently and that may settle some opinionsso currently the way i multibox is i have isboxer same can be accomplished in multiple other program i simply prefer the interface isboxer provides i use isboxer to arrange my windows so i can click on parts of each client in rapid order instead of alt tabbing this is how the majority of multiboxers currently using isboxer utilize it legally to assist in our interaction with the eve client this setup takes hours and sometimes days to put into place and does not even then remove any of the UFFFDtrainingUFFFD required to become proficient and effective this does decrease our margin for error which is the point of the program and setup it does not however make us better than any other player by default that is on a personal pilot training level and not mitigated a program mistakes happen and happen a lot that majority of the community sees only the UFFFDharmfulUFFFD effects or the perfect pilot that lays waste to a poorly fcUFFFDd fleet or a fleet that has been trapped expertly by the multiboxers allies it is silly and downright stupid to blame the multiboxer for being better than his 7 counterparts in a single player per client only bombing fleet as far as automation goes the limit of our automating capabilities go roundrobin is the only pseudo automated form of multiboxing that people have considered and it isnUFFFDt really that effective thus far finally you like to combine automated multiboxing into one phrase that is botting and bannable by the eula and not something multiboxers are concerned about nothing is automated in multiboxing using isboxer and it hasnUFFFDt been it requires user interaction for everything i will also argue or more likely point out that wow largestmost successful mmo to date and others such as eq2 and rift allow multiboxing and even allow input duplication with no game destroying sideeffects multiboxing isnUFFFDt automated it doesnUFFFDt destroy popular games and it does require a significant time investment to get good atcheck out my podcast my blog
i have quite a few stances on my blog and in my original post for csm  small gravity capacitor upgrade changes ice changes for ventures still need to blog about this one npe for whsmultiboxing specific better pr for multiboxers better eula definition and enforcement provide a ccp  multiboxer conduit for discussion
basically thisi cant support anyone who thinks large scale multi boxing with 3rd party software is oktheres a really big difference between manually running a few accounts at the same time to increase pve efficiency or scout ahead of a pvp group ect and running dozens of accounts with paid for 3rd party software in order to gain an insurmountable advantage in pvp andor pve stuck in here with me
actually i am trying to separate them but iphone typing isnt that great what i was trying to do is separate out what end of multiboxing you want i suppose ill try thismultiple accountsmultiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to monitor themmultiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to send commands to every account at once by pressing one buttonmultiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to make decisions for you so you are afk making a pizza bottingwell remove botting in total because no one wants that yourself included a monitoring program nobody is arguing about such as replicating your desktop so you can see whats going on on another account heck i tool around with eve previewer myself because i have two accounts one monitor i cant input commands into that other account without first clicking it bringing it to the front and interacting with it which causes me to lose control of my primary account its no longer in focus i treat that program as a poor mans second monitor you use isboxer in that role too nobody has a problem with thatits when you the one person can control and interact with every account simultaneously give commands to everything at once and can both execute and perform jobs which would take a group of people to do sometimes multiple groups but you do it solo were not talking about you magically switching between 50 accounts pressing f1 each time with such speed you melt your keyboard im not talking about outshipping content battle cruisers in level 1 missions im talking about having your own army to perform group functions as if they were solo content and using programs to control the entire thing full nightmare fleets in incursions controlled by one guy full bombing wings controlled by one guy full ishtar gangs run by one person full mining enclaves run by a single person those arent that hard to run though you remove the need for people actual breathing people from the game when you the solo person can replace them in totalwe currently have this exact mechanic as a part of the game its called drone assist ccp decided to nerf it down because the community complained people are still advocating for drone assist to be removed entirely the difference here is that with drone assist the person each individual can still screw up the fc could get headshot then its confusion until number two takes over hot mics arguments decision making target calling the need to type a message copy paste a dscan report check if the people are actually flying doctrine fits or happen to fit some billion isk loot piUFFFData jump commands escalations friendships asking for help the joy of playing dies eve is anti social to a lot of people if you want to do group content that is otherwise impossible without using that program or others like it then it should stay impossible now do i care if you want to solo or not no i care when you want to remove the content meant for groups by doing it all yourself when the program replaces the rest of the group you kill the point of grouping honestly i hate playing against isboxers because our group activity vs group activity turns into our group against one guy and his army of accounts it wasnt a fun group interaction it wasnt pvp it was our group trying to break down the wall 1 guy made with his 100 accounts maybe i am just old fashion but to even ask if you can use an inputting program in this game i am just a bit of an ideologue who thinks good fights with like minded people is better than good fights with an atomitom its been said 100 times before and it will continue to be talked about in the near future with all of that said as you are representing the wormhole group i do look forward to the townhall
im not really sure what you mean here but are you actually saying that there should be more home site content in whs because if you are that the complete opposite of what the actual issue isthe vast majority of high end wh corps run pretty much all their pve in their home system farming sites with capitalsthis leads to low content all around since it is extremely safe for them to doif anything corps should be encouraged to venture out of their home system to run site not the other way aroundthis was done alreadywhat are you basing this on most of wspace is very empty and it is easy to find even empty hs static c2s which historically were always fullit take very little effort to find an empty wh of any class for a new corp to move intomore ore sites is not the solution here ore is freely available in wspace because no one mines ita big part of this is the move of ore sites from sigs to anoms which is something i firmly believe was a mistake and should be reverted stuck in here with me

i agree that most of these need addressing though id like to hear more on how you specifically would approve as far as the changes gothough again i say it mining caters to a playstylelimitation some players have if you dont like how passive it is then do missioning minigames should never be the answer especially when your going to be required to do it endlessly for hours straight thats where most redo mining ideas fall apart even if you find a candycrush not even that fun killer once someone is forced to do it endlessly for a couple hours its not fun anymorebesides if we lose mining as a passive income source am i just supposed to stop playing while doing paperwork or actually being at workschool which recently has started taking up any hours im not asleepbesides mining is already dangerous enough with gankers i dont need my attention split even further trying to watch local or dscan while navigating some horrible minigame why i left exploring after the changes

i know where youre coming from while i find industry work pretty boring just being alert for that suspicious t1 frigate tailing you is something that requires being at the keyboard however i have a vision for industry that encapsulates what we have now while also providing rewards for actually being at the keyboard doing things how does this sound we would leave the current very simple option for doing industry work as it is but introduce minigames as an enhancement to industry rather than a replacement that is to say you mine x amount of ore whilst doing your taxes now you still mine x amount of ore post patch but you have the option to complete a small minigame during your cycle that gives a small boost to the yield of said cycle this would simply expand your options without eliminating or limiting any playstyles that you currently have too badly of course this would have some implications for the mineral market and i feel thats something best explored with ccp this also could apply to inventionresearchcopying for blueprints you can leave them in and cook at default speed or spend some time playing minigames in order to shave off a few days here or there i feel that adding options like these would only serve to increase the possibilities and playstyles of eveid like to take a moment here to say that i am a great supporter of the manufactured by x addition to all player made items everyone should be able to sign their work
right but i and a good chunk of eve are vehemtly against eve becoming a game of qtes minigames just become a chore the third or fourth time you do them because they never change theres no way to actually make them enjoyable and the worse part its already proven bots can do most better than humans so this would just encourage people to use botting programs because any edge is nonnegotiable especially in closemargin business like research and mineralsso people would either burn themselves out of eve in short order trying to force themselves to do the same minigame for the 500th time that day they just stop doing that activity entirely which for many would be the only thing they do in eve besides chat with friends so likely theyd just mvoe to another game and keep using the old teamspeak channel or worse yet just start using bots so they can keep their edge without killing themselvesall considered i have trouble seeing any positive benefit to adding minigames besides making a previously simple activity mroe complex and time consuming for the sake of anything that keeps them from leaving the keyboard for 5 secondsas for the manufactured by x its technically impossible the database handles objects in a simplistic manner all of item x are identical the second they are packaged they become a single dataline changing this would mean you would have to have multiple data entires for every item in the game to account for every possible state that single item could be in rather than a small list of possible states that general item type could be
you do have a point however id point out that in other facets of pve eve players already have similar options available to them take ratting for instance some people semiafk or even completely afk drone boats to mindlessly grind isk with minimal interaction while others spend hours meticulously cutting every corner possible to speed clear sanctums and maximize their incomes whereas in industry you have one option click button take nap i want to see industry expanded so that those who are willing to put in that extra effort can reap additional rewards in ways besides running 12 semiafk clients i understand that you find changes like these distasteful but i promise that i will keep your opinions in mind when discussing possible industry changes or additions on the csm itself i will also do my best to give feedback to the community within the limits of the nda on any changes that may have an impact on your current playstyles so that i can be an accurate reflection of the wants and needs of the community as for eves code i know its bad but youve gotta have pies in the sky to shoot for when ccp finally defuses the pos code from the bank of england or whatever its holding hostage even if theyre small ones
theres a difference between missions and industry thoughin missions it doesnt matter how fast you kill those red crosses each enemy is worth the same amount and always will be whether you one shot them ignore them or semiafk fight themin industry anything that improves or gives you any edge is mandatory flat out its why alot of people discourage noobs from industry since in most cases to see profit you have to have skills at all v this is because values in the industry proffession as opposed to the missioning profession are dynamic if i can make a product faster or cheaper than somebody else then their entire attempt is near pointless as i and every one else who can do that will do that and keep the margins 001 iskd just enough that anybody who doesnt do it cant make profit over base costas for mining bonuses the more ore you mine the less its worth youll see the active miners make about as much now as inactives before if not even less and the afk miners will just be making a token amount of isk that really doesnt amount to anything tangible and again here your proposing mechanics that for alot of people will limit the amount of isk they can make an hour in a proffession that already makes some of the lowest iskhour in the gamei get you just want to see improvements but when it comes to things like miningindustry any change that gives one group a bonus over another only invalidates the group that doesnt have the bonus because market values are not consistent and unchanging like missions in markets you can either sell something cheap enough that it actually moves or you cant and depending on whether or not you had those bonuses youll either make money or realize you may as well give up
i just do not feel that handicapping everyone to the same form of industry is a fair choice i do agree with you on your point about the current state of mining if you dont have 100 of the bonuses you do not compete as i said before ive been there manufacturing is a razor thin line to walk and it was difficult to make isk however market pvp and all industrial roads lead to market pvp is as much a part of eve as any nullsec brawl or wh furball and industrialists deserve to have more options than train every skill to v then n1 accounts thats why i feel adding the ability to use actual gameplay to increase your ability to compete in eves harsh markets will foster more budding industrialists than it harms
i support this product andor service1 stuck in here with me
we dont need a kickstarter we need ccp to stop putting money into nonexistent and failed products legion dust514 world of darkness and stop trying to grab headlines with a vr game with a very limited audience not many people have headsets
so if i read this correctly the way to do rmt in the future will be buy aurum  trade for plex  sell plex on market just like every other nex itemim also wondering how gifting aurum to people would be any different to contracting them a plex with no fee well apart from the free aurum a bunch of us received as part of various celebrations
wtfpeople arent using titles as access control groups isnt that the whole point of titles being to give personnel officers tools to better manage roleswow i can now understand why some people think roles are truly broken i just want finer grained roles such as title a means people can access the pos labs at pos x while title b means those people can put fuel in all poses but not take fuel and certainly not unanchor stuff while title c means those people have full control over all pos functionality include unanchoringso new customer education program required and i guess the ability to toggle the public visibility of titles
emphasis mineoh yes pleasealso it would be nice if pilots could create their own wallet divisions it would also be nice if pos usage fees could be paid from personal wallets
and using words other than society mean you lose the import of prepending secret 
it wouldnt in principle it never really was since aur store goodies could be traded for isk and they could be traded for plexbut yes in future the relationship will be more direct thats why youre exceedingly unlikely to see any more such gifts in any meaningful quantity or at least unless and until ccp are really desperatethe aurum mountain left over from the incarna era has been a stumbling block in the way of nexneswhatever its bloody called now reform for years the mct cert was a very clever revenueneutral or perhaps even revenue positive way of clearing that mountain out now that its gone the way is clear for ccp to deploy aur products  services in a more rational way as long as they steer well clear of anything that has direct ingame effects im fine with that and so should you be too
does anyone know why withdraw from the csm x elections source
there doesnt seem much point in speculating since theres little we can do about it in any casemarlona hinted at rl harrassment occuring against him  family members what the truth of that is its hard to say he did tread on some sensitive toes and there are some idiots out there who might think it amusing or profitable to do somehing like that but he was also something of a dramatist as well
that was claimed months ago well before he decided to run in october if i recall correctlyhe simply couldnt deal with the inevitable criticism he drew as for the aftermath to my knowledge he biomassed and gave away all his assets to a new player donation program
just found it weird that such a dedicated character would leave like that it has to be something spontaneousfor the speculation side of it i hope it is not oog player harassment if so ccp should be notified imhowho ever he made enemies with in game it is all about content creation and therefor he will be missed
if any csm townhall is ever done again my first question will behow will ccpgames see the csm if you compare eve online with visiing starbucks source

dear capsulers of highsechere i found a nice summary of what tora bushido stands for
the post of mark eting is rightand yes give me more wardecks and so i say tora not for csm
havent read it all yet but it looks like great tears i approve 
no tearsonly your right face you and alex meyerand last but not least i dont pay 1000000000000 isk and i dont rejoin gse
nvm question answered earlierwhat is your stance on the phoebe jump drive changes do you agree with it disagree with it would you want to keep it or roll it back and remove it
tora i have a questioni see that you have plenty of excellent ideas for changes to be made but how would you take control of your seat on the csm to make these changes what are your plans for making your vision become a reality how do you intend to have an influence on the csmps did you write that passage linked above about you being a blackmailer come on now be honest
its always hard to get your own ideas on the agenda best way to do so is trying to convince the csm ccp one by one and let them see why some of the ideas should be added to eve but in the end its still ccps decision i might be all grrrwar dec everything in game and enjoy being a evil guy but the csm is hard serious work if i make it to be a csm theyll see a way more serious side of methat link above is about 50 true and 50 bull ships not something i feel like responding to here move it to cp and i might if i have the time
thats it youre going on my list tora
this guy is the man i will vote for him for surecorbi have my babies
mike really again supporting you again if you are not tired of it burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
easy because there are many many more qualified than himcommercial bla snippedcommercials do not change the fact that he is not qualifiednoooo it is just not risk averse enoughat least you admit that it is riskaverse not complety but  mostlyso only a complete numbnut has risksdo codies ever realise what stuff they write
i dont see any in fact i see a pretty poor crop of candidates overall to the point where i expect at least 4 incumbents to be retained probably more like 5 or 6 or even highersabriz stands out rather well
most or all of the incumbents seeking reelection for csm x are easily worth voting for
someone asked me last night what if you woudl dream a change somethign that fits your voters i woudl say upgradable systems in a big and meanignfull waydream  owning sov gives u credits which can be used to upgrade your space over the years of owning it you have yo make decide what matters first and most as holder as you get to convert your activity into upgrading ore types amount of belts number of anomalies me rate refining bonus station or gate guns in your null more pos anchor locations pi balance upgrade for a jb jc cycle time fatique bonus all sorts of stuff u can make a long list of desired thingsthose things are stakable over time u can make awsome system maybe keep high end moons out of there as they are conflict drivers in themsleves which is good for years u invest in your systems whilst you grow your community can grow as your space becomes more self sufficient and can hold more and different people this doenst necesarrily mean more iskh but a feeling of achievement where investing pays offi woudl die for my space now
greetings corehope you are well i would like to ask how you would like to see supercaps rebalanced or given new roles to play or even removed altogetherwas a privilege flying with you good luck with the campaign
hehe i live in provi any dead super and titan is a good one as long as its not mine  but its also a item peopel trained and worked hard for with fatique they already in a better place now but its no secret i am a big fan of subcap fights ratehr then gettign dropped with 30 supers ruining any chance of a goof subcap fightthis is more a question though for goonn3  titans as mobile destructable stations supers too delievr power too player owned stargates haha i dunno just thinking out loud dying titans make great news though and atract people to eve thats the upside of them we shoudl not forget that either
my play for the plhabit vote
both originals are better but with a literal half a billion views i suspect that most habit members will have that nagging feeling that they have seen shake it off somewhere before
hi mannyhave you any ideasopinions on how supercaps can stop being the cancer of eve
im all for carriers and dreadnaughts in hisec cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
since they changed the gates to allow capitals to jump through them im honestly surprised no one has found a way to do this
i endorse this product from bobman the rumours of isk transfers are highly speculative lol in all seriousness i cannot think of anyone else that i would rather use my toons vote for  now if he was only in a half decent alliance then maybe if i had two votes he would get em both lol jk vote bobman for csm10ljbceo dion dion one of the oldest corps in the game
bob gets my 1 ive worked with him a lot at en24 and im tempted now to edit his speach as well as his articles and flying with him in ncdot i know hes a good guy plus he even visited me in hospital at fanfest and offered me grapes thats what true eve bros should all be like
dont remind me of that hospital experience not going to lie i was pretty nervous to see how you were doing
1 for chance brought old vets back and is creating a lot of contentid rather trust that chance will bring some new blood to the csm then voting on you tora justmy2cents
just a note everyone ive updated my campaign post with some links including a link to my recent interview with capstable which includes a lot more detail about my thoughts goals and ideasif you have a chance check it out
chancejust wanted to mention that i think you hit it out of the park during your cap stable interview the interview is what garnered my vote i thought it was the best done of the last several your energy is undeniable yet you present yourself quite well i look very forward to seeing what you might be able to dothanks alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
hey khadori like your approach and as i already had the pleasure meeting you in rvb i think you will be an excellent candidate for csm xeves future in terms of what ccp is planning for is quite interesting for me especially that ccp wants to widen the sandbox aspect allowing players to destroy or build even stargates and stations andor getting rid of concord as a space police the later is a speculation by myselfwhat would be your approach to achieve a new eve experience granting players even more control and power on the one hand but still keeping the game accessible and not too cruel to new players under this aspecti am not asking for details or specific features but more like whats you position here regardslegedric
i have known harry for several years in game and will gladly stand by him and endorse him for csm x
1 got my vote here
yes thank you for that
no prob and good luck you have my votes
i have few unusually direct questions for you being as you and your alliance was one of those impacted by this changewas the phoebe jump changes a mistake would you fight to revert them would you get rid of the 5 ly jump change jump bridge fatigue etcdo you believe there should be no jump fatigue timer at allone final question its pretty well known that the phoebe jump changes killed the botlord treatydo you believe botlord was a good thing and would you fight to reinstate such agreements if the phoebe changes were reverted in other words would you agree to return everything to the way it was before phoebe
i will continue to bump and endorse frosthammer for csm x just as i do harry saq
thanks for the questions phoenix 1 the idea of neutering force projection was necessary and i support it for the health of eve the way it has been implemented with jump fatigue i find to be singularly annoying and punitive i would argue that the 5ly jump limit needs to be extended slightly because it prevents people from easily moving even within regions jump bridge fatigue is excessive and punitive given the cost and effort involved in holding the sov in the first place and installing the bridges the timers are aggravating because they can reduce ability to coordinate in fleets because of previously acquired fatigue i think theres a way of implementing a force projection limitation that doesnt involve this excessively complex and annoying mechanic 2 there are many treaties and agreements in place that arent as well known as b0tlord many of them remain in force and others are negotiated all the time politics is a thing in eve as an alliance leader i will support whatever at a diplomacy level secures the interests of my alliance at a different level i want to say that your premise is slightly off b0tlord didnt die because of phoebe at least not directly it died because pl gave up its sov that happened because of phoebe but if pl had sov today i would bet you dollars to doughnuts that it would still be in force ill go back to expand on my original candidate statement and say that you cant fix eve by telling people not to play the game to win or to do things that arent in their own interest to make your life easier human nature says that wont happen what is needed are changes to the ruleset that penalize risk averse behavior if signing something like b0tlord kept you from acquiring resources that your alliance or coalition needed to have or which put you in a substantially better position you wouldnt sign it but since the resources dont change and so once acquired tend to stay acquired by the same entity inertia sets in and those agreements make a lot of sense if your goal is to minimize risk to your own resources
i have removed a rule breaking postthe rules5 trolling is prohibited trolling is a defined as a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting other players in an attempt to incite retaliation or an emotional response posts of this nature are disruptive often abusive and do not contribute to the sense of community that ccp promoteisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
around the 32 minute mark onwards falcon is going on about how it is horsesh that null alliances have the greatest influece and further downplays this by stating that only four members are null and the rest come from other interest like miners and mission runners
not sure why you had to mail me the answer and couldnt just reply to me on the thread its a pretty straight forward reply by you
i didnt want to  my thread up with a oneliner i talked more about this in my cap stable interview that will be released soon i hope there is also the problem of me not feeling like i have actually been on the csm to write a review coming in late into a close knit group saying hi was pretty hard goatsephobia thanks m8 i deny all accusations of shitposting in the swe channelsion kumitomo wrote some nice words about me
do think rookieships should be player built because ships should not spawn out of thin airand handing out free ships is a form of capsuleer wellfare 
i dont really consider free noobships a big problem i wish there was a button to trash all mine though because they clutter up my assets window  i dont have a problem with ccp handing out special skins for certain ships like that scorpion but they need to be super transparant about it im sure there will be some jelousy but i think that good stuff for the community and the game should be rewarded the new ship skin system will make it less of a ships spawning out of thin air thing btw
you got my vote for supporting small gang  solo pvp plus your employment history speaks for it selflast monday we had a noobship ffa with a dozen capsuleers and 2 eve radio djs as moderators someone won a plex that day source
stakeholder status is unclear in my mind too it isnt a stakeholdership in the scrum sense access to player stories and being able to provide feedback there is a good idea but nothing like that currently exists i concur communication between players and ccp is of paramount importance still a lot of work to be done there when i have time which is rarer than i would like
good tmc article you have my vote
dear sionsince you currently are on the csm and have expressed thoughts about legislating the process and the rules by which we play a sandbox game i want to forward this ideanow that must likely the csm white paper is being rewritten would it not be a good idea to put in some abridged right of interpellation source
how would you communicate your csm term to your voters if electedburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
do you live in a black hole if not why are you so eager to advocate for changes to someone elses home i live in a black hole and am very happy with the weather as it is
actually no i dont live in one i have heard some feedback on them and it seems they still need a tweak however i would like to here from you on how you see them
well by talking to themseriously in game wise i hang out in the wormhole channel the help channel etc you can always send me a mail or convo me out of game im on twitter slackfleet and irc
the blackhole favors missiles as they experience a greater range and due to the explosion velocity bonus the damage application keeps up with the faster ships ships move faster and webs are less effective which favor mobility the longer targeting range fits in nicely with both the faster movement and the longer range of missiles that movement requires the pilot to think ahead a bit more as agility is challenged and speeds are higher turrets and drones both experience tracking issues as relative motion is often greater yes capital escalations are a bit more difficult but there is far more to life than the use of dreadnaughts for pve that increased difficulty can be dealt with so it is not a deal breaker all in all it is a good set of effects which work together in interesting ways they permit different doctrines but are not as oppressive towards random guests as either the wolf rayet or pulsar i would label it as something done right rather than a feature in need of change but all of that is not what caused me to trip over your request for my vote my concern is that if you intend to advocate for the space i live in you should do so in a way that is respectful of the way i use the space and play the game half thought out ideas are harmful rather than helpful and to be honest it would be better to have less wormhole representation than a representative that causes bad changes should you be successful in advocating that my home changes the likely result is that i would have to move the team to a different system and that is not something that will earn you my vote
that argument makes more sense so i am more arguing for having the eula defined better however letUFFFDs define what is legal currentlymultiple accounts  legalmultiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to monitor them  legalmultiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to send commands to every account at once by pressing one button UFFFD recently against eulamultiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to make decisions for you so you are afk making a pizza botting UFFFD always against eulaso myself i utilize legal approaches and multiple accounts while using a 3rd party program to monitor them i donUFFFDt need a 3rd party program to send commands to every account at once by pressing one button but i also know that some are angry that this has been taken awayi would argue that a monitoring program is exactly what people are argueing about legal multiboxing with isboxer is monitoring and sending commands one at a time to your eve clients i like your description a lot UFFFDcant input commands into that other account without first clicking it bringing it to the front and interacting with it which causes me to lose control of my primary account its no longer in focusUFFFD this is exactly what we use isboxer for nowi understand people not wanting others to play solo at the same time we were never meant to live in wh space i do not agree with ruining others playstyles simply because you donUFFFDt like it thatUFFFDs what this boils down to ganking and hotdropping could be treated with the same acid of community misunderstanding and mob mentality i agree that you are more than welcome not to like how i fly i do not agree that you or anyone should take that away now ccp is the guardians of the game and they have the ability to do whatever they want if they remove multiboxing all together iUFFFDll leave until then i will fight for my playstyleto the mr miton
i will hopefully be there to talk about wh stuff not multiboxing just fyi yes this will be a never ending debate lolcheck out my podcast my blog
holly twostep balls i dont even know some of those dont be so cruel in the end running for csm to represent a group does not mean you have to know them what it means is you have to understand them not sure how it is in this case though shrugburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
thank you for the backing up i do understand that i am not well known but i still hope i can be a good choice to bring the feelings and views of all wormholers to the csm not just those of a single large wormhole corp
chitsa is my friend and is a super nice guy please dont misunderstand his alarm as back up no offense to you as a person but your campaign is very ignorant of the community mechanics and gameplay in which you intend to represent youve had some very knowledgable wormholers share thoughts and voice concern and you ignored quite a bit of it you clearly arent suited for this position yet again you may be a swell guy but you need to learn more and be more responsive and interactive to do the job you seek
i was gonna say something but then bert posted so im good
hello mista cortex and good luck n stuffin the absence of my bigger sista id like to ask you what would be on the forefront of her campaign querieswhat are your views on wormholer fashion in yc 117 and do you think the physically simulated hair look should remain with finished portraits and not just be a visual feature in the character creatorid still really love to see his answers to those questions though
do you live in a black hole if not why are you so eager to petition for changes to someone elses home i live in a black hole system and rather like it yes some things are more difficult but that is part of the charm as well as the balance
it wont though the new requirement will just be have all skills to v then do every minigame as fast as possible the second its available your still competing with the same products with the same profit margins your just upping the amount of sitting at the computer staring at something required to participate
aiwha wrotewormholes more newbies wh space is desolate its not dead but its very empty i want to promote more ways for newbies to see both the riches and danger of wh space and become a new generation of crazy mad max capsuleers  this can be done as a player similar to braves efforts

i approve of this candidate very knowledgeable about wspace and from my past interactions with him he seems like a stand up guy1010 will be voting for him
whats your problem with clowns we got families to feed too
im not racist butclowns are scary
well one different approach to the system in use atm that i had in mind was to remove the donation of lp entirely and in his place substitute it with a permanent  detraction in lp from the total amount that you get from a missiona fw site reward and from killing enemiesfrom the actual system you collect lps actuallythis way the tiers bar would be tied to a more random effect instead of a constant donation of lps from farmers to one side until the market flips plus defending and capturing a site would have a meaning beyond the actual lp farmingflip the system it would be lp farmingflip the systemlp contribution to keep and raise the tiers level furthermore the  of lp detracted from a player conquering or defending a site would decrease as the tier level of his faction goes up to a point that to obtain and keep tier 5 would require a lot of manworkfarmingsystem controlpvpetc for examplealso it would mean that all the factions could hold the same tier as long as they will have ppl actually fighting capturing defending missioning instead of the actual one side only system i say one side only system because once the farmers exploit the market enough from a single factions lp items sell they switch to the other side and those that are there for the true meanings of fw pvp with a lore underground they simply dont count that much even though they are those that fight the mostlose the more and flip systems more than the farmersbasically those that make the hard work pos shooting gate camping roaming you know the jobi would also add more pve random content honestly for example packs of amarr coercersminmatar thrashers trying to camp an enemy faction owned stationcapture a siteetc
if there was one thing you could do to change fw to make it not so stale make it harder for farmers to just make lp without contributing to the effort and to get better fights what would it be
it would be good to get a fw representative on the csm i am glad you are runninghow do you plan on enticing more groups to join fw at the moment there is not a huge incentive for players to join fw outside of farming lpdo you have any ideas about how to make system upgrades and tiers worth more than they currently are at the moment a systems level means almost nothing and the tier just determines whether it is worth running missions or notin your opinion should the ability to run fw missions in a bomber be nerfed even harder the initial intention was as i understand it to encourage players to fly pve ships through lowsec to run these missions in a bomber they are not only too safe to run they are also not a very interesting target to hunt even if nothing else where changed other than an extra 35 light missile batteries at the warpin for each site i would be happydo you have any ideas on how to encourage people to fleet up in fw space
you have my support however i have one question what do you think could be done to cater to people who join a side  in my case amarr  not because of the farming potential but for lorerp reasons  i dont think you should be able to jump sides so easilygood luck for the election

just heard you on capstable podcast im actually well impressed i hope you do well and seriously here this man out
what i find hilarious is that players are all but there are no apparent plans for new gameplay beyond the door yet meanwhile ccp is planning on allowing us to create gates that lead to space with apparent plans for new gameplayof course there are ideas and possibilities for both i just find the rhetoric amusing
hope you dont mind the skill loss since your last clone installation as you as a capusleer do not have the implant ability the dust troops do or would you settle for a permadeath
UFFFD external page giving more pageseriously though i think the concern here is merited new players are introduced to the idea of plex by word of mouth which is usually not accompanied by admonishments about trading with dirty scumbags on the internet who steal your credit card detailshow do we provide warnings about what is and is not a legitimate plex seller without breaking immersion inside the gamei think the simpler issue is how to address the issue of rmt in general especially since the intent is to sell aurum with plex being a nex itemmy suggestion would be to a ensure that you have a current email address for all subscribers then b include warningadmonishment about illegitimate rmt through the newsletter
confirming that he left and donated assets to operation magic school buswill not comment on reasonsm
as this isnt an assembly hall issue ill be closing it
as its highly probable the player behind the character in question is or would be quite capable of deciding for himher self if any justification should be given as would most players of eve for that matter in similar circumstances its rather futile to speculate on the matteras such thread lockedisd ezwal
what is your opinion on the new state of industry throughout the regions of high low and null are there still changes you want to see and if yes what direction would you like to see
there are a few minor tweaks to industry itself that id like to see mostly tweaking the build time of t2 back up a bit right now its pretty easy for a single producer to tank a module by over producing itindustry itself is in a pretty good shape i do want to see changes with structures but those are coming thats around the support infrastructure for industrythen you have resource gathering i think theres work to be done there not taking away the current action of mining which a bunch of people like because its relaxing but by adding alternate options which are self limiting so you cant just shift a big mining fleet over and making much more isk over a long time but you could shift and make more in less time at the cost of more activity and adding more game play around finding sites to mine once you have them you can just lock on strips and keep going but you have to find them or have someone find them first something longer lasting than the current belts and sites
here is your ad if you need or want something changed let me know and we can work it out good luck with our csm campaign
here is your ad
1well made video you should post it on reddit
and i am not advocating or assuming that the csm gets to approve bans or control bans i would however like to know if the person applying to join my corp has a shady history etc that is the rationale behind my wall of shameoh heaven forbid that any game company anywhere lets players have anything to do with hiring or firing i have of course been reading the blog posts twitter et cetera of csm9 and have decided not to say anything more about it at the moment
sounds like an epic story why should tora be apart of a csm ballet if hes creating content this seems like an excellent piece to go along with the rest of highsec fun if gse lost 500bil and cracked because of it yay content if gse cracked because of poor leadership yay content if gse is currently falling apart and tora is deccing every shed corp yay contentdeletetheweak
0 toraas a fellow merc i would love some changes to the gui for contacts and wars to give us more tools to analyze and organize data here are some of the things i think need changing i may spend some time to make some pretty pictures for these but for nowwar history a way to organizesort war history by date ended rather then date began there are a number of other ways to sort them that id like but this is the main one colour code the background of each finished war with green for winner and red for loser  this gives some quick visual clarity add a search function that allows you to look up all wars that said corpalliance was involved in including assists add a pay bill button and confirmation to the right click options for active wars so you can do it from elsewherecontacts allow us to add a secondary colour tag to contacts for organization for example i set pending wars to orange active wars to red and i leave neutrals clear for when i mass add corpsalliances id like to be able to set a secondary colour tag for things like known neutral scoutslogi gankers etc etc label groups please let me make a group of labels so i can split them into random wardecs contract targets  other mercs clients etc corporation pay bills is buggy and shows a lot of finished wars please fix add a show info button when right clicking to pay a bill to give quick access to the corp info add a search filterother create a customizable label that can be assigned to corpsalliances that all members can view or even better have it customizable for certain roles would be handy to be able to set contract targets or clients to a easily viewable list or have an icon that appears on show info to immediately indicate the labelim sure there more i will add later this was just off the top of my head
god yes to all of that how do i give you more than one thumbs up
this gse drama shows that tora is loyal to friends this is supposed to be used as a reason to vote against him that is some fairly odd logic
in these difficult times i at least trust tora and sabriz a hell of a lot more to make the right call at the right time on any given issue  than the likes of mike asariah or sugar kyle who just nod sagely when ccp suggests more nerfs to the game we lovejust as you can always trust a mike asariah or sugar to side with a nerf and making eve into disneyland with slow papercuts you can also count on tora and sabriz to defend the sandbox and say hell no it really is that simple everything else is campaign conjecture theatre for the autistictora the man the sandbox needsf
this year im starting to have a look at the running csm candidates in a bit more depth and ive written a short review of your campaign which can be found here
you have my votes here is the campaign ad i made for you i hope you like it
thats amazing thanks alot

yes yes yesmike is a nice guy who works hard but wasnt dexter also working hard at slitting throats on hbo each week while wearing a warm brotherfather facade hardly a dexter but in mikes case its nodding with trainedseal approval as ccp slits their own throatsalso this is pretty damning commentary from another csm who also sat behind the curtainsmy point is this csm membership shouldnt be a popularity or workethic contest for dexter shure worked hard at putting a lot of bodies in the ocean it should be about people who will simply fight to the death to defend the damned sandbox we dont need a fencesitting trained seal or carebear supporting nerfs we need someone who will defend the sandboxeve is not wow for a reason but mike would take us there while pretending he isnt helping ccp do just thatf
1 vote for dexter mikeanyone who slaughters bad guys hunts evil promotes fun is good in my bookmike isnt trying to turn eve into a theme park he likes the sand box just as much as you and i do
for those of you unwilling to click the link i brought it over with a reasonthe reason is i agree with almost all of it i just see it in a different lighthe remains unconvinced of talking to the electorate to going and and connecting with the players to being on these forums i am convinced that is what you are electing me to do communicate if you think csmccp knows best and they do not need you bumping his elbow then vote for people who only talk during the campaignsfence sit i always try to see both sides of an argument and usually both sides have some good points i do not like things in black or white for us or against us part of the problem or part of the solution the world does not work that way it is of compromise agreement consensus so i engage ask and look for the gems on each side of an argument but that does not mean i waffle notice he did not accuse me of that i do make a stand but usually it is somewhere closer to the centre than some others do since he is more to extremes he finds me tough to readactive and engaged    wow that is really damning i have nothing to say to defend myself against thatanarchist yup i make my own rules and have an ingrained aversion to playing my game for someone else that is why i do not do well in null casual players cannot play alarm clock games cannot make their monthly quotas of fleets and required activities in sions eyes a lot of players are probably slightly anarchistic i represent themi read sions article and laughed what he saw as negatives are my best features i like sion as well i get along with most folks comes from that centering tendencies of mine i am what i ammmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
none of them are high sec content creators though
that depends on what your definition of content creator is sabriz seems to have a blinkered view as if any change which doesnt promote codes ability to shoot newbies is automatically not content creation as if shooting a bunch of mining barges piloted by players who generally have no clue what they are doing is actually worthwhile content to support
their track record of advocating for nerfs to our playstyle and of general uselessness speaks for itself i realize that csm is a sort of club and that most current and former members like to stick up for each other to the rest of us though if we are paying attention and being honest csm9 looks to have done as poor a job as csm8 didthe field doesnt look much better for csm10 either sabriz and tora both stand out in that they both represent an important and historically underrepresented playstyleit is true that there are others out there who are better qualified to represent highsec content creators than sabriz is unfortunately none of them is running this year and sabriz is more qualified than you may think if you judge him purely on his killboard which certainly isnt bad you may scoff and say bah hes no cannibal kane no arden elenduil no jerry rin jerry rin for csm and unban him too please but the fact remains that sabriz is smarter and more fair minded than all of us put together and unlike most highsec content creators he actually takes the csm seriously if you elected me to csm id show up at the summit just for the free food is there free food and just troll the whole process from start to finish
your statement shows that you do not know sabriz what he stands for or what he has been saying considering how much youve been posting in this thread i find that surprising
to me this is the key and why sabriz tora or ideally both should be ellected they represent a play style that currently has zero advocates as csm candidates funky bacon filled this role on csm 9 and i was happy with what i saw from him even though it wasnt his primary field of focus if neither of these guys get elected than every csm member will represent either nullsec wormhole space or carebears having at least one of these two candidates will give a voice to a play style that currently has no representation on the csm and no sabriz is not running as a code candidate though he is in code hes running as a content creation candidate vote sabriz
quoted for truth these are the men these times call forf
i was highly disappointed by the changes to jump freighters and the jump bridge network core will you in the future fight to improve the mechanic or even reverse it in the coming year
thats a bad remix
its not a remix its a mashup hayoure too old its no surprise you dont get it
hey jaynei have a question that hasnUFFFDt really been addressed but i believe could be a concern for others who are interested in being a part of the npsi community i spent a long time in the game doing a lot of pve stuff and frankly it became boring i was about ready to leave the game when i found spectre fleet and the other npsi communities like bombers bar rvb ganked frigate fun sir squeebles redemption road etc the npsi community revitalized my interest in eve online and i love how in the community i can jump on several different fleets a day depending on my mood with any of the npsi communities and still feel at home itUFFFDs great how all these communities cross over and thereUFFFDs no sense of hard feelings if you flew in a bombers bar fleet with the same guy in the morning and in the afternoon killed him when you were in a spectre fleet and they were with one of the other public fleets itUFFFDs npsi everyone laughs about it and youUFFFDll fly with them as friends the next day with npsi really being where i learned how to pvp i developed the mindset of ashurman where UFFFDthere are no blues there are no reds you just kill anything you can thats not purpleUFFFD at least for that short while your in an npsi fleet just donUFFFDt be a jerk from my experience many regular npsi pilots have the same UFFFDhippieUFFFD mindset where thereUFFFDs no reason to get butthurt over a little friendly npsi pvpmy problem started when i joined a corporation that was part of a large sov holding alliance at first it was great and i looked forward to even more pvp where i could either join the sov battles and experience that aspect of the game or if nothing was going on or i was in the mood i could hop into an npsi fleet i thought i could have my cake and eat it too unfortunately i was surprised to find thereUFFFDs a lot of butthurt about this nonsensical blue thing the worst part for me was when iUFFFDd join an npsi fleet iUFFFDd run into a ton of UFFFDbluesUFFFD out there and youUFFFDd either waste several hours on a fleet when the npsi fc blopsUFFFDd a blue carrier while you sat on your hands or youUFFFDd have to make a decision to throw away your good name and awox instead of having my cake and eating it by getting on all the pvp i could handle i ended up frustrated and disappointed because 50 of the ships the npsi fleet would see were blue sov alliance members a lot of my other corp members who were npsi pilots found this a problem as well which culminated in a number of them leaving the corp or UFFFDmessing upUFFFD and shooting blue eventually i left the corp and alliance as well because at heart iUFFFDm an npsi player but i do wish there was a way to do both npsi and fight in the larger sov battles without drama for the most part it was inferred to me that i had to either choose the sov alliance and quit npsi or choose npsi and quit the sov alliancewhile your club idea is interesting on some levelUFFFDs it doesnUFFFDt address this sort of issue is there a way to have my cake and eat it too is there a way to be in sov alliance but have them not get all bent out of shape because i decided to join an npsi fleet one slow afternoon someone in a club would still have the problems i hadone thought i had that you can use and consider if you get on csmx is the idea that if someone joins an npsi fleet all your blues see you as red or orange that way they know at that point in time your not blue to them and vice versa perhaps a notification to alliance and corp mates that during the fleet you are not a friendly you can kill them and likewise they can kill you and there will be no butthurt on either part if thereUFFFDs worries about spying perhaps when you join an npsi fleet your corp alliance and any related alliance scouting channels would be unavailable to you that way no one could say your a UFFFDspaiUFFFD maybe it just comes down to large alliances and corps understanding and rethinking npsi and pvp as a whole maybe people just need to get over internet space ships as being UFFFDsuper serious businessUFFFD or maybe iUFFFDm just an npsi hippie and need to shut up regardless i wish there was a way i could have stayed in the alliance i was in and still be able to do npsi pvp when i want and how i wantat this point i jumped into my own small corporation so no one gets upset and i can do what i want as i so choose itUFFFDs a little bit lonelier though and in some ways i would like to join an alliance that gives me the benefits of working with others i think my example showUFFFDs an issue where npsiUFFFDs regular members will be forced to stay in loner npc or smaller corporations and alliances it would be nice if we could find a way to address that
this year im starting to have a look at the running csm candidates in a bit more depth and ive written a short review of your campaign which can be found here
so by strong platform you mean1 ccps idea of corplite sounds neat i should be voted based on this even though i didnt contribute anything new to the ideaand2 complaining about wardecs   but providing no alternative
no by strong platform i mean that he has a good understanding of what the csm does hes got a primary target audience but has evidenced that hes able to consider issues outside of that area and has a good idea of what will be beneficial for the game overall id trust him to make decisions and raise concerns as a csm member that would help ccp improve the gamelook i understand that you have some personal issues with jayne and i dont care not even a little bit whether or not some random player dislikes a csm member is completely irrelevant to my opinions of them i dont care if he wronged you i dont care if you feel like his actions make him a a terrible person i simply dont care what your opinion of him is im calling these like i see them and in my honest opinion there is no better csm candidate for players who enjoy the npsi playstyle
please look at my posting history and you will see i critique several csm candidates i dont have a personal issue with jayne and he hasnt done anything that i feel wronged about his idea for the npsi portion of his platform isnt even his idea and the issues outside of that area i assume you mean wardecs provides no actual solutionwardecs are currently badok i disagree with your premise that theyre just griefing tools but sure what is your suggestion to solve this problemtired of candidates that say x is a problem but offer no ideas or solutions
its not a csm members job to come up with all the ideas its their job to present players concerns and ideas to ccp and work with ccp to ensure that what they do deliver is designed around what players expect in this instance jayne has simply answered a question about what he would remove from the game if he could and struck a chord with me hes not being asked for a replacement idea and i certainly wouldnt expect him to come up with one quite honestly though removing wardecs as they currently stand would be less terrible for the game than their existence currently is as they stand they make it completely pointless to attempt to run a corp in highsec which is bad for player interaction if you run a corp that isnt a pure pvp corp and you get beyond a certain size you become an instant permadec target for the few groups looking to farm easy kill id love to see large corporations of all types duking it out in highsec but that just doesnt happen very often at all
garbage csm is not just a stand in theyre suppose to help ccp by presenting possible solutions and ideas because theyre suppose to have first hand experience on the subject a csm should do more than say hey ccp x demographic is complaining about y issue theyre suppose to communicate possible ideas and suggest solutionsof course it struck a chord with you not surprising but heres the big point you shouldnt be able to run industry nilly willy without conflict so yes if you want to run just a pve indy corp you shouldnt be able to you need to htfu and be prepared to defend yourself plenty of highsec corps do exist and simply being ignorant of that fact doesnt necessarily mean we need to turn highsec into wow styled candy land
lucas thank you for the kind words i initially saw your blog when it was posted in the eveblogs channel on tweetfleet and was pleasantly surprised to find that youd chosen to write about me as well as mike how many of these do you plan on completing
youre very welcome thanks for running at this point im just going to chug on through as many as i can before the voting concludes im aiming to do a minimum of 10 though
ask a dozen people what is the csm or what is the role of the csm and youll get a dozen different answersthat being said i think your statement here is way off the mark at no point has the csm ever been about peddling your own ideas to ccp in order to get specific changes implemented the csm has never operated that way nor has it operated as a mouthpiece for whomever complains the loudest suggest specific ideas dont know about you but i dont have a coding background and i would wager that 90 of the sitting csm doesnt either i dont know what is physically within the realm of possibility and i dont know what ccps current development focus is either without a conversation with ccp nothing productive is going to get done if it was just about communicating ideas and suggesting solutions im sure we could keep on keepin on with nothing more than fi threads and crowdsourced solutionsthe csmccp interaction is a two way street its as simple as thatthis year im fortunate enough to have my interests in game perfectly aligned with the development roadmap that ccp has already laid out my expertise can help ccp redesign a portion of the game which needs work an aspect of the game that ccp has already begun tackling i dont want to suggest or design allencompassing features  theres simply no point thats what the actual employees of ccp are paid to do as csm i want to make sure that ccp gets it right i want to make sure that they have the best information and perspective possible in order to design and implement the best product thats how i can helpif you dont believe in my vision of the csmccp interaction well i dont really carethis is almost exactly whats written in the white paperkey section be available for formal feedback on work in progress mattersi may not have been the only person responsible for having crafted these ideas but ill tell you one thing  ccp didnt come up with the societies proposal on their own weve been tooting that horn for a long time  way before the minutes were released its nice to finally see the fruits of our labour from all of us both on and off the csm who have contributed to the proposal
tommas i read your post and i appreciate the kind wordsill reply to your question soontm but im going to take my time and answer it in full youll probably have to wait for the weekend before i can give your question the attention it truly deserves there are a lot of good points id like to touch on
presenting ideas yes coming up with their own ideas not so much sure if they can think of a good idea that solves a problem great primarily they are there to give feedback on what ccp is doing before the playerbase is allowed to see it i certainly dont expect csm to churn out ideas like they are living in fiexcept i already do run industry nilly willy without conflict i just sit in npc corps run solo corps and outsource to other solo players and at the same time why should industry players be forced into being targets of wardeccers for what amounts to pocket change if they want to form anything beyond a handful of players why should you be able to make just a pvp corp but not just a pve corpand yeah theres plenty of highsec corps just very few big highsec corps big highsec corps and alliances are generally wardeccers or pure pvp groups its not just useless to attempt to run a large highsec industry corp its shockingly less efficient even if npc corps didnt exist running everything as solo corps would be far safer than piling together industrial characters because the moment you get past a certain size you get permadecced by a group who pvp all day every day i agree that conflict is required but the current wardec mechanic is fatally flawed because it doesnt promote conflict it promotes antisocial risk aversion it would be far better if the mechanics for highsec promoted players to need to work against each other both with pvp combat and with economics it doesnt though right now it simply acts as a way for pvp players to turn off concord so they can farm easy killsthat all said however the fact that you refer to it as turning highsec into wow styled candy land suggests that you have no interest in a serious discussion over it you want to reject it out of hand because you assume that the suggestion is get rid of fighting in highsec even though both i and jayne have explicitly stated that to not be the case
no problem jayne whenever you get a chance to answer iUFFFDm just glad it wasnUFFFDt lost in the other dialog now iUFFFDll take a stab at the at the wardec discussion a bit what about rethinking the highsec as a whole 10 systems are supposed to be the UFFFDsafestUFFFD systems where concord polices them with the best response time etc what if concord determine that 10 systems are considered a UFFFDpeace zoneUFFFD and a war dec does not include 10 systems 10 systems are deemed neutral zones for corporations 10 systems arenUFFFDt all that profitable for pveUFFFDerUFFFDs but it still gives them a safe area during war time it doesnUFFFDt really hurt pvp war dec corps all that much because in order to get in and out of 10 systems the war targets still have to go through 09 and below space they just have to gate camp the 10 system and itUFFFDs basically business as usual one could argue the possibility that 09 systems should be exempt from war decUFFFDs as well but i wouldnUFFFDt go any further than that now these UFFFDneutralUFFFD systems wouldnUFFFDt be completely exempt from pvp i wouldnUFFFDt stop the normal ganking can baiting etc
bobmon is pretty much the worst he kept talking to me and being passionate and enthusiastic and then i started to realize that hes a good guy and that hed be good on the csm but im a goon and hes the chief editor of en24 i couldnt like him to do so would shatter concrete laws of nature and send the universe itself into chaos and not the usual kind of chaos the universe ending kind of chaos but i cant help myself and so it is with a heavy heart that i confess bobmon is pretty okay no more than okay hed bring whatever strange power he used to melt my cold black heart to the csm and hed create pax bobmonica and all would be right until the fabric of reality unraveled so you see bobmon has doomed us all and for that he is the worst bobmon 2015 because there wont be a 2016
sion
bullshit you published a badly written page hit driver with no research done and not an ounce of consideration for the people you  on by wording it the way you did the worst thing is you still show no sign of having learned anything from that debacle nor have you shown any understanding of the wider benefits of recent changes rollback the phoebe jump changes i mean reallysion passion for your subject matter is a good thing but it needs to combined with a working brain and a sense of empathy neither of which bobmon has shown he possesses so i wont be voting for him and i highly encourage everyone else not to either
i dont want to roll back the jump change i just wanna tweak it using the playings feedback just like any other new thing ccp has put into the game since the start
1 got my vote bobmon putting alot of effort here nice read aswell  good luck
your stance on wardecs in general is what would be the decided factor for my vote on you although i agree the system needs to change there are a few things i would like to have addressed for the most part you seem to under the belief that the victims of a wardec are just that victims from my experience rarely are defending corps often have several things in there advantage the first and foremost being numbers common decced entities like brave newbies and the such out number every wardec alliance corp out there they lose massesively because focus is not applied to the aggressors but when they do put focus they end up kill a neat amount of ships lookin at you drop bears other smaller corps often have the advantage of having the aggressors having to come to them in their home systems home system were the targets are have the ability to have a counter ready to undock for the most part from what ive seen the victims of wardecs are only victims because they allow themselves to be the victim there are exceptions but if you create or corp made of sub 4 month players your bound to get hurt is that a problem with eve in your eyes eve was built on the idea of actions should have reactions with that i ask do you feel that wardecs are a problem due to older players picking on younger players you use of victims seems to make me seem so personally at least or do you believe it is underlying layer that belongs with the npe and the tutorials not properly explaining things with detail if you had free reign to change the wardeccing system how would do so war dec dodging a corp closing once it is decced and reforming with the same name do you feel this is an issue as it basically defeats the wardec feature as a whole or do you feel that wardecs are unbalanced in the favor of the deccer that it is a necessary need until the system can be reworked thanks for the response odeletetheweak
youre the reason i signed up for eve and youre my ref i knew the game since 20082009 and i had multiple trials in that time but ive never had the chance to grasph the gamethis is not a regular orc game go kill rabbits and pick up gold this you have to learn for everthanks to you im flying nemesis and im doing fairly well
the wardec system is unintuitve because it allows someone to bribe concord to look the other way but doesnt for some reason allow the defenders to counter bribe concord to protect them because of this wars can be extended indefinitely even if the defending group has a gigantic fiscal advantageyes people can defend themselves but they also have to humor troll wars that are declared by organizations with no intent of having a war against them in any military or financial sense wingspan could wardec 100 corps tomorrow then sit in w space showing the pointlessness of this backward system
many have already expressed my reasons for endorsement so simply  thumbs up
deal chancei want to thank you for inspiring me to come back to the game with your youtube videos you have my vote best regards2becuil
i see many of u are questioning his experience as a pro or vet in the game i dont think he is a good pvper or a pro but he creates content inspires fun as a solo pilot with 1600 kills i couldnt care less if he knows how the hit the right mod or has spent time in null with the power blocs or knows much about highsec wardeccing noob merc corps all i care about is at the end of the day eve is a game that when played should be fun and entertaining and a lot of vets have forgotten that eve is a game for fun not a job or has a specific agenda to push for csm when i see his vids and what he is all about he is only person i believe that doesnt have a specific agenda and isnt a puppet for one of the factions but a representative of just having a good time in a video game which is what eve should be about that is why he s got my vote
while you clearly arent what some would describe a bittervet i think thats a very good change from the traditional csm layout its great to finally see a marketing guy step up to the mark and ill certainly be considering you as my votejust a few questionsconsidering that it has been deeply ingrained in peoples minds that eve is a space sociopath spreadsheet simulator how do you plan to go about dispelling the bad press that surrounds eve online do you intend to push for more traditional television advertisements or focus primarily on an internet audienceif you had to pick one thing to be emphasized moreat all in the tutorial what would it be and whyand finallyconsidering all those unclaimed plexs sitting in your account have you ever thought about making it space rain on unsuspecting newbros
1 i support the above message
she has been a great corp member and works hard definitely has my vote
the cap stable podcast recently sat down for an interview with ashterothi it can be found here
i would like to point out this recording was done before the drama with funky bacon came out obviously my answer has changed
hail thoric  he surely get my vote
thanks for the info i would guess this is a case of people who dont live in black holes find it hard to adjust to the effects where as the people who do live there get use to it ill guess they will have to just figure it out
ill say it once again since you apparently didnt read my last comment theres a really big difference between running multiple accounts manually and using 3rd part tools to assist in running them even if youre not sending commands to multiple accounts with itnote that i say this as someone who have multiple accounts and does manually multibox in many aspects of evei consider myself a multiboxer and you do not represent my views at all in fact you represent exactly what gives multiboxers a bad reputation and what is wrong with multiboxing stuck in here with me
angrodyou have taken a pretty polarizing approach to your campaign in regard to multiboxing although i appreciate your perspective as an individual advocate for your playstyle you arent running for csmx to be an individual advocate you are running for csmx to be a representative and advocate for the playerbaseyour responses to players who advocate against your playstyle has shown that you are defensive which is fine for an individual advocate but as a representative you shouldnt polarize your constituency i dont agree with your style of gameplay personally and personally i think using a third party automation to run multiply clients at the same time is akin to cheating i multibox when ive done pi cynoscapital movements mining manufacturing and occasionally scouting i have never used an automation service to do this and ive sometimes messed up and lost ships where i wouldnt have if i had used a third party servicethe point is that as a representative you have to be able to represent this playerbase and if a strong majority of your constituency says that they dont want automation services allowed for multiboxing then you have to represent that view to ccp if you cant do that you arent suited for the position and shouldnt be running for csm
ill respond to each of you mr miton i understand and have read your views on third party applications i understand you do not agree with third party application i simply disagree with the statement theres a really big difference between running multiple accounts manually and using 3rd part tools to assist in running them hence my response either way i advocate for what ccp allows mr diadochu i agree that i am polarizing and that this is a very polarizing subject however you like many before get confused with the whole automation concept i am not advocating for automation currently automation implies no player interaction multiboxing even with third party applications requires the same if not more interaction i realize that not alot of the player base wants or even likes multiboxing or third party applications i am advocating for those that do as well as other aspects regarding whs npe scanning and the most recent issue i see with ice in shattered frig wormholes if you dont think i should be running dont vote for me simple as that bottom line mutliboxing is not automation many seem to be confused about thischeck out my podcast my blog
this is where you are terribly wrong i dont confuse automation and you clearly have no clue about how automation works i work with automation every day at work automation actually has quite a bit of user involvement and requires a measure of control depending on the depth of the automation protocol automation in the case of multiboxing is layered similar to an onion you are lumping it all into one definition and are wrong about this subject and like xenuria refuse to accept that you are incorrect and instead are just telling others they dont understand it you are losing votes daily doing this nonsensei encourage you to throttle back on this subject and move on with your campaign everyone sees your view on multiboxing and many disagree with you you are doing absolutely nothing but hurting your campaign right now
very cool interview
steve you get mine and all my alts vote youve been a great asset to eve community keep it up
its yours to use as you see fit feel free to post it anywhere you like
not empty quoting
you can write a blog any way you want it to go itUFFFDs clear that you and i donUFFFDt like each other this is affecting your judgement if i give someone a peace of cake they would probably say UFFFDohh nice thank you i love cakeUFFFD someone like you would say UFFFDohh tora is a bad man he is trying to make me fatUFFFD if you want to be a good writer lucas try to write these things without personal feelings itUFFFDs probably the hardest thing to do as a writer this is one of the things that will make me a good csm as i can do thisUFFFDtora has changed his mind since he started his campaignUFFFD vs UFFFDtora listens to the community and is willing to change if neededUFFFDthe csm isnUFFFDt about my ideas itUFFFDs about the communities ideas a csm is there to listen to the voices and express them at the meetingsUFFFDiUFFFDve been quite critical of a few csm members since the beginning of these campaigns and tora is the only one that has gone out of his way to ignore me even going so far as to block me on twitter from reading his feedUFFFD looking at how people respond to your forum walls of text are you sure itUFFFDs just me who wants to ignore you ok thanks for the effort and eve content yes i really mean that  but iUFFFDll be going back to ignore lucas mode life short and prosper tora
i call it as i see it it has nothing to do with feelings for you i have no reason to dislike you beyond the fact that you are a terrible candidate for the csm for precisely the reasons ive listed you dont listen to the community you listen to a few select people and you change your mind if it will benefit you to do so a csm member needs to stand up for what the community wants not just pitch and agree with ideas i dont trust you to do that and i certainly dont trust you not to change your mind about what is a good idea half way though how can players be behind you if in 2 months time you might suddenly be against their playstyle because you cant make up your mindi get the impression that you just sit there and echo what you think people want to hear more importantly than anything else a csm member needs to be freethinking with clear opinions about what is good and bad about the game backed by substantial eve knowledge i dont believe you have that i believe youll say what you think people want to hear to try to get yourself elected and youll do it more for the glory of look at me im a csm member rather than to actually help the gamethanks though for turning this into an attack on me personally this just further proves that what i wrote in the blog post is true you are unable to handle criticism at this stage so theres no way youll be able to handle the amount of criticism youll get as a csm member
lucas your blog post and your comments in this csm thread and others show you to be illinformed judgemental and overly biased in your opinions also you misspelled focusedyou need to learn to be fair and balanced in your reporting in your blog like i am in mine
my opinions are just that my opinions they are no more or less biased than anyone else holding their own opinions illinformed i very much doubt  differing in opinion to yourself perhaps but that doesnt make me illinformed just because i dont agree with your point of view and judgemental sure im writing a blog post which give my opinion on whether or not a csm candidate should be voted for so its likely to be judgementalby the way focussed is a common way of spelling the word in the uk both are acceptableand i tell you what ill write up my blog as i see things alright i write my opinions as they are if that gets some peoples backs up then too bad get over it
being a highsec dweller myself for a long time with most of my characters and praying that eve doesnt turn that nerfed disneyland i will support tora and sabriz with my votes to the csmxeve need to stay as eve the funny thing isi have trader mission runner incursion runner industrialist and all sort of highsec professions among my chars i fly with dscan everywhere i go i keep one eye on what im doing and the other on local channel and the places where supposedly i would not be secure low and null are the ones where im not that paranoid yeah that is true believe you or notabout content was a long time since innominate nightmare i dont laughed as much as i do when reading miner bumping
not convinced thats not a code alt based on language but ill bitei think quite a lot of people would rather eve doesnt turn into a nerfed disneyland but thats not what sabriz and tora stand for what they want is their playstyles to be the primary playstyles of highsec if tora was being honest hed realise how badly unbalanced wardecs are and propose heavy rebalances to thatit really amuses me though that you say that from a character who has always been in an npc corp why no actual corp could that be perhaps because entering into a player corp in highsec if you do anything beyond pure pvp is completely pointless thanks primarily to wardec mechanicsat the end of the day you can vote for whoever you want if you think tora is a good candidate then go ahead and vote for him just remember youre voting for someone who needs to have a wide range of skills  and most importantly needs to be able to maturely handle criticism  and if you vote for someone purely based off of the fact that for the past month hes run a campaign that says eve is evil you are more likely to end up with a dud
haha yeah my engrish is not that good perhaps because is not my native language as well as i said believe you or not  uedama and halaima are a nightmare for me but these guys are really active folks that love the game as much as i do ive being called an alt from lots of people in eve and i would love if that statement was a reality unfortunately im an alt of nobody even playing eve since 2006in fact i have several disagreements with tora and sabriz as example i dont like when sabriz refers to haulers that take his courier contracts as useful idiots and no i didnt take any but i need them tooi could log on the other accounts with chars in player corporations and alliances but this is the one i use on the forum and i will post with him regardless of what you think
a very balanced review that i will endorsei also listened to the podcasti agree with your final analysis and think he needs to get an agenda without contradiction as this can be seen as weak and people will not be comfortable with iti hope he does not take this the wrong way as i know his way of playing and have first hand experience of the way he does thingsas a conclusion i say that tora is not in the csm campaign for eve he is in it for tora which comes over quite clearlygood advise is free and can come from some unusual areas
if i make it to the csm ill promise never to listen to players like lucas veers and sol
maybe you should be a bit more humble in your approach and not take all that is said as an attackin the podcast you stated you listened to people and changed your approach maybe the ones you are knocking have some good advice you should take on board just like the population you hope to represent
humble hahaha i am here for the evil side of eve not for the crybabies in game
and you miss the point again
you know how arrogant that sounds think about it
 thati have nothing against sion kumitomo but the fact that mike is essentially incomprehensible to him is an excellent reason to have mike on the csm it means hes representing people who sion could not hope to speak forand thats ok it just means that eve is a big game
well ill say mike came out against drone assist need which i agree with him on and there were many other ways to balance carrier fleets however im not sure his opinion on multiboxing and isboxer users it
i believe people tend to forget that a candidates opinions are a very small part of everything the largest part of being a csm member is how they are going to represent the players like sion said himself in his tmc article they are just a focus and feedback group and not devs or employees of ccp they filter and sort through the cosmic white noise that is the pilots comments the forums and the eve media then they focus the strongest signals to ccp this allows ccp to focus more assets on the game development and content while being bound by nda they do the same thing in reverse they convey what they can to the public via multiple different avenuescandidates need to have the ability to focus on what is good for the game and not what is good for an individual or a group communication skills and the ability to work within a team environment is also a must their personal opinions are just spice added to meal but not the whole meat and potatoes creativity knowledge of the game and the ability to provide educated thoughts to the csm group or devs is more important than personal and biased interestsmike a has earned the respect of the incumbents much of the player base and those at ccp since we dont really have a good way of evaluating their performance while serving on the csm we have to rely on those they have served with to give us some limited feedback on the their peers since they can not speak poorly of each other due to the rules imposed on them you can only go off the level of praise they give each othermike is also supported by the majority of the those in the eve media his willingness to do shows and interact with player base is also well known by so many mike always has a notebook nearby to write down suggestions comments and complaints he is willing to funnel those things that he writes down to the right people at ccp or the csm group for discussionmy opinion is that if you dont vote for mike and put him towards the top of you ballot while voting then there is something clearly wrong with you and you should go skill yourself in game then give me all your things just put mike in your top 10 for csm10
its still good comedy to watch you chest beast about sandbox when you dont acknowledge both sides of the coin some play for pew and glorious internet spaceship murder others dont that you fail to accept this concept is your problem not his
explain to me how this is honoring both sides urziel in the context of eve being conflict and spaceship detonations at its founding core and the first duty in my mind is for csms to protect that not help ccp slit their own throats on the road to wow themepark then search your soul on if mike has truly been defending thati get hes your podcasting bro but ccp doesnt need player help in making hisec a theme park from our elected csms when the csms should be the balancing counterpoint to ccps themepark intentionsf
this is worth reiteratingi want to see more conflict in highsec not all of that will be driven by my alliance and some of it may well be conflicts we end up defeated inone of these proposals is for defender entities in wardecs to be able to collect some or all of the wardec fee by inflicting damage upon the aggressor entity code often initiates wardecs and seldom is the defender in one so this would materially assist our rivals i am still for it because it would increase conflict in highsec
what are your thoughts on the current state ofcapital class warfare  good place or in need of some work what are the areas that you think could use some workanchored interdiction bubble spam  what are your thoughts on this working as intended or cowardly abuse of game mechanic would you suggest changes to this either in the form of anchor distance restrictions material input adjustments or something entirely differentsov resources  do you see a need for changes in the distribution of resources in sov null if so what changes might you suggestlocal channel as intel  problem or nonissue what are your thoughts on intel gathering currently in sov null and do you think its in need of a change if so what changes might you suggestthanks for your time and good luck
definitely voting for sugar again this year i love that she is passionate about eve and that she treats everybody equally and is always willing to hear all sides
hi endieive been looking into csm candidates and your interview posts in this thread and prior writings are incredibly impressive ive meditated a lot on sov mechanics ever since running pfr through the sov meatgrinder after phoebe launched and everything you say echoes my admittedly limited experiencetwo questions if only because i find the discussion fascinating first what aspects of dominion sov do you think actually work or even work well something that surprised me about pfrs misadventures in etherium reach and scalding pass was how much fun the timer system could occasionally be i expected the entire thing to be a death march but only most of it was  some nights mucking about with sbus or sweating out the last few moments on a grind was actually kind of thrilling i suspect that was mostly due to the smallscale nature of things though  there was never more than one super on the field  but im curious what if any aspects of the current system people with vastly more experience think might be worth salvagingsecond what do you think about the pacing of the changes  its now more than three months after phoebe we still have no concrete information about what comes next for sov one of your blogs discuss a concern that jump drive nerfs being the stick without the carrot needed to make things work  something i agreed with at the time and am getting more concerned about each day that passes without more news
timers can work they work when they let an attacker and a defender essentially work collaboratively to set up a fight at a time both sides will show up admittedly neither side goes into setting a timer wanting that outcome but if both sides are for instance based in eu tz and the timer comes out on their saturday evening then you can have a great fightor and here is the catch you can end up with two thousand people in a system straining the server to breaking point which is why distributing the sov goals in space could work picture for instance if all of the defenders systems in a constellation became vulnerable at the same time but they only needed to win the majority of the timer fights in the constellation in order to save sov in the whole constellation that is one very abstract example off the top of my head but you can see how spreading the fights out might lead to more fights and smaller ones that require more people fcing that cannot depend on jumpcapable ships hopping around postpoebe and so ondont jump on that as endies solution for nullsec sov by the way i have given different examples before and will do so again of different approaches the ideal would be a synthesis of many that minimises the weakness of each i cannot bring myself however to do a james315 and influict a 14page summary of my blog posts on the eveo readers
i agree yes i think that ccp were in do something do anything mode and that they brought in one element of a potential solution before the rest were even writtendown let alone on the table from speaking to exemployees of ccp i can tell you that the jump fatigue idea had been rattilng around for a very long time i suspect that the clamour for action pushed them over the line to implementing itits not a bad system in itself  i gave it a cautious welcome while suggesting that iteration would be needed  but making it harder to travel while leaving in place a system in which fights are still a long way away was rash and i am confident that the initial bump in pvp stats has dissipated since thenand to those ccp devs who have said to their customers  dont complain that you are a long way from enemies when you blue everyone nearby i would suggest that part of the job of game dev is to understand player nature and psychology and not just to be good at balancing modules and ships if you have a measure of success and prestige  holding sovereignty in the case of nullsec  then you cannot afford to be shocked and surprised and snarky when mmo players hit on the optimal approach to achieve the best score they candont blame the players blame the game
as you know marlona sky has quit eve but before he quit he left behind what i still believe is a good proposal for high sec war dec changes what do you think of what marlona proposes jayne
i would agree that it has problems but you havent answered my questions although changing an entier wardec system is a big one to answer i will admit but ill shorten it down do you feel that corp rolling should be allowed do you feel that the wardec systems harms npe if so how do you propose you fix it also you are a younger player i consider myself one as well we both have one thing in common youve explored for your entire time in eve ive been in the mercwardec business my entire time in eve i know next to nothing about sov space lowsec indy mining and the such i assume that it is about that same way for you how do you feel competent enough to handled these topics as a csmdeletetheweak
vote 1  chance ravinnevote 2  johnny pew 
if you did your youtube campaign video in magnetos voice i would consider even voting for you for president you inspired me out of my bitter vet stagger thank you
chance is high up on my ballot with this current platform as someone who went though the npe as a solo player i think the only thing stopping me quitting was my extreme stubbornness any improvements to the npe and tutorial will be positive for the game and combined with improved marketing this is eve ii  could improve the player numbers by a significant factor one thing i would like to put out there is that all the marketing in the world wont work until there is a better npe 10 million people trying the game and quitting does nothing but put strain on the servers but if chance sticks to this platform he should absolutely be in your csm shortlist
here is your campaign ad let me know if i made any errors good luck
this man inspired me to get into cov ops an hero
corp rolling is a byproduct of wardec and corp mechanics i dont believe disallowing it will fix anything just cause people not to log onmost totally new players are in npc corps so i dont feel they are often the direct victims of wardecsi dont intend to stick my head into sov any deeper than asking does this make sense and is it worth the trouble compared to what we have i would also challenge some older players to justify how they will provide meaningful feedback on newnon player experience
playing since 2006 here and i agree with your statements about npe we need new players that is a fact the thing that most vets dont realize yet is that we want new players as much as ccpim voting and supporting you even if you only focus on npe for the entire duration of the csm
the costbenefit ratio for tv will most likely be terrible id instead advocate for paid sponsorship or establishes media personalities with loyal audiences of gamers additionally there exists a lot more room to solicit and share eve content perhaps with more contests or incentives to produce video there also needs to be a hard look at the use of eves site and landing pages to better convert organic traffic and answer common questions about the gamethe tutorial should emphasize navigation and the market much more i dont think new players understand who or what theyre buying ever and eves world so is so different than any other mmo it is very easy to get disorientedand no i dont give billions out to newbros gotta save it for a blingfit battle zephyr
i have to admit while some of my colleagues think you maybe running on the im famous platform and you dont quite has the whole 10 years of bitter vet experience your interview and enthusiasm swayed usi havent heard a person with your type of enthusiasm in a while its not reckless excitement you do have a focus i think ccp and the community could use a person like yougood luck in the election
i love your enthusiasm i love your emphasis on narrative and on helping new playersyou remember the part of the this is eve video where an erebus appears and someone shouts out oh my god thats a titan have you ever seen the original video that produced those comms i am unable to find it now but the video shows a camera zoomed out far enough to show the entire pos that brave newbies is attacking below the pos is a tiny yellow box which eventually resolves into an archon while theyre talking about their options the archon is destroying them an avatar appears above the pos it is visible if you are looking for it nobody notices time passes people keep talking the line that made it into this is eve isnt uttered until the titan fires its doomsday weapon across the entire height of the pos at the archon destroying it it is impossible to miss thatbut is it not remarkable that one of the most impressive ships in the game 14 kilometers long can appear on grid with a small fleet that has never seen a titan before without anyone in that fleet noticing do you have any ideas to make eve more cinematic
this is a good point and i dont think it would take much to help make gameplay more immersive and cinematic there should be for instance some changes to the default overview to make it more obvious who and what lands on grid without requiring the memorization of 250 ship namesi also think there could be a window or a targeting ui default that shows your currently selected or targeted item up close a window in a window that way while you can stay zoomed out for tactical awareness this window will show you what your target looks like and what is generally happening to it you essentially then are interacting with ships and not brackets and crosses this would be resource intensive potentially but all client side and optional
i think csm would greatly benefit to have you as a member as you can provide much needed new player perspective my concern is how would you balance making eve more accessible to new players with maintaining its unique player base eve has always been a place where tiger happy sociopaths much like yourself fell very much at home what can be done to encourage high sec carebears and new players to venture into lownullwh space without to much of a protective umbrella over them
hmm  i really dont know if you have enough experience and knowledge to run for csm  but you certainly have enthusiasm and this game really needs someone who is not bitter about it  so you probably will have one of my votes good luck
ashterothii just wanted to mention what i good interview you had with cap stable it and a subsequent reading of your thread here has pushed you onto my vote listthanks alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
gorskiyou mention as do many others fw as a good way to get into solosmall gang for new players while i agree that fw is a quick way into solosmall gang the downside of absolutely demolished faction standings is rarely brought upwould you be open to a tags4standings idea to at least help people get back to zero faction standings if so would you voice your support for it to the other csm reps and ccpfw is in a much better place now than it has been in a long time due to the changes to plex rat respawns  blocking cloaks within range of the capture point standings repair is probably the next greatest hurdle that needs to be addressed imo followed by lp taxation though ccp said that would be quite a bit of work it would be cool if they could work it into the corp rework over the next few release cycles and of course mission payouts for something that can be done in a stealth bomber

just finished my application to the csm ballotcheck out my podcast my blog
greetings capsuleersi often repeat the mantra of be the change you want to see so here goes nothing i am sick and tired of stagnant null so that is my only platform i know there are other issues facing all areas of the game but this to me is the most important so i am starting a crusade to make a change i know many people are probably asking who the heck is this guy and those that arent are likely laughing their asses off that i even threw my hat in the ring but nothing ventured nothing gained i guess so on to a little about mei have been playing eve since 2009 and have a somewhat diverse background but nothing really special i have lived in both sov and npc null with the likes of the cfc pl tri and bl i have also lived in both low and high class wspace i enjoy pvp and only do pve to make isk to buy and replace ships sov null is to me the best part of the game but as many know it has grown stagnant and i would like to see that changed instead of just complaining about how sov sucks or even worse just quitting the game i hope to at minimum offer insight on how i think we can improve the sov game even if i dont win so here goesmany people have many different ideas on how null sec sovereignty should be handled in eve so i figured i would weigh in with my 2 cents many of these ideas have been offered before in various forms so i am really just compiling what i personally feel are the best options and plans my goal is to make sov null sec more regional and less universal i would love to see sov held by hundreds of smaller alliances constantly warring with their regional neighbors as opposed to being held by a few power players that keep everyone else at bay by their sheer number superioritycapturing sov  in my plan we do away with tcus ihubs and sbus and go back to a system similar to pos sov with one slight twist instead of using poses we use pocos i feel this plan is better for 2 reasons 1 there are considerably less planets in pretty much every system so takinglosing sov is easierfaster 2 there is no fuel needed so you donUFFFDt drive your logisticsindustry team out of the game trying to keep 40 poses fueled just to maintain sov owning sov is as simple as owning 50 of the pocos in the system in looking at sov null the average system has 85 planets with the minimum being 1 and the maximum being 16 on average you will need to own 5 pocos to own sov and worst case scenario is 9 by moving to a poco based system this also allows for split fights and strategy instead of all parties blobbing onto one objectivestations  if there is a station in system then it is automatically controlled by the sov holder however if no alliance owns 50 of the pocos in a system and for 72 hours after a system changes hands the station will allow ffa docking and services rights once an alliance owns a system for 72 hours they once again have full control over docking and services rightsfeesoccupancy based sov  lots of people talk about this but rarely have i seen anyone put metrics on how it is measured or what it does in my plan UFFFDoccupancyUFFFD is based on 3 metrics two of which are already in the game military and industry these two would continue to work as they currently do except there would no longer be ihubs so no ihub upgrades would be required for better anomaly and belt spawns the third metric would be a war metric this metric increases for every ship killed in system either for or against the sov holding alliance this metric would be weighted based on the class of ship lostkilled this should encourage sov holders to fight when roaming groups visit and especially when their sov is under attack i am sure some alliances will choose to have a thunderdome to increase their war metric but since it is weighted based on ship class if they want to blue on blue a bunch of dreads and carriers to keep an enemy from taking their sov instead of fighting for it then death to all caps these 3 metrics are averaged to determine the strategic level of a system instead of it being based on how long you have held a system so what do you get for higher strategic indexes i am glad you askedpoco hp  for every level increase the hp of the pocos in system owned by the sov holding alliance double this means if an alliance never does anything in a system they own and thus has a strategic index of 0 the pocos can easily be rfedkilled in a short time by a 20 man sub cap fleetroughly 1015 minutes for 20 bombers per poco if they are active in a system they own and have the strategic level at 5 then their attacker would need to bring a much larger fleet or caps or be on field longer to allow a defense fleet to form and drive them awayroughly 1015 minutes for 20 dreads per pocorf timers  instead of giving the defender 2 days to a week to decide to fight letUFFFDs make it more urgent once again we will start with a base level of 0 and double for every level increase the minimum rf timer would be 2 hours and max of 64 hours once again unused sov is quick and easy to take but used sov provides the defender with more time to prepare like now we can throw in a deviation of x alsocontinued
sov cost  this to me is the biggest key to occupancy based sov for entities that hold vast swaths of space it does not matter really how quick and easy you can take their sov as they will just allow you to take it for a week or even a month then come back with a massive fleet that you have no chance against as a small entity and undo your gains in a very short time we need a system that makes it detrimental to the sov holders that are not active in their systems and to me sucking moon goo is not active once again we will do our simple math but backwards and since we took out tcus and ihubs we will eliminate the confusion of varying costs for certain UFFFDupgradesUFFFD at level 5 strategic index a system costs the alliance a flat 1b per 30 days for each level below 5 the cost doubles resulting in a 32b per 30 day sov cost for a level 0 system let me be clear that i hate isk sinks just as much as the next guy but i hate empty 00 systems more and the only way to provoke large alliancescoalitions to not take more than they actually UFFFDneedUFFFD is to punish them for doing so by having a scaling system you reward those who are actively using their space to rat mine and fight and punish those who just own it for either the moon income strategic value or simply because they cancommon concernswhat about logistics andor null sec construction this is for sure a concern for anyone who lives in sov null and especially those who live in the farthest reaches i think there are 2 solutions to this issue the first is the use of wormholes many null alliances already use wormholes for logistics and pvp fleet movement but if you do not have a blue path to high sec you will be more dependent on wormholes than ever this is also additional potential content between wormhole and null sec entities the other solution is to tweak the resources available in null so that you could produce all t1 and t2 items for the race of your region not only would this be a boost to null sec industry but also would somewhat control the meta based on geography and not just what is the flavor of the monthcloaky campers  null inhabitants already complain about how one cloaky camper can shut down an entire system and a few a full constellation some are concerned that a cloaky pilot in system could singlehandedly prevent activity in system and thus lower the strategic level making your systems more vulnerable to attack the simple answer is yes if you allow one pilot or one pilot with multiple friends waiting to join via cyno to shut down everything you are doing then you deserve to lose your systems you should have a counter to whatever pvp could be waiting for you or if nothing else if you lose enough ships to your enemy your war index will help keep the overall strategic index highthanks for your time and even if you dont vote for me please spread the word that sov changes are necessary
the hero gotham needsyou have my vote
and my sword
what are your thoughts on the current state ofcapital class warfare  good place or in need of some work what are the areas that you think could use some workinterdiction sphere spam  what are your thoughts on this working as intended or cowardly abuse of game mechanic would you suggest changes to this either in the form of anchor distance restrictions material input adjustments or something entirely differentsov resources  do you see a need for changes in the distribution of resources in sov null if so what changes might you suggestlocal channel as intel  problem or nonissue what are your thoughts on intel gathering currently in sov null and do you think its in need of a change if so what changes might you suggestthanks for your time and good luck
1 i think caps need work i like the line i heard from grath that if you can do damage to me then i should be able to do damage to you i dont want to see a scenario where caps supers andor titans are only able to fight other caps but can be killed by subcaps i think supers and titans are especially in a bad place and need a more defined role i have mentioned to many people that i think aoe dds should come back but in a different way so that it isnt instant death to any ship within a certain radius but does give them the ability to damage subcaps and caps alike give them a reason to get out of poses and you might actually see more in conflict and thus more die i think supers either need a distinct role or need to just be removed with the changes to drones and fighters it just seems that the main role for supers is to shoot sov structures and if that is the only thing they are good for then why not just use a dread that is way cheaper can be insured and isnt a coffin2 i dont think this is a huge issue in my experience and i think if changes are made to null to create smaller regional conflicts it will be even less of an issue fcs will be forced to choose giving up dps andor logi to field more bubblers and if they only field a small number then just primary those first3 this is a tough one if we are promoting occupancy based sov then i think the inhabitants of the region need to be able to produce all t1 and t2 ships and items locally of that region i have heard others complain about the free isk from moon mining making eve a two class systemthe haves and the have nots but ifwhen regions are spread among more smaller entities almost everyone should have a chance to get their own slice of the pie if they are willing to fight for it i like that the diversity of density will create more desirable constellations and regions within sov null4 i think local is fine in null but i would make 1 change if you truly want no local at all stick to wspace in terms of lore which i am not into really big if we are in the future and have all this advanced technology we should know who comes inout via a stargate or is in a station the only exception i would make is anyone entering a system via wormhole is delayed in local until they are detected by something in system like a gate station manned ship pos or other object capable of reporting their details
thank you for the responses and i think i mispoke on point 2 when i asked about interdiction sphere when what i meant was achorable bubble spam could you respond to that if you have time
as a hunter i always hate running into a 100km wall of bubbles but as someone who plays eve because of the sandbox nature i do not feel strongly that changes are required unless there are cases where it causes performance issues it is a game of cat and mouse and the mouse is using every means necessary to stay alive just shoot all of their bubbles and make them the time anchoring more
this seems to promote the idea of supercapitalonly fleets with no subcapital support being viable because they can deal damage to both subcaps and caps do you believe that is a direction the game should go in why or why not
each hole type does have their merits but there needs to be equal want for each hole time in my mind
why does there need to be an equal number of people wanting each weather does this same idea apply to ships weapon systems anything else
hole time and if all things were equal you would lose a lot of conflict drivers today you are saying black holes are badtomorrow when you get dropped by phoenixs alphaing subcaps in a black hole like there is no tomorrow you will call for them to be nerfedthey let people use their own style of play eve is a sandboxeditsorry i can stop looking at your thread its just like rubber necking when seeing a car crash s
do you intend to ignore everyone that doesnt toss you a softball question or do you enjoy ignoring dialogue from people in the community you are campaigning to represent you are quite possibly the first wormhole candidate ive ever met that i actually want to go out of my way to make sure you get no votes you really need to round turn your campaign or you are assured to have no chance at representing anyone this year your chances were slim before now but as it stands i know for a fact you arent even being considered by some wormhole groups
obviously not i just would like to see more people desire to be in wormholes it it hard to find a new wher now a days
i am trying me best to get questions answered when i can
1 i do have to agree with your first point i do understand that statics are always a great area to explore and i push the currently alliance i am in to explore our statics also with the addition of secondary statics this does help corps make content2 i do understand that but there is always room for improvement maybe even some new wh effects3 i can disagree with this i have had a very difficult time trying to find a new wh for my current corp4 the mining is wspace should me more desirable
i can assure you most of my playing time of this game has been spent in a wormhole on this character or on one of my alts
1 not an alt2 i do understand that content can always be made of one looks hard enough my point is there are options for the addition of different content to allow for diversity also as far as my corp is concerned thats not a factor nor should i need to reference in with that argument3 i do understand your veiw for that one i would however always like to see lower sp players become viable in whs4 refer to answer for 3
1 please expand on your answer for 2 what are the different options for content you are wanting to see2 why havent you been involved in the past with development of wormholes for example many whove run in the past started by simply being active and involved in making wormholes better as an individual contributor3 if you have been involved please show some examples4 what sets you apart from your competition and why should someone vote for you over any other candidate5 have you reached out to meet with individual groups to do ts interviews 6 so far youve been super delayed on responsiveness and skip comments and questions do you actually have the time and ability to be a csm delegate do you understand their workload and have you sat down and spoken with any of the previous delegates before
bane cortex wrote i still hope i can be a good choice to bring the feelings and views of all wormholers to the csm not just those of a single large wormhole corp as much as i do not like the way this post was written it does outlines a few weaknessmy one eyebrow also nearly crawled into my scalp at the underlined parthowever i think your concern about the large alliance is valid at best having people focused on worm holes i think you are looking at specialists i would say you need two representatives that live in two different systems a class 2 and a class 5 we can argue that sleepers are sleepers and the mechanics of the links and such blah blah but there are some differences not as obvious as low sec and null sec for example but the income the type of neighbours you have the usual size of the corps and alliances et cetera make for different flavours of worm hole livingi also struggle to see how you can get the word out to all the worm hole people because from my time in there people werent knocking on my pos and asking for a bit of ice they were generally trying to kill me when i was out and about in systems or passing through as unseen and quickly as possibleso evolve fasthopefully we can have two or more worm hole representativesalso try get all the people that are in other parts of space and are thinking well i would live in worm holes if the following changes occured my wish list removed the frigate links that have no mass limit reverse the dscan immunity allow alliances to build an outpost  station in their system allow worm holes burn masses of fuel to keep a link open without mass limit long enough to burn out their neighbours worm hole to worm hole only
i see youve chosen to neglect young shelbys legitimate questions so youre not gonna get a real nice post here sirif thats legit then you should be ashamed honestly and deluding yourself a bit to think you can waltz in with a single thread of bs and get yourself elected a complete unknown with zero history anywhere except some contentious posts filling up one single forum thread  this one where almost all of your views have been vigorously challenged and support seems to be very minimal indeedthis is a crock of  and youve already demonstrated that by ignoring shelbys questions corbexx on the other hand has always had time for shelby and the rest of us including listening to our concerns which arent always directly wormhole related though if you were a real wormholer youd well and truly understand the comedic history between fashion and wormholes corbexx would always listen to us and did such a great job with wormhole issues over the past year he even found some spare time enough to take our concerns regarding fashion and avatar development to host a public workshop on ts surrounding it in which several developers attendedhe still contacts me occasionally of his own accord to ask if theres anything avatarrelated i wish him to raiseive never seen you in space ive never seen you in the forums beyond this thread ive never seen you at any whrelated meetings or ops on ts when i test your mettle with a typicaldusetteesque question you dont even try to answer then weve got herrberts awesome serious of humorous yet still semiserious questions where you had a beautiful chance to make a good impression with some fun candid or comedic replies but silence  thats not very wormholey in fact you dont smell much like a wormholer at alltheres 10 accounts that wont be including you anywhere in their votes this year youre gonna need all the support your nullsec friends can muster if you want it no free trip to iceland for you bro10 paging jack miton corbexx and trinket would have will be getting 100 of my votes this year and all our public supportedU00A0U00BCedU00BDU008C

but most of your game time hasnt been spent in wormhole space on cortex if youve been in wormhole space on an alt why not run on the alt if youve spent most of your playing time of this game in wormhole space i implore you to prove itif you really need a example of proof ill give you myselfi entered wormhole space in december of 2012 joined a random a corporation based in a c4 with a c2 static initially they were miners i know but they had a good core group of people ceo changes we turn into a pvp corporation throwing t1 cruisers at t3 fleets the logic is that if we took one of them out we were isk positive and we caused the guy to lose 3 to 4 days of training time we left the c4 to search for another place wound up in a c1 after meeting some good people hung there for maybe 2 months but our group was way too large for it moved to a c2 temporarily after spending a week diving into wormhole space trying to find a viable home then joined a merc corp alliance wound up in c6 space rage rolling for pvp and running escalation sites on the side wed take contracts to do defense fleets for peopleparticipated in one of the most devastating ops where we sacked 500 billion isk in wormhole space  this was before the sma loot drop fix thanks ccp   on the side i never left the c1 as we had a few people who enjoyed it ran pi out of there ran gas reactions out of there managed the poss out of there i was running this under directorship roles from the corporation god i hate that interfaceleft after usual drama lama stuff in alliance some caused by myself that and they moved out of wormhole spacewandered around a bit tried brave for fun almost went into their wormhole corp but the nightmare of living out of poss in super large corporate alliance got to me  i was doing that before no fun  joined another wormhole group but realized they were looking to join a large alliance themselves found isogen 5 and they reminded me how wormhole space used to be smaller gang more intimate scouting exploration discovery and its from the ground up i returned to wormhole space in july 2014i have worked as a director i have seen how crappy poss are how wormhole effects used to suck how wormhole space has evolved that is a history that is a background that is a resume experience the facts that is the main of a person who is a wormholer and i am just a line member i am the bare minimum of experience needed for a potential wormhole csm and my own experience isnt as good as 90 of the other wormholers who post on these forums your the ceo of a wormhole corporation where is your experience knowledge background and backing saying i did it on this guy or an alt did what i at least have one stupid operation i can point at and say yes i was there yes i participated yes i shot that i can happily admit i lost a brick tank prophecy on a highsec c1 wormhole exit because i left the prop mod running and outmassed the hole limit by 1 million i can say that i rolled myself out of a c5 wormhole in a pod those are basic experiences people have in wormhole space when they live in wormhole spacewormhole csm does not need an alt they need a main the wormhole community you are no part of it it is unfortunate that we would have to call out a csm candidate on not just their platform but on their background lack of history lack of knowledge lack of experience and on what seems to be a total farse of a campaign solely to try to get some recognition to waste a spot on the csm to waste the time of the community in total and to waste the time and money of ccpthe problem started not with the content of your initial post it started with the subject line of your post wormholers unite what the heck are you talking about we dont unite we kill each other happily i might add asking for unity from a group whose sole purpose is to take each other out was your first mistake you dont know the history of wormhole space you dont know the people the culture the attitude of wormholers with all of thatyou ignored shelby a high class gal gave you the time of day and you shunned her she is like the wormhole queen and you ignore her shame on you you have a total lack of manners
you didnt respond to me hmmmpffi have a list of your alts will go check out your wh history evil grin
wow thats like the sweetest thing ever to say mista jones it was kinda nice to come and see candi stickin up for me though and putting her big highheeled yellow boot into mista cortex face like thatbut yeah what an ass when i checked back today i was so excited to see what mista cortex thought about the stuff i asked then  i saw he just stepped right over me like garbage in the street like a goon would some nullsec renter corp living under their oppositionessentially i felt like this mista jones wow  im no wormhole queen though like its totally hard enough for me to get respect even from my own sistas being the youngest its always about them you know like woooo dat ass on erica or stuff like dani dusette best dusette but never nothin about me well except for mista winthorp hes really nice to me and stuff am i even allowed to say his name at the moment though i dunno and i think foedus like me too he let me fly with him this one time mista jones and i called him senpai053102 foedus latro  shelby you can fly with me anytime053113 foedus latro  kohaiamazeballs the things i get to see hanging out with my bigger sistasyoure pretty cute too mista jones  just sayin and mista cortex im totally gonna tell foedus you was mean to me and ignored me and stuff you betta run yo
i had a bashers at this and the idea is definitely workable although i would need to learn the more complex relationship between sit and damage as i know its not a nice linear relationship more to follow when i get the workings out for the suggestion finalised and a few answers that i feel i need to refine it to a point that it becomes workable
so you clearly hate math and have no facility with it whatsoever excellent answer thank you
unfortunatley i did not pass a background security check on my account and have to withdraw my campaign hopefully this provoked some debate for you all at least
well this is terrible news
sorry to hear that as a consolation prize the image of ccp checking api keys is amusing
allow worm hole dwellers to burn masses of fuel in order to keep a link open without mass limit long enough to burn out their neighbours worm hole to worm hole onlysorry to hear about your background check if i land up in csm i will come pester you for another perspective
as someone who has had enjoyment of this game reinvigorated by the skulduggery of the one we call master i must express my absolute disappointment in the narrow minded decision that ccp has made in blocking tf from running for csm x in my opinion the wormhole community lost its second best possible voice running for the csm not only has tf been a very active voice of the wh and autz community he has also succeeded where ccp has failed in introducing newer players into wormholes do your player base a favor and readdress the decision ccp or i will protest by smartbombing little scanny ships you have been warned
a very shortsighted and disappointing decision especially given some of the other wh candidates or lack thereofwish they would reconsider or come outright and say what the issue is
you cant pass the background check this is ccp not the fbi just how naughty were you
sorry to hear it tf you would have been second on my ballot behind corbexx having read your blog i have an idea about what the problem was does this prevent you from ever running or could you try again with another account i think youd make a great csm and so i hope there is still a chance even if its for csm 11 or 12 or 13
i guess ill reask this question since there was no answer because you disregarded someone as a high sec player what is your opinion on the recent capital changes in phoebein addition based on your response to a previous question below how much of a time commitment do you plan on making to the csm over the next year if you are elected
maybe next year dnsblack will run again
not a candidate thread ergo closed
you want to see whats behind the door here you go
funny thing is that when people talk about unfinished expansions they always leave out incarna which was not even deployed as planned and thus the most unfinished expansion to dateas it was also the expansion that i was looking forward to ever since i started playing im still not completely over my disappointmentthus if they even only talked about implementing the cq upgrades that were supposed to be in there by now customizable cq screen for example i would smile a little my grin will likely only come back if the door actually opens though
i hate jump fatigue im sick of it it makes me rage quit out of eve
hello i started playing eve back in 2004 and have returned to playing after a break of 45 yearsi must confess to find playing eve an increasing depressing experiencethe activities of players exploiting other players seems to have increased over time to where it now seems to be most prevalent thing going on in game it always as aspect of the game but now seems totally dominant promoting nothing but paranoia vengeance and viciousness mirroring the worst of rlthe game only remains visually wonderfully ccp please think about balancing content and practical gameplay to those of us who do want to play computer games just to be vindictive to other players
i am not exactly sure what you define as exploiting other players or what type of game you think eve online is eve is a competitive pvp sandbox set is a wartorn futuristic dystopia where we the players fight for power space and resources the game is specifically designed to foster conflict between the players everywhere in new eden that said playing eve is not suppose to be a grim experience  you can have a lot of fun shooting you enemies and friends too in the face see the latest from permaband for this sentiment in musical form embrace the chaos and strife and the challenge it provides or if you absolutely cant then perhaps consider that this game isnt for you
i have played this game since 2004 i do not enjoy killing other players and when i started to play it was not an exclusive pvp game has it now officially changed so if i do not want to pvp i am in the wrong game
this what ccp says eve is currentlywhat is eve onlineeve online is a massively multiplayer online game set 23000 years in the future as an elite spaceship pilot you will explore build and dominate across a universe of over 7000 star systems sandbox gameplay and advanced skillbased progression provide you with a truly unique experience as you rise to power among the starsthe possibilities are endless in eve online takes sides in factional warfare join an alliance and wage epic battles for sovereignty over star systems discover wormholes leading to unknown regions of space uncover pirate outposts and lucrative resources hidden in the far reaches of the cosmosit implies pvp exists it doesnt say its the main focus or obligatoryis this actually false information and pvp is the main and only respected activity in the game
im really disappointed by how this game treats information regarding gameplay you are supposed to know almost everything via outside tutorials external wikis and fan pages they are useful and fine resources but i find both unacceptable on the part of the developers to lazily leave the learning the game part to for all intents and purposes third party volunteers the fans who make these sites and also ineffective for the total newbie that tries the game without knowing any friends or external sitesi had this impression since long ago but today i finally decided to post this after trying to follow the factional warfare path on my own the amount of stuff you must figure out for yourself is even greater than for industry planetary interaction or general pvpi dont know why information can be presented as followsthis is a caldari state facility capture it by clearing all the opposing ships in it if any to help capture the system for your faction only tech i frigates can enter this complex you must remain closer than 20km to capture the facility for your faction microwarpdrives work normally inside this deadspace pocket you will not be able to warp from inside the complex to any point also inside if you are fighting for the caldari dont attack the npc ships as they will help you be careful enemy capsuleers may enter the complex and fight you over it allied capsuleers can help you capture the complex faster simple clear and visually understandable this is just an example i know for a fact that the newbie unfriendliness of this game costs ccp and the community thousands of good players that never get past the trial period or the first subscription due to sheer frustration due to incidents like this one the shameful useless tutorial process must be also overhauled forget the confusing wall of text and introduce explanatory pictures and bullet point type of sentencesto csm representatives that read this please raise this issue its more important than it seems im sure weve lost tens of thousands of players due to this through the yearstldr ccp needs to make gameplay information much more accessible to the learning player both revising the approach it follows for the tutorials and putting much more effort in the info windows among other things
fw complexes do not disable your mwd ever only certain missions which you have to get from an agent will do thatthe reason you cannot find any information on what happened is because you appear to have lost against someone using multiple mechanics to hisher advantagefirst the facts your mwd was disabled you say that it disabled your mwd at 18km you say you were in a fw complex it was an astero that killed you i pulled it from your killboardwhat does this saya disabled mwd is obviously a warp scramblers work however the astero is no garmur in that it does not have any bonus to warp disruption range check the hull bonuses and as i said before fw complexes do not shut down your mwdnow you can increase scram range with perfect warfare links giving you 11km range and overheating a scram will push that out to 13km but that still falls short of the 18km you describedthe only semirealistic way to get close to the range you described is by using a faction warp scrambler the domination and true sansha scrams coming the closest at 17km range with links and overheated however both of these modules easily cost 150 to 200 million isk which strains believablymy conclusion is that maybe the guy rushed you a little quicker than you thought asteros may not be the fastest ship out there but they can accelerate much better than mostwhat does all this have to do with your ideaall this information was gained through firsthand experience comparing statsinfo ingame and piecing together different mechanicsthis is not something you can be aware of until it hits you simply because there are so many things just like ittldr you lost against mechanics and tactics that are completely separate from faction warfare and could not be completely aware of until it was too latenow that you know you can prepare accordingly in the future remember eve is a process game there is no way to know everything beforehand
it seems very clear from all recent game development tendencies that non pvps are only in the game as the bottom link in the food chain for all other players they should expect to be trolled and any comment suggesting otherwise in short if you play eve now and are not interested in pvp stopped deluding yourself and find a game you get a better experience in eve will just be misery
shooting mtus is the new can flipping your standard issue carebear gets really upset if you shot their mtu
i broke my coalitions preferred csm ballot paper last year specifically for steve and i will be doing it again this year unless hes on it by default which tbh i wouldnt be surprised considering hes done an awesome job this yearcsm isnt about public speaking and doing so with the red light of the record button blaring can be nerve racking but you come across as approachable and friendly with a wealth of knowledge and a humble attitude which only helps you there stevegood luck and you have my vote
can i make a suggestion that a less controversial platform for those of us who do not play eve for pvp is the additional of new content which is not centered around pvp or in areas where pvp is likely in seconds once you decloakeve has improved it fleet combat in the last 7 years or so but it has always had an amazing potential in its economy implementation would ccp countenance adding new content for non pvp or pve activites the last time this seemed to happen was with pi and some small additions to exploration this is not about dumbing down the game or making it risk free it is about giving some love to the areas of the game that at lot of us are attracted to in eve other than exploiting other players why has ccp never widened trade possibilities much or fleshed out more npc companies opportunities for player content
youre missing his point actually hes having too much fun watching you squirm to bother explaining it to you or perhaps he doesnt feel youre worth his time but i feel your pain so ill give you a hint its all about your attitude he reads your posts and listens to what you say and he disagrees with it do you have good ideas maybe sometimes definitely yes is it presented in an unbiased fashion far from it your posts have been very selfcentered and condescending you talk like toras platform is an affront to everything you hold dear maybe you really feel that way but bringing it into the discussion isnt going to help
and what exactly is toras pointmore to the point what is yours in quoting the above are you toras spokespersonin your opinion i am being very selfcentered and condescending but that is just your opinion wrong nonetheless and nothing more you are entitled to it as am i or anybody else maybe you also should be a bit more humble in your approach and not take all that is said as an attack
i should have thought that was obviousyou arent worth consideration
actually its just another example of a player criticising tora where he has put himself in a position to be criticised and judged then rather than responding in a mature way tora has tried to make a joke of it or simply insulted the players in question this is not a new trait and its certainly not something id expect to see from someone running for a csm position of course tora cant see this because in his mind hes perfect and its the rest of us that must be flawed
im just trying to give you some advice you seem to be failing to get the kind of response you want out of tora ive already discussed things with him in a civil manner and he has responded to me with seriousness he doesnt take you seriously and im telling you why you can continue along the path you are on and expect the same outcomes or you can change what you are doing to change your outcomeim satisfied with what im getting tora is apparently satisfied with what his responses are getting theres my advice take it or leave it
miners mercs and gankers in hisec arent the only players in game what about players who live in space where it is not possible to dock like wormholes or hostile null and uncloaking  death
i used to fly in wh space for a few years and i understand they dont have much other options then to be cloaked in space sometimes for longer periods to get fleets in the whs then youre not just sitting still without a good reason in most cases you will be flying around checking posses statics etc not sure if youll sit still on grid for longer then 30min much and i am not saying you cant be cloaked i love cloaks i would be happy if it was just implemented for highsec where the risk of dying is way less
for example during preparation stages of operations we might spend weeks collecting intel on some holes requiring you to be online and watch as much as you can and every time you log on or off you make yourself visible a potentially blow the whole operation i cant risk being seen every time i want to check whether they are doing anything noteworthy so with your solution wed either have to push a button up to 47 times a day or not do intel at all i dont see how either option improves the gameor we might be watching someone who is preparing to farm which can take hoursand many pvpers multibox during large fight placing their covops in various holes along the fight for getting warpins collecting intel combat scanning or looking for exfiltration routes if the hole gets collapsed or camped these scouts are just sitting there being handy in case they are needed and if im flying a logi i really dont want to be clicking random button on other screen just so my buzzard sitting in safespot doesnt die because im currently busy repping my fleetmatesso yeah while i might sympathise with your desire to deal with afk miners in hisec i dare say that  over wormholers and others in the process isnt the right way to do it forcing players to click buttons that dont do anything isnt gonna bring fun to anyone and people who simply cannot dock because the design of space doesnt allow them to do so shouldnt be extra penalized for living in already hostile place unless you propose ejecting afk players from stations and poses
i agree
youre expecting a serious response when your criticism is nothing but thinly veiled character assassination
no im not expecting a serious response to my honest review of his campaign theres certainly no character assassinationanother thing youve missed in your afk idea besides that it actually would affect other players like axioth has said it would also do pretty much nothing to miners a miner will be at the keyboard generally at least once every half hour since they will need to empty their ship if they are sitting there on grid for 3 hours afk then they are accomplishing nothing and so dont need to be forced to be active and in fact logging them off would be beneficial to them this is just further evidence of a fundamental lack of understanding of game mechanics outside of your own areai suppose that is also just character assassination however
in real life we would call you a stalker
lol mate youre signing up for what is essentially a political position people are going to criticise you for what you do and what you say that doesnt make them stalkers just because you cant deal with that criticismi note that you completely ignored the actual point of the post however presumably because it proves that you have no idea what you are talking about
if this is fun to you it just shows what a waste of time your attempt at getting to the csm has beenif you think you could represent the population of eve with what you have written here then i feel sorry for you as nothing you have said would encourage people it would rather make them worried that you would be representing themi have read a better candidate manifesto for this csm and the writter is only 14 years old you should read it and learnunfortunately this is just further evidence of a fundamental lack of understanding of game mechanics outside of your own area and as such you should retract your application for your own standings in the community if you have any left

most of the items on that list were fixes to major bugs exploits or oversights that made piracy altogether too easy highsec was originally intended to be pretty safe and the only reason it took so long for those changes to happen was because it took a long time for the playerbase to really take advantage of the issues on a large scale also i like or rather i hate how your list conveniently ignores all changes made in the other directionso heres what really has happened concord response times adjusted for the increase in prevalence of highsec ganks sec status penalties for ganks increased due to the discovery of easy ways to raise it again insurance removed for gankers tornado added expensive ganks retain similar cost cheap ganks still cheap barge and exhumer hp buffed because they were paperthin and were getting demolished by 1 destroyer even when tanked now it actually costs either isk or players to gank an expensive ship ventures added which have builtin warp stabs with full cost to slots cpu targeting range and scan resolutionso its a less flexible frigate baiters can only reship in a combatflagged orca to prevent orca pilot from being combatflagged for not doing anything war declaration mechanics made to allow corporations to attack others freely in highsec after paying a fee war declaration costs increased in balance pass after they are shown to be too cheap unlimited allies can join a defender or attacker  this is obviously used almost exclusively by attackers can flipping gives suspect flag now instead of combat only with one person  duels added for those who dont want suspect status ganglinks cant be used inside pos shield  allegedly mining foreman links can but i find this hard to believe can anyone confirm drone bug fix breaks exploit that allowed a player to flag another player for combat merely because the player had drones out allegedly corps can disallow free shooting of corp members i never heard of thisso with all of these changes we see a lot of rebalancing of highsec combat but overall one very strong detail rings clear highsec is much more dangerous now with wardecs than it ever was without them the rest of that stuff which isnt really strongly in favor of the defenders so much as balance retention is insignificant in comparison
mining links are the only ones that work in a shield all others wont work the intercorp aggression flag is coming with tiamat it plugs a major security hole and its made to encourage more social play instead of countless alt corps or just sitting in an npc corp but feyd here isnt interested in balance he just wants easy kills by any means available there are still plenty of complete bullshit mechanics that ccp either lacks the will or technical skill to fix cough bumping hyperdunking 10s still active in highsec cough so dont bother playing poor downtrodden victim around here it wont hold water
in addition to this there have been other changes which have pushed it the other way for example the corp hangar changes allowing orcas to drop loot from ther fleet hangars no changes which were beneficial to his playstyle make it onto his graph also for wardecs you used to be able to dec shield yourself making it ridiculously expensive to declare war you also use to be able to shed wars and now cant do that
mikeassuming someone wanted you steve corbexx and sugar to get reelected what do you think the order would need to be on the ballot to ensure maximum success
yeesh that is a really tough question trying to answer it without being selfserving is even harderso let me tell you how i am thinking itvisible support currently in effect is the key along with how the election algorithm is worked we all need some 1 vote slots to make it past the first winnowing and pass throughs so if you had multiple accounts i would suggest you shuffle them a bit to spread the lovethat being said i would say that right now my money is on sugar and corbexx for being almost sure things corbexx has a solid and supportive constituency and i challenge you to find anybody saying anything negative about sugar i expect to see her on a lot of null ballots as well as the low support steve and i are the odd ducks neither of us have a huge support block behind us and as a result are more at risk if you listened to my interview with cap stable you will know steve was who i chose as the one person i would like to see get in besides myselfso to keep it from looking self serving steve me sugar corbexxbut there are lots of other good candidates that deserve to be on that list as well i am going to hack my way through the final list in the next few days and see who i like over alloh and thank you for putting me on the same list as those other three i consider that a high complimentmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i agree with the intercorp aggression flag though i am a bit disappointed about it but the mining links working inside the shield is inexcusable and i disagree strongly with that it should be fixedmike i thought you were a shoein you might get a few less votes because of the high number of folks getting interested in other candidates but i highly doubt you wont win a slot steve will probably get in too hes got popularity but youre right corbexx and sugar kyle are total shoeins
hi theresome questions because its campaign now 1 what would be your word in csm x for wis 2 for project legion as an important element for eve online 3 for valkyrie so that it could be linked with eve online you want to be the voice of newbieswhich one  english speaking only  how would you represent other language community and how do you do this each day in brave collective sorry for this inquiryyour application is interesting so we want to know a little more about you before votingthanks and best regards
1 for sugar if i could i would clone her and vote for both of them
your ad is here good luck
i do enjoy this bitthey are too cowardly to look for combat in low sec or even faction warfare because they might actually be shot at essentially in my opinion a cancer to the game a cancer because every action they take with that mindset does a tremendous amount of damage to the game without ever adding anything positive to it again cancerous cowards
its going to depend how sov 30 shakes out changing them before that wouldnt make sense the supercarriers role has been to be the ultimate structure grinder the titan the ultimate expression of damage so thats what these ships have been defined as thus far if i were to take a stab in the dark however the supercarrier i am not sure at this time what to do i think giving the titan a bigger sma would be great for the shipclass scriptable ddds have been talked about for years really its hard to give a good answer here without knowing how sov and other changes are hopefully with your vote ill be able to get in take a look and really start to start having that conversation with the community and ccp
thanks for the support keep the questions coming
bobmon here is your ad
i dont know if its strictly necessary to convince new players andor carebears to leave hisec hisec has a unique environment that you cant find anywhere else i think a healthier approach would be to ensure hisec is fun so that people dont have a need to leave it from there players should be given information and direction about the rewards and risks of other areas of spacethat said i think the prospect and the sisters of eve ships were great moves in the general direction of deep space encouragement these cool explorationfocused ships basically begged players to take them into spooky space and i can tell you ive seen many of all of them floating around wormhole and nullsec systems creating more accessible cheap ships with bonuses that aid in scanning navigation and cloaking all help the little guy get into and out of dangerous areas more reliably with practice
this will be the very first message that i leave on these forumsdear mister chance  in real life i am a young man struck with an unfortunate medical issue that cannot be cured or overcome and throughout my life this has caused me a fair amount of grief and depression spending an awful lot of time alone at home in between of hospital visits i was constantly bored with life and i found it really hard to meet people and make friendsso i browsed the interwebs for a game of social nature eve online was mentioned frequently as not only a social game but as a whole world separate to the real one we all live in where the players controlled their own fate intrigued by the idea of it all but far from convinced that the eve universe was all that it made itself out to be i went onto youtube to do further investigation thats where you come ini quickly came across your videos and i thought they were hilarious i watched every single one of them even though i sometimes barely understood what was going on since my knowledge of the game was nonexistent and i was thoroughly amused seeing what crazy adventures you were able to have in the game and the interactions you had with other players or customers was what convinced me to download the game and throw myself into it this was about two months ago nowi am still very much a newbie i learn tons of new things every day and i make a lot of mistakes however since i started playing the game i feel an awful lot less bored with my life i met great people to talk to and i feel like the whole experiences has greatly affected my mood in a positive way for the first time in many years i got really into something for that i will be eternally gratefuli will never be healthy nor will i ever have a normal life but at least thanks to you i have a chance to be happyyou have my vote and the first kill i get in my purifier that i just purchased a few days ago will be dedicated in your honor
hey sataric i really dont know what to say i will work as hard as possible to live up to your expectations and fight for this community whether it is on the csm or through my stupid videos
how many hours per week do you plan on committing to the csm if elected for the next year
no thank you
thorics a stand up gentleman has great depth and breadth of knowledge of the game both mechanically and sociologically and above all has a proven track record of good people and negotiatory skills these in my honest opinion are more required and necessary than many people may think when it comes to being on the csm as the recent eve media fiasco of funky bacon has provengood luck my friend
i have an issue with you anti ishtar stance i love mine for l4s and being able to use an orca as a mobile basea machariel isnt going to be the same
cap stable interview fresh off the rss feed
i know that the standings thingy is a problem and probably a old code relic from way back that no one dares to touch i have brought up the problem with ccp before and i hope something can be reworked here there is also the thing where neutral guys go into fw sites and you get a sec status hit for defending them i really think that they should give a suspect timer on fw plex entry it doesnt have to be 15 minutes just as long as you are inside the plex capital class warfare i am not really experienced here at all but some things i have read was swapping dread and carrier costs around and i kinda like this since stuff dying  stuff being alive but like i said this is not really something i know anything about to make a comment that could be considered good id rather listen and see what ccp suggests and comment on thatcomment on what other members think about this anchored bubbles first i would love for ccp to finish working on the many bubbles  1 large bubble thing they showed at fanfest because that  was so cool as for 100 large bubbles unguarded on every gate in 5j direction from your bear haven  that its one of the reasons i moved into thera having wormholes helps getting past that  fast in a battleship i think these provide way to much safety and no one is going to wast ages sitting there killing them when new ones will be up instantly when you leave shooting players is funnier then shooting structures as well one idea i support regarding the bubbles is
thanks for the response gorski i hate to say it but youll be on my ballots
1 for getting rid of null systems littered with large bubbles i support gorski
thanks for the response gorski
well looking forward to the csm x wormhole talk later tonight  url
the wormhole csmx talk is about to happen talk to the candidates
good platform to work with will be watching
domanark sat down with myself for an interview on cap stable listen here
i think everything in eve is about balance are subcapital fleets without supercapital support viable in virtually every circumstance the answer is yes we see all the time that subcapitals kill caps supers and titans yet if anyone suggests that supercapitals be able to kill subs they are shouted down as mentioned before i think dreads are in a pretty good place they have a purpose to deal lots of damage and that damage can be applied to structures caps and subcaps the balance to them is if they want to do any real damage they are then incapable of receiving any remote reps now look at supercarriers i think one of the biggest flaws that needs to be looked at is that they can do everything at once fit properly and with enough friends you can apply dps provide reps and cap and receive reps and cap something as simple as making them make a choice on which they want to do instead of being able to do all at once would bring more balance to the game but would be a better solution than continuing to nerf them so that they are defenseless against subs that are still capable of killing them
hi im i just joined this game yesterday and i would like to run for csmthis campaign is laughably bad
thats it time to evict ccp
withdrawing from the race with a sad heart good luck to the many
you have my votee
why waste your time the is an uneeded middle man dont kid yourself into believing the matters in anyway shape or form ccp will change eve to the way they want not what a handful of unimportant middlemen want
as some of you read via twitter i have to withdraw my candidature this year long story short i had two turbulent weeks at work caused by some changes in our company this leaned to more responsibility which will give me less time for the next monthsnow i had to change the order of my priorities i really coulnt foresee thisi think i will try it again next year after everything settles down thanks for everyone who supported me and sorry for maybe disappointing you
yes it wasyou always were
i started playing back in 2009 and the vets that took me in and trained me have been playing since the game beganfrom the stories they have told me it has always been this way the differences between then and now are more people are playing meaning more people are experiencing the same kinds of conflict that people did back in the old days and by extension talkingyelling about it more people are playing meaning there are more people causing conflict more people are playing and there is less empty space especially in highsec where people can just hide and avoid contact with others which is a good thing because it breeds more conflict in my opinion many people who have been recently joining the game seem to have a much lower tolerance towards gameplay revolving around conflict and interferenceas far as avoiding shiponship pvp is concerned it is possible hell there are still people who have been playing for years and only recently have had their selfcontained bubble of gameplay interfered with who then come wailing on the forums about itsome of the tricks to do this are understanding the aggression mechanics of the game there are a surprising amount of people who dont understand docking games remote repairs and not to shoot at a ninja looter in a pve ship understanding how pvpers and other undesirable people think and operate what better way to avoid getting blown up or have stuff stolen from you than to understandexperience how these people perform their tradenote this whole point can be best summed up with this phrase make yourself a more undesirable target compared to the guy next to you being prepared pvpers are not superhuman players with access to ships modules tactics and mechanics that no one else does every tool tactic and mechanic they use to their advantage can be used against them or to avoid them outright note eve is special in that its ingame economic health and by extension the health of the noncombat aspects of the game are dependent on conflict and destruction just the same way that conflict and destruction are dependent on the noncombat aspects of the gameless things destroyed less isk and minerals are spent andor trade hands because there is less demand for replacements which causes deflation of product prices which means less profits which means there is less incentive to harvest build haul andor tradeevery ship that blows up is more cash in the pockets of miners industrialists haulers and traders and if that ship happens to be a competitor for said minerindustrialisthaulertrader that means greater profitswelcome to the machine that is eve the ultimate rat race
if eve is getting sicker maybe we should send it to a doctor
actually they do explicitly say that pvp is central to the game from the new pilot faqthere are ways to do almost only pve in this game but there are always done against the backdrop of competitive pvp sandbox if you really only want to mine and build stuff you can but you will have to arrange for protection with some pvp players as part of an larger organization if you forgo your defense but do not find someone else to protect you you will be an easy target for larger more aggressive groups however missioning in highsec is pretty isolated from the sandbox in that there is much inbuilt protection from unwanted aggression so by following a few rules you are unlikely to be affected much by others in the sandboxeve is not sick or getting sicker  it was born this way there are other space games out there that will allow you to play without interacting or being affected by others eves sandbox is however quite unique and means that pretty much everything you do is in competition with other players  the ore you mine devalues my ore when the module you undercut me on the market sells that is isk that i dont get and so on this and the real risk of losing your assets provides much meaning and excitement to your game play that isnt present in other themepark mmos it may not be everyones cup of tea however
ive played since may 2004 and its always been a pvp game not this charyou either didnt truly play stayed in some back water system and did nothing but mine or your memory is wrongwhen i started there were far less online at any one time so the former is likelyeve is pvp centric almost every aspect of the game revolves around competition and conflict as more players have joined its merely gone to highlight that moredestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i really think your 45 year break has skewed your memories as to how this game was played you rememberd all the fun times you had but seemingly forgot all the bad times that came with them
i stand corrected edited the original post to eliminate the invalid example however that doesnt invalidate the main point of my post a problem with how information is presented in this game
because researching is hard cant use google to find the answers to your questions cant ask a more experienced player whats going onplayers have put thousands of hours of work into all the third party software tutorials faqs and everything else used to learn about the game what youre asking is for ccp to throw away all that work donated to the community and redo all of it simply because you cant be assed to go do some research on your own if you want the game developers to hold your hand and sing lulabys to you as you blissfully traverse the game then youre in the wrong place
i know im in the wrong place to be a newbie that is what im trying to changei dont know any other game that cant be learn either doing the tutorials or reading the manual here the tutorials are a mess just a collection of poor too simple missions that dont really teach you anything and there is no manual eithera game should be about enjoying it not about researching how to play it and about gameplay facts that sometimes seem hidden on purpose
i remember having the same thoughts as you as i started playing ccp is very bad in documenting things they usually release a devblog for a feature but dont update the wiki page of the same feature if the feature is changed afterwards the devblog is not updated eitherwithout someone telling you things you usually end up with half correct information about game mechanics it goes so far that players picked up devblog notions for features instead calling them by the lore name player owned station vs starbase etcthe client got a little better in telling you things show info of items is now a lot better for example but overall not much changed in the last 5 years where i played  you have to get used to it sadly
exactly what i mean although this character is new im a veteran of the game only after going through the new player process again after so many years with as much knowledge as i have now about the game i realize how difficult it is for a truly new player how much information he is missing due to a shameful tutorial and how hard it is to learn the game without constantly doing something wrong and learning from fatal mistakes and thats assuming you ever get to know exactly what happened which again you dontin the current state it is very easy for a new player to just leave due to sheer frustration after a couple of losses where you dont know anything about whats going on or how you were supposed to do things properlythis game needs a serious overhaul of tutorials to provide more meaningful information in a more readable and clear way and forcing you to practice these concepts with properly designed scenarios not the current lazy implementation npc surrendering because he was webbed without actually seeing what a webber does why warpdisrupt an npc that will not leave the area anyway allow the missions to be failed and repeated until the player executes them correctly explain with graphs and pictures complex matters like tracking probing electronic warfarei find it hard to explain why ccp has put so little effort trough the years in a critical part of the game such as this one only god knows how many players have we lost due to a poor tutorial very limited localization and the general obscurity of the game but i personally know a few of them people i know for a fact they would enjoy the game if they had made through the initial stages and the language barrier in my case spanish
i hope that you all had a great vd and the health clinics wont be hard pressed
hi steve i am happy last time i have voted for you with all my 7 accounts but now i want to hear about your feeling since you define yourself a small scale t2 highsec produceryou have written some posts ago about conflict tweaking that the holistic point of view you one has to adopt has to protect high sec people by not going elsewhere or more realistictly quitting i agreebut then you have written that in your opinion industry is good there is a feeling out there instead that in highsec its basically disgregarded i am was a pretty big hs manufacturer able to run over 250 inventions each 25 hours just to define intensive and what i actually see is that1 inventions is easier not unhappy with that ui has had nice improvements  lower entry level2 manufacturing processes in hs are no longer profitablethe second point deserves an explainationproduction times went down  more production in the same time unit  more supplyhs industry costs unreasonably went up  thinner marginswith this given its clear and not unpublicized that ccp wants to push people in 00but there is a point that always made me crazy we are not talking about a free to play game with power items where who wants can spend money to achieve more we are talking about a game where everyone pays but the ones that dont want  cant afford a given lifestyle can quitely dieplexes prices go up margins are thinner and hisec lifestyle can barely tank this would you define this balanced i was not after an easy industry never made it in the easy there would not be competition and when years ago people wanted to scale up they could more accounts more bandwidth more profits because of a hugely bigger efforttoday also that approach in hs is uselesssince you are an hisec industrialist whats your feeling with that regards bm
some really good articles have been published that really extol the importance of platforms like mine
funny then how you almost automatically reject questions regarding your own platform and even reject suggestions to improve it from wellmeaning people where i count at least myself in the former group and nariya kentaya in the latter and choose to lump it all together in this manner from p 12its remarkable how on one hand you cry for more transparency and authenticity while on the other hand reject questions into your own platform and gives an inauthentic view of yourself your history your abilities and your platformnow this in itself is a very good reason to question your candidacy but when you make it so obvious that your one shtick is csm reform and then nothing else i can assure you that pretty much anyone currently running for csm can do that job and many of them have actual agendas outside their own ego and misunderstanding of the election processwhen you decide to stop being a joke candidate and answer questions regarding your platform and when you decide to adopt a platform with relevance to the game rather than an electorate that doesnt like you people might think better of you currently your slogan ofmight fit you but we have a number of csm candidates whom we know and who arent devils you simply fall short compared to the competition and frankly youd currently fall short even compared to no competition at allof course someone regarding themselves as a devil likely wont attract voteseither because it shows how much ego and how little sense you have when you make that comparison or because its an accurate comparison and nobody would vote for a devil
okay your platform si transparency what else is it specifcally what other problems do you seek to fix or bring to ccps attention and what suggestions do you propose would make good soltuionsi ask this because there are several csm platforming transparency but none of them use it as their primary platform most of them are concerned with ingame material which is important after all what good do glass walls have if theres nothing inside to see
xenuria when are you going to answer questions you can not expect people to vote for someone that is silent in his own csm thread
thank you for stopping by my threadyou raise some interesting points and i am going to have to think about thatbut my initial not really thought about emotional response would be something along the lines of isnt the thing about eve that it is a sandbox with player generated content and shouldnt ccp stay as much out of it as possible and enjoy what we do with each otheras a really nonpvper i can appreciate the feeling of lack of content especially on weekends when there are really no suitable freighter contracts for me where i want to go if you are not pvping sometimes it feels like you have to struggle to find something to do but if it is too much i dont think that for eve the right answer is more content but rather try another game as well
just tell me if you need a hug man its ok

why if the majority of the players are not set up in lowsecnullsec alliances and wars is ccp not focusing on content development for them the entirety of the eve media seems dedicated to advancing the interest of players to play eve just to blow each other and the rest of us up why are our interests not being represented well why is ccp not advancing content in the games in areas where you are not targeted by players 4 seconds after you decloak this is not about separating more groups of players with different interests but a ambition to add something in the game for those of us not interested in new ways to blow people up
sion is not the only csm member who shares this opinion ive heard people say the exact same thing before sion even released this
simple exercise for you open the map and go to the statistics tab and click on players in space in last half hour then rethink your first sentencesmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i have corrected the missing negative in my postthe map doesnt help me tot up all the next to empties compared to the smaller much redder empire spacei am assuming there was still a significant proportion of people playing almost entirely in highsec maybe theyve all gone and i am overdue tooi have been told in replies to my other postings in no uncertain terms that eve is a pvp game and has always been and i am in the wrong place i have played since 2004 and have never shot at another players except in selfdefence what worries me is that the games seems to have no momentum in making non pvp content players like me are just ridiculed the only significant non pvp content i can think of since i started playing is pi exploration and epic arcs these are all dusty furniture now and i hear nothing on new content for non player combat areas all all focus and clamour is in the opposite direction i am alone in this view why does ccp just disband npc space and stop deluding players that there is a non pvp game here too for those who want it
ah ok see i was answering the first question and scratching my head wondering where you got the impressions everybody was in nulli disagree that ccp always plays to one portion of the population but at times the communities can act very envious of the other ones if action is taken to fix something over there yes the next year is going to have a lot of null focus because sov really does need some attention no that does not mean that all the other parts of space will be ignored that is why i am running to represent hisec play and the casual gamer to watch over the fact that no part of space is isolated from the rest not even wormholes any change causes ripples across all of new eden and so you need wh reps low sec reps hisec carebears like myself as well as the null representatives who admit that they dont need your votes because their own people will sweep them in to victory easilyi do not have that luxury i need you and people like you to votea lotmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
then we need some kind of affirmitative statement from ccp they actually support this playstyle because reading any eve media and reading future plans i see a big zero the only issue discussed seems concord tweaks and war decs this is not new contenti game like eve has enormous potential for no pvp content and there seems no movement in this area trade expansion market interaction expansion science explansion social expansion planetary resource expansion npc corp interaction explansion coop mission explansion the list is huge noone seems even to both to mention it as it is not big for pvp or alliance metagame twaddle where is the prompting on ccp on thisall this could be done all players could enjoy it if them want all could offer risk of various sort economic pve or player pirating where is the debate its seems be a total nonstarter
1 i mailed you about it you read it then didnt reply
applications are ending time to vote soona candidate may not agree with everything but he should be a fair representative and witness of what people told himbefore requesting our agents to endorse someone we would like to be sure you would speak about these following subjects if member of csm x  1 piracy  we dont want new game mechanics which reduce ability for some to live in a securized space this subject is important in game but becomes also more important politically out of game when we see some unscrupulous organizations applying for csm2 walking in station legion project and valkyrie  these 3 subjects are important because they would add other perspectives for eve online thats the reason why they should be supported as a whole and not like other games they must be linked with eve online perspectives in a game are the main reasons players new or old would stay in this game working on this doesnt significate ccp shouldnt work also on current mechanics3 societies social hubs or organizations  we are so we want them4 market mechanics  even if it would necessitate big modifications ccp should start to think about this in their planning see what we spoke about in this thread about shares exchange as a way to influence in another way the sandboxyour answer could be as simple as an ok for each pointand we will be yoursbest regards from the law organization and its messenger
as soon as true command ships give a mining foreman bonus so the booster can defend itself till then nope
can you please be more specific on who your advocating for the high sec players or the high sec gankers  pirates
neither gankers nor piratesnot only in high sec
1 i am not sure what you mean hisec is not safe it is a place where consequences happen as enforced by npcs in null and wormholes the consequences come more from your fellow players any freaking change will affect someones ability to live in the space question is which change and who gets affected take the awox change coming this tuesday it has an effect but i was totally for it because it was a very dumb rule to begin with2 ccp has a game universe and an intellectual product and they are going a lot of different ways with it i do not expect to see direct crossovers anytime soon for a few reasons the first is time differential we fight in long age of sail type battles while valyrie is more twitch boom dead i have played it a few times legiondust is small group and also hard to tie in without a lot of economic rulings for it all to make sense and not for a mediocre pilot to be able to buy and see squads at the drop if a few million isk it is easy to demand integrration but a lot more difficult to actually envisage what the hell that means as for walking in stations i wrote this and stand by it3 societies hell yes i will continue to fight for them and the name4 market mechanics are cool if we could have some sort of concord securities commission otherwise it would be a madhouse with uncontrolled monopolies snatching up all the little fish go back through the histories like eve bank the number of corps and alliances shut down or broken due to bad share management and tell me i am wrongmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
this was done to protect null sec mining boosters neither the orca or rorqual have received a balance pass so it may yet change in relation to highsec since the orca is also the logistics of a fleet it is almost always on grid hence the nerf to hisec is a nonsequitur for this particular itemconflict is just not measured in dps and ehp harvest  build  destroy are three legs that eve stands on mike gets this and has my vote

i have removed some rule breaking posts and those quoting them as always i let some edge cases stayplease people keep it on topic and above all civilthe rules3 ranting is prohibited a rant is a post that is often filled with angry and counter productive comments a free exchange of ideas is essential to building a strong sense of community and is helpful in development of the game and community rants are disruptive and incite flaming and trolling please post your thoughts in a concise and clear manner while avoiding going off on rambling tangents 27 offtopic posting is prohibited offtopic posting is permitted within reason as sometimes a single comment may color or lighten the tone of discussion however excessive posting of offtopic remarks in an attempt to derail a thread may result in the thread being locked or a forum warning being issued to the offtopic poster isd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
no where did i say that as a csm you should peddle your own ideas to get specific changes implemented or to be a mouthpieace for whomever complains the loudest i clearly stated that as a csm you should have concepts and ideas that you can suggest in order to solve certain issues previous csm members have done soyou dont need to be a coder to suggest for example that the bounty system needs to be improved or to come up with ideas that would improve combat boosters or hey even ideas on how to introduce more small gang pvp in nullsec  blink if you dont come to the table to do anything then what are you just a talking head forto ccp its this sort of passive do nothing style notion that brings the largest about of criticism toward the csm by players no you arent suppose to code and create aspects of the game but you should be part of the process in a meaningful waynobody said that you should design an allencompassing feature for the game i talked about you actually having relevant input in the process right now i dont see that as a possibility you may be a nice guy to chat with but the csm needs more than that
and in order to do that you must be able to provide relevant feedback which sometimes include solutionsthere is no division between just a pvp corp and just a pve corp theyre not rival or competing factions or playstyles eve is a social game and anything that you try to accomplish works better in groups through the corp mechanics if it made no difference you wouldnt be having issues with wardecs but i digress heres the beautiful thing about eveif someone does something to you you can do it right back to them someone fights you you can fight them thats balancebalance doesnt exist when a hulk can fight off a gila balance exists when you yourself can fit up a gila as well or a ship to counter the gila and go fight themthe problem is that you are trying to run a pure industry corp or alliance which is about as intuitive as trying to have a china shop in 5th century germania eve is a violent brutal game and your ability to be violent to your enemies is what will ensure your security not a sense of entitlement and there are large corpsalliances in highsec that do industry but most of them once they reach a large enough player base tend to migrate to more profitable areas of eve such as lowsec nullsec or wh space if the defenders are being farmed easily and are socially averse thats the problem on their end because they refuse to play the game and fight theyre free to do that but dont punish the people that actually want to play the game in its full manner pvp and all
thanks
bobmon has my support for csm he has the ambition and drive to make proper changes
disclamer bobmon is a mate of mineive known bobmon for aaaaaaaaages and worked with him on a number of different projects he is passionate about eve online and its communityif he is elected to csm i know hell put 110 in he has my supportdr
as many as it takes though i also understand leelo is rewriting the white paper to more specifically outline responsibilitiesroles so perhaps it will drastically change what ccp is looking for from csm this year
hey since you are kinda exploration focused and have some wh experience i wanted to ask you couple things do you consider yourself a wormhole candidate what are your views on the current state of wh pve with lowerclasses on one side and c56 capital escalations on the other whats the best way to get more people living and flying in wormholes what are the biggest hurdles atm any thoughts on t3 rebalance
thanks gehnster
thank you so much guys for the support 
in my humble opinion being an industrial representative means a general understanding of what effect industry has on this game as a whole and not just one aspect of itmining changes are brilliant im not knocking that but industry details so many more aspects than just mining and im curious as to your understanding of the rest of the aspectsfor instance you said youre a freighter pilot do you have a detailed understanding of how the changes in the rhea patch effected industry and the impact that change has on the markets throughout all of new edenif youre only running to effect change in mining how can you be an effective representative of industry as a wholeyou should then be running for mining representative and not a full on industrial representative again just in my humble opinionalso another major concern of mine is the fact that you are so involved in everadio as a manager etc do you really have the time and energy needed to dedicate to csm with your other dutiesfunkybacon was just a djblogger yet he proved to not be an effective csm representative as his dj  rl duties took away from thatrunning for csm should be to improve the game as a whole for your constituents that you are there to represent and not just one single aspect of it ie mining
i touch on mining the most because it is the area that has not seen any changes since probably when it came out yes i would be representing other aspects of it as well that is pi moon mining building and manufacturing and the like for instance we can go ahead and take mining out of the picture here whats are some other ideasso we can take a look at pi  for instance making it easier to set up meaning instead of having to place x amount of factories we can upgrade them to produce more materials and goods at the same time it would create also extra interaction so upgradeable structures is something that i would like to see or also maybe even the possibility to actually move around a structure to a place on the planet that may have better yieldthat is one idea on that regards or  like what we have with moon mining we have the siphoning units for moon goo but it would also be interesting if we could have those similar units to siphon pi next to a player owned poco i dont see why we shouldnt be able to have something tike thatthese are just a couple of things that i feel would deffintally help in making that aspect more interesting so yea i would be standing up for industrialist not just miningthe next i would touch up on is the jump changes yes i do feel that it has effected the industry side of things as well for instance it has made it a bit tougher to get stuff in and out of nullsec the one thing that i have throulght about in particular are carriers and using them to transport ships around the fatigue timers on them are crazy i feel that a ship that you have to actually train those jump skills on should be getting a better bonus this has been a problem i feel because it makes it harder to move those ships around when you have to wait an hour or so between each jump now eve radio yes i am involved with eve radio however i dont feel that will be a problem for me i know for sure i will have the time to dedicate for csm i dont feel the actionslimitations of one should effect another person just because they are tied to the same group and yes i agree i want to help improve the game as a whole even though my main focus is industry i have taken part of nearly every other aspect in the game from pvp fw missions nullsec sov and exploration for instance so i do have a broad range of knowledge that would prove usefuli hope that answered all your questions there and thank you
agreed mining itself hasnt seen many changes except for the rebalancing of the industrial hauling  mining shipsthe addition of the venture mining frigate gave a great boost to mining in itself allowing players old  new to dabble in mining adventures where they otherwise probably would not have doneim curious to know exactly how you would propose mining changes without taking into account the addition of new ships or further rebalancing of current mining shipsyou already can do that when you have the proper scanning skills planetology  advanced planetology to scan down the planetimproved scanning skills allows you to see where the best place for positioning on the planet is and you can always tear it down and move it to another side if you so should wish upgradable structures are always a bonus but on the other hand it is a passive income which in my opinion should require more interaction for better yields instead of just making it easier for everyone to have a passive isk sinkyes moving the setup costs isk as it should do and of course the time put in to tear it all down and set it up again but the way it is now is beneficial to all pi producers allowing more than just 1 person to use the planet for pi productionwith what youre saying basically ignores other users of the planets for pi production and gives the general assumption that the planet is yours and yours alonethe assumption that a planet is yours to do with as you wish is completely wrong under the basis that this game relies on everyone working as a team in all aspects including pi production and would knock the rest of your corporation out of the ability to produce pi themselves should they wishpocos are usually empty or next to empty so siphoning them is not really a viable solution to changing pi into a more positive aspecton this point as an industrial pilot i would totally have to disagree eventhough the changes have had a strong adverse effect on both myself and my corporation as a wholecarriers are not intended to be industrial ships or haulers their purpose is as a combat ship and to allow refitting and reshipping during combat as the dynamic situation of battle demands as a pvper you should know thistherefor your proposal of turning back the jump drive changes to carriers will again make nullsec static giving the bigger powerblocks again a greater advantage of keeping it to themselvesthat defeats the purpose of trying to break the major powerblocks hold on nullsec and denies smaller alliances once again the ability to venture into nullsec in their own right which we should never do againeveryone should be able to experience nullsec should they so wish and the change to jump fatigue not only fits with lore but also allows smaller alliances to get in on the nullsec experiencewhat is any game without its lorethe 90 jump fatigue reduction for industrial ships greatly offset the negative impact of jump fatigue as a whole for industrial pilots making your statement invalid and totally mootyou can already fit 6 battleships with fit in a jf to bring them to the frontlines in a major battle should it be necessary to give your carriers on field extra support during major battlesthose 6 ships in the jf is more than the 2 fully fit battleships you can fit in a carrier
my sincerest apologies if i come off as saying that because youre involved in everadio you shouldnt run for csm that is not what i mean nor is it my intentionmy concern is i am aware of your duties  responsibilities not only in everadio but with her sister station subspace radio and it makes me wonder if youre not somehow underestimating the task at hand and spreading yourself a bit too thinthere have been plenty of people who are not involved in er or ssr who have ran and been voted into csm while totally underestimating the requirements and responsibilities to be an effective csm representativeas has been said many times not only in these csm forums but also on csm forums on reddit and other sources one should always take into account whether one is able to take on the responsibility of csm in combination with either corpalliance leadership requirements as well as rl job etc before running and being voted inas one reddit user put it if your corp is going to crumble because youre not able to run it or if your other works wont allow for the required dedication then you shouldnt run for csmone should always do sufficient research into the viability of taking on such a responsibility before doing it
if you dont vote for this great man you are a casual
thoric definitely has my vote
i agree with this however what would you propose to fix the fatigue problem
your website sucks but you want to nerf ishtars which is probably the best of all csm runners talking points  ishtars youve got my vote as for pos being inactive why not make them hackable and then they go to the control of the hacker if he is successful integrate pve with pvp another candidate briefly touches this point but its also aspeaking point of yours vindis should be black ofc glasseswhatever ishtars should die klapen for csmps your website sucks
the day i made that website i vowed to make it look like a 8 year old made it i feel proud to report i have outdone myself and it looks like a 3 year old made itthis is an unfortunate consequence if ishtars were nerfed people who used them for pve would possibly suffer it would be nice to explore to see if there was alternative options where pvp ishtars are nerfed and pve would not be upset too much we will have to see what the future holds if you have any suggestions feel free to mail me
i saw down and spoke with migui xhyrrn for the cap stables csm x interview series listen here
thank you guys

you have my appreciation both for the kind words and for the vote thats an excellent idea ill definitely be bringing it up thanks for making that and color me impressed that you managed to find my old eve down under presentation dreads are in a pretty solid spot though carriers could probably use some work im not a huge fan of the sansrisk skynet style of playcowardly abuse of game mechanics as opposed to what cowardly trying to leave the honorable field of battle sov is becoming more trouble to hold than its worth rather than a change in the distribution of resources id like to see mechanics added that allowed alliances to build up their space into something more valuable build up in the urban sense of the word to increase density and value and to allow for reduced footprints for alliances in 00 the side effect of being able to build a meaningful space metropolis is a greater sense of home and attachment which is always more difficult in a static truesec type of mechanics system i wrote an entire article on the local issue
id like to see jump freighter fatigue cut by 50 of the current accumulation rate id also like to see the rorqual range upped to 10ly but have the same fatigue accumulation that the jump freighter currently has if a t2 bowhead ever gets made i think it should have the same accumulation rate and 10ly range as the rorqualmy thoughts on fatigue in general is that its a terrible idea to make it harder to move goods from one place to another but placing limits on military force projection is different and should be treated differently until the rest of the sov changes come out nullsec is limited because local defense can rely on carriers and supers more easily than an attacking force can attack with themif elected to csm id ask ccp for statistics on the average number of active accounts with carrier and dreadnought skills trained and intraining and based on the results which my guess is that theyve declined modify capital training time some without easing the time it takes to get into the ships necessary to take and hold nullsec sov with a new group players are forced to either not go to nullsec or join an existing group phoebe has reinforced the need for coalitions and nonaggression pacts to secure their borders as much as possible on focus on peripheral security in my opinion that need will never go away the only way to prevent it would be to put a cap on the number of standings an alliance can set and that wouldnt encourage content
yes to a reduction on industrial fatigue see previous reply but while i wouldnt mind seeing blops fatigue reduced slightly maybe 75 of current id like to see cloak modules nerfed slightly my suggestion would be a maximum cloak time for each module higher maximum the better the module but the longer you stay cloaked the longer your reactivation timer is once it deactivates the penalty would apply to covert ops haulers as well but perhaps with a 10 reduction per covert ops skill level if you want to camp a system 24hours bring some dscan inhibitors or fly a recon
these are the questions from marc scaurus and my answerswhat single part of the game do you feel requires the most work in terms of iteration by ccp please choose just onecorporaterole managementlowsec in generaldo you feel that lowsec is UFFFDfixedUFFFD if so explain why if not explain what you want to see done to fix it whether you mean fixed because there was a problem or fixed as in static my answer to both is no eve is not a static game and things change both by updates and player influence or use of the space while it may be underutilized that doesnt mean it needs fixing or any additions to make it more appealing just for the sake of trying to get more players to live there i am not a lowsec resident i live in nullsec so i would defer on any changes to the region to the representatives who live in the area such as sugar kyledo you have any plans to push ccp if elected to iterate on lowsec in general  feel free to elaboratethe biggest changes to eve which i support and which would affect lowsec the most would probably be pos plans and pi layouts i iterate my ideas more in my campaign thread but tldr is being able to save and reuse pos and planet structure layouts for future pi planets or poses just like saving reusing and even sharing ship fits the addition of both these mechanics would benefit the majority of eve players and eliminate a lot of useless tedium that bears no impact on players other than to frustrate themin your opinion where should lowsec rank in terms of priority for iteration by ccp  use a scale or less than null more than high etcin terms of regionality i would have to rank lowsec less than nullsec at the moment postphoebe nullsec is stagnant while awaiting the last two parts of sovereignty changes and i want to see that finished before ccp refocuses attention elsewhere after sov changes are finished i would still prioritize lowsec beneath the outstanding issues that all of eve would benefit from such as corporationrole management changes and pos mechanic changeswhat in your opinion are the main factors that make lowsec more attractive to its current residents than other areas of space from my limited experience 6 months spent there several years ago id say players who live there like it because theres danger but not so much that it requires participation in and support of multiple alliances to live there lowsec has different opportunities than highsec or nullsec and it has different types of danger nullsec sov space is time intensive but lowsec doesnt have to be while still providing a lot of similar pvp and pve funwhat is your thinking regarding piracy in lowsec UFFFD is it good bad or ugly from a lore perspective im surprised the factions havent gotten enough complaints to upgrade gate and station guns in terms of pure gameplay its lowsec not highsec so pvp content is a part of the life players shouldnt go to lowsec without expecting to be challenged andor killed its low security with a warning dialogue box for a reasonwhat are your thoughts on the notion that increased protection for pve players in lowsec will result in a better lowsec if they want protected pve they can mission in highsec or rent from northern associatesdot in nullsec lowsec is an ongoing challenge to the players who live there and who seem to love the adversity i wouldnt want to see pve protected more for a region meant to be less secure but i would support additional challenging and dangerous pve content for the areawhat are your thoughts regarding faction warfare particularly the idea that fw is the killer feature of lowsec  killer feature as in killer app  the defining characteristic of the spaceive never been a member of fw but ive done some frigate brawls with a few of my pvp characters which were fun i think fw satisfies many players appetites for small to medium scale warfare similar to nullsec sov warfare but without as much blobbing fw space is meaningful in a different way than the rest of lowsec but not necessarily better when it comes to a player perspective we all pick different places to live based on the play styles we love and the time were able to play the gameif elected to csmx and subsequently informed by ccp that lowsec was the UFFFDhot topicUFFFD for iteration in the coming year what input and advice would you have for them  we all know that the informed by ccp part will only happen when hell freezes over  but just in caseid ask them to finish up their changes to nullsec sov first if they didnt have that done by then and then id complain about how they could be spending their time on more important and actual problems like corprole management then id shut up and help as much as i could to give input on any changes despite my deficiencies in the area from my perspective as a player its rarely possible to change ccps mind once theyve announced a development plan so working with them to make the changes good for players is the best way to be of servicebonus UFFFD what lengths are you willing to go to in order to make pirates flashy red on overview by default again we want what was taken from usi wouldnt have an issue with supporting it to be enabled by default personally i would support a new player tutorial that explains overview settings and functionality its an important part of the game and might lead new players to ask questions like where can i find a pirate

someone is being salty that a positive and constructive conversation is occurringi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
by this point anyone involved with walking in stations has quit or been fired they would have to hire a full new team
and ill happily stop being salty the day something comes of said constructive conversations
imo tutorials should eb removed and replaced with tools to get newbies into communities quickerin a metasocial game like eve no amount of tutorials ccp could put into the game could help you because to put a comprehensive tutorial out would require dozens of hours of playthrough to finish and likely thousands of manhours to create whereas on the flip side you could learn most of the stuff firsthand in an experienced corp in 1 or 2 afternoons
exactly thisthere is simply too much information in this game to digest in an hour or two long tutorial and it is always changing in terms of how people use that informationthat is why i tend to warn newbies that eve is a process game you learn far more by doing things and failing than just readingis it frustrating yesdo player learn from the experience absolutely because humans have this interesting trait where we retain information better through negative reinforcementdoes this discourage players sometimes then again eve kinda caters to the type of players who lose and want to stop losingthink back to your childhood remember that friend who you played  game against and heshe always lost then a few weeks later you meet for a rematch and heshe utterly crushes you repeatedly all because heshe has spent that time figuring out what rules are and testing things against other playersthats an eve player in a nutshell
time travel back to eve online 2006then come back and thank them for what you have now
i was there in 2006 and youre rightbut the fact that things were terrible then doesnt mean that we must give thanks now that they are just bad  it only shows the low priority ccp has always assigned to this and that it remains an unfinished issue after many many years

i think tora understands that there should be a cloak and dagger with eve he knows that eve should have its bad players he knows that weak will always bring down the strongest if you group them together he also understands the weak can become strongest he knows that the good makes just as a good story as the bad im still not to sure if i will vote for tora but i can say he like what hes been getting at so fardeletetheweak
torawe have spoken a few times in game but you probably dont know me that well i started out in test alliance and flew in the war in delve found the politics tedious and boring and didnt want to get that hardcore over a video game i moved back to highsec to pursue my passioni was a highsec griefer and ran a small corp with my friends called wardec u we were about a year and a half ago before ccps obsession with killing highsec 2nd on the corp bounty list 5th now we were at war with you almost permanently through your support of many of our targets our mo was simple hunt and destroy industrial corps until they shut downi have a point stay with me my background is somewhat relevanti didnt start out my griefing passion with wardecs a long time ago when eve was at its best you used to be able to canflip this may have been just silly bullshit but i loved it we all did we would always have some shenanigans to do people to irritate and we made a fair bit of fake money which is not our objective at all there were mining fleets of people and mostly alts in the belts greedily filling space with cans to save the 4 minutes it takes to dock and drop some were even super enterprising and would have one of their clowns flying around to scoop the asteroid poop for them new players who shared our passion had a way to immediately pvp the eve kind of pvp where deaths cost someone something not the stupid epeen i am so skilled at pressing my buttons kind like most mmosthen eve released an update not sure the name of the patch they decided that mining ships should have a special bay just for ore that it should be large and that mining was too difficult an activity that was already incredibly afk for the next two weeks our action decreased to the point of complete scarcity mining became a solo activity and jet cans were something we saw once in a blue moon on top of that in a later patch they change the flagging rules because somehow the internet space police are all knowing and cant be fooled i quit the game because it was boring and i was pissed that a game that once prided itself on its ruthlessness had backpedaled into nothing more than your typical world pvp mmoa year later my buddy texted me with a new plan we were still pissed but he had a way to make miners pay wardec u was born and we were quite succesful in pissing off many deserving carebearsi beleive that the jetcan rules are creating a solo high sec that high sec is so easy to afk mine and afk mission run that there is no need for people to group up or join corps carebears can have their cake and eat it too that i can not abide the reason i tell you my story is because there are plenty of people like me who stopped playing plenty we want to see highsec be a place where there is a purpose where miners need to work together again and cant just afk where griefers or pirates are actually causing an impact in the afk lifestyle of miners im not just talking about suicide ganking im talking about more immersive hunt annoy destroy my band of brothers would return if ccp got some intelligent perspective back in their discussion roomsmy question to you isare you my guyyou can pm if you would prefer
i can give you a very short answer  100 yes
thanks for your endorsement tora and good luck with your highsec candidacy i think its pretty solid overall
hi bam in our occasional chats on slack or twitter or seeing the many comments of others i have no doubt that you will work hard and bring value that said my 1 concern about your candidacy or that of any autz person frankly is the ability to deal with nearrealtime communication especially in this faster dev cyclei live in the midwest us and play more on pacific time and i find the speed of things even on twitter and slack during their work day hard to keep up with how does the icelandic workday translate to your schedule and what is your plan to make sure you dont end up out of the loop however unintentionally if you come on while all the ccpers are asleepauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
hey rhavas thanks for your questionthe time difference can be awkward but its not insurmountable by any means and in fact it has some perks as it happens the icelandic work day aligns nicely with the autz evening by the time i hop on the pc in the evening after work the devs are usually arriving at the officein the last two years ive been in regular communication with devs like guard and falcon on skype to discuss matters related to eve down under and ive found the way our timezones overlap to actually be really convenient since i can spend my free time ie when id be doing most of my csm work talking with them while theyre in the officei usually have skype slack jabber and whatever else i need running on my computer at work as well im pretty much open for business 18 hours a day contrary to what nosy gamer and random mcnally said on cap stables 4th csm analysis show i do actually sleep sometimes im writing this reply to you from my office now in factas for summits  if i werent invited to attend in person  the sessions usually run from my evening into the very early am however as ive demonstrated by watching every match of the last two ats and neos live im clearly not afraid of putting in an allnighter where internet spaceship matters are concernedeve down under  a community for players in the autz
thanks for the answer1 hi sec is safer if you dont attack if you attack yes you start to have problems we dont want to change this logic some suspicious candidates for csm x proposed to be changed2 peraphs you think about something too much first demonstration of project in fanfest 2014 is enough far for us you can make two games with a minimal link like they show for valkyrie it could be exactly the same and yes they are time differential thats the biggest reason they should be linked battle on the ground or in the sky cant be like in space you could easily imagine it  there are wars in space on ground and in sky they would propose the adequate rythm in the adequate situation for wis if i understood your blog here also you plan very far a role playing like mass effect could be enough in the first time to make us discover inner stations and if its like in legion demonstration a game that boots from another its enough at first after it would be possible to increase interactions3 we agree even if the name societies is a bit luxurious when we have already organization the word in the game4 your idea some sort of concord securities commission is quite good fight for itwith these additional informations would you be able to be at least a spokesperson in csm x of what is a wish for some even if we understand you can have a nuanced vision on some subjects almost impossible to be a clone for each opinionin any case we like your ability to speak and exchange with players this is what we are waiting for a csm candidatebest regards
you got my vote
cagali for supreme ruler
jayne is a rare breed someone who commands on grid and commands respect off gridwhile the cfc does not implicitly benefit from npsi groups other than content provided via fights the societies model proposed for noncorporate groupings is something that our structure already enjoys via substantial dedication of resources outside the game based on the benefits it provides us i can see the appeal for incursion communities npsi communities and anyone part of a group with aligned interests to get on board with this change whether its stepping into the arena by delivering an eve event speech unlike many in csm threads or fleeting up to defend an excellent small gang record versus ccp at eve events jayne is one of the few people in eve who is worth interacting with offline
a campaign ad for you
thanks for this really nice and cool of you to make this appreciate the support
it was fun and im glad you liked it
ive flown with manny in many roles over the past several years hes opinionated stubborn and strong minded ive had more than a few arguments with him where we havent seen eye to eye hes also someone who has the best interests of the game in mind and who will not hesitate to voice his opinion to that effecti fully trust manny to be an excellent addition to the csm and hes got my full support
bobmon is not only the ceo one of the biggest eve online news sites but being so is probably one of the most well informed individuals in the game not only is he extremely knowledge in eve but the passion he has for this game and community is simply outstanding with bobmon on the board there can only be good things coming for eve
as a onetime contributor to en24 i can only confirm that bobmon is a guy with great enthusiasm a positive communityminded spirit and his heart at the right place not only is he working hard to work things out at en24 he has also done good work helping deirdre vaal with evesterdam this yearits guys like him and apothne who save pl from becoming a black hole of bittervet cynicism
1 from mei think your strengths will lie in the communication aspect of the csm and think you should drop the junior game designer stuffs but i think youll be good to have on the csm
1 from me sbu change is something i can really get behind bring back surprise attacks 
bobmon has my 1 he genuinely cares about eve  very enthusiastic about making positive changes and from h is time in large alliances as well with en24 i think it puts him in a good position to see what is broken in eve
definitely have my vote chance i believe that youd make a great csm and i wish you all the luck
then wouldnt a candidate whos been around longer whos had time to experience eve at all its edges be a more acceptable candidate for csmx you dont want to stick your head in sov then a person who understand sov and exploration would be a better choice an experienced eve player will always be a better choice when it comes to things like this because they have a better idea of the balance that it is npe high to null and wspace i personally do not want a fotm candidate that only wants to be csm because he see a problem with a small facet of his time in eve when a player who has had time to look at eve in a grander picture can see the large problems far better i understand that you like the game but i do not think you should be voted into csm due to this reason sorry but good luckdeletetheweak
i personally consider myself a wormhole candidate even if others consider me a daytripper i will not pretend to know everything about w space but i do intend to listen to the wormhole community very closely if elected since the health of w space is something near and dear to my cold black hearti dont see there being a problem with the disparity of operations and rewards in different types of systems although perhaps im misunderstanding your questionthe best way to get more people in w space is more active recruitment and propaganda by w space corps and alliances there is also the larger problem of getting more eve players to force the existing ones into more remote and risky space ive also heard but havent personally seen w space farmers moving to incursions for a variety of reasons but its another piece of evidence that riskreward should be properly balancedregarding t3s do you mean balance between the t3s or balance with t3s versus other ships
if you are seeking wormholers vote you should go and talk to us more have a chat with corbexx the incumbent wh csm rep get on wh podcasts talk to some wh groups get the feel of the community give them chance to be wooed by your enthusiasm those three things i asked are what we all care about very deeply for example t3s are the backbone of our fleets and they will very likely be getting a rebalance pass during your potential csm term so you should have some idea what that should look like ie versus other ships roles etc
my position in a nutshell is that more player control is good weve already seen the theme from ccp that the empires are loosing their grasp on power and i would like to see this continue i love the idea of players taking more control and power from the empires and think that it could massively add to the gameplay of eve as you point out the challenge in this is balance destructible stations stargates etc are all a step in the right direction i feel but when it comes to giving players more control of things like concord  roles filled by npcs there are more intricate balances that need to be considered for example i would love to see some of the things that the faction police do attacking low sec status players players carrying drugs etc handed off to players however some things such as concord would be difficult to replace players withsorry for the delay in replying but i was enjoying the lack of internet access that icelands more rural areas have to offer 
go erika i know for sure you are the right person for the job and i know from first hand you are as helpfull as one can be
being a nice helpfull person is all nice and all but i dont see her actualy having time to represent us indi ppl seeing her being in everadio and ssr as was pointed outand to be honest have someone represent industrie in eve who thinks a carrier is an indi ship for me that just premotes having mining drones in your carrier to go mining and i realy think thats not a thing to premote
a carrier may not be intended as a industrial ship but it is used in logistic operations to move ships around im not sure how that is promoting that you should have mining drones in your carrier for mining and as far as the time commitment as i said before time commitment is not going to be an issue for me also i am not involved with ssr so im not sure why that is being pointed out im also not sure how it also equates to saying that i shouldnt be running because i am from eve radio i am not doing eve radio stuff 247 i have done my homework and again i am not seeing me as having issues with the commitment so with that said id like to go over the next bit of topics that were pointed out from raeshaso for the mining im assuming you would like me to go in another angle besides the ideas for new ships and rebalancing or what i had mentioned in my initial post well there are a couple of things in addition to that for instance another idea is that we have something like we have with combat sites when you finish a combat site you have a chance to get an escalation for better profits we do have mining belt anomalies as well i think that if we could get something similar for those it would be interesting as well it would add more sense of reward as well say that when a anomaly belt is mined out or i suppose this could work for normal belts as well you have a chance for a mining escalation to pop up where if you go into it there will be richer ore and perhaps much harder rats that you would have to deal with so thats another idea there and with these ideas these are to see mining become more interesting and more interactive than what we have nowtheres also another idea that was brought up which is not my original idea but one that i support comet mining both of those ideas there i feel would add more for miningso now taking a look at the other points mentioned carriers im not saying they should have timers like a jump freighter no they shouldnt have timers like a jf i was just looking at seeing them more viable  if thats the right word im looking for carriers are not industrial ships and i know that nor should they be but i do think that they did get hit too hard with the jump changes but aside from that idea of reducing the fatigue on carriers a little bit i think its a lovehate relationship being a jf pilot i like the jump changes it created some localization in nullsec but nullsec is still stagnant and major alliances just reorganized themselves though i think thats going on another topic there but it does also encourage teamwork as well  the hate part of it is that its just more annoying to have to wait a bit before you can jump again now the moving around on the planets i know you have to tear it down and then just reposition currently however i was looking at making it easier and less tedious youre right that it is a passive income though and with your skills you can find the right spots and replace your structures you are still interacting with the structures wither you are able to upgrade them or just place more down but the upgrades would also be more convenient in my opinionyou arent owning the planet you still have the same restrictions corps can still work as a team i dont think that adding that is going to change that personallyhope that answers your questions there
the ideas for barge rebalancing are quite overpowered as was pointed out previously making barges opd is not the answer to the issue at hand with miningthe problem with mining is most people including myself find it very tedious and fact of the matter is since the removal of drone goo from the game there is a severe lack of minerals as there are way more builders building ships than there are people mining the resourcesthe way to go with mining is as you said trying to find ways to get more people involved in resource production ie making it less tedious for the same or slightly improved yields to promote more players getting involved in resource gatheringthe addition of the venture helped this allowing players without perfect mining skills a cheap way to dabble in resource gatheringi know many diehard pvpers who now currently use the venture for mining in between killing off thingsbrilliant idea but how would you suggest implementing ithow often do you see a comet zooming throughwould it stay or would you have to hunt it down and for what kind of yieldwouldnt that then fall more under exploration with a bit of resource yield as a reward like coming upon a rat hauler spawnthey are already versatile  viableyoure ignoring the role that lore plays in the current jump fatigue and missing the point of why it was implementedjump fatigue was implemented to stop the major powerblocks throwing carriers about being able to mass move them from one side of new eden to another in 10mins or lessnullsec isnt as stagnant as you think and yes thats another subject and instead of blobbing carriers about we have more of what happens in lowsec with small gang roams plus you are now more likely to defend your small holdings than ever beforestaging isnt that easy anymore what used to happen was someone would throw up a pos or 2 in a system stuff their carriers  supers in them then just steamroll regions to gain massive control of everything with very little oppositionstopping this has  did open nullsec up to smaller corps and alliance to come in and get sov over a system or 2 and made the odds even of whether they hold sov or notthe jump fatigue timers made teamwork more possible than it was before in the aspect that subcaps  caps now fly together through jumpgates unlike before when carriers could not move through a gate and you needed a cyno to move it even to the system next door to stage in other system so why wait use the gateyou now need a good mixed fleet to protect your vulnerable carriers as they move about which gives the subcap pilots also more content and something to do instead of just orbiting cyno chains til all the caps are throughi actually feel that carriers are more viable now using less resources ie the cynoships and fuel for cyno chains than ever beforecarriers are not indy ships and should never be thought of as haulersthis is also being critiqued in another csm thread here
a single pi production facility per player per planet is already a good systemthere are limits to how much a planet can be mined and stripped of its resourcesthe way its set up now doesnt allow for a planet to become overmined and gives other players a chance to mine what they need for their own reactionsim sure if ccp were to implement the ability to place more production facilities on a planet they would also implement the ability for that planet to become barren due to overmining to balance it outand going back to lore how would you propose for that to be implemented in empire where the planets are our original birthplaces before cloning without making everyone homeless and space being full of nothing but refugee centerswhat happens when all planets become barrenof course that is pure speculation but you need to be thinking of how ccp would balance out those changes to again not make them an overpowered isk sink as you are proposingbeing able to move your pi production facility about willynilly again doesnt take into account your corpalliance mates and their production facilities on a planetwhat if your corpalliance mates are already mining on that spot you want to move your facility toas a passive income it shouldnt be made easier with less interaction then it becomes an isk sink which is never what it was designed or implemented to be which is a fact youre ignoring and not addressingit also causes an overinflux of pi materials to the markets making the price on them bottom out and also with an overinflux you get an inbalance and overflow of pi materials versus other materials needed for building and reactions
thank you for pointing this out this would have been my next thing i would have pointed out which has also been critiqued here in this thread
can you talk a bit more about this if you were suddenly in charge for a day what would your top three priorities be for eve and mobile platformsauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
several alternative methods or approaches have been proposed that i think would work better 1 shorter maximum fatiguetimer 2 flat timer on jump with no fatigue timer 3 reduce fatigue arising from jbs as compared to a true jump this is ancillary to the other two im open minded on it but i think the essence of most of them is reduce the escalation or cap it make it less applicable to jump bridges which have a built in use cost already in terms of sovfueletc
what would you think about expanding new eden rather than constraining players into a smaller place rather than tying the players hand why not give them more room to move i see no reason to penalize someone for using a faster method of transport if it is their desire to move rapidly across new eden for any reason why not give new regions in all zones of space to explore and expand into if you want to reduce current sov holders grasp why not do it through pve as well as pvp create new npc forces that wish to destroy all life that directly attack sov structures with capital and subcap fleets of thier own why not have ccp generate more content for the players rather than completely leaving them alone to only come back and punish them for being successful i do not see the logic in the using punitive measures to control the players when you can reshape the scenario in a positive mannerwhat i am saying is content not penalty timers
id be thrilled to see new content ive been hoping since they started talking about player built stargates that wed see a new sort of space with different rules of engagement i still think nullspace is better with some limitations on how fast capital ships can move across it however we see a lot more gudfights in our neck of the universe since it became harder for everyone and their titan to 3rd party from across the universethe cfc has been using wormholes to good effect to 3rd party and have fun in other places i would as i stated prefer make the rules less punitive but keep some restriction on rapid movement of capital ships in place and yes i own a super and lots of capitals ive actually gotten to log them on more and use them recently than before i completely agree that were well overdue for a bit of new content to give us new and interesting goals however it fits in with my platform of decreasing the rewards of risk aversion if you have to get out and fight some npcs to hold your space periodically it might lead to some good 3rd partying and fights if you cant simply huddle in your station and wait for timers to blob there will be more aggression of course as always poor execution can lead to tedium and making it even harder to hold sov to the point it doesnt feel worthwhile to most people it needs to be handled carefully so i agree with you partially
awesome thank you for the thought out response
well that sure is a relief knowing you dont want miners out murdered or anything right now im feeling the sort of gratitude that was likely felt by lepers in medieval times on hearing the new local lord wasnt going to burn down their camp and drive them over a cliff and into the sea and go right ahead promoting the idea that miners spend all their time magically mining afk for hours on end the secret must be in one of those guides to making isk in eve i keep seeing ads for no one i know has ever subscribed to eve because they got all excited about being a miner but a lot of people do get drawn in because of the opportunity make stuff some of those folks like to make stuff in small groups or on their own and derive pleasure from resource gathering themselves and that requires a lot of time spent mining but when youve churned out your manufactured item the mining grind seems worth it and whether as a corp group or individual you get to experience a real sense of achievement oh and believe it or not a lot of us miners do things other than mine this is my 10th year in eve and im still happyso no need feel sad on my behalf 
i respect people that decides the way they want to play a game of meaningful choices i dont like botters and i dont like to see noobs sticking to mine without knowing anything else just because no one bothered showing them it isnt a free choice if you only know a very small piece of the spectrum of choices mining ore is arguably the worst isk source but its trivial to escalate horizontally i dont have an issue with low income low attention game play but i would like to see more content like ninja gas mining where you risk a venture to get in 15 min what a mackinaw gets in one hour
i just listened to your capstable interview and think you would be a good csm only heard good ideas not a single thing i disagreed on added you to my endorse list

hellofor those of you who do not know who i am i am a highnull sec residing incursion runner i hope to represent high sec during this campaign and would like to address some of the issues plaguing high sec incursionsincursions are a wonderful way for carebears to make money while also being involved in a community i do however believe that there are some design flaws with them in their current state a quick list things that i believe should be adjusted are as follows quicker monetary penalty for stacking the grid with extra players over the maximum payout amount the ability to defend the mothership before the withdraw timer should be introduced the tpph site type needs a little work to bring it in line with the other headquarter site types freighter gankingsuper dunkingdespite being a carebear i do not believe that this form of content creation as gankers would like to call it should be nerfed or removed however i do believe that the freighter should be given at least some form of self defense when was the last time you saw a trucker without a license to carry and to help combat super dunking freighters should at least be able to lockisboxerthis may lose me a few votes but i believe that ccp was a little hasty in the way they tried to solve the issues that is boxer was creating and despite all the predictions in the forum post for it i have yet to see a significant drop in plex price or a better profit margin on industry i have however noticed an decline in user online activity in the recent months and a decrease in the value of deadspace modules which affects the income of high and null alike i believe that ccp should readdress this issue to come up with a solution that better addresses the problems at handbuas a candidate i would also like to state that i do not know everything about every aspect of highsec gameplay however as a representative of highsec i will make it my duty to hear your voices and present your arguments to ccp in the best available fashion the csm should be for the people by the people the above touched on topics are not all of my opinions about the changes needed in the game however they are the issues that i have the most experience with and first hand knowledge of if there is anything you as a highsec dweller would like to be addressed please mention it in the ingame channel aeon csmx
hellohave you submitted your paperwork to appear on the ballotmy understanding is that due to the wardec mechanic incursion runners do not form into large corporations instead they form one man corporations that can be quickly dissolved and reestablished are you satisfied that ccp provides enough tools outside the corpalliance ui to allow incursion communities to adequately functionthe csm is described by those who have served on it as a 2040 hour a week commitment would you be able to put that much time into your csm duties for a full yearif you could pick only one other candidate to serve with you who would that be

the only thing i can clearly recall changing from 2007 to now is that currently getting into nullsec is far far easier than it was back then
theres no such thing as a nonpvp player in eve
there is no counter to these devices and there should be if ccp does not want to make a module to counter these items they should probably be removed
blockade runners counter cargo scanning
bear in mind that the cargo scanner can only pick up 80 of the things you are carryingif you load up your cargo bay with lots of small useless items like exotic dancers documents and one of each mineral then it overloads the player scanning you with tons of information that has to be sifted throughremember players who are planning for a gank are looking for easy targets not ones that make them want to pull their hair outship scanners pvpers dont care and if you are concerned about being ganked then you should not be flying all purple fits in the first place if you want to then take precautions and fly defensively
but there are countersdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
but op cargo scanners have perfectly legitimate pve uses
as was said there is a counter to cargo scanners and ship scanners are not perfect in the information they provide in principle i would not be against a module that confused a ship scanner but since this information is provided for free upon destruction of the ship via killmail anyways i am not sure anyone one would bother fitting it certainly though ship scanners have too much utility to just remove from the game for no real reason the overview also provides the ship type with no counter just like the look at button give information regarding fitting with no counter should we remove those too
counters to scanning modulescloaking devices cant scan what you cant seeinstawarping ships cant scan what you cant lockblockade runners immunedouble wrapped cargos pick up a contract on an alt then contract the shipment to your haulier
true that you cant fit a module to block a cargo scan but at the same time ccp has generously provided the loot pinatas which offer that counter as part of the ship unfortunately the loot pinatas cant be tanked anywhere near as well as well any other hauling ship so the sacrifice you make for not letting people see what you have is to make it very easy for them to kill you even if you dont have anythingas for the ship scanner i find it to be very peculiar as it has an optimal range but is never ever anywhere near complete on its result ive had to scan a ship i was sitting right next to a dozen times to get enough module info to be able to piece together the actual fit in eft though usually the people you need to scan wont just sit there and let you scan all day until you figure out their fit so if there were to be a module to counter a ship scanner by confusing it then the ship scanner would need to be more accurate if not be able to give you the complete fit if you are inside of optimal or whatever
lol good onescloacking  yeah the can still get a scan on you with a fast locking scan ship you cant cloak if they lock you firstinstawarping ships  even with a triple web hyena escorting a freighter a fast locking scan ship can still lock and start the scan which is all they need to do as long as a scan starts on a ship you will see the cargo contents and yes ive seen it and done it myself just to make sure instawarping ships arent safe just safer they can still be scanned and still be victim to a headshot nado gang or a normal gang if properly doneblockade runners  aka loot pinatas you take the chance to get blown up even if you arent hauling anything it is a target by itselfdouble wrapped cargo  nothing says hey guys im hauling expensive stuff i dont want you to see like a double wrapped shipment
grrr gankers
tradeoffs friend eve is about tradeoffs there are plenty of viable ways to move your goods safely in highsec  just not a onesizefitsall solution as it should bewhat is your goal for these changes force gankers to randomly destroy ships to get the delicious loot inside because that seems like a bad idea as it would remove much of the incentive to carry a reasonable amount of cargo and actually cause empty ships to be popped all the time something which already causes enough whining on the forums when gankers decide to do this
does a server tick prioritise a recloak or ship lock is it whichever comes first either way the scout has less than a second to react to your presencei wasnt talking about freightersblockade runners have the same benefits and drawbacks as the cloaks they usethe double wrap goes hand im hand with decoy ships carrying doublewrapped shipmentsare you seriously complaining about a lack of an allpowerful anti scanning device given that you already have numerous options to hide your contents and there is literally no alternative to figure out someones cargo dont you think youre acting a little overentitled

could this be a big step forward to solving war declaration problems coupled with the white knight corporation list
from over here
sorry i didnt get back to you earlier i kept meaning to but stuff came up at inopportune momentshighsec has one benefit over all other locations logistics getting your hands on materials is easiest in highsec anyone doing serious manufacturing in any other sector except possibly t3 production in wormholes comes to high sec for materials they then have to ship them back to where ever theyre making things which adds an additional cost and risk there are shipping costs for highsec of course theyre just negligible in comparisoni do agree that some t2 things are too quick to produce ive said that elsewhere but as for the went up unreasonably for costs i have to disagree the costs are low as long as youre not manufacturing in jita its simple to get them below 1manufacturing in null will never really compete with that in highsec except in very specific areas
hey mate thanks for the replyi have some objections first whoever does mass production resupplies in jita except for capitalsc builders which take part of their supply in jita highlownull producers do the same so no advantage for anyone hardcore producers raise jita materials prices of 1525  when they restock in jita and theres no chance to find suppliers for such numbes not even in nulllogistics is a benefits  i think that is easier to jump multiple jfs in some place other than moving really expensive cargos aroundi moved freighters by 2530 b per run in the past which was risky then is impossible now and that was clear when i made capital production with my jf moving 15 b stuff from jita to low sec with just 1 jumpthe cost point is partially true but then again i was talking about people wanting to use the brain to push the game in the limits they can afford its true that you can find good spots to produce but a real massproducer might be forced to move any now and then and such effort in terms of business is a cost relocating 3 dg towers each 1 or 2 months  most people hidden in null can starvate there producing in a very stable scenario which they deserve of course because they can give the time it takes and this takes us to my only and initial question arent we carebear and uber players paying the same money for the same game note i am note aggressing you its just the love for the discussion kudos to you anytime anywhere 
worst troll ever
not a troll and i am also not the only candidate proposing this please dont flame my thread
in political science the regular terms are joke candidate or frivolous candidate and a number of variants ironic sarcastic comedic etc although im still not ruling out the honest though still deluded hypothesis which would better explain the charge that goons are messing with his ballot by putting him on theirs  i mean what  and the madeup statistics about his voter baseits not always clear but i think any honest person would have gotten the message years agoeither way we get to point and laugh
your campaign ad
thank you it is very nice
interview par cap stable en franUFFFDais de ccp tara au sujet du csm x
truly urziel i am unique in my support of sandbox play and desire to shoot others in the face in a space combat game you however have never dunked another eve player nor used mechanics against them to achieve victory individually or in fleets truly you have only ever taken part in honorable 1 v 1s at the sun in equally fitted ships against equal sp toons onlyyou would never win a fight by any available means try and shoot the messenger all you want but i am not running for csm mike is and he is about championing continued nerfs to the sandbox just like ripard teg before him thats fine its his right but whats despicable is he and you try to hide that fact from people i dont care about rationalizations of a nerf a nerf is a nerf 0 minus 1 equals 1 and it doesnt get to equal 0 just because you rationalize the subtraction with mechanics fix spindoctoringor perhaps what you call bullshit mechanics many including ccp who validated bumping in a ruling call working as intended and people playing downtrodden victim are actually the ones trying to defend the damned sanbox you know like mike is supposed to be doinglook im not the first or only person to call mike out here others have long ago done so more eloquently than i the voters just have a right to knownerf advocates like mike and yourself who operate like tax  spend governments pitching new taxes as revenue streams are lying to them selfsame dressing up nerfs up as mechanics fixes to avoid voter scrutiny and people clueing into what you are really about is equally not coolf
its only negative one in your opinion a lot of changes you dislike i think are good for the game so id say 0  1  1 you crying over the changes doesnt make them bad its simply a matter of opinion and they differrofl a tmc posting by james 315 and thats supposed to be taken seriously and can be assume to be completely objective i think notyou realise if you guys didnt stand behind code youd actually be worthy of considerably more respect right i say this in complete honesty and this is not designed to be insulting in any way  nothing anyone from code has ever said has ever come across even remotely as if it were supposed to be taken seriously its an enormous rp trollolol fest youd do far better to drop the act and be frank about issues drawing up fake graphs and presenting grandiose the end is nigh speeches really doesnt lend itself to being treated like anything more than comedic entertainment
james article is well written and its very hard to argue with the points he madethe some thing happened long ago with ultima onlineultima online was the first sandbox housing pks full loot all that good  the economy was extremely well balanced pvp was frenetic twitchy and had an extremely high skill cap you could steal from people poison them etcthen trammel came it split the world in to two halves one half was the way it was before the other half was pvpfree if you stayed in the old world you got double the resources you did in the new one but at the same usual risk in the new world there was quite literally zero risk so the economy got completely  and inflated everyone went mobkilling ratting in the best gear deadspace instead of basic blacksmithed t2 gear no one cared about oreminerals anymore etc etcit was the deathknell for uo subscriptions dropped off massively and it never recovered the game is god awful now but a carebears absolutely sweetest heaven full of opportunities for massive goldaccumulation and nothing to spend it on
dont forget to vote
the problem is that this is unrealistic because you dont want people who pvp to defend you want players who have no skill or interest in pvping to do it giving a defender a token reward to defend themselve then cutting of their ability to evade isnt going to suddenly make them good at pvp ill have to dig out the stats later but from ccps crest data the vast majority of wars are won in the isk war by the aggressor this is because the aggressor targets groups they will win against theres nothing to gain by attacking someone theyd lose againstim all for conflict but it has to be meaningful conflict between groups who are on an even footing and it also doesnt have to be just shooting each other there are other forms of conflict im not for forcing players into gameplay they dont like just so that another group has more targets to shoot at this game is for multiple playstyles whether you like that or not
you cannot possibly play eve without pvping sole exception test server play where there is no economyand if you do not believe that groups of low skilled characters in t1 frigates can pose a threat  look at the history of brave newbies or goonswarm for that matter although its a long time since they were newbieheavy
in that instance by pvp i meant the classic pew pew variety which is what you are trying to encourage you know this tooand i believe that low sp characters controlled by players interested in shooting people can excel at it sure but youre being rather dishonest if you are suggesting thats who ends up as the defender in a wardec 9 times out of 10 the majority of defenders are players who have no interest at all in shooting people and if they tried would fail against most of their aggressors who are considerably more skilled not in sp but in actual player abilityi get it you want more people to shoot at  so go find players who want to play that way stop trying to force every other player who wants to play their own way into playing the way you want them to just because you want to be fed easy targets rather than hunt tougher ones down
not according to your post historyso basically you hate any and all non consensual pvp which is one of the cornerstones of sandbox gameplay in general and eve in particular why do you even post anymoreand shooting at people whether they like it or not is its own playstyle whether you like it or not
check it out my personal troll found me againthen you have comprehension issuesnope im for nonconsensual combat it just needs to be within reason forcing players to have to engage in fighting in order to get out of a hostile situation placed on them by another player isnt respecting other peoples playstyles just because people dont play like you doesnt mean they are playing wrong id like everyone to be able to get whatever it is out of eve they want thats not good enough for you well tough thats still my viewbecause like you im allowed to my opinions are valid even if you dont like themwhich is why im not advocating its removal i just dont support making it even easier for a player to be disruptive to the pve playstyle just because you think people should be punished for not wanting to engage in pvp combat once again though you either are unable to or actively refuse to make that distinction and you continue to assume that anyone with a view that isnt exactly yours is automatically asking for the removal of all nonconsensual pvpat the end of the day theres room for all types of player in eve i really dont care if you think it should be just you guys thats never going to happen even if you get terrible csm candidates elected
you just said that youre not unless its forced through some contrivance about even footing and this statement also means i am against all non consensual pvp because a hostile situation placed on them by another player is damn near a perfect synonym for non consensual pvp thats the whole thing about non consensual it doesnt give a flying rats ass about respecting their playstyle if their playstyle involves not bothering to defend themselves so much the betterexcept for the part where you are i just saw through your doubletalk i doubt im alone either youve gotten worse at hiding it lately
where exactly did i say im not for nonconsensual combat in your mind unless im screaming everyone should kill everyone at all times with no restrictions raaaah that im not for nonconsensual combat thats ludicrous im for a balanced game which involves considerably more than one playstyleno thats not what it means at all sabrizs suggestions amount to making wars unavoidable without logging off or staying docked then giving the defenders some token amount of isk to repeatedly die as a form of content for the aggressors being against that isnt removal of nonconsunsual pvp it simply means not making it ridiculously easy and not giving people choices when reacting to it and sure defending themselves but that does not mean they have to fight to defend themselvesyou havent seen though anything basically youve read some of what ive written ignored it and gone on your usual tirade that you dish out to everyone lately i get it you hate eve you hate where its going well tough luck buddy this is the game pve exists and ccp are not going to just throw everyone into some sort of pit of death for you to blap endlessly without effortyou want nonconsensual pvp thats fine it exists and always will but you have to work for it just like everything else you already have to pay basically nothing to force an entire corporation into combat you can gank with a week old character in a ship costing a tenth the cost of a mining barge and yet you want the game to be even easier seriously htfu
here
im for nonconsensual combatis the quote that i get out of your link
selective reading at its best i suppose
lucas just click his name and hide his posts he is not on the forums to contribute kaaros sees himself as some sort of forum warrior who needs to smite anyone with a different opinionas to getting back on track sabriz and i would both like to see more conflict in high sec but in different ways i want to see veterans exposed to more danger and less newbies farmed by suicide gankers and station camping duellersi grow so very tired of seeing things along the lines of this it is not fair they changed corporations when i declared war on them i paid isk i am entitled to kill them now meanwhile the ones expected to defend themselves havent got a snowballs hope on the surface of the sungankers run around suiciding into newbies and laughing at their horrible fitsboth groups complain about risk aversion and yet create more risk adverse behavioursabriz  how do you respond to thatedit please make it very clear between what you and your friends do and how you see others behaving generally
so i contuined reading your link and wham which is why im not advocating its removal i just dont support making it even easier for a player to be disruptive to the pve playstyle just because you think people should be punished for not wanting to engage in pvp combatseams like kell is saying that hes for nonconsensual combat and like all things in this game it should be within reasonable limitsin my opinion i agree with him as there there are other places in the game where nonconsensual combat doesnt exist because just by fact of being in that space you agree to pvp combat low and null so high sec shouldnt be degraded to a free for all just cause
no thats just lip service
wow thanks so much didnt know you could block someone like that on the forums
your problem is with this ill make it a little clearer for those with issues understanding i have no problem with you attacking a player who does not want to be attacked but their ability to respond should not be limited to shoot back players who dont want to fight have the option to run and thats a perfectly valid option at no point will i ever suggest that you should not be allowed to attack another player against their will but at the same time their options should also not be restricted to what you wantyeah im aware of what he does im just not put off by people like him hell get bored or banned eventually im sureyeah i agree with that in principle id rather make it more challenging to attacker newer and more passive players while more rewarding to engage in fights where the opposing team is willing and able to fight back at the same time though id like to see players less rewarded for safer pve and more rewarded for venturing out exploration for example it sucks it should be much more consistently rewarding to explore space away from highsec mining is the same there should be more reward for players mining in places like wormholes
kaarous it sounds like some of the trolls are blocking you does this make you despair
puts on wizard cloak and hati am a watery swamp troll that makes me difficult to kill with fire
eve is not and has never been about fighting on your enemys termsif i want to dominate the enyo market my enemies are the other people building enyos i can fight them on their terms sell my enyos cheaper or i can fight them on a different choice of front  manipulate the datacore market gank any ship i see carrying crystalline carbonide armor plates hire mercs to kill my rivals pos or whateverother participants in the enyo market need to either repel these attacks or leave the market this is true whether the attacks target their strengths or weaknessesif you want your playstyle to be left alone by other players you need to also leave other players alone  and that means playing on the test server where you cannot impose your will on the game through the market if you want the ability to impact other players in the sandbox you must accept that other players will do the same to you
i simply do not see newbies farmed by suicide gankersfreighters orcas exhumers mining barges and t1 haulers are the main ships targetted by gankers of those only one requires less than a week of dedicated skilling you can sit in a battleship in less than half that timeif you want to complain about nonconsensual pvp that hits a lot of newbies you should be up in arms at two things gatecamping high to low gates especially low systems that have stations that sell skillbooks and market manipulation in rookie systems the people who are overwhelmingly the targets of highsec predators gankers wardeccers and the like are not newbies nor are they the extremely experienced player who usually has a clue they are in danger and so can use the advantages highsec gives the defender in conflicts to escape they are usually the middling experienced player we do get the odd actual newbie and i tend to give them advice to get back on their feet on laughing at failfits  i do this to older characters newer characters will instead get advice if i blow up a vindicator which mixes active and buffer armor tanks and has no web ill check the character age two months  they get advice two years  they get a minerbumping blog post mocking them as for wardec evasion  this was termed every bit as much of an exploit as concord evasion once it gives the defender an overwhelming advantage in conflicts i support some form of unilateral surrender as long as it is a surrender not a broken mechanic
which is all perfectly fine the problem is that your ideas dont respect their ability to counter you attempts to fight them on their own terms you want to force people to have to defend in combat when you attack them they dont need to thats not a requirement and it nevre should be if you choose to attack them with guns and they choose to avoid you thats also fine at no point do i want anyone to be left alone but what i dont want is people forced into having to respond in a way you choose simply because you feel they arent providing you with enough content when you attack them because they choose to avoid you altogether i dont understand why some people seem to find that such a hard concept to grasp
in fairness they may not be a newbie in terms of time played but they are a newbie in terms of experience with the game theyre targeted specifically because they dont know how to respondand now its not an exploit things change get over it it used to be possible to use dec shield alliances or shed wars too now its not possible to do eitherthe problem wit ha surrender mechanic is that it puts full control in the aggressors hands and they already generally have the vast majority of the control if that were the case there would be nothing stopping the main wardeccers deccing a corp and demanding 500m isk for example to surrender which gives them 2 weeks grace and they are back again if there were no other way out of the war besides waiting it out or not logging in it would simply get rid of most highsec corporations or cause people to quit it wouldnt suddenly make them suicide themselves for all eternity into the waiting blasters of what would definitely be a superior force
nope thats working as intendedbut i cant say the same for wardecs which is why we need to vote for sabriz to get our voices heard
yes as mentioned in my eve24 article of recent i feel use shoudl reflect and tied into distribution upgradabke systems would add value of ownership and desire to defend and fight over itanchored bubles have been removed from thera on csm wish as it would clutter the ever shitfing entrances nullified is a nice counter though and ceptors there have been petitions of overuse but in the end a cyno  a covert  black op bridge t3 ceptor are allways to make use of their sense of safety and kill em with tears incommingwhats crucial now is next sov round imo
got my votes core outstanding job mate
my favourite flight attendant
finally someone who can identify that there is more benefit in having an impact on broader ccp policies and game design rather than the specific details of an individual issue 1 for core
1 from gulnar
core might be nullprovi specific but he has a big heart for eve he wants to see people grow  enjoy the game i thank him for helping me get into pvp fleets  he speaks for the underdog in null not the power blocs  the meta game you have my vote
gday mate sorry its taken me 2 weeks to reply to this as far as the npe experience goes there is a massive problem with the way newbies are dumped into the game and left to fend for themselves the tutorials are horrible despite their apparent revamp a little while ago theyre clunky far too wordy and teach the new player to pve ccps stats show that if pve is all you ever do in the game youre going to leave very shortly that needs to change  players need to be engaging with the community in eve  which is the real drawcard anyway im confident that should i get elected there will be one guy sitting at that table saying hows that going to get more players to subscribe past their trial have you thought about how difficult that will be to explain to a new player through a tutorial window how are you going to offset the pain that someone like me is going to suffer trying to get newbies to do that im keen to get new players into this game and keen to have them stick around im confident that i will be able to assist in that occurring
i hope you mean walking in stations by wis otherwise my reply here is going to look pretty dumb i am personally a fan of walking around its a welcome change to ship spinning as i sit around reading mails and hopefully csm stuff i am disappointed that we dont have hats and id like to see some fat characters around ive played dust i have a couple million skillpoints on my brave bunnies toon and im interested to see if legion can improve on dusts strengths while avoiding its shortcomings i have a hope that one day ill be able to storm onto a supercarrier kick the capsule apart and tear the pilot apart with my bare hands or use a land based battery to annihilate a fleet in orbit or use shaped charges to blow up those irritating pi colonies that are right in the middle of the juiciest resource band im excited about valkyrie id want to play it before i decide whether or not id like to have people with that level of control on the battlefieldim a fan of more more is great more things to do more ways to have fun more ways to engage and interact id love it if we could harness all those people playing dustlegion and the hordes that will likely try valkyrie and bring them into our magnificent communityedit sorry  i missd half your question theres no language barrier theres always someone who can translate for me if my horrible french and worse japanese isnt up to the task we have some fantastic languagespecific corps and alliances in eve and their newbies are as lost as the english speakers as far as the brave language experience goes a little while ago i introduced a translation program for various things i wanted to harness newbies of all stripes regardless of their ability in english i called it the honyaku sha program and i had about a hundred volunteers for the gig some of them did some great work translating various mails and resources into their home languages and for a little while we had a channel for nonenglishspeakers to jump into it was utterly unused having said that we have people who are able to translate and interpret for us and we can pretty well guarantee that well have someone able to speak with you or your newbies thanks again
thanks cagali for this answerwe like your enthusiasm and openmindednessand are ok on your vision of thingsits a very serious diplomatic position in csmso we will first wait and see other candidates campaignand we will after ask to our organization agents to endorse some good candidateswe must confess we like two candidates at this momentand you are one of thembest regards
hey endi nice so see you running for csm i like quite a few of your blog posts and the ideas  conclusions you present therewhats your take on fatigue in its current iteration specially the fact that fatigue is global do you think theyll eventually split it up in subcapital fatigue and capital fatigue and maybe black ops fatigue because it feels like right now fatigue is too limiting it is basiclly like telling players oh you want to go on that 1900 cta of your alliance well tuff luck for you no blopsing with your corp or going rf something 2 hours before the op
bobmon has my support he is passionate about the game and you can tell this just by talking to himif he accomplishes just 10 of the issues he wishes to tackle i would be a happy manim more than sure he will be more than able to tackle all the goals he has raised so farhe will be a great asset to both the community and ccp alike when tackling the hard issues
10
i will vote for bobmon and you will too why you may ask bobmon cares about eve and client base we currently have and has epic ideas on how we can continue to grow the eve community for ccp and all of us in eve bobmon make us proudxocrice
bobmon gets my vouch all around good guy and he threw away a carrier to help me raise money for childrens hospital colorado last october
i like what he wants to do he gets my vouch
ill be voting for bobmon with all my accounts you should too hes passionate about the game and hell put in tons of underappreciated unpaid work for the community and ccp
if you want an impartial view on bobmon then here it isme and bob have had some ups and downs throughout eve being in crappy alliances together such as unclaimed  better such as nc his personality has become clear over the many years of knowing him and i honestly believe that he would want to change eve for the better this game is what he desires it is his hobby and his lovermy opinion comes from my experience of this individual and many may differ but if he were to be elected eve would benefit greatly1
good men1
so many great ideas so positive and fresh air your mentor progarm idea is probably the best and should be examined very seriously by ccp
ill say this even day trippers are wormholers chance is kind of split with the wormhole groups atm its wierd but hes on par with the other wormhole candidates minus corbexx atm you could see his as a good or bad thing just be careful trolling the wormhole forums we bite if provoked
hey everyone the latest capstable candidate review is here which includes the teams review of my interview check it out if you can starting about half an hour in
should go on dtp
1 i have been on both sides of his guns and i support this person
i wonder how many cfc candidates are genuine and how many are for meta gaming purposescan you present anything on this and other candidates
that is an interesting question and one that i can only heavily speculate on as this is my first bid for the csm and only have the minutes and commentary to go oni will say that while i am in the cfc i am not at all representing them in any capacity official or otherwise in fact aside from people finding out about my candidacy on these forums i am not mentioned anywhere in the cfcs roster as an official candidate i would be surprised if i was even incidentallyso in response to your question as it applies to me personally i have no greater agenda other than what i have already stated here and nobody pulls my strings has me by the short hairs or anything else yeah couldnt help itin terms of meta i believe in quality change that ensures we can both shape the world we live in and put our personal stamp on the things we do and build i believe this is best achieved primarily at the individual level personal motivation and rewards where teamwork and player interaction simply add value and meaning organizations are a biproduct of meeting individual goals and needs and serve to enhance quality of life they do not exist and cannot have meaning and purpose if the individuals that comprise them needs are not being met or achievedso i could absolutely care less about the meta for its own sake and understand it to simply be a biproduct of combined game mechanics played out over the vast number of individuals that contribute to the daily execution of those mechanics the meta is simply a reflection of the overall quality of design and serves to gauge the effectiveness of the mechanics applied to the single shard universe which is what makes this game great so i do not serve the meta for a set of masters but rather focus on the individuals experience and interpret the quality of change through the resulting metahope my answer helps
harry saq do you know a guy called suq madiq
it does and sounds like we have similar difficulties by pure coincidence i am in the very same corporation as corebloodbrotherscan you highlight weakness in the game design and link to possible ways they can be fixed
lol  no i am from a different lineage 
it seems that you are more of turning around what im saying and it would appear that you may be losing sight of the topic at hand and are confused about my statement so please allow me to clarifythe thread that was linked has no relevance to my statements and what he was proposing and what i am saying have yet to meet on common ground lets be intelligent about this and try to maintain some level of focus to these topics of discussion and not clutter them with confusionso in closing youll have to excuse the forthcoming awkward silence as this is a forum thread for csmx and not the forum for hijacking of threads for personal entertainment
to be honest its more something along the lines of you are running for csmx so i would like to have some honest answers on what you are promoting on the question if you have enough time since your in everadio and ssr you reply your not in thathowever when i look at voting for people to represent me i do check them out so i checked you out also and i came at a few pages like these
so your referencing a blog that i havent updated since 2013 or a twitter account that i havent kept actively kept up to date either im sorry but im not seeing how this is relevantbut im not here to debate about that to be honest i have dozens that can vouch for me on that i dont lie that is done
now allow me to clarify  give rebuttalthe thread that was linked was specifically about another csm candidate running to represent nullsec in general and his statements regarding reducing carrier jump fatigue which is one of the issues youre promoting as well for industrysince that is being critiqued there i see no use in rehashing the same discussion over  over again since it has no effect on industry i linked the thread and since that is being critiqued so well in that thread there is no need for me to comment on itthe second thread linked was another discussion in the same thread about the same point that someone else brought upif it was not relevant on topic or a hijacking of threads for personal entertainment or even a personal attack isd would have removed it as suchthat is what isd members are here to do and they have the power to remove part or all of a comment if it doesnt adhere to forum ruleswhat i have done is made valid rebuttal and testing of your knowledge response on industry as well as asked some in my opinion very good questions on your promotional platform which you have yet to give any sufficient answer toas an indy pilot i care about who is going to represent me in the csm because indy is such an integral part of the game affecting everyone whether they want to admit it or not
and in response to this you saw fit to update your dj character ingame with your csm thread yet you have not updated your ingame dj character as suchas for twitter you were just on there the other night advertising you were playing sto and you havent seen fit to update this eithermy apologies for the criticism but it again lends valid credence to the questions on your time constraints to effectively do the job at handthe only reason im concerned about this is for your own wellbeing and because if elected i want you to do a good job representing not only myself but all other indy pilots as wellso maybe you should have thought about updating that information before campaigning for csm to avoid such questions
i dislike him less compared to the others
some ideas are interesting can be good for our community 1
recently cap stables bhock sat down to interview with alyxportur the recording can be found here
im torn really i would love another wormhole candidate but my belief in how this multi box automation destroying mmos is too strong ive seen it in too many games in too many players and in too many companiesi dont play rift eq or wow anymore eq people started using buffbots second and 3rd accounts that follow their main around buffing and healing them daoc had that bad for a while wow alterac valley had almost entire 40 man parties of solo man boxing accounts 1 wow account was enough ive seen what was originally social mmos turn into soloist wastelands heck the only reason i like project 1999 is their total anti boxing rules if i had to choose between voting yes for you as a wormhole candidate or voting no because of your multiboxing input broadcast and automation stance i will have to vote noeven if it meant losing a wormholer csm spot i would lose it to keep all broadcast input automation isboxing functionality out of this game even if it meant a total ban on any and all screen monitoring software fine ill buy another monitor i dont want eve to go down the road that so many mmos have i fear that your prospects of being a viable wormhole csm member is at risk due to the multiboxer stancegood luck on the run
its not automation its replication theres a difference and to be quite honest why does it affect you if someone else is replicating input if you see 20 guys mining or 20 alts mining what difference does it make if someone wants to consume 50 plex a month and keep ccp rolling in cash im all for it only when it becomes botting or get used for rmt do i carethat said angrod seems to be in agreement with keeping the changes to isboxer rules in what he wants is more communication between ccp and the multiboxing community which i fully agree with personally none of the csm would take on that task when the changes were announced and people had questions and ccp gave people the runaround with the forum telling them to make a petition and the petitions telling them to post on the forum if an when ccp make further changes to multiboxing rules id like to know theres someone who will raise the concerns of what is quite a substantial section of the playerbase with ccp even if the end result is the same
hi im gorga im running for csm xi had a really long post written out for this talking about how and what the csm does and why running on some enormous platform pushing on lots of changes isnt the way to be honest about what you do  i decided to shorten everything up for you i will give you some background on myself as some of my rl and eve experiences and how they may relate to my csm term i will also answer any reasonable question basically an amaive been playing eve at a very large scale for a long time now i am the ceo of s2n and a major leadership figure in n3 we dont really subscribe to the leaderfollower mantra coalition of willingfriends i have a lot of experience with eve at a large scale as well as how player interaction player groups and many other out of game and in game mechanisms work i have a hand in many different elements both in and out of the game as many major decision makers do ive also been involved pretty heavily with pvp theory crafting fleet composition design power projection manufacturing pos management sov management money management and a slew of other things i think my experience in all of these fields doesnt make me an expert in any of them i know my limitations and where to draw the line on my expertise thats where my rl and its intersection with eve comes into play i have a lot of rl experience leading and contributing to teams both large and small from my work i additionally now am employed in a networksystems engineering position where i must be able to utilize my skill set to assist in the configurationdesignmanagement of large and small networks i also rely on others to supplement my known weaknesses to ensure that our customers needs are met all of this will help me to contribute to the team in any meaningful way possiblei also will make every effort read as my rl schedule allows to be as open and transparent about the csm process as the nda will allow i am not some major blogger nor do i have my own news source but i think its important that the players have some insight towards the csm and as such i can say that i have an agenda item to run on thats directly game related i would work with the csm towards some sort of disclosure schedule where we would open up about whatever we can on a regular frequent basisi also tend to be quite responsive towards direct personal communication you can tweet me at gorgaeve or send me an evemail if you would like to discuss something in private or have some sort of feedback i will also monitor and respond to everything i can in this thread up to and through the csm electionshopefully thats not too long winded and i didnt lose your attention also sorry about the late notice proceed with the amai will update this post with any additional important questions that have been answered
give me 3 reasons why i should vote you over progod
first he makes progod look dumb there gorga started you offalso with the entire corp named after him give him a chance at minimum
hes not runninghes not running andhes not runningserious answer to troll question is he is amazingly good at pvp rebalancing pvp things focusing purely on pvp and all things surrounding that i am not quite that focused on one individual thing i can contribute to that discussion and drive some of the points there but im not the end all be all i can help contribute to a wider range of topics with far more expertiseim far more capable of maintaining focus and i can multitask a whole heck of a lot better than he canim much better at communicating information and taking feedback im not really very egotistical and self centered which is an oddity for the role i play in the game i of course have an ego but i can fit in the room with progod a feat not to be underestimated
maybe it should be mentioned that gorga was not at the meeting where the corp name was chosen so it is not arrogance but more of a tribute to him which should say something
youre a little too late there champ unless you got your application and all your documents in before posting this of course
i have no questions the original post is too vague and full of placating language
i did
thanks for missing the point the csm doesnt get a platform to effect direct innovation thats not what the job entails you point out balance issues or discuss changes ccp is making but you dont sit there and come up with your own platform of details that you want to change or make happen im not going to make some pandering waste of time post talking about all the grand things i would change in eve or try to change as a csm because thats not what the csm is doingwhat i would do is end up being a voice and a sanity check for the changes that ccp proposes i wouldnt be the guy that goes i would change it this way but instead i can use my experience in the game to represent the position of players in general and help ccp correct changes that would negatively disrupt many types of gameplay maybe now you understand why its pointless to have a platform in a situation like this because thats just petty political theater you dont get a platform when youre in the csm you dont have the option to just radically stand on specific positions you must relate changes to the current game your understanding of mechanics and player interaction and come up with adjustments  or outright kill some changes in the planning stage to be replaced with other ideasthe reason why i think that i would do a good job are laid out im good at working in a team environment taking and adjusting to feedback working at a high pace and i enjoy the kind of things that are laid out as csm tasks i dont mind making and reporting items to the community i enjoy thinking about high level problems and working as a group to overcome themi dont have a laundry list of crap that omg pvpeeee in lowsec is broken lets fix this thing guys back me and ill force ccp to fix this guys do my list of things i would like to see is extensive but im not running because i want to see a lot of changes im running because i think i can help ccp make the best decisions as to how they would relate to a large portion of the player base
since progodlegend is not running are you the official nulli candidate
hello rosewalker yes i have submitted my paperwork to appear on the ballotand yes you are correct that most incursion runners stay in small 1 man corps i feel that maybe ccp could possibly invest in an isk sink that would allow corporations to pay to be unwardeccable but this mechanic would need lots of investigation to not be abused by major corps and alliances for the mean time i am happy with the tools that ccp has provided to allow communities of noncorp members to develop and be maintainedi am well aware of the strains that serving on the csm will put on me and i am fully dedicated to investing the time needed to ensure that the voice of highsec is heard as loud as possibleif i could pick only one i would have to say mike he is a really swell guy who put a lot of time in trying to help highsec over the last couple years
hey candidatesive just sent you your vote match login details vote match is a website that matches voters to candidates who share their opinions and views on eve online and it is used by thousands of voters every election to help make their choicethe website will go public on february 24th while you can fill out your profile after that time you risk losing out on votes as such i urge you to complete your profile sooner rather than later also make sure not to forget the questionnaire see the big blue button at the top of the page after loggin ingood luck to everyone in this election and dont hesitate to contact me if you have questions or problems
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh more to write
can csm members promote this idea  so we can have one issue solved capital combat ships divide by 2 base types  dps logisticdps are dreads in order to boost their damage they need to use siege module that enhances their dps output at the cost tracking scan resolution and especially ability to receive remote reps logistic are carriers like dreads they can boost their logistic abilities by using triage module that have also similar rule  while module is active ship cannot receive remote aid overall this looks like good balance still players proved that ccp was wrong in this assumption in case of carriers currently one of the eve major issues are carrier blobs that abuse ability to provide remote aid to whole fleet without triage as while keeping their full offensive potential and ability to refit on field they can also provide logistic support to other ships without triage this way 200 man carrier fleet means ability to  deploy up to 2000 fighters drop up to 2000 sentry drones mount up to 400 smartbombs  base concepts use 2 per carrier mount up to 400 heavy neutswhile at the same time still keeping ability to provide remote aid from up to 597 capital remote aid modules to a single member of the fleet because of this amount of ships needed just to brake this remote tank  and then slowly chew multi million ehp is so immense that it requires extreme blob of sub capitals supported by capital ships usually counter fleet have to be so immense that soul crushing lag will occur it is very simple way to solve this issue as the issue is connected to capital remote aid systems proposal is to  remove bonus they get from hull without triage module active reduce their base abilities to match large versions  boost triage module bonuses to counter those nerfsthanks to those changes the only viable way to use capital remote aid systems will be by using triage module with all the benefits and cons that come with this module without changing how the carriers behave in triage
if you say it enough
i will just leave this here in hopes of the nessage getting across
im sorry i used an example same applies to any ship that is getting webbed just lock faster than the webber simple unless you mean instawarping a hauling ship without a webber which is much much slower and can easily be ganked regardless
your idea  nothing says hey guys im hauling expensive stuff i dont want you to see like a module to hide from cargo scans
yep that was my idea alright
does repeating a dumb idea make it any less dumbi dont think so
hello alli am writing to you today in outrage that ccp is releasing my personal ship to the masses and did not bother to consult me as the diplomatic shuttle i firmly believe that i should have early access to the bpc because i am the official diplomat 1 if you agree this is an atrocity and should be rectifiedofficial diplomat
i have elected you for csm 9 and going to do the same for csm x i am happy that the new industry ui have saved me lots and lots of clicks however removing production efficiency skill and reducing skill requirements to build high end t2 ships were antiindustry updates simply because they are killing the uniqueness of manufacturing profession and i wish i am not going to see more new alts have an easy access to train and build the t3 destroyers anytime sooni hope you prevent ccp from doing this again and would be better if new features and skills are added to industry to distinguish manufacturers from other eve players
to initially get into industry it should be easy production efficiency was a bad skill because there was no choice involved at all just have it at 5 or gtfo when it came to pretty much any industryhowever i dont want to see industry any more flattened than it is already and would argue against any changes in that direction
purely out of curiosity would you be in support of active gameplay mechanics which improved your production simple example missions to speed up a run in progress or would you want industry to remain primarily a passive activityjust a note im really not sure which way i would go on it so im not aiming towards one answer or another
gah nice question my gut feel response is remain passive for the actual production step we already have issues with production speed so either those get worse or you have to cripple it without the boostunless you worked on a you have x production units per facilityslot these normally get used over 24 hours but an activity can cause them to be used faster so your overall production is the same speed but you can accelerate bits of it would have to be at a character level
what about some industry class mission much like security distribution etc which when completed granted an additional production slot for a while then you arent messing with material efficiency or time efficiency with their perils youre just upping the characters number of slots for a whilemdd
it is enjoyable to point and laugh
you know in addition to not addressing hard questions you also spend a remarkable amount of time trying to police how people ask you questions this sort of attempt to control the narrative never comes off well in real elections and i dont think its doing you any favors here either
many thousands know my glorious and prestigious name im lord vaari from noble house of valius im earl of sosan vii founder and despot of the imperial pharmacy golden mountain self proclaimed prophet worlds most beloved hero ecumenical patriarch of the silent infinity and many more i like to become csm so i venerated lord vaari can bring the voice of small corporations industrialists and faithfull into the table and break the dominance of pirates and hexers to me outlook is very important i wish to see more medallions with more ability to modify them i wish to see other kind of awards like clothe patches and armbands i also have to be able to strip them away if bearer becomes unworthy to have them i also wish to see how my members put those awards on them and see those medallions and other awards in their clothes i wish to have more contoll to my corporation i wish to have more means to tax my members current general tax is sufficent but i also want to be able to make individual taxes for example superrich members would pay more taxes i also want infinite number of slots to put diplomatic relations i want much more clothes into nex i want hundreds of pieces of clothes starting from boots and ending nice hats most clothes must be cheap or easily affordable but there should also be extremely prestigious peaces who make monocles look mere trinkets
1 on so many different levels
great post vaari and nice campaign start hope to see you in the next csm
some nice ideas about posses 
gevlon from the greedy goblin blog has published his csm x recommendation list today give it a read
your suggestion about alts is one of the key things that is wrong with this game and your reasoning around it detailed in the post here is spot on that in itself means you have my vote blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
thank you i know this aspect of my campaign is vigorously attacked andor dismissed and i appreciate hearing voices that support my choices in the matter
two good articles i stumbled upon today bring up the subject of toxicity in the community
that is something on which i agree with you o7
excuse me if i dont take your word for it ive read james articles before and the only thing it did was waste part of my lifeyes im well aware of trammel something that happened years before uos peak player count yet for some reason takes blame from some old players for the downfall of the game i dont really buy it to be honest beside the fact that the game went on to grow significantly for years following trammel it was also a separate world so would have no actual impact on the hardcore world the only thing it would influence is how much people cried because someone else was playing the same game but easiertell me do you get upset when you play a game in very hard while someone else plays it in very easy do you write letters to the developer demanding your money back because everyone should have the experience you have or not have it at all no you dont nobody sane does that would be ridiculous so why would it matter if an mmo had 2 different style of worldthat said nobody is advocating trammel in eve mike just wants people who play the way they play and enjoy it to keep that style of play too many people want to force them to have to defend themselves with guns which they dont want to do forcing someone to play the game your way is just as bad as forcing you to play it their way theres room for a multitude of playstyles in eve and keeping that room is all we want
mike part of ccps seaguls vision was about players having a home in eve what does this mean to you
it is hard to argue with such a well presented piece or at least i havent seen any real attempts other than those rejecting it based on the author or just putting their head in the sand and claiming no problem exists however ccp is the only ones with the numbers to show what we all suspect  players are increasingly moving back to highsec or using highsec alts to make their living in safety and that this is contributing to the stagnation and low population of the other spaces so mike ccp seagull has presented us with a grand vision of playerbuilt stargates and increased player conflict which many speculate will involve new maybe jove space perhaps this question isnt fair as you have signed a nda but what do you think is the best way to get a significant amount of the player base to move to or use this space i can only imagine if things are left as the status quo no one aside from a few large null entities will move in and this expansion will be deemed a failurei know you have made some efforts to get new players out of highsec and pvping but you must admit that the near riskfree and significant income potential of highsec is tempting for established players to come back to and grind an income without hurting casual or new players do you think there is anything that can be done to discourage this grinding behaviour on the part of established players and encourage them to move their home somewhere riskier than highsec like perhaps this new space when it becomes accessible
its like the boy who cried wolf because hes written practically pure sperg since the beginning of time people wont generally sit there and read through 10 pages to find out if its crap for me i took one look at the subject and the author and can be reasonably certain it will be more crying about how terrible and themepark eve is becomingsurely this is something you should know though i live in nullsec i moved all but a tiny fragment of my alts out of highsec long ago so i dont know why pvpers live in highsec but your group lives in highsec so surely you know why it is that you choose to sit in highsec ganking industrial ships rather than go into other parts of the game and fight people who shoot back id wager its much the same reason carebears like highsec  low commitment low risk high reward easy access to trade hubs so what would it take for you to be coaxed out of highsec
home is a place you care about that you will defend and work at improving at least that is what i see it to be mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
he wanted you to talk about wis
so people should be allowed to counter ganking by being afk and making poor fitting decisions like it or not thats essentially what youre sayingwe would love to see the people who choose to resist us by force be provided with support in their efforts avoiding us is also a perfectly valid tactic one that is already extremely effective i would gladly support any changes that made active defense against ganking more successful but i would not support any changes that made passive defense against us more successful
when did i ever say that im certainly not advocating passive defense in this particular instance were not even talking ganking were talking wardecs i dont believe a wardec should lock you in and force you to fight with guns to get outand i agree people should use decently fit ships ecm drones and evasion to not get ganked that said i think ganking is too static i like black pedros idea that concord response times should vary for example so sometimes you only get 10 secs sometimes you get 50 for example i also think the shocking overuse of catalysts highlights a balance issue there id like to see a larger variety of ships and fits able to be used for various reasons at no point will you ever find me saying that ganking should be removed or passive defense should be the way forward hell i want freighters to be given more active and less passive defense methods specifically because they are too passiveso yeah if thats what youve managed to get from what ive said you very much misunderstand i just dont think every situation needs to be resolved by fighting it out with guns some players dont like that playstyle and thats ok
your suggestions on war decs are stupid you talk about locking people into conflicts that they have no fun doing no interest and no reward so they either stay docked or go play another game for a week possibly deciding not to bother at all and yet your carrots are a few extra percentages of yield big deal what a complete idiotif you want people to fight against war decs then give them the benefit of immunities from war decs based on how many hits they get on enemies and how many kills they get and then add that up and apply a block to all new war decs and then a block from that to the value of the benefit from fighting then there is value in fighting against a war dec even giving them blocks of time for going out in space and not being cloaked blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
im just sayin
thank you for agreeing with me blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
well then i withdraw my objections in this particular instance i apologize for misinterpreting your stance if you happen to make it to fanfest in 2016 id love to sit down over coffee with you and discuss these sorts of topics in person im buyingas for the freighters i do not disagree with you they are and should be easily killed when their pilot is incompetent or lazy they should stand a chance when their pilot takes precautions im of the opinion that they currently are at that point though im open to discussion on the topic as for wardecs if there are ideas on how a defender could contribute to a war besides getting into a combat ship and fighting head on or guerrilla style im all ears thats not sarcasm id actually love to hear any ideas along those lines
sounds like a plan i was there last year and am there this year so all likelihood will be there 2016 too so youre oni think on precautions they are there but thats all they have once they are in the fight they are sitting there waiting for the gankers and their escorts to duke it out id love to take some of the passive defense away lowering their tank and give them some form of actively defending themselves be it some kind of ecm pulse which doesnt make concord go nuts or something else havent really considered it enough to go into great detail but the idea would be that if you are afk you are pretty likely to get pasted but if you are there defending the gankers have to put in considerably more effort ideally id want it to be than a perfect fit afk freighter takes about half the gankers it currently does while a perfect fit active one takes 15  2x on averagefor wardecs i really dont know what can be done working with the current system id be really tempted to consider going back to the drawing board altogether and looking at a system which causes wardeccers to fight over space and inspace assets on a smaller and more flexible scale than things like sov with industry players playing a support role on either side when rvb and the merc groups went all out over pocos that was some great content and id love to see more of that kind of things and less of i crush you because you cant do anything about it
core has been awesome and im looking forward to another year of him in the csm 1
core has done great things this term not the loudest voice but one of the most if not the most diligent and hardworking core for csm 10 11111
you have my vote core good luck
keep up the good work core1 vote
the csm is all about debating and thinking about the consequences coming with changes to work properly it needs different ways of thinking just imagin the csm would consist of only pl people that own a titan everytime somthing is going on their first thought would be how would that affect my titanplaystyle and just like the csm needs a member thinking this way it needs someone from the other side and for me thats corebloodbrothers he is the representative of the nrds coalition and in my opinion as needed as representatives of the other faces new eden has and if the other csm member dont like him for his ideas  point he stands its one more pro arguement for him different convictions lead to more discussion lead to better possible outcomemy vote for core for more variety in the csm
you have my vote core its important to have a variety of nullsec play styles represented in the csm good luck
you have my vote
so i just asked corbexx for a in 10 seconds or less whod you like to work with next year the most and your name came up and thats good enough to get you a place on my balot for me
thanks for the support palli
in the latest capstable candidate review i notice that one of the remarks was i wasnt very polished i am not a politician i would rather people vote for me based off of who i am and what i have communicated not how i communicated i am not interested in kissing the voters ass to get them to vote for me i will however try to win you over through superior ideas my knowledge of the game and my experience
i am voting for bob mainly because he used some weird crowns on his csm thread title  U265BU265B i mean how cool is that i didnt knew those existedohh yeah hes cool vote him on first placebobmon for csm xps U265B U265B U265B riverini  evenews24 evenews24
bobmon has my voteknown him for a few years now and he has proven to be extremely dedicated to every job and responsibility that he takes on and accepts
ill be voting for my friend and corpmate bobmonhes a fair and trustworthy guy who genuinely loves eve
honestly i think you are perhaps the strongest npe centric candidate and your perspective as an informed newbro will prove to be valuable during the upcoming csm term good luck to you
so what are your thoughts on capstables evaluation of your interview how would you see ccp involving youtube channels to promote eve would they be getting an advanced character items ships what kind of incentive would ccp be giving them
khador obviously i know that you have a rl career that takes you all over the globe and often at very short notice how will you reconcile this with the requirements of the csm role should you be successful in earning a seat
iUFFFDll vote for you i like exploring its a good thing to do  and yep there is pi as a newbro i would like to see some kind of tutorial agent for this what do you thinko7
ill cast a vote for you we need more people with a fresh perspective and a campaign with a unique angle in particular i like your ideas on ccp lore integration with player lore and from the looks of recent activities by ccp i believe they have a similar mindset for this reason alone you deserve a seat on the council as i believe your contributions would be valuable considering the implied trajectory of the game during this coming csm term
youve got my vote hopefully ill be able to run against you next year
bump for thoric csm 10

citri be sure youve get my vote and by the way gibts die stille gewalt flotten noch wUFFFDrde gerne mal wieder mitfliegen
i will amend thismy suggestion is to add a function where players gain a timer that affects the reactivation delay for cloaks afk cloaking needs a fix so that a player isnt completely invulnerablyjust as offgrid t3 boosts are not completely invulnerable though difficult to find

name janwa reshcorporation center for advanced studiesprimary focuses exploration miningindustry pve highsec  pvp nullsecgreetings fellow capsuleers some of you may have talked with me in cas chat fleet chat with the cas crew in nullsec or even in local space in highsec id like to give you a bit of background on myself and what i feel are areas i may be able to bring some focus to as a csmi as a player have off and on been playing through various accounts eve online for 10 years and nearly 11 months ive seen many of the changes that have swept through eve over the years both good and bad janwa was a character i started a bit over 4 12 years ago but had to leave after a while due to rl issues that couldnt be avoided which i returned to in december of 2014 since the return ive spent many hours relearning the controls play styles and idiosyncrasies of eve online gameplay ive spent nearly as many hours rereading lore watching players videos and live streams and perusing blogs and websites dealing with eve gameplayover the last 20 years ive been involved in game testing quality assurance and in a few instances development change planning for various mmos and rpgs that have hit the market from ultima online to star wars the old republic from earth  beyond to dragon age inquisitor ive spent large periods of time finding bugs and helping fix them finding serious imbalances and helping adjust them into balance all with the goal of making game play more fun for the players who will partake of the effort of development these are skills that took years to develop and i see eve online as the perfect place to set them to work againquite often i hear people complain about how hard it is to learn to play eve how the learning curve isnt a curve its a slippery wall while others are turned off by ganking griefing and a perceived sociopathic player base and still others yet that complain that eve is boring its grindy its all the same stuff over and over again id like to put my experience into play helping to resolve those things change those things and help find ways to bridge the gaps that hold back players from going past their trials to a subscription or plexing game timeplatform keypoints each point will be covered in additional posts1 working to undo years of bad word of mouth publicity2 addition of new modularmobile structures ties into 33 revamping of pos mechanics ties into 24 addressing the new player experience5 developing events in which players help shape the lore of new eden and are not just bystandersother areas i feel need attention1 sov mechanics2 wormhole space3 inclusivity of new eden lore4 bringing in functionality from 3rd party programs such as eft into the main client as well as fixing some bugs in the fitting window5 skill trainingattributes overhaul or revamp6 interface updating and ease of useintuitive feel work on the interfacemenu systemupdate 222ive been hearing a number of new players issue about trying to find various things in the menu structures of eve contracts being an example i agree that sometimes finding things in the menu system is a pain and that the interface overall might need some work to make it more intuitive so im adding this to my other areas i feel need attention list
platform keypoint 1working to undo years of bad word of mouth advertisingthis in my opinion will be the hardest thing to do when it comes to eve online with years of people leaving due to so many reasons from horrible tutorials making learning to play a job in and of itself to people who have been ganked griefed or left feeling that eve is a place the psychopaths go to play those experiences shape the way people look at eve whether they decide to try the game through a trail account or simply refuse to play at alleve has many avenues of play available to many to list quickly and a great many people of all walks of life and outlooks playing it but take a quick look on youtube or other video sharing sites for eve videos and what do you find the majority to be solo gank pvp small gang pvp blob fleet pvp and a mix of tutorial videos which are in large part outdated and a few of ccps own trailer videos and some podcasts basically a small fragment of what eve is but narrowed to a sliver of pvp ganking and commentaryadmittedly a large number of players love pvp admittedly commentary and tutorials are a good thing but commentary without context is just words tutorials that are outdated are of limited use and for players that arent interested in blob fleet pvp its a turn off to see video after video with purple blob vs orangered blobwhat we need is more advertising which shows the full range of things that can be done in eve from exploration to industry to faction warfare to pve missioning we need more self policing to help remove the stigma of eve is all about ganking and griefing we need more positive publicity to show how great eve is to bring about the change in image that eve has built up over years of word of mouth advertisingi believe it is possible to reverse this bad image in the general mindset of eve by those not playing and those who are playing trials and thinking of leaving but it wont be easy it wont be quick and it wont happen without the csms devs and players working to remake the image of eve
platform keypoint 2addition of new modularmobile structuresthe introduction of the mobile depots and mobile tractor units changed gameplay in fun and interesting ways they gave players a home away from home with functionality that helped expand gameplay they allowed for making missioning easier through the automated collection of lootwrecks all of this makes for impressive increases in playability of eve onlinebut it could be expanded it probably should be expandedmy thoughts comprise this why stop with the mobile depot why not expand on the concept and bring in another tier of mobile structures that can be added to in order to increase their use beyond refitloot hordetemporary basei want to work on developing the next tier of mobile structures structures which allow for addition of expansion modules to give further functionality to the mobile structure shield modules repair modules refining modules lab modules the list goes on these mobile structures and their modules would be a middle step between living out of an npc starbase structure and a pos giving adaptive functionality without having to deal with sovereignty massive fuel requirements though i would like these proposed structures to use some fuel while letting poss shine as the top tier for player owned structuresive seen many wanting changes to pos mechanics and i agree that pos management is clunky convoluted and seriously in need of revamp a new tier of mobile structures would be a good place to start those changes giving new options to players as well as allowing development of new code and systems for player owned structures overall
platform keypoint 3revamping of pos mechanicsover the years ive heard a lot of complaints about pos management how its unwieldy clunky and at times very buggy to deal with ive personally had 2 poss over the times ive played eve and can say that much like corporation management pos management is a major pain in the buttwith the outdated interfacemenu structures nonintuitive setup and other things being a detractor for some to even think of working with a pos i agree pos mechanics need worked on badly and as i stated in keypoint 2 one way to work on that would be to make an intermediate tier of structures that fall between the mobile depot and the poswhile making an intermediate tier of structures wouldnt immediately fix pos issues it would allow for development on new systems to replace the legacy systems poss use in the long run that could be a better way to work on it than trying to do a bottom up or top down revamp of the pos systems a parallel system of management that could be eventually adapted to replace existing pos management systems
platform keypoint 4addressing the new player experienceim pretty sure at this point that no one would say that eve has a tutorial that is engaging fun and excitingim also pretty sure at this point that most people would call eves tutorial a word walli remember a time in which aura read the lines of the tutorial text to you it was great to hear fun even made the whole thing less bland and remoteeve needs a much more engaging and fun tutorial experience that covers more than the pure basics the tutorial needs clarification simplification and expansion to areas not currently coveredthe career agents need expanded to further advanced areas covering those unexplained skills and mechanics a few examples of things needed to be covered include nanite paste overheating use of pos setting up management etc rd overview setupeve is one of the worse games ive played when it comes to the new player experience with massive text wall blocks from aura that after a bit many just turn off causing them to rely on other players to help them learn which in turn brings about confusion as a new player doesnt necessarily understand where you are attempting to tell them to click on something or do somethingid like to help get the new player experience out of the word wall it is and into a place where it is engaging fun and teaches without feeling like a massive cliff climb learning curve
platform keypoint 5developing events in which players help shape the lore of new eden and are not just bystanderseve online has quite a bit of lore and events which have shaped new eden sadly the capsuleers have been on the sidelines for most of those things mentioned alluded too even treated as feared enemies but how many capsuleer players have really had an effect on the shape and course of new eden not manyid like to bring players events which can and do shape the course of new eden which drive the story forward towards whatever is ahead wherein players can feel they really are shaping new eden with their contributionseves players deserve to feel that what they do really can shake the foundations of the empires that they really are the demigods moving through the aether of new eden
there are many areas that could use work in eve every player has something they would like changed fixed revamped overhauled adjusted thats normal in any game but in a sandbox like eve even small changes can take a lot of timeas a csm i feel i could bring the keypoints i lined out into focus as well as other areas in which players feel things could be done better id like to be able to help bring about those positive changes which will make eve even better i cant promise anything more than that i will give my absolute best effort to help bring about the changes that can make eve the best possible gaming experience for its playersthank you feel free to ask any questions and ill definitely answer them if i canjanwa resh
why have you been in an npc corp for 5 years and what is your response to people who say that npc corps should be for trialbrand new accounts only
i am
as the leader of s2n you are responsible for guiding the overall direction of our alliance with major sov changes presumably on the horizon you are responsible for implicitly and explicitly predicting potential outcomes and taking action to position s2n favorablyas a csm member you would know at least to some extent the direction s2n should be moving however you would be ethically and legally bound to not act on this information when mittani decided to not seek reelection he cited the conflict of interest and his inability to be the leader gs deserved while serving as a csm member do you envision the conflicting demands hamstringing your effectiveness in your role with s2n and n3
good question not an easy answerthe best way to put it is that you have to divorce yourself from the situation as a player between the csm and what you know and can act upon in eve much of the information there is not actionable and will clearly impact my ability to be the best decision maker for our alliance and coalition we absolutely benefit much more from my impact on the shape of changes to come the chances for things to overlap are absolutely there which is when i must know to not allow my responsibility for s2nn3 to come before my responsibility for the game there are some explicit legalities at play and i am credentialed irl in a related industry that would absolutely be ruined by me sharing this sort of information and the revelation of this disregard of the ndathe best way to put it is that i could absolutely not be capable of acting on things directly and may need to delegate some decision making if the topic may result in an ndad item being disclosed inadvertently or acted uponthe sov changes will be out in a devblog im sure at some point in the near future
from my own dealings with gorga i can say hes a measured and considered decision maker and im really hoping hell be part of the csm team next term if theres someone who can work successfully with a room full of egos and still get  done its gorgai mean look at the people hes in charge of in nulli and n3 command
if he can herd nulli cats csm is nothing 1
dont take this personal or an attack on you directly gorga but i honestly think that the csm in its current state of operations is nothing more than rubbishit appears to many players to be just another way for nullblock leaders to sway power in their favor and or get a jump start on countering upcoming changes so the nullblock they are apart of doesnt lose any groundi have read so many csm candidates platforms and whatnots that they all sound the same however you are the first person to actually come into this circus and admit they wont be campaigning for radical changes to the structure of the game force players in certain parts of new eden to endure more riskisk factors or rally to move the major portions of content to their owned spacei wish you well in your journey and task you to look out for us little guys  the ones that just want to log in have fun and not care about politics
the main failure with regards to the csm is the perception that they can actually make changes to the game they all campaign about how theyre going to fix this or that when in actuality they have neither the option nor the power to fix anything in the game the csm are a group of consultants a sounding board for ccp to speak with about upcoming changes and get an opinion from people who arent employees of ccp gorga understands this role and isnt going to feed you all a bunch of horse to get votes i cant think of a better person to be giving reality checks to ccp
still it would be pretty nice to get another look at jump fatigue and maybe banning russians from stain for like 12 months and force them to actually go elsewhere for once in their lives can ccp do that
vouch
so im not going to bother reading any of your campaign promises since even if elected you people wont ever get the power to implement your vision of eve your getting elected as a consultant not developer so my question for you is how would you consult say ccp tells the csm that they are planning on introducing something thats a bad idea for the game at large for example old aoe doomsday weapon and old type of titan returns removing all chat channels except private messaging hails making all stations in high sec destructible the introduction of a suicide frigate that deals 100k omni damage in a 500m ball devs insert bad idea here what would your approach be as far as turning a bad idea into something that actually works for the game
thanks for your interest in the csmdont forget to vote
ill respond to this quite simply by saying if ccp wants to do it they will do it our job will not be to tell them how to develop but to advise when asked and help tweak ideas for the masses if they want to bring back titans to aoe doomsday gods then theyll have reasons alot of what ifs will solve nothing and not get you any closer to finding who to vote for the key to finding a candidate for you is to look at those campaign threads and decide based on if their playstyle and logic match yours check out my podcast my blog
we can tell ccp its a bad idea and show the possible alternatives or adjustments but if ccp decides to go ahead anyway theres nothing that can be done hopefully ccp would tone it down
 i have regular experience running a posnoyes i have lived in a posyes i have managed a posthe latter two seem orthogonal i could conceivably answer yes to both of them but one is not a superset of the other or vice versa is it too late to revise this question
good point but unfortunately yes it is too late pick whichever one you feel applies most to you and feel free to add an explanatory comment with your answer
is there a way to remove a person from being applicable under one of the vote match sections there is one specifically i and others has concerns about i doubt he has a chance in hell of winning but the guy doesnt do what he is alleging he is doing im more curious of the stance of candidates falsifying both their experience and their voting block such as highsec candidate who says they have 100 experience in lowsec when they dont and i mean absolutely has zero experience outside of avoiding the systems in totaljust curious really
phoenix is referring to bane cortex who is clearly not a wormhole candidate and running on that platform wormholers are advised to not vote for him and to ignore any lolable posting that may result from his campaignthat said corbexx is the wormholer everyone should vote for and thats about all i can disclose from my wh super pac advisory board at this time pthanks dierdra for doing this each year youre great
not really ultimately i cant police or verify if what the candidates fill in is actually sincere or correct you can hide the candidate from your own match results if you like however
why radu is getting my vote eve is a game where scamming and trolling is an art that is encouraged one thing not found a lot in eve is integrity however that is the one thing that is needed more than anything in a csm memberi have read the whole thread the detail of the arguments are not as important to me as the responses and radu has responded at all times in a manner that shows his integrity if he doesnt know or is unsure he will put his hands up and say so not try to politician bluff his way through if he does know  he will put his point across but will listen and respond to the arguments not blindly push a line he come across as someone that if a compelling enough argument is put forward he will change his views he does this at al times in a polite and civil mannerthat again is what i am looking for from a csm member the willingness to listen to an argument take on the views and adjust an outlook accordinglylastly radu is a director of a well respected corps one that sticks by it values my only concerns and i hope that radu can address this with his thoughts is he doesnt seem to be that interested in the null sec sov issue i would like to hear any thoughts he has on how small amd medium size can hope to attain sov in decent null sec without renting of one of the majors and how them smallmedium size alliances can impact more effectively on the huge power blocs sov

im in about 5 agreement with the opeve is becoming increasingly polarized between the carebears and the pirates once upon a time corps typically had a mix of pvpfocused players and industryfocused players who would work together for each others benefit haulers had escorts mining ops had security and lowsec industrial poss had defenders now this is rarely found outside of nulsec where its a practical necessity but in empire space these two groups have little reason to work together the industrialists are focused on iskhour and have no desire to build anything other than to sell on the market the pvpers want to pad their killboards and have no interest in sitting around guarding a bunch of shiny mining ships when they could just as easily gank said ships and get their killmails that way im not saying that its completely gone from empire space but it is in decline things are drifting towards creatorsvsdestroyerspeople play eve for different reasons many are driven by the primal desire to clash and match wits with other human beings they love the thrill of combat and the adrenalin rush that comes with risking and fighting over things of value and consequence others are driven by the primal desire to make things they love turning barren rocks floating in space into beautiful functional spaceships and wish to bring civilization to where there is none i am of the second type i heard about the massive fleet battles involving thousands of players and the vast complex player driven economy behind it but what really sparked my interest was the backstory about humanity reaching out through the stars through a wormhole to a distant region of space to where there was nothing by emptiness and asteroids and not only having to make due but thriving i understand and respect the other type of gameplay and would quite happily build you ships and weapons to further it but its not for me i prefer to have my pvp of the fps variety when i got into eve i was a bit disappointed to find that everything that needed to be explored discovered researched invented and built has already been explored discovered researched invented and built this is no minecraft in space but thats a rant for another postwhen you think of what makes eve great you probably think of the legendary battles between player empires in nulsec these are what make headlines and gaming history but whats important to the current discussion is that they build any fly their own fleets of capital and subcapital ships and destroy them in the great melees that make the new eden economy go round the key point here is that its creatordestroyervscreatordestroyer this is the defining characteristic of a healthy new edencreatorsvsdestoryers sucks for everyone it sucks for the carebears of obvious reasons and while it may initially be fun for the pirates it cause their victims to cry and scream until ccp starts rolling out nerf after nerf to highsec pvp not good what needs to happen is for ccp to nudge these groups towards cooperation with each other for mutual benefiti honestly dont know how to make that happen but i think a good place to start would be recognize the defining quality of a healthy eve online alliance that members as a whole create and destroy in approximately equal amounts groups that mostly do one or the other are not healthy most individuals are biased strongly in one direction or the other as would most subsidiary corporations of alliances and thats fine but the group of players who have agreed to generally not shoot one another be it alliance or large independent corp should be balanced
split post damn character limiti think the first step in promoting this is for the server to keep a running tally of all that each player creates and destroys the creation side would consists of the sum total isk value of what they mine pull from moon and planets loot from npc wrecks purchase from lp stores salvage and the delta for any material conversion they do ore refining manufacturing reprocessing etc the destruction side would consists of the hulls blown up fittings and cargo that dont survive and anything they trash there are other minor factors but they are insignificant compared to the major ones the data from all players within an alliance or independent corp would then be aggregated and shown in their alliance information as graphical indicator i imagine two colored bars blue and red stretching from the opposite sides of the window and meeting somewhere in the middle the ratio of blue to red would indicate the balance between creation to destruction that members of the alliance have engaged in data for individual characters or subsidiarity corps may be shown privatively but shouldnt appear publicly as it would only distract from what is important there might also be a historical graph that shows this balance as a function of time imagine a sawtooth graph which shows a gradual trend toward the creation side and then a sharp swing towards the destruction side representing a huge battle and a lot of stuff getting blown upthe next step would be social it should be recognized that alliances with a good balance are healthy and should be looked upon positively alliances or independent corps which show mostly blue with a tiny bit of red principally carebears and those which show mostly red with a tiny bit of blue principally pirates should be looked down upon equally this would hopefully create a desire for highly unbalanced alliances to recruit and assimilate players and smaller corporations of the type needed to bring balance once that starts happening then perhaps well see more carebears building stuff directly for pvpers rather for their own profit and more pvpers assisting carebears in their endeavors yes there are and always have been groups that do this most commonly in nul and wh space but sadly its only small percentage of all playerscreatorsvsdestoryers is eve at its worse creatordestroyervscreatordestroyer is eve at its bestsorry for the long rambling post barely on topic but lately ive been thinking something similar to what the op asserts that highsec is disfunctional and lowsec is a wasteland of fear and loathing and have been thinking about how it could be fixed
eve is a competitive pvp sandbox set is a wartorn futuristic dystopia where we the players fight for power space and resources the game is specifically designed to foster conflict between the players everywhere in new eden that exert is exactly what they are referring to there isnt a lot of wartorn futuristic dystopia anymore i have lived everywhere in this game for the last 2 years bouncing here and there trying to find that same love of the game i had when i started playing so long agothe majority of gameplay i encounter on a day to day basis is not wartorn content its scammers trying to steal your isk through the same tired old scams being spammed over and over every 30 seconds day in day out a stale and uneventful high sec and nullsec where everyone just mines missions or rats and docks up when their shiny ship is in danger sure there are always tidi fleets to protect player space but not everyone enjoys sitting in a 30 lag for 5 hours defending a timeri understand eve has a challenge in every aspect but to allow the scammers and spammers to run rampant is too much i detest the trade hubs and i always close my chat boxes when i have no choice but to go there why bc there is nothing of value to read there everything linked is a scam or someone bitching about being scammed i mean hell its gotten so far out of hand people are now using their bio to carry their scam everywhere they go and it even comes equipped with a fake link to their walletplay my game follow the rules and you win click here for api verified wallet transactions but i found those websites and they are designed to falsify the wallet so it will show isk returns when there are none
i think the solution here is to join a community with the same interrestest and moralte codexs as you you cna then help and teach each other avoiding unwanted content
no the op was referring to the ubiquitous existence of pvp as a sickness in eve eve has always been a place where everyone is competing with everyone its even in the name everyone vs everyone and that is the same today as it was 11 years agonow if you want to claim that eve has some issues with stagnation and malaise i will not disagree with you however in my estimation this is not because there is too much player conflict in eve  it is the exact opposite a combination of highsec being too lucrative and too safe has drawn many players back to earn an income in near total safety as well as a lack of compelling sovereignty mechanics to keep players fighting in nullsec has caused there to be a lack of meaningful conflict just a bunch of veterans grinding isk in highsec incursion and then randomly roaming around outside of highsec looking for consensual and meaningless fights with one another scams are part of the dystopia but easily ignoredavoided if that isnt your thing highsec is too safe to be really interesting as there is no real advantage to joining a corporation and defending it from a wardec and nullsec has its own issuesi agree that eve definitely has some problems but too much player conflict isnt one of them
i cant take a side but i will im at odds with myself i lean toward new player issues considering the skill point differential and learning curve of this gameit would not bother me in the least if new players were given less grief why would itsome of these hisec dudes who camp the trade hubs are a grief to new playersits in everyones best interest to dissuade new pilot grieversgrieferpain in the arsesprobably takes one little wormhole server shard and both sides can be satisfieddefinitely there are more new players in a week than there are these types of pilotsi would bend and lean toward less new pilot griefan optional space for new pilots an academy before the academydont care though since im not a new pilotwaiti was one once took about 3 trials before this game stucki remember my first hi sec war i was in a station because the hi sec corp leader said dont go outrightfully so considering the sociopaths in this game i do care because i want this game to succeed more than failand those kind of pilots the wannabe mercs are dare i sayjust an alt anyway and you do not risk losing them with a change that can actually retain more pilots than lose
where did i repeat and encourage the including of a module to block cargo scansi listed an example of a ship that does it and how its generally a bad idea to fly because you get hit even if you are emptymaybe you are reading a different thread than i am
thread locked
how often and what frequency do you question yourself for playing this game
that is a good solution and more complete then what was defined by the other candidate that being said i also had my eye on giving meaningful fights to war dec corps so they are more focussed so my suggestion of time off from war decs based on kills and shots plus this would be a win win because people must not forget giving content to people who declared the war too and it has to be better than locking people into a war dec where they decide not to log in for a week blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
so youd like to make wormholes safer
i felt they were pretty insane when i lived in one i would like to point out that first of all you are in a large worm hole alliance when you are in a small corp and living there almost solo it is very differentdscan is your eyes when you see someone just before they cloak after entering your system or when they log back on and are warping to last position this gives you a tiny chance to know someone is theredscan immunity eliminates that so you dont even have the tip off to get to your pos and get out the probing shipit effectively blinds you completely i am not actually clear on your idea do you mean that if a defender wins a battle that they buy a reprieve in time from the war
when you look at war decs you have on one side certain entities war deccing on a scatter gun type approach to get access to people operating in space they want kills to keep their players active they catch stupid people and people that want to fight the rest just hide up and wait it out so we have wasted war dec fees on one side and on the other people not playing eve for a week and maybe morein many cases when a corp does fight other people see that and want to join in so they start throwing in war decs so the industry corp now starts to die as people decamp to npc corps the people who throw carebears around as a term want to tie all these people into the corp so they can not walk away from the war they dont care if those people leave the game because as far as they are concerned they are not eve players anyway but for ccp its a problemthe last war dec i had i looked at my strengths and weaknesses and theirs i assessed their time zones and did a lot of research on them including activating my scout account and watching them by day 5 i had gathered the intel to become a major pain my objective was to cause them issues in one of their activities in doing so they did not renew the war dec in fact i could have killed two t3s but i found it more amusing to make them panic warp i could do that because i am used to fighting against greater odds and my two pvp accounts are high sp the intel i got was hard work but included almost all their rr charactersthe issue here is that most hisec corps cannot deal with this they do not have the will or the sp to do so or so they believe but most of all if they do fight back they get dog piled there is no benefit in fighting back for themwhat i wanted to suggest was a mechanism where concord records the defenders pvp activities be it hits on the enemy ship kills and even time out in space uncloaked even losses but this excludes noob ships and shuttles this gets lumped together and a calculation made to define a value in terms of hours or even days or maybe weeks depending on how active they weresimplistically i thought about applying that to the corp that war deccd them only so that this gave them a period of immunity for a period of time based on how well they fought but having studied a number of corps that had been war deccd recently i saw plenty of dog piling going on and we should also not ignore the number of one man war decs thrown on as a spoiler so realised it had to deal with multiple war decs the mechanism gets a bit more difficult at this point because of that but could still be worked out with a bit of thoughtbut my giving time of peace to corps based on their ability and efforts in fighting a war or wars they could gain the most precious thing in hisec a breathing space which is something that i hope certain types of people would go for thus giving content to the people that war dechopefully leading to less scatter gun war decs and a benefit from engaging no matter your skillsi read the comments by corps that war dec and understood their issues but its like so many things in this game as soon as you try to build something the pressure hits you as you just start because there are too many bored big groups looking for something to shoot and then you fail before you start and most people in what they define as the carebear group want to play a game which is not always death but eve is a pvp game in the main so they need something that is a benefit from fighting there is nothing in terms of defending a war dec at the momentpersonally i like the challenge of this game against people who have the mechanics all on their side even though when you read the forums you would think otherwise but if you are under the cosh day after day its no longer a game its an ordeal and how many people can stand that blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
youre not stupid so i can only assume that you know how blatantly broken this would be in favor of the defender just undock a freighter or something else expensive sit on the dock point then if trouble arrives dock back up to rack up free immunity pointsbetween this and so many other mechanics strongly weighed in favor of the defender it would make wardecs functionally pointless
as most engagements edit change to as far as i understand a lot of engagements in hisec happen on the undock then its down to the attacker to drive them off of it but yes it can be gamed like so many mechanics in eve in any case the points from just being in space could be adjusted to be less from being on the undockalso the war decs come to an end then the immunity applies there may have to be a period where no new war decs can go in so that the break occurs but the thing is to give the people a reason to come out and fight even though they will get their butts kicked blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
stevethis year im starting to have a look at the running csm candidates in a bit more depth and ive written a short review of your campaign which can be found here
ohugthanks with the volume of candidates this year analysis is going to be handy for other people and you say nice things about me
finally a proper candidate from proviblock congratulations on running for csm vaari question given that you are indeed the earl of sosan vii it is odd to see you running for the csm would you not consider joining the csm to be a step down given all the titles you have already earned via your service to amarr additionally if you do indeed deem the csm a worthy bloc of people to join is it even possible for you to join if you are not the chairman of the csm i cannot imagine one such as vaari serving under some riffraff from goonswarm for example if you are not able to get enough votes to be chairperson how do you plan on seizing the title otherwise
if im elected to the csm im to be addressed as your worship when matter is on csm topics otherwise i simply ignore the questions and comments it is not stepping down many nobles has hold numerous titles who are not equa for examle our gracious majesty jamyl i holds the title of empress of the amarr empire she also no doubt hold countless of titles below that primary title she may be duchess jarlessa baroness and so one her lesser titles do not make her primary title any less lesser im still inexperienced what csms do so it would be bad leadership to claim the leading position right away i however promise to scheme if i can dethrone current heretic from the position of chairman if im ever elected to the leading position to the csm all those who wish to take part to the elections must be agreed by me before anyone can vote for them
last i checked earls are beneath kings so you will address me as your majestysecond your entire campaign seems like a troll thread so you will certainly be dismissed by any voting population that matters if this is simply you rping then i encourage you to understand that you will work with real people in potentially real life if elected rp has its place in intergalactic summit for example or even ingame but not when you are serving on the csmif you told me to address you a certain way or youd ignore my question id laugh at you and dismiss you like any peasant i happened across rolling in the muck and mire in the streets of the bobforsaken wastelands of kspace until you get on the level of the enlightened of bob you know nuthin jon snow
you are free to vote whoever criminal you wish if im elected i will represent my peasants on my terms and you cannot do anything to it im sure there are plenty of people who are tired to choose between naked and rags to correct any misunderstandings if im elected my planetary assistant who represents me is no way high noble and not even csm so he must not be addressed as worship it is just me
as you can clearly see plebe i have a refined taste in attire as do many within my circles you also mistake your position as would many with the simplemindedness you clearly displayi like many can do plenty to thwart your already futile attempt to influence the course of this election process mark these words that you will never see the halls of the csmenjoy your rags rpjust to be clear you really wont get elected with this campaign i would posit that xenuria gets more votes and that is saying something
let the god decide if im elected or not if not i try again with same campaign
i am fully behind these socially very important changes only thing i would add is more bushy moustaches my vote goes to vaari
make your corporation members vote me too
1 for lord vaari
then you have just secured my votes as wellgood luck tora and thank you for running
a few days until the voting starts seems i have to try harder to be evil
good luck in improving highsecyou can always find me on the forum section of minerbumpingcom o

bam supported our fledgling canberra community for our first ever canberra meetup last year and he is supporting us again for our second meet next month he provided advertising of the event through the eve downunder fb page in game edu motd the edu radio show and some awesome prizes through evebetcom for people that turned up bam 4 csm
it was such a pleasure to listen to bam speak about his eve community work on the hydrostatic podcast i cant recommend that enough he comes across as such an enterprising guy along with the sugars and the corbexes bam is getting my vote
haha wow this kind of blew my mind i logged in to the forum and the notification said thered be 12 new posts overnight and i was like whatthanks so much guys eve down under  a community for players in the autz
if you have lived in a wormhole in the last year you already know how much he has does as csm if you havent lived in a wormhole this guy cares and spends huge amounts of his time for players from listening to their concerns to tirelessly running tests on sisi if no one else i vote for gets elected i wont worry as long as hes there
ccp to give out a new shuttle and trinketsf in honor of ten years of csmi would have preferred that ccp give the diplomatic shuttle bpc to those accounts that will vote and the trinkets to everyone on feb 25th but kuddos for the efforts to raise awareness about the csm and the importance of votingccp va cUFFFDlebrer les 10 ans du csm en donnant des bpc dune nouvelle navette diplomatique et des bibelots rUFFFDfUFFFDrenUFFFDant tous les noms des membres de chaque csm jusquUFFFD ce jourjaurais prUFFFDferUFFFD que ccp donne la navette diplomatique UFFFD ceux qui voteront et les bibelots UFFFD tous les joueurs actifs le 25 fUFFFDvrier mais malgrUFFFD cela bravo pour leurs efforts pour amUFFFDliorer la visibilitUFFFD du csm et limportance de voter
just because ccp allows a mechanic doesnt mean its not complete bullshit tacking without invoking aggression or generating a kill right is bullshit 10s operating with impunity in secure space is like giving charles manson free admission to any social function he desires instead of keeping him locked up where he belongs the most hilarious part is the fact you quote james 315 and think he is to be taken seriously who next in the sociopaths hit parade erotica1and before you get too uppity i have lived in high low and null security space and accept the benefits and limitations involved in each when it comes time to fight i have no problems doing so on my combat alt tell me again about how being narrowminded is defending the sandbox it amuses me
im genuinely interested in hearing what csm members think about eves vision because at the moment it seems building stargates is something only the huge corps and alliances can consider mike said he is about high sec and smaller groups of players i want to know what he would like those groups of players to be able to do as part of this vision
there i read it and i want that few minutes of my life back its exactly what you would expect it to be its a guy still crying about carebears and themeparks and going though basically every fallacy there is in a post that could have been summed up n page 1 essentially he believe that any change to help with highsec player retention is part of path which will inevitably remove all risk from highsec the problem with that is that even the players campaigning for changes which reduce risk in areas are adamant that there should always be risk but apparently they cant be believed essentially his problem is that he wants people to live in what is effectively lowsec but doesnt want to go though the pain of moving to lowseche also makes terrible analogies like comparing total safety in highsec to removing the ability to die from an fps except there are still 3 areas of space you wouldnt be able to die in more accurately if highsec were made completely safe which it shouldnt be it would be more akin to having a safe spawn point which is a feature used by several fps games to great effectim convinced he wasnt even there for incarna since he seems to have the impression that the main issue there was wis the main issue was the potential threat of the game turning into a microtrans model which would effectively be flipping to a completely different type of playerbase wis itself isnt a particularly terrible idea  or at least it wasnt on ccp reduced staff numbers now it probably would behe also talks about how making the game less risky in highsec will drive away veteran players what he fails to realise is that hes a shining example of that not actually being true hes been complaining about how ccp caters to carebears for years and yet still hasnt quit like it or not ccp could do basically anything they want to help with new player retention and the vets would still remain even if they grumbled more im pretty sure that when im old grey and dying my last breath will be make sure chribba gets my assets for plex 4 good
my only concern would be making sure that such a war system does not invalidate the im smacking you down because you made me mad wars beyond that i think the points you mentioned here warrant further discussion this is probably not the best place to go into greater details of such a discussion thoughim adding you to my list of people to meet at fanfest and yes i have an actual list
lol no thanks you pushed for a shitstorm that not only didnt kill multiboxing but only created more problems and spawned a terrible rift between many players and ccp why would we want that again this year
1 you have my votes
my negative post on cagalis application was deleted by an isd because for some reason we cant post ingame correspondencebasically the tldr is that he kicked my alt from brave newbies after my main left before i had a chance to evac my stuffthe reason i referred to making money as jewing and he called me a stupid fking idioti posted the same logs on a reddit post recently and everyone agreed that he is not the kind of person we want on our csmto isds if youre going to snip out correspondence only snip out the correspondence and dont ever edit my post to look like positive praise for a player that is clearly an ahatyou deleted the correspondence and half my post to try to look clever
he is my ten seconds or less answer as well he has been a great partner this year and we work amazingly well together

most long haul flights have wifi now so now i have something to do rather than watching the same movies over and over again in all seriousness i will be transitioning to a new role with my employer come the new financial year so nowhere near as many flights to strange and exotic lands fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it this year the stars are lined up and personal life work life and eve life are all permitting me to commit the necessary time to be an effective csm member
i missed your post sorry about that thanks for the support
ash youre on my ballot youre an ideas guy i know despite this i feel that its necessary to push for a more engaging integral new player experience to provide a bridge to the demands of corp life in which case im going to completely overlook that you are clearly an imaginative and vital personality because i believe that you also have the patience and the dogged enthusiasm to push this to ccp who will no doubt be driven by overwhelmingly serious nullsec block csm with admittedly critical concernsto comment on comments made elsewhere eve is not age of conan to extend a metaphor if age of conan had a well made bridge to an blank facade eve has rickety old rope bridge to xanadu i think ash will provide npe relief from the very important work being done on sov this year

alyx is good people he gets my vote
listened to the wh townhall couldnt be there myself i am concerned with a few of your ideas namelydrama within the csm you are not there to police them there is bound to be disagreements and they are healthynpe were talking about from day one to a couple of months here right wormholes are not an new player thing they dont have the skills to survive or be useful at that age they cant run the sites effectively cant pvp against things like t3s for arguments sake and they have no clue of game mechanics these are things that are needed off the bat for living in a wormholei agree there needs to be more advertisement for wormhole space for new players but new players are not useful to themselves to this extent they would get very bored very quicklysovereignty as wormholers personally i think we should be very careful about this type of topic we dont like it when nullsec people who do not live here have a say in the day to day running of the way we live slippery slopeokay so a couple of questions do you feel wormholes are in a good shape currently and whyobviously lower class wormholes have been looked at a fair bit this year which possibly means that a look at higher class holes is coming what do you feel are the three big things that need changing in higher class holes why do these things need changing and how would you propose they are changedhow would you push for more pvp encouragement in wormhole space  do you think that there needs to be something added that would encourage more pvp to happen in wormhole space
drama within the csm you are not there to police them there is bound to be disagreements and they are healthyin any organisation there will be always be disagreements and not liking the people who you work with thats life what you do need to be is professional and work with people regardless of your views of them npe were talking about from day one to a couple of months here right wormholes are not an new player thing they dont have the skills to survive or be useful at that age they cant run the sites effectively cant pvp against things like t3s for arguments sake and they have no clue of game mechanics these are things that are needed off the bat for living in a wormholei agree there needs to be more advertisement for wormhole space for new players but new players are not useful to themselves to this extent they would get very bored very quicklythe idea is as part of the exploration mission arc that you can do is to introduce you to wormhole space by get you to scan down a wormhole which is instanced just for you so you can enter it and be tought to bookmark scan and do some easy sitesthe new opportunities system which they have just announced instead of the mission system could make this harder i will have to look at the new system on sisisovereignty as wormholers personally i think we should be very careful about this type of topic we dont like it when nullsec people who do not live here have a say in the day to day running of the way we live slippery slopeas much as we like our wormholes been sovless every where else has sovereignty of one kind or another and it effects or interaction with kspace ie pvp logistics etc etcokay so a couple of questions do you feel wormholes are in a good shape currently and whyover all yes there was some panic over the changes to wormholes and some people left we got use to it now and things are picking upobviously lower class wormholes have been looked at a fair bit this year which possibly means that a look at higher class holes is coming what do you feel are the three big things that need changing in higher class holes why do these things need changing and how would you propose they are changedthere has been much improvement on the lower system c4 space once the dearth of wormhole space are now thriving c5 and c6 need a bit of work but not by much tweaks to the sleeper sites to make them more random i dont think that ccp would give us sleeper dreads to fighthow would you push for more pvp encouragement in wormhole space  do you think that there needs to be something added that would encourage more pvp to happen in wormhole spacethe pvp is good when you get it its nearly always who gets the most wins that is the same all over eve however there is a problem that i see is when you find people to fight and they pos up they see too much risk for little reward theres no easy answer for that and you cant fix it
finally my capstable interview has been posted
good interview ariete youll have a spot high on my list for csmi would encourage all wormholers to listen to this interview  i think it does a much better job at laying out arietes positions than either the thread or the town hall that has been posted i think ariete will be a good 2 to corbexx this year and i think we all want two wormholers so vote them 1 and 2author of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
ive updated my thread with scaurus analysis of my csm campaign
lets look at this as two questions which is what it really iswhy have i been in an npc corp for 5 yearsthere are a lot of good reasons to be in a npc corp as many as there are for reasons to be in a player corp cant be wardecced dont have to deal with sov issues ready access to helpful advice in corp all good reasons to remain in cas on the other hand there are quite a few reasons to join a player corp sov warfare ready access to pvp fleet activity ready access to helpful advice in corp lower taxes generally better access to pos refiningconstructionfor me cas has always been the best starter corp lots of veteran players that are helpful in their advice many former cas members available in the castabout alliance for access to nullsec pvp fleeting pos useage and other things plus cas is overall a fun place to be due to the varied personalities within itive stayed in cas because cas has been a welcoming and friendly place with plenty of group activity and even with higher taxes 11 its worth that 1 tax hike just to not be constantly wardecced have i thought about joining a player corp yes many times ive turned down dozens of invitations to corporations over the years to be honest all because ive yet to find a corporation that gives as much benefit as cas haswhat is my response to people who say that npc corps should be for trialbrand new accounts onlyforcing people into player corps wont help retention of players most starterbloodline corps are places people stay in for a day week month while trying to find other player corps to be in yet cas has people active people who have been playing since the first days of eve online the reason cas does as much as a player corp with few of the downsides wardecs sov issues politics in the end i have to wonder if the ones yelling loudest for npc corps to be limited to a certain age of character might be due to jealousy or regret in having left their initial npc corpive always felt it is a mistake to push disadvantages at a player in a game to force an outcome in this case pushing people to join a player corp currently the npc corps have 11 tax higher than typical player corps as a nudge towards joining a lower tax player corp doesnt really work out that way though since the no wardeccing aspect of npc corps is worth a lot more than 1 tax
have you submitted your paperwork to be on the ballotis there a reason you waited until the last minute to enter the race for a seat
yes submitted my application before the deadline there was an issue with getting one piece of paperwork in which delayed entry finalization to last minute unfortunately but those issues are have been dealt with and all application paperwork submitted within deadlines
please elaborate on your ideas for the following what could ccp do to encourage someone like yourself to get out of an npc corp it sounds like the main benefit to you is immunity to war decs since ccp has voiced a specific desire to get people out of npc corps what is your thought around how to make npc corps a lessattractive longterm option you mention wormhole space in your secondary terms  please detail what exactly you think needs doing or prevention from doing you mention inclusivity of new eden lore  what do you mean by that phrase and what would you suggest to change it author of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
1 the primary reason many stay in a npc corp has little to do with wardecs at all but the fact that there are some really great people in them that have been playing for years the social aspect of such varied and interesting people enjoying being able to talk at any time when online is very attractive and any mechanic that forces people to leave what they consider to be home without very good justification will push people away and in many cases those people are able to find sub groups that work together missioning pvping mining most anything you could do as part of a player corpwhile ccp may want people to leave npc corps to player corps over staying in a npc corp the truth is some people just wont want to go theyve invested time into making a place for themselves in the npc corp theyve stayed in much like the time and effort put in by players in player corps they have been in long term there isnt a lot of carrot given to entice people out of a player corp say what you will some people just dont want to deal with politics wars they have no say in or the cult of personality that might exist outside of an npc corpthings that might help encourage people to join player corps would include a number of things a such as the ability to set a corp as noncombatant and members being disallowed from initiating pvp activity completely save defensive combat when attacked first or even giving rrboosts to third parties involved in pvp activities noncombatant corps also being immune to wardecs including those against an alliance and unable to help in an alliance war with logiboostsetc b additional information available on corps in the corp window including information such as average security status of the membership preferred activities pvp missioning exploration etc which can be filtered in the corp search c the ability for players to leave a corp within the first week of having joined and return to the starter corp they were in as opposed to the bloodline corp with an opt out option when leaving the player corp after that initial week or if they opt out the character would go to bloodline corp as bloodline corps tend to be short term landing pads for people who jump around corps they are more in line with people wishing to return to a player corp this would allow a player to decide if they made a mistake to go back to the place they started in which they likely have some level of comfort in before deciding to leave the nest again this would remove the all or nothing feeling of leaving a starter corp and encourage people to join player corps in the knowledge that if it isnt a good fit they will be able to go back to the start as it were2 wormhole space is an incredible thing for eve while on one hand it seems to have been intended more as a highway and day trip set of locations on the other players saw the potential to move in and own pieces of it for themselves this is pretty awesome as a concept shortcuts to other places yet the possibility to have your own little kingdom in the middle of who knows where i think that wormhole space could do with more attention additional mysteries to discover and unravel as well as some changes to anomalies and signatures to put ore sites back to signatures rather than anomalieswormhole space is a perfect place to add in new concepts for exploration and new types of sites to discover possibly new ways to escalate from a site say to a connected adjacent wormhole wormhole space just seems like the perfect canvas to try new things or expand upon existing concepts3 eves lore has grown since before its release to this day and will continue to grow but the vast majority of it happens as if the capsuleers are the big bad guys or the knights in shining armor yet it seems very often that the actions of capsuleers really dont affect much overall what i mean by inclusivity of new eden lore is that there should be more events andor activities in which players can help shape the lore of new eden change the streams course as it were this is a sandbox but outside of some sovereignty map changes not much really changes due to player actionswouldnt it be incredible as a player to be involved in an event on the side of whatever faction or empire brings it about in which they can feel their actions helped set the course of something major in new eden a change of solar system rule or elevating some person to a position of power hmm gallente presidential election comes to mind possibly discovering something that could shake things up a new module bpo or ship design that only a select few gain through their hard work by literally working through the event and earning it as the rewardi know that as an eve player i would absolutely love to be involved with things like that knowing that my actions helped decide a direction that the world moves in and im sure many many others would feel the samethanks for the interesting queries i do hope my answers satisfy the questions you gave mejanwa resh
hiim a longtime ceo and manyyear alliance leader and ive decided to run for the csm im a game programmer and a game designer in real life so i have a lot of experience with the kinds of issues i would have to deal with as a csm member i am also a very good communicator and will have no trouble conveying my thoughts and ideasas far as the game itself goes my main priorities at this time would be balance and financeid like to see more of eves systems balanced to keep the various bartle types of players happy in the game which leads to a healthier playerbasein terms of finance the biggest thing i think eve needs is a way to trade stocks reliably a functioning stock market would be a great playerdriven system to have this would of course require an overhaul of the current system of what owning stocks allows players to dowhile my corp has tended to be on the carebear side of the game over the years this does not mean that i would be for tilting the games systems in favor of passive playstyles i am a firm believer that it is the danger presented by other players in the game that makes building so rewarding while i think there are a few places where the balance leans a bit too far in one direction i would not favor moving too far in the other as a means of fixing itas i also favor concise communitcations i will keep this short and sign off now i check my evemail and this form about once per day so expect responses to take about that long to come throughnorjia
have you submitted the necessary paperwork to get onto the ballotis there a reason you got into the race so lateon the subject of stocks and the stock market what do you see as the shortfalls of the current system and what additional features would you like to see also in your ideal world would ccp have to actively monitor the stock market and act as a regulatory bodyon the bartle scale what type of gamer do you believe eve offers the least support for and why
i have submitted the paperwork yes i had decided a while ago to run but i wasnt sure if i would come in for 10 or 11 i decided last week to do 10i imagine the stock market fixing the current problem that shares can only be given theres no way to trade them reliably among people who dont know or trust each other i dont see ccp needing to regulate it in the same way they dont regulate things like evebank or the big lottery you still dont know if you can trust the stock to pay dividends or be in a real operating company instead of a ponzi scheme but thats a much more interesting problem to work through than will i actually get the stock or will i just lose my money with the ability to see a stocks value and dividend history potential buyers would have some data to go onanother issue is the means that stock owners can use to call votes to replace corps ceos this would require a serious overhaul as the current system means youd only want to issue stock in altheld holding corpsi would say achievers have the least support from eve as a game system since eve is so massive its clear that explorers have plenty to do socializers can join the rp alliances and chat all they want without leaving the station and killers well they have plenty of targets all over the galaxy
i believe you are the executor for your alliance some past and current members have stated that being a member of the csm is like having a second job ccp leeloo said on a recent podcast that the csm duties can take up to 1020 hours a week if elected will you have the time to devote to serving on the csm
bartles model is getting a bit long in the tooth i prefer nick yees along with the newer studies done around the usefulness of bartlethat said this is a csm campaign so instead of indulging in psychological theory ill play alongusing bartles model explain what you think the biggest need is within each type and what you would champion for ccp to do to address thatauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
there is a lot of good that can be accomplished by the csm even if many may view it as rubbish the dynamic viewpoints that can be offered up to ccp is something they will not be able to get out of their development teams and internal groups additionally developer  player communication directly tends to have a lot of noise csm  player communication in some forms can also be information saturation but if the csm tries to be accessible they may be able to get a lot of good information i plan on being as available as possible
1 for gorgafor not running with  i will fix xxx

once you are going against 200 man capital fleets dreads have the ability to alpha carriers off the field very easily a hundred battleships can alpha a carrier additionally the current siege module doesnt nerf tracking at all what about supers by folding the hull bonuses into triage which super carriers cant fit you lose any benefit of being immune to ewar when it comes to fleet repairing your proposed changes would utterly gut the carrier class because you cant handle dealing with 200 man capital blobs fleet repair becomes exceedingly difficult in lowsec for small gangs and repairing structures will demand a support fleet because no sane pilot will use a non triaged carrier solo when a t2 cruiser will out rep it and be less vulnerable instead of demanding that the ships be nerfed try looking at the mechanics of remote rep instead i can assure you that being unable to kill a ship under massed repair isnt an issue only dealt by capital ships guardian chains can be just as infuriating to subcaps
if we are throwing out ideas of how to fix it how about allow corps to make custom items take all the items in the game and allow player corps to pick so many bpos or bpcs and they can make upgraded versions of them like a 4x takes so many ppl research outposts and a huge supply chain of materials to keep the research going pvp players want better weapons and ships but they need ppl with research skills and industry skills to keep them supplied and the research bonuses coming not much in the way of graphics required instead of tech ii icons put the corp icon there the more people reseaching the more stats can be changed conflicts have more meaning since you could lose months of research if a specific pos goes down you can always replace a lost bpo or bpc now but not reseach on the cutting edge call it invention and call invention tech ii refits should require a lot of busy work data core running from your corp hq to your research stations and back various scavenger hunt style weekly missions for research bonuses prototype testing hiring and management of noncapsuleer staff running missions for specific npc corps or factions for access to their research this would shake a lot of things up the market would skew to who ever was doing the most research in each field some corps might limit their tech to corpmates only and use it as a draw for recruiting supplies would be limited since only one corp is producing the item for all of new eden allow for reverse engineering to steal research from data cube transfers research outposts or prototypes and consequences for the corp who lost them so many options for what amount to 13 variable changes to ships or ship equipment if an alliance has enough hulls in its member corps maybe a custom alliance ship like a pirate faction takes large networks of active accounts and the skills in the required reseach fields if your the small guys try to find areas ppl arent selling on the market and fill that niche the progress wont be as fast but you could always reverse engineer to speed your progress makes for targeted wardecs where people wanna steal your research or hurt your market dominancejust a few ideas that seem like they could bring the 2 sides of eve together
the dirty little secret of most pvpers is that they already have a minerindytraderhauler guysometimes this person is an alt of the pvper sometimes it is an actual person either way what separates these characters from their minerindytraderhauler peers is that they are willing to accept risk as it comes even if it means lower profits talk communicate and work out deals with the pvpers they are supplying understand that no matter how powerful hisher pvp friends are safety can not be guaranteed so it is up to that character to take preventative action andor stay within were coming to save you distance from friends and allies continuing from the last point understand that in order to take preventative actions they have to know how pvpers operate and what mechanics they typically use this usually requires the minerindytraderhauler to pvp a little bit much the same way a pure pvper has to take a crash course in economics and industry to buysell stuff on the marketthe rub is that there are more than a few minersindustrialiststradershaulers that do not want to adapt in this fashion because it interferes with the way they want to play which usually does not include pvp in any way shape or form which is silly because they are affecting pvpers in their own way and literally asking to not be affected backthe current issue is mainly based on perception and principle not actual mechanics
well written that is the shift that has left highsec in this state very few mixed focus corporations remain in highsec most of these groups either moved to nullsec or were destroyed from within by awox groups i do not believe that the anti awox button will fix this some of the better strategies to awox are not through shooting corp mates but through misleading and misinformation then leading groups to their destruction against a larger force i feel that corporation play is completely unnecessary and redundant in empire space
you didnt but then i never said you did in the first place
i can agree to this intent though i would say defenders need to score some kills  and maybe have higher isk winthat might make undocking shiny worth it to buy time to earn more risk and reward
never dont vote for stevelet those who will complain about the meta or bloc votes or politics steve has done a whole bunch of work to get technical issues sorted out and made eve better for everyone if hes not in your top 5 you havent thought carefully about this
im curious because over the past year ccp has hinted at development into this area what experience do you have with delegatingsubcontracting parts of the industry chain to other playersentities
other than once having someone contract me for a bunch of 425mm rails none they ended up not taking them which left me a few hundred million downid love to see an ability to contract production out with contracts which once accepted have x days to have delivery and cannot be cancelled maybe with collateral from both sides for completion
i really like the upcoming changes to new player experience congrats to csm ix for participating to what seems like a good way to improve this experience i particularly like that people will start in a ship in space warping to their own anomaly instead of inside a station without a spaceshipi just hope that they wont be able to be probed in that starting anomaly and no griefer can mess with their first experience until of course they leave it after having acquired some basic rudiments including not shooting at somebody targeting you having learned that being targeted is different than being shot atje trouve la nouvelle approche du jeu qui est presentUFFFDe dans le dernier post de ccp plutUFFFDt bien bravo au csm ix pour leur participation dans ce qui semble UFFFDtre une amUFFFDlioration majeure de cette premiere expUFFFDriencejapprUFFFDcie tout particuliUFFFDrement que les nouveaux joueurs dUFFFDmarreront dans un vaisseau de novice warpant sur une anomalie qui leur sera spUFFFDcifique au lieu de dUFFFDmarrer en station sans vaisseaujespUFFFDre juste que les nouveaux ne pourront pas UFFFDtre probUFFFDs dans leur anomalie de dUFFFDpart et quaucun griefer ne pourras venir dUFFFDranger leur premiUFFFDre expUFFFDrience jusquUFFFD ce quils quittent cette anomalie de dUFFFDpart aprUFFFDs avoir acquis quelques rudiments de base incluant de ne pas tirer sur quelquun qui vous cible en ayant appris que UFFFDtre ciblUFFFD est diffUFFFDrent que de se faire tirer dessus
mikewhy should you serve another term as csm what do you have to bring to the table that a newer younger member of the community couldnt wouldnt you think that newer players would have a better feel for improving the npe that the game needsdont you feel that maybe this should be the year you step down and pass the torch
i did spend some time asking myself that same set of questions i bring experience contacts and continuity i bring a long history of involvement with the csm and a sense of the changes and direction that it is traveling i have seen iterations of the npe and look forward to helping with the new one as it growsdo we need some new blood on the csm hell yes but it needs to be tempered by experience it needs people to bring the new council members up to speed that is why i am still running or one of the reasons there are othersmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
we think you have some qualities to be again in csmyou just have to be more confident in some new features as we talked about beforeand then with this i am sure you will be able to bring also what a new player could bring in csmeven if you didnt answer on these points in our last thread we believe you are enough openminded to speak about these points in csm xdont disappoint us on these points best regards
my experience of working with mike was that the csm was better for him being there hes outside any consideration of bloc politics he brings a valuable alltoorare perspective to the table the well informed considerate thoughtful hisec player hes mindful of the little guy who experiences being the solo minnow in a sea full of sharks but hes by no means a simplistic nerf the pee vee pees raging carebeargod dambit vote mike you fools we need him
i hope providence block has two csm after this election

the new bro agenda is a high priority for me this year and will strongly influence who gets my vote in the csmx election youll have a slot on my slate but assuming brave rallies on your behalf i reckon you shouldnt have any problems getting a seat i can envision the many ways you might bring your experience with new bros to bear on csm discussions since it seems we can expect csmx to be involved in lots of discussion about sov changes this year what do you hope to bring to that discussionwhat are your thoughts about the opportunities dev blog released today
i may not always agree with cagalis quest to make everyone feel at home in brave but without his amazing work with all the fantastic newbies we have eve would be a lot less welcoming to new players if theres anyone whos gonna really help especially new players and make sure they get the voice they deservevote cagali cagali for csm
endie hes a goon even his enemies believe in a toast to better thrones 1 youre on my ballot
good luck endiei sincerely hope that you manny and corebloodbrothers get elected and are able to ensure ccp get it right with regards to the nullsec fix i fear that if ccp screws this up it will be the final nail in the coffin for eve online i hope they appreciate thisyou have my vote
just posting to say why arent others posting
whats to say  put manny in your voting preferencesand your heart
thanks malcalypse for all the support

bob is a good man and what i believe is most important for a csm is social activity which bob is in spadesif you want a csm that will talk to you and answer your questions vote bob
very good duder and now runs the most credible eve news site on the internet thanks to le martinis decline
i loved your interviewdefinitely giving you one of the first four slots on my ballots your enthusiasm and creative approach to problem solving are appealing and you would bring an engaged newer player perspective to the csm which i dont think it has had the benefit of before good luck
an important question as i stated in the interview its important these people do not receive a ridiculous ingame advantage since ccp should not be using its marketing to play favorites as it were in my background as both a marketer and a gaming journalist there are a few approaches ive seen the most common is simply to give players a free review copy of the game with an agreement that the content creator will produce a set number of videos articles etc in exchange for the free software now eve is different since it isnt a boxed product per se but it could certainly be arranged for a subscription period 3 months 6 months 1 year etc or a boxed collection eve collectors edition the boxed collection in particular offers the additional value in askingrequiring the producer to also review the physical goods create an unboxing video etc some people out there may not even be aware these kinds of products existanother type of agreement may consist of precreating several midlevel characters of various archetypes a miner a mission runner an explorer etc and giving these to a player in exchange for an xpart series featuring each of them this would require a more formal agreementa third option which is most likely to be considered distasteful but should still be considered is to hire a pr firm to directly pay the targeted personalities to play eve these gamers would be contracted to receive x per videomedia produced with previously agreedupon topics length etc they would have to disclose their sponsorship to their fans but would otherwise be relatively free to approach the game as they please this type of contract would be the most formal but also the most likely to yield results due to the best incentives and the binding nature of the agreement however these players would still not be receiving any type of ingame advantage or exclusive benefitof course it is hard to advise on the type of route to take without knowing ccps budgeting details their previously completed endeavors general player datasegmentation of highretention players etc theyre just examples of highlevel templates to work from based on what i have seen work for other companies
interview was excellent chancesuzy for csmx
if it wasnt for chance and or the wingspan bros i would have left the game and unsubbed a while ago d good luck boss 
your rvb experience put you on the radar for my ballot since the new bro agenda is the primary criteria for who i will vote for this year big bonus is that via your alts you have a wide range of experience in other areas of the game that will clearly be on ccps agenda this yearwhat do you think of the opportunities dev blog and the possibilities it suggests for new players to get a better start in learning how to play eve
the devblog is a good start i love the free form concepts that the opportunities system promises rather than sequential do x y z and read a wall of text it becomes much more about allowing them to explore this works well when you combine the new ui elements and things like the new simple icons the notification system etc so you are guiding and teaching them subtly allowing them to explore without giving them a rubix cube and the traditional go f yourselfthe fact you can now make things open ended means that they can learn there is more than one way to skin a cat more than one way to achieve an objective and remove some of the artificial restrictions placed in the existing tutorial im particularly happy that things like joining fleets pvp and other things that were not previously possible or that were very intuitive from the old tutorial system could also get a new lease of life eve is by and large a social game and people will get the most out of it if they engage with other players so anything that means social  npsi groups or corporations are easier to access is a very positive changehopefully now the new player experience can also show the players that loosing a ship loosing a pod etc is all par for the course and that they can and should embrace the fact that they are immortal hopefully making people less risk adverse and more likely to explore other areas of space other types of gameplay and means that players can be engaged from day one to day twenty one rather than getting to the end of the tutorial and saying what do i do now
i tried to give a bit of flavor of that in my follow on posts essentially it boils down to me that the focus needs to be on customization and player drivenunique solutions to overall balance for instance when ccp generally thinks of balance they consider how they can better move us to the right decisions based on some predetermined ship archetypes and given specificationsi see it much differently this game like no other has embraced the very foundation of economics and material acquisition that should be used to drive balance from within the player base through real invention and tweaking of products in the manufacturing process more like being given a bag of ingredients that we discover how to put together better based on a more fundamental approach to attributes specifications and parameters so instead of changing an attribute tag on a ship and making the mass artificially some number that should be a function of all the crap you put on it plus materials used in construction etc along with efficiencies in design and whateverso while the ship othe day meme never gets old it does always say the same thingcookie cutter top down design doesnt work innovation needs to come from those that actually make use and need it etc and not by commity but by individuals experimenting and literally inventing drafting and building custom ships from the raw materials available throughout the eve universeto me that is the ultimate waaay on down the line endgame and not something i would imagine would just be implemented but rather a philosophy of thought driven towards so that progress can be made in that direction over time nothing in eve feels like it is mine even though i may have minedharvested the components or done the reactions etc etc etc at the end of all that work i get some thing that is the same as all the other things with no more or less value and all i did was jump through the right hoops for the sake of it that can extend to all sorts of aspects of the game
great leader and great personality
this is a particularly difficult question software developer is not quite the same as a manager not to mention there isnt much that can be done in one day that being said i will try to follow what i believe to be the spirit of the question rather then the exact wordingmy top three priorities would be 1 begin the construction of an app that exposes tools you do not want to expose to 3rd party developers pi skill training in game chat from mobile tool skill point updater2 begin examining creating a stripped down version of the client that could work via mobile to allow basic in game functions could be the facilitator of number 13 collect a list of the back log as well as previously announced features that have been left on the way side separate features into active development backburner and abandoned and expose this list to the players for features that are public of course while number three is not specifically mobile i believe that it should be done either way we have a trail of lost features and we as a community should know which features that have been mentioned over the years are still on the table i think this would do wonders for player confidence of future feature discussions
run with me you mean
the real problem with pi is that it is damn unintuitive why do you think the new eve flight academy has 4 videos on pi alone the system is just terriblethe sad thing is that the foundations of it are not that bad only its ui a few simple fixes such as the ones i listed below will make it far easier to figure it all outthe problem with a starter mission is that generally pi is measured in days not minutes or hours i am still unsure how to make it work within the npe but making the system as a whole make sense and not be so punishing would go a long way
ironically the newbros who join null blocks generally do not need the npe as much as those who do not null blocks are very good at turning new players into workers and getting them up to speed those who chose not to join null blocks right away or are to intimidated are the once we really need to reinforce with a solid training program and engaging gameplay
recently thoric sat down with us over at cap stable for an interview you can find it here
vote for thoric
1 for a great leader
i hold thoric in extremely high regard personally he has been an extremely good alliance leader for us i also agree with his views on eve and where the game should go so he will have my vote there are a lot of lawn members on here showing support please dont take that as a sign of nepotism but rather a genuine belief that if thoric is involved in something it will likely be better for it
thoric for csm 10
not sure i agree with this the stagnation is very much the fault of the coalitions in my opinion smaller entities are virtually extinct because the coalitions either killed them all or swallowed them up i dont see how any sov mechanic that ccp introduces could prevent anyone from forming a massive blob if thats what they are determined to do i agree with you on risk aversion which is the cause of the coalitionsedit  you make some good points regarding riskaversion in other posts
speedkermit i think there are a number of ways they can introduce mechanics  not just sov mechanics but game mechanics that can create diminishing returns when you go full blob just a few random examples could include diminishing returns on links for larger fleets perhaps an increase in signature size for individual members of a fleet as it got larger perhaps ecm could be tweaked to have a small aoe effect that might discourage simply orbiting an fc and hitting f1 on command i havent thought any of those through completely so i disclaim their being goodideastm by themselves but accept them as an illustration of game mechanics that could tone down n1 combatnumbers will always matter but you can at least make it so that if you can get close you can count on not being completely outclassed which would encourage fights also the thing about large coalitions people play games to win if the best way to play is accumulating a large coalition people will take that path and dont mistake it for easy mode the politics of a large coalition are hard or you wouldnt see so many organizations failscading blaming people for making a winning move or telling them they shouldnt do so because you would prefer to win once in a while is pretty much the anathema of a sandbox game generally speaking the answer if most people arent having fun in your game is to create new content and rulesets that allow people of all sizes to have achievable fun goals ccp has had some great successes and epic failures in that realm over the years all i can do is offer my point of view on what worked and didnt over the course of the past decade or so
i recognize its been a quiet two weeks for my campaign but im going to blame it on the fact that i had my interviews posted first thing early on in the campaign and thus theres really very little new to share thats changed since those interviews posted and nobodys asked me questions recentlymy killboards been quiet recently because ive been flying logi frequently including for a fun little small gang brawl with darkness and a renter ratting carrier dunk ill post in a bit about my thoughts on the latest npe devblog
so having looked at the npe blogpost in a bit more detail openended ways to introduce players to game mechanics are great however it doesnt yet address the piece of connecting new players to existing communities of players that share compatible interestsselfselected cultures and thats the part that will have the most impact for new player retention in the long termin short what rise is proposing to do will have dramatic gains for retention of players in the first 7 days as they learn mechanics but doesnt yet address retention of players from days 714 and beyond

hello capsuleersi first started playing eve 5 years ago i am currently member of mortis angelus a member of the kadeshi alliance i am one of the many fcs in the kadeshi alliance my main focus in eve is the combat pvp element even thou i focus my time in mostly combat i have experience in the industry and pve elements of new edenthese are some of the points i will be focusing on if i am elected as csm1 how to generate content for new players to gain a large player population in eve2 focus on pvp and pve ship balancing by exploring the current gaps with t1 sub capital ships usage set a platform for t1 sub capital pvp and pve in my eyes this will create more content for everyone due to cost and availability this will also increase the need and demand for industry corporations within super alliances3 explore t2 sub capital pvp platform and usage currently thereUFFFDs only a select few t2 cruisers used for pvp look at balancing one t2 sub capital ship from each race to have better pvp usage4 look into new industrymining barge faction cross race platform ships for better defense and mining yields5 look into better communication structures in eve to support new player base and veteran playerUFFFDs communication links for recruitment being a part of the different elements new eden has to offer i have discovered several different player populations with many different outlooks on the way eve online is played in those 5 years i have experience many successes and utter failures that have made me the eve player i am today i have been in alliances that have crash down to nothing in null sec i have been in industry corporations where small coalitions existed and the relationships have had a major impact on the course of their futureso you ask yourself why i bring up successes and failures in eve when i look at a dictionary and look up the definition of a sand box in the virtual world i see a picture of eve online next to that word the sand box knows no boundaries and it can eat you alive or bring you the adrenaline rush you want out of your gaming experience these are things i would like to help improve in provide the input to create the content you as the player want to see nextcsm is a great tool to be the voice for our player population i want to be one of our players voices and present these ideas to our developers i want to hear your voices share our ideas and bring back that communication from the developers group to youso the big question why vote for methis will be my first year running for csm actually this will be my first time running for any campaign what i lack in position that requires a vote from the population and being a voice for our society i can promise my door will always be open i will give 110 to make sure your voice is heard i will apply my knowledge and your knowledge to communicate the best interest for our society in new edenthank you for taking the time to read my campaign thread and when the time comes let me be your voice and vote for cycule
gorksi what about off grid boosting some other players in here asked you about this but you seemed to avoid the topic obg is the reason for most of my accounts being inactive and i know many pilots who feel the same way isnt it finally time for a change in that regardedit you stated that you want new players to get out there and solo agreed but running a second account to carry around one of these ridiculous link boats to be competitive is kind of really discouraging dont you think
 ogbs i have a party to attend and i need to get drunk after work will write something more on this here is my blog btw
painful
very immature and downright stupid responses the bad thing is that you seemingly regard yourself as funny or original when you reply like that also cheering for ogb means that you dont know  about small gang pvp or that youre in for the epeen either way you should stay away from csm as far as posible
you are right small gang pvp means dont use ogbs
saw rhavas bump for your thread and knew your interview was posted so i took a listen i will say that you did much better in the interview than i had anticipated based on the townhall the other day you are clearly a nice and likable guy with the occasional giggle in self amusement and a hint of nerves in your tone as you struggle through some of the questionsanswers the latter is normal ofcourse but the former really does say a lot about you in my opinioni think you took a leap in this campaign you dont strike me as the spotlight kinda person and im basing this on my interaction and observation of you almost none i can tell you that i wouldnt be surprised by hidden fremen ayeson bernie nator chitsa jason bronya boga longinous spear jack miton winthorp sith1s spectre billy hardcore james arget or even rhavas running for csm since i know how involved they get in this game and they lead from the front in their interaction with other players until your announcement id never heard from youafter listening to your interview i heard the same rhetoric all political prospects use including myself last year but i didnt find that you are really trying to bring anymore to the table other than your commitment to support corbexx which doesnt really mean you need to be a csm to do that i support corbexx sugar and others often and i dont or have intentions on serving on csm i have respected rhavas opinion for a long time now and always look forward to his writeups and blog posts but for the first time in sometime i have to say im not in agreement with himi just dont see that you bring anything to the table that we dont already have corbexx has plenty of support and he gets things done the question becomeswould having two wormhole candidates make it even betteryes i think it would but the next question becomesare you the guy that would best represent as the second wormhole candidateim not convinced you are but i will say you are likely the only other option i see currently i think you are a nice guy and i think you are a better option than bane cortex or angrod but i am concerned that you arent keen on maintaining a blog or capitalizing on written communication avenues corbexx is already a terrible writer he admits this freely and if i were to ask for an amazing 2 a great writer and communicator that supports him is what id wish forthats my two cents and you are on my ballot if that means anything as the only other wormhole candidate worth voting for1
aww proc you dont love me any more ariete is one of my corpmates its true but it is very rare that he and i fly together  maybe once in the last year  were in different time zones and have only a handful of connections so unlike james arget in csm 8 who i knew very well ariete and i are not as closely acquainted and youre right ariete is not a radical departure from corbexxi think your questions strike to the core of the matter 1 would we as wormholers be better off with two reps i think we would and 2 is ariete the best 2 hes got opinions that match mine with the possible exception of the black hole stuff im not wellversed in life in new black holes and how well theyre going so its hard for me to tell heres a sneak preview of my coming opinion unless one of the 15 unannounced but approved candidates is one of the more famed people you note above while others call themselves wormhole candidates in a shill for votes ariete is in my opinion the only one in the race other than corbexx who i consider a true wormhole candidate for me this makes the math very straightforwardo7author of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary

angrod losshelin recently sat down with cap stable for an interview listen here
no he really doesnt and neither do you just listened to your podcast and honestly you really dont understand that input broadcasting is literally a form of automation noting the fact that it isnt allowed anymore and you point that out id like to state a couple things1 i multibox without any third party software2 i work with automation every day at work you are welcome to mail me for my credentials or look at my campaign from last year3 input broadcasting is limiteduser automation4 it is cheating in a gaming environment5 ccp changed the rules to remove it6 is boxer made adjustments for eve online7 what is left is fine with me8 if you took the above approch and breakdown you would likely have not lost support9 you misrepresent corbexxs stance on new players and npe in your interview10 i dont think you represent my interests or the best interests of others in this game outside your own interests11 as it stands i sincerely hope you arent elected12 the end
you beat me to the punchcheck out my podcast my blog
so lets do this since we obviously disagree it is not cheating if the game allows it and most games do this one no longer does so there fore input duplication is cheating currentlyi have stated plenty of times that i am ok with the way things are now regarding input duplication but alot of people are not i am not happy about it but i understand that it will likely not change in the future i chose to represent multiboxing as a whole and there are a lot of questions as to why it was removed in the first place if you notice i did not argue in my interview or mention that input broadcasting should be reallowed they made it cheating in this game and i understand thati simply stated that corbexx and the csmccp agree that wh space is not npe friendly and that corbexx has not focused on npe regarding whs which he hasnt hes focused alot on other issues which is also very ok if corbexx wishes to correct me that is totally fine and i will stand corrected the end only serves to close a book oddly enough it does nothing to an argument or debate if you dont want to vote for me donti am running to see if the multiboxing community would like better representation i am also running to put whs on the npe map if the community wants to see that happen vote for me it not dontcheck out my podcast my blog
my executor duties dont take up a whole lot of time its a small alliance and my corp runs quite smoothly now that it is so wellestablished so theres shouldnt be any conflict between my eve play time csm duties and real life
good point about yee his work is excellent for simplicity ill stick with bartleachievers are the ones that i think have the least support in the game the alliance tournament is the main thing i can think of that caters to them perhaps also faction warfare im an explorer so its hard for me to say how this situation could be improved beyond adding some more competitive elements to the game the fundamental problem with achieving in mmos is that their content tends to be open to all players provided theyre willing to put in the time but i would be open to suggestions from the community on this since its a place i dont have my own ideas about what should happen one thing i am good at in game design is evaluating the impact of game design changes on the rest of the system i think i would make good choices from multiple suggestionsi think ccp already does a great job of facilitating the enjoyment of explorers in the game so i dont think a lot needs to be addressed there same for the killersas for the socilaizers i think there are good avenues already but the idea of walking in stations owning facilities there etc would be a great boon to them imagine being able to be the proprietor of a bar which is a place where pilots can socialize buy stuff from you and get a certain type of mission etc however i would not advocate this unless ccp could prove that they could get it working without doing it at the expense of development of the core game the incarna release was pretty weak and we all remember the shakeup that caused in the community and at ccp
i have known norjia for yearsshe has vast knowledge about eve is an excellent diplomat and a superb herder of catsif you want someone who can examine complex systems talk to people with competing agendas and come up with innovative solutions to gnarly problems then norjia is the person you want
personally i have no inkling how gorga maintains his sanity running n3 and s2n im hoping the csm will finally break him
well i had to pay 15 to resub to reply to this campaign it is i dmitry friggin wizard bane you held thor for tornen please dont get that twisted and it was like a week and you left right after he took it as much as i support your ability to run for csm for this terrible game im going to tell you that you shouldnt not because of what everyone else on this thread is saying you know that wormholers are some of the biggest trolls in the game running for csm requires you to have knowledge of not only the space but of the people in the space for all the time i spent in diplo channels and talking to the various leaders and self proclaimed kings of wormhole space i still didnt know what was best for wormhole space and her citizens therefore i didnt run take another year at least and build up your reputation get your self known as someone who cares about the people and the place and then try until then try not to get evicted over thison another note proc you beautiful sob how you been i see that your coat is not red and for that sir i am dissapoint
you have my vote
while a full rundown on my platform is still pending the approval of my campaign manager doink9731 i will do my best to answer any questions you may have in this thread

holy crap dude thanks
i would agree with this  if a small amount of resources were put against this on the eve side and they were in communication with the dustlegion team and allowed to use the same engine then when you combine legions engine with the upcoming ondemand content download capabilities i really think ccp could deliver us that vision they originally talked aboutjust like captains quarters were supposed to be a slow temporary start they can iterate on it for each release im sure if they gave us vending machines and other items for aur then the aur sales could start funding further development in the avatar experienceultimately id love to see a unified eve universe where legion valkyrie and eve all existed on the same plane and in the same overall client
perhaps eve gives new players the wrong impression of the game and directs them into pve and lets them think that high sec is the pve area
old vet here intrested in industry to some degree just passing by in my search for the key to open damn unidentified wormholes what bothers me most is eve industry atm is much more ingame skillbased managment with too predictable results then actual production or research with strong impact of personal human skills of course you can get better prices or cheaper components but imagine if someone would 9599 win in pvp just because of ones skills are leveled to 5 and opponent skills are 4s  thats just wrongthe other good example is new explorations mechanics and i admit i really like it  ingame skills rise ones chances to open hackingarch container but only to some degree and it strongly depends on personal skillalso if it would be more about personal skills probably we would see less passive alts just for an extra slots lol doing good at industry same goes to mining and such and about claiming asteroids probably we could see more complex approach with conjusction of exploration and mininggathering mechanics probably removing all but basic newb sources points all other stuff needs to be found first be it asteroids or comets itc probably involving much more detail scanning thinking of elite dangerous style founders get scan results and rites to extract this site or they can put this claim deed on global information market where intrested parties could check how complete scans are actual location of the site and what possible revenue they would get if they would harvest it people who dont own rights get suspectedtldr finders keepers but with legitimate way to sell what they find just an ideahere is my vote  industry is a heart of the game after all and it deserves love no less then pvp
you have my vote any possibility you could expand on this in a bit more detail id be interested in your thoughts thanks
i wasnt gonna vote but the overwhelming response has convinced me to vote for this candidatety all for helping me make the decision

this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediascsm representatives can only be elected once this is important to make sure the csm seats truly represent all players each year and does not become a stagnant pool of power playerseve online is not like any other mmo out there players build resources and assets that they can lose ingame and have a wide variety of options to set their own goals there is no final boss no end point in a players influenced story line for a lot of players that chose to stick with this game eve is more like a hobby than just another gameeve has celebrated its 10 years already for all those involved the passion and the stakes are high and the nature of this game is about long term commitmentthe more recent information about the csm interaction with ccp clearly shows that csm members will have the ability to voice their thoughts directly in confluence the system that ccp uses to manage their projects ccp also clearly stated that they are the sole and final decider about what they do with the game and they reserve the right to not make everything public to the csm as i think insider knowledge on some stuff can favor certain groups over others and is difficult to verify regardless of nda signedstill a direct access to the makers and deciders of the fate of new eden is a significant power as the teams in ccp can read everything logged and kept in confluenceccps goal is different from the players representative goals ccp is there to make money while providing long term fun and a unique scifi experience the csm members represent the voices of the players that voted for them csm members are not game designers they are part of a focus group or a think tank and represent the community that elected them to bring up points that may be ignored or acted upon at ccps discretionmy main point is that being elected only once will keep in check a nonccp employee individuals influence over the game we all share and allow other voices and faces to rise up as younger players become vets there is no shortage of talents in the player base to represent a community that evolves each year i also support an increase of the term for csm to two years and possibly an increase to the number of representatives to keep up with the growth of the active community keeping one election every year for half of the memberslarge players groups with their voting recommendations will always have representatives on the csm but it is up to them each year to find new people to represent them i also support activity feedback for csm members with a public activity report for every csm member every 6 months and consequences for two poor activity reports in a row like loosing your seat to a candidate next in line from the last election this process must not become a possibility for other csm members to blackball someone they do not like and be fact checked with activity data and clear expectationsversion franUFFFDaise
sighmike just when i was about to drop you into the endorsed section of my spreadsheet i find this my friend you were even in the room for my favorite dev quote everso lay it on me  whats your ideal fix for something that imo is a gargantuan nonproblem that is really a symptom of whiny lazinessauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
afk ratting is one of those things that keeps coming up let me tell you why i have an issue with it then you can decide whether it alters how you will vote i want people to play eve i want then to be present in the moment i have issue with afktars with afk mining with people assigning drones and coming back hours later to see how they did i dislike bots that allow someone to set it and return to bacon unless you are docked or in a pos you are at risk space is dangerousbut then there is cloaking see i have no issue with the psychological impact of it but the presumed safety i would howl with maniacal laughter if the circadian sleepers started finding scanning and decloaking inattentive cloaked ships i donthe mind cloaks    i mind their excessive safety and security mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
local channel list provides even more safety and security and doesnt even require you to make any fitting sacrifices
yes but it is not an asymmetric safety and it does demand player engagement to be usefulmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i can get behind this agreed providing certain timing i dont think looking hard at a ship that has been afk cloaked for 10h without moving is a big deal  go for it but 30 minutes is very typical when you are actively watching a target ive sat watching actively for up to 23h at a time as a scout sitting cloaked is an especially valid thing to do in wormhole spacethe issue is not the cloak so if the above is your stance please dont present it as a cloaking issue  present it as an afk issueauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
mike the more i read the higher on my list you go from what i read the best thing i can see about you is that you have a solid grounded platform your intents are clear and well communicated and despite being called wishy washy and a compromiser i see you as a clear decisive moderatea disclaimer before i go further im a carebear and proud of it i enjoy missioning and mining with the rare day of incursions in peace and quiet with the exception of npc explosions i have tried null but wasnt really happy there so i moved back to highsecsome thoughts on points raisedin regard to the conversation with feyd rautha harkonnen i wonder if a possible solution would be to make empire spaces sec status dynamic more traffic hostile or otherwise would result in a higher concord presence if you offset this with the opposite being true or there being a finite concord presence across a region with traffic determining the distribution in a dynamic secstaus model i could even see it extending to trusec and the value of null systems for ratting and mininggranted this the features and ideas section is probably a better place for specific ideas but in a general context what are your thoughts on reworking some of the static systems like secstatus to dynamic ones that are based not on static values set by ccp but on formulas based on player interaction with bounds set by ccp precedent for systems like this have already been set with the cost indexfrom where i sit one of the biggest negative differences between eve and almost any other mmo out there is the immersion factor there is by far more metagaming that goes on in eve than in any game ive ever encountered i believe this is a large factor in new player retention what are your thoughts on ways to improve the immersion factor of evedespite being a carebear i like the sandbox i like that theres no right way to play eve i love its complexity but i also think theres a real risk of scaring off new players and the money that comes with them by having that very complexity create an environment that is so hostile so early how have advocated in the past to minimize new player loss and will you continue to do so
read this for entertainment and lolz yet you made arguments in line with my thinking you have my vote you should campaign on reddit sometime do an ama
i really like it when people read this thread for the lulz but like it i intend to set up a reddit account and do just that
in my opinion the changes of sovereignty mechanical will be key to this election eve needs a rebalancing and a renewed attractionsi want to support the corebloodbrothers vision on this particular topic a universal vision that can be shared by all players of eve not just the people of providence we are talking about our favorite gameafter this election i could appreciate the man respectful teacher volunteer and im a little sad to see that sometimes the debate revolves around its spelling or its way of fcing i know how difficult it is for him to sell himselfin the end we all know that its ccp has the last word on the direction of the game thats why it is important to elect people who will carry our voice and for my part i think this guy is corebloodbrotherscorebloodbrothers will have my vote

i spend much of any given day with one or two characters waiting for jump fatigue timers to get down to the level where i wont lock myself out of the game until tomorrow by jumping again it is frustrating and i understand that it must be even worse for those who dont have the luxury of several capable alts to swap betweeni think that the next key step will be to see what ccp propose for their sovereignty solution if it leads to a substantial increase in nullsec density if it leads to fractured politics and to more independent powers and if it rewards those who get into space and fight for their sov or for the sov of others that they want to take then i believe that it will just be a matter of tweaking the jump fatigue system perhaps in some of the ways you suggesti rather like the suggestion of separate queues any mechanic that stops people having fun without a very good reason is a poor one and the idea that i cannot use a blops bridge to hit a ratter because i have a strat op later is as you suggest essentially a blocking mechanic

actions speak louder than words chanceyou claim to care about the status of pve and the new player experienceyou say that i think this statement is quite funny and contradictory considering that you and your corp members are harassing and blackmailing streamers and even make them quit entirely whose sole purpose was to show new players some pveexploration content and how to get a foothold in eve in gerneraljust to make clear i dont care about ingame blackmailing scamming suicide ganking and whatnot thats all part of the gamebut just as a comparison how could i take someone seriously whos claiming to stand for pve and the npe but at the same time is wardeccing eveuni and killing newbrosthats why i think the purpose of this whole candidacy is not primarily to help the game but to boost your own egoas you might have already guessed no i will not vote for youregardsdamjannow you all can spam me with your htfu posts i dont careproposal  new inventory  item hangar

please put the cosmos agents  mission on ccpgames radar for updating you got my vote for your lore platform
1 thoric for csm xi agree with a lot of his ideas and think that it would be good to have him on the csm you have my vote
another worthwhile candidate
thoric is the future of eve
i would like to say that i dont know someone else better prepared for this kind of work than migui its someone who always got your back whenever you need it knows a lot about the game and has a lot of interaction with the people123393204839 anyone who knows him would say the same
as a true friend and helpful mentor i must gladly promote my true friend cycule for this position he has been playing with me for a while now and helped me improve in pvp this man is a great fc pilot that really cares about the pvp side of eve he really knows the ins and outs of what almost everone is using in eve and why i have also seen this man be a true help to his friends in need as well as step up to the plate when requested i have never seen this man turn down a challenge without first thinking though all the scenarios possible for the best outcome so if i was to chose the right person to push for this campaign it would be cycule because i know hes not doing it for the title but truly to help everyone who plays eve get what we want
very happy to see that you have decided to put your hat in the gameno one better to represent the individual players in my opinion cycule has been an integral feature in our corporation he is always offering to help in support of the members endeavors whatever that might be he is there for the little guy it sounds like he has some sound ideas for improvements i am interested to hear more about faction mining barges cycule definetly has my vote
recently xander phoena and i sat down to discuss his csm x campaign listen here
massive thanks to the cap stable guys for this interview and all the work they have done this election seasoni wrote up a little piece following up some of the accusations that have been aimed at me this election season now that ccp have definitively stated there were zero csm breaches this term
recently i sat down with citricioni to discuss his run for csm you can listen here
its a terrible tedious mechanic which reduces both the total number of fights happening and the quality of these fights nvm if you dont understand that this is not the place to discuss that issue
oh noooooo my english devery small scale group use offgrid links if you dont use them you make it wrong
so far i have to say that your platform seems a little small and flimsy to me alright you would like to see more power and opportunity given to smaller and alliancecoalition independent social groups like your npsi and thats fine and dandy but i have yet to see some more concrete ideas on what is actually wrong with things how they actually are and what should be done to fix it especially since at least to my knowledge ccp has already taken notice of the issue and is thinking of ways to improve upon the social aspect of the game in your opinion what are the biggest issues an independent npsi community like yours has to face what would you like to see in the game that improves the situation for such communities in nullsec with only a few exceptions there are vast regions of space with nothing to shoot but low bounty rats only sprinkled with a few systems where you will inevitably face the blob and get shitstomped by endless hordes of ishtars t3 strategic clinkers or worse i suppose we can agree that this has to do with the nature of nullsec and the state of sov that favors the apex force and n1 tactics to throw a few buzzwords around now ccp is allegedly working on this as well but what is your stance and how do you think this could be remedied if you think this needs to be remedied at all in lowsec while at least in my opinion the situation is not as bad it can still be hard for a commander of a few tens of random scrubs to get a decent fight for fun more often than not one finds himself running into or running from again nigh unkillable t3 cruisers or again boring as  ishtars do you see room for improvement here or should people just htfu and fly legions and proteususussi themselves when will we see the birth of the stille gewalt procurer doctrine can i bring a drake
you seem to imply staying in a system with a cloak active is some kind of problem why
i know its a late introduction abut since i managed to actually get myself on the ballot and ive received emails stating introduce yourself i figured it was timeso who am iim that guy that sat in your class for ten years and you still have no idea who he is i dont typically thrust myself into the limelight and though ive had an effect in several alliances i remained relatively unknown until recently basicaly im that very experienced null sec guy who started his life in high sec learned the joys of pvp and tested it in all sorts of places i spent some time years ago running a mercenary corp in high sec pirated and spent lots of time out in nullso why did you run for csmit started off in my podcast with manny joking around about being able to wear pink thongs in station although this is obviously not the highlight selling point for me it got me thinking about actually running seriously ive never paid much attention to the csm as i always considered them a popularity contest however in the last couple of year some of the joys and wonder that was eve had started to fade for me that excitement i had 8 years ago fighting with scalar federation for terribad space in pure blind was missed theres two ways i could have gone with that find a new game or inspire myself in eve i decided to build the alliance  corporation and go that routewhat does this have to do with running for csmi want to represent the little guy null sec is stagnant and because of it everything else in eve is mostly affected by this there are really only a couple of coalitions out there in this player run game and because of it nothing happens this is one of my primary concerns and id love the chance to work with ccp on solutions for it ive had some pretty radical ideas that would entirely revamp gameplay so i dont think they will be put in place but could at least open up new avenues of thinkingthe tiny alliance i created and am currently building is not part of a massive block and has every intention of messing with massive blocks to see what can be accomplished eve needs more smaller groups fighting thriving and creating content this has a cause and effect across all of eve high sec gankers are often bored alts prices are inflated low sec is often the big guys rolling over the little guys for moons still all stuff that needs to changeif you want to get to know more about me my style and general thoughts on eve check out my blog it has months worth of thoughts opinions ideas and concepts of the life of a non coalition playerkasken kronicleshit me up here or in game with questions comments concerns and anything else you can think ofeve match csm ballot questionnaire
hi kasken  glad to see someone from the latest group put up a threadi spent some time browsing your blog looks like you started a corp flew with n3 for a while left there flew with bl for a while and then struck out for npc null stain with your corp and founded a new alliance so lets get a bit more detailed do you intend to remain in npc null for the long haul or is it a staging area for an eventual run to sov if the first then what is the shortlist of things you think could be done to make npc null more viable on its own as a whole separate area of space different from sov null how do you convince people to stay and play if the second what are the top priorities you have that youd like to see ccp consider as part of the sov revamp for bonus points you can answer both  what drove you to leave n3 what drove you to leave bl what are the most important lessons youve learned in running your own corp and alliance author of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
1 i can safely say no we have moved out of stain and are currently living in detorid we are building  growing for a little bit before we strike for our own sov npc null to me is like low sec without gate guns so it was never really the long haul plan stain as a non sw member is terriblei think having pirate factions that one can run missions for out there makes it very independent from sov as it is perhaps adding some npc null specific anomalies with appropriate rewards not found elsewhere could also add to its appeal finally the quality of space in npc null should be bumped up a bitsov revamp there are so many ways of doing it isk sinks by themselves really wont cut it n3  cfc will just raise rental rates and people will pay i would personally love to see a couple of different methods in actiona moons get mined out and respawn elsewhere in eve similar to when a site is run it appears in another anomaly but on a much grander scale b systems that are unused have their true sec gradually decrease ie an unused system for x time would reach truesec 10 heavily used systems would raise up to a base 00 truesec this could force migration and movement instead of huge swaths of underpopulated space2 the corp i was in chose to leave nulli and went to fw for a while i was in the process of leaving the us army at the time so played in fw a bit and then moved back across the country and was inactive during that time a large chunk of the corp reformed their old group and into the ether fell apart3 i left black legion because they were toxic and immature i have a blog post about it and rather than retype it all i will provide the link to the reasoning for my departure form bllinky4 the most important lesson is quite easy delegation a ceo who does everything themselves burns out eve is challenging and running a successful corp requires a large set of skills and dedication you have to trust and delegate tasks to people to spread out the workloadthe other equally important thing is communication without clear communication people start to feel left out and lose site of what is going on poor communication is often the first cracks in a corps foundation
given that corporations in eve are really just collections of people do you think that trading stocks would have any real valueie what would the driver of value be in trading stocks
i find the question odd as real corporations in real life are really just collections of people as well but ill answer it as best i can for example my corp has run what we call projects where a bunch of people give us money in exchange for stocks then the project uses the money to do something say buy poss set them up in a wormhole then run reactions and it pays dividends to the shareholders through the corp interfacecurrently this only works with people we trust since a random person in the galaxy doesnt have any means of trading the stock with us with a stockmarket anyone can trade the shares with anyone personally id like our project shares to be available to trade with anyonethis opens up new means of gathering wealth like you could issue 100000 shares in your corp but keep 25000 of them and then sell them later once the value of the shares has gone upclearly this is open to nasty things like insider trading and various scams but as i said before thats a much more interesting set of problems than just wondering if the share sale will be honored or not with the current system
you say you are currently a game designergame programmer are you aware of the nda provisions that prohibit current employees of competitors to ccp from being on the csmccp employees isd volunteers ccp interns ccp affiliates ccp strategic partners or employees of other gaming companiesgames and family members of ccp are all ineligible to run for the csm
i didnt think of my employer as a competitor as the project ive been on is a mobile golf game thanks for the heads up and im guessing i will be ineligible if this is the case i am sorry for having wasted peoples time
best to come clean with ccp and explicitly clarify  they might only be concerned with mmos
your campaign ad
gorga has my full unconditionnal support he is the shadow man who works a lot but will never brag about itgodspeed gorga 210 video thats extremely unpleasant you redefined the meaning of atrocity
here you go
thank you very much
hey dmitry ive missed you snookums sorry about the red coat missing but to be fair this new one is legit i get to swing the ebil space emperor look im glad you came in to clear this up regarding banes experience while flying with you guys as a self proclaimed and retired king and i dont care if hidden gets flustered lol 3 u too its my game my rules point is that ive never interacted with bane and ive interacted with many many of the active wormholers and groups over the years the players ive worked and played with were the people that i feel have been involved in wormholesthis is from his candidate snapshot very involved since their creation i started wormholes fall of 2009 annnnnnd i dont know who bane is and never crossed paths with him ever this seems like a shill attempt to garner votes in an area that some think will yield votes by simply saying wormholes nope we may be one of the hardest critics of csm candidatesbanebefore you or someone cries out that i dont understand check this out i understand full well what you and every other candidate is going through you clearly dont have the time knowledge or experience to be running this yeari suggest you just forfeit the campaign and bow out save yourself the headache bud like i suggested to others before you you should get involved over the next year as an individual contributor and then run for csm next year prove to players that you are active and involved in the community you will go much farther and be far better received wormholers are ironically a tight community and we have our drama but we still know and support our own in our own way get involved with the community before you try to be our representative
here it is
title says it all
not the right forum section but
never thought of having the dust devs work on it like thati am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 strongly not supportedthe lack of risk in null sec has been a driving force in the stagnation of sov null the ability to almost instatravel from one side of new eden to the other has spawned mega coalitions and mostly empty systems the jd nerf was
sugar kyle and i will be holding a sounding board for people to come and chat about structure with ccp nullarborstuff that will be discussed arealternate ideas for capture destroying structuresbeing safe and or aggressing ships around structures outpostsposdesployablesthe meeting will take place on thursday the 26th feb at 1900 eve time it will be on a ts server details being sent out the day before to people wanting to come alongif youd like to come along please post below
yeah id like to come along unless its at a horrible time
i really hope intel gathering from both a structure owneroccupant and visitors to a systems perspective will also be considered greatly when designing thesea station just wont be acceptable for wh space
sure ill be there 
stations will be fine in wormholes when they can be destroyed there and nullsec
no they really wont bei think the failure of takeup from wh entities of the thera experiment should be proof enough to ccp that stations in wh space with all their limitations with intel gathering and docking games do not belong
i will do my best to make it
highsec wardecs are broken in my opinion too much power lies in the hands of the aggressor and any newer industrial corp is going to struggle to do anything in the event of a war i say this as someone who started out their eve career in a highsec pure pve corp that had absolutely no pvp players inside of itwhen the first wardec came we were still incredibly unprepared it came from a merc corp who would basically come to our system cloak up in a deep safe and sit around all day afk waiting for both our members to reach low levels of activity and the pirate corporation we were working with to log off they would then hit us over and over again until everyone was in stations spinning ships since a lot of them couldnt even begin to fit a starter combat frigate we had members that were often less than a couple of months old everyone else were carebears for lifeeven as we got better with dealing with wartime it was a bit too little too late more and more corporations were dogpiling onto the wardec at one point there wasnt an hour in the day which you could be logged on and not have wartargets cloaked throughout the system this is the point we were actually able to get some of our pirate friends to start helping us with the wardecs they were limited though as they werent massive lumbering corporations so they could only help us with a few of our most difficult wardecs even then we werent able to make a dent even though there was an effort from many people to try and get some kills against these dec corps major problems were things such as lots of neutral logi in system to break any wts out of any jams as well as the majority of fights either being quick fast engagements against a lone ship that couldnt be saved or they were fought on station where the wts knew enough about the aggro system and knew how to use neutral logi alts well enough that they were guaranteed not to lose anything i believe at one point we had a proteus falcon drake and a brutix all piling onto a wt we had baited into engaging on station only for him to land two neutral logis on top of station and rep the ship long enough so that it could dockwe were only able to resolve the wardecs after i was able to befriend even more pvp corps in the area there were about 45 pvp corps one of which was comprised of about 100 people and the other which came from nullsec that we were able to uproot all of these wardecs and get them off our back we had been in a constant war for nearly three months and even with the help of somewhat competent pvpers the wars ended with us just barely able to deal out about a billion isk in kills to the few billion we had suffered it ultimately led to the corporation falling apartive kind of rambled a bit but i wanted there to be a personal touch to help understand where im coming from when i put down my next pointsnpc corporations are not a real option whoever is pushing this meme has no idea what a corporation can mean to players and are generally people who think that corporations should fit some ideal theyve made up in their head corporations act as a rallying point for players to come together and work towards a single more clearly focused goal it is not a place just for pvpers to stack their leet kbs under a single banner they are for everyone not just the people that have been artificially decided that these are the kind of people who can have corporations without being rektif a merc corp can bribe concord to start a war why can an industrial corporation not bribe concord to invalidate it this at least gives an indy corp to use its natural abilities to counteract war decs if you pay 50mil isk to start a war why cant an indy corp pay 100mil to invalidate it if you really think the war dec is worth it you can double down and pay 200mil to keep it going let it keep going it would create at least some risk for a wardec corporation because as of right now unless theyre just bad at life most wardec corps worth a dime arent going to start a fight with someoone they dont think they can absolutely pulverize with absolutely no risk the corps that are most vulnerable are the corps which are new and dont have the means to fight for themselves to conclude the corp is still dead and save for a few people i dont even see any old corp members log on anymore at our peak before the wardec there were about 60 of us we were starting to participate in npsi fleets starting to buddy up with local industrial and pvp corps and were generally just being a group of noobs making something out of what we had over the course of three months and dozens of war decs this was very slowly eroded away until there wasnt anything left to this day i still hop from corp to corp looking for a corp that is reminiscent of the corp that i had been apart of before nonstop wars tore it apart tldr highsec wardec bs isnt beneficial for anyone except the aggressors and suppresses the growth of new corps that dont want to lump in with major blocs that are already in power
the reverse is true the defender has both the option to dec dodge and make the wardec disappear without any consequence or work on their part as well as bring in functionally unlimited allies for freethey have far far more options in that regard than the aggressor does then everyone needs to put some effort into defending themselves or do you actually think you should be able to reap the rewards meager as they are without doing the same work as everybody else because that would make the mechanic utterly and totally pointless thus revealing your true objective the same as any carebearyou want perfect safety without having to work for it the answer is too bad
they dont have the option to dodge a wardec you can only drop corporation this works if you have a well established corporation not a new corporation full of people who still dont understand basic eve mechanics doing what such as recruiting 4 pvp alliances to join in the wardec like i said i did theres only so much you can do against people who will sit afk cloaky in your systems all day some members even tried moving across the galaxy they were followed over 30 jumps to be killed by war deccers as soon as they had a chance to use a locator agent to find them what rewards i dont pve thats how i started out but youre free to pull that card if youd like i have been in many pvp corporations following that corporation which has been wardeccd who has said the same thing as any industrial corp avoid major traffic systems dont get caught out alone etc etcno i want to meet in the middle you want it to either be black or white its not functional when you only look at it in black and white there are legitimate reasons to use wardecs your corp is new and easy targets isnt a legitimate reason for corps to be able to keep 50 active wardecs open at all times this could be as simple as limiting the amount of simultaneous wardecs at a time there is no legitimate reason for anyone to wardec 50 corps at the same time
it works regardless because reforming a corporation is almost free no you dont you want to handwave any and all wardecs away with isk thats not the middle thats a drastic shift in your favor in a situation which already strongly favors the defender yes it is its a sandbox game and that means because i felt like it is a good enough excuse for anything there it is again trying to disqualifyyes there is a legitimate reason because they feel like doing it people should never be handcuffed so badly that they have to have a reason good enough for you to justify shooting at you
which is a terrible solution to an obvious problem of war decs being easily abused no that was an offhand suggestion i made youre just going after it like im about to put it into the next releases patch notes or something the entire point of the thread from what i saw was to possibly brainstorm solutions until it becomes because there isnt a good reason the only reason is to grief and troll and to circlejerk to tired old htfu meme and talk about tearsit doesnt do anything to benefit the sandbox it actually works against a sandbox since it turns a valley of options into a peak of one action which is troll corps wardeccing anything with a pulse who wont fight against them
diplomacy  my first corporation was full of newbies i was one of them and was war decced the ceo talked with the enemy ceo a deal was made where my corporation would would cobble together some kind of fleet and meet at a certain gate at a certain time win or lose they would drop the war afterwards it was fun for us newbies because we got to experience a battle it was fun for them because they got the fight they wanted everyone wonconsolidate and operate in groups  yeah my first corp did this too there is safety in numbers at first our incomes were anemic because we were all sharing but we learned how to keep safe by the end of the war we had all learned how to effectively blitz multiple missions in groups bringing our incomes back to where they were beforeuse ewar lots of ewar  when the tables turned and i took up the trade of ransoming corporations my group and i ran into a carebear group that had teeth they had consolidated themselves into one station and as soon as we started camping them they all came in griffins and scrammed and jammed our ships we could only dock up to save ourselves rinse and repeat for a day or sothe end result was my corporation left them alone and let the war expire after a weekbring friends  you do not need 4 pvp alliances to attack your assailants just one active and bloodthirsty one will do pay for their war dec or let them join in as an ally for free and let nature take its coursethere is no shortage of pvp corporations looking for free valid war targets all you need to do is spread the wordyou have options the trick is that you have to stop thinking like a victim and start thinking like a moose have you ever encountered a moose those suckers are mean putting up a posputting up a pococollecting taxes for collective activitieshaving a common wallet for funding collective activitiesbeing able to rent a common hanger for holding collective assetsa banner effectively declaring who you are to the rest of the gamethe ability to declare war against another group that is annoying youthe first two there can actually reap some huge rewards if you put them up in the right areas andor use them in the right waysbut if you have no use for any of the above then you probably should not have created a corporation in the first place what you are actually looking for is a common chat channelthe problem is that compared to where we were a couple of years ago we are already in the middle in a few more years people who come into the game will see the new middle we establish today will think that it is too extreme then start asking for a new middlefrom a wider perspective this is nothing more than a constant moving of the goalpostsas for legitimacy again this is a sandbox you cant put artificial conditions on one play style on the basis that you personally dont find it legitimatethe reason for this is that it opens the door for others to make the same argument against you and your play stylewhich i have pointed out numerous times in this thread
its actually a textbook exploit and one that used to be punishable but sadly is no longerand being able to use a mechanic is not abuse its there to be used how anyone sees fit just because you dont think something is a good reason does not make it invalid because they felt like it is always always 100 of the time a good enough reason in a sandbox game it does not matter if you disagree you dont get to curtail their freedom as players if you cant deal with that you are playing the wrong game this game has player freedom i suggest you pick one that doesnt
we did do diplomacy read my posts skim less diplomacy is how we partnered with 4 different alliances from lowsec pirates to some nullsec alliances that were interested in having an industrial wing diplomacy doesnt happen overnight and consolidation doesnt matter if youre playing by your opponents clock you cant ewar what wont fight your fleets we actively ran fleets in conjunction with the pvp corporations as well as getting many of our members into npsi fleets in order to help get them trial by fire pvp training blood thirst doesnt matter if someone isnt going to fight them they can bare their fangs all they want but they arent the ones who get to dictate the pace of the battles the wardeccers get to dictate because theyre generally more experienced players with alts who are involved in many activities against noobs who have a single account we are always in war they are only when its convenient for them or when they have an advantage in numberswhat need does a noob corp have for a highsec pos so we can lose money on manufacturing because any ore you get is free yeah that level 1 mission tax money is a sweet rewarding nectarbecause war mechanics are poor for anyone except the aggressor its incredibly to their advantage because they get to make all of the decisions especially when they are wardeccing a corp that is very newbecause they are used as a way to circumvent concord in a lot of the cases rather than to create any sort of gameplay its being used as a loophole around highsec engagement rules rather than as a way for corporations to resolve disputes further their own goals etc its for people who dont want to leave highsec but still want to do pvp
this i can agree with dropping a corp to avoid a wardec shouldnt be allowed but neither should a situation in which its been made to be a legitimate strategy by troll wardecs im not against wardecs im against how easily they are abused people will just make blanket wardecs hitting a bunch of random corps in hopes that more targets will turn up this is abusive of a mechanic which creates the problem you mentioned this ruins the possibility of wardeccing any corp in a way to disrupt their actions because they can just leave and join another corporation which is more than likely why there is a larger amount of war deccers who just do it for easy killsthe player has as much freedom to express their opinions about the direction of the game as they do to play the game thats player freedom i do think its illegitimate and i think the very fact that i would as well as many others only post about it on an alt says a lot about the current state of affairs in eve since its a sandbox im going to continue to use the forums and any other medium i can find in order to bring attention to the blatant abuse of wardec mechanics in a way to circumvent highsec engagement rules because im free to do that stop curtailing my freedoms bro
oh it really does that some people dont want to play the game they want it changed to suit them firstand thats so incomparably selfish that i almost cant believe itoh and it doesnt matter one bit if you dont think the way wardecs are used is legitimate or not they are
that is literally what they are forconcord stifles gameplay wardecs exist solely to allow people around that loathsome mechanic you can take your resolve disputes and your ehonor and go play a different game clearly you dont want to play eve
see here is the thing eve is a competitive pvp sandbox the only reason your industrial activities have any meaning is because we are all fighting each other in many ways and on many levels often trying to destroy each others assets this creates the demand for very industrial output that fuels the entire economypure pveindustry corps are not really suppose to exist of course they can  this is a sandbox after all  but the mechanics have always been such that corporations are suppose to compete with each other highsec is not intended to shield them from player conflict but rather just provide some support so a new or small corp can get on their feet you are suppose to be responsible for your defense as often the tactics of your competitors will not always be to try to outcompete you but rather attack you directlygoing with sports analogy again a pure pve corp is like putting together a baseball team of players that are all excellent at throwing and catching the ball but have never picked up a baseball bat in their life such a team is not going to have much success in an actual baseball game there is a place for someone who only likes to do pve or industry in this game just like the best pitchers in the major league may not be able to hit the ball to save their life but it is as part of a team the game mechanics have been designed as such so you need to arrange for your defense with others whether through joining an alliance a more informal arrangement with some pvpers or through hiring mercenaries you cannot abdicate your defense and still expect to earn the rewards of a player corp that is the point the corporation is the competitive unit of eve you join one to carve our your place or to achieve your goal in the sandbox that means people may choose to resist you or try to stop you and that is exactly why wardecs exist i do think there should be a social corp for players who dont actually have a goal but just like mining or missioning with friends for fun they should be like an npc corp and with all the current restrictions but would give a common identity to more casual players who are not really trying to compete as was said above this is a terrible idea as it favours established and wealthy players new players would become the preferred target of wardeccers and this is the exact opposite of what we should be trying to encourage spend that money on hiring mercenaries insteadthis is working as intended your industrial corp was unbalanced and apparently too much of your energy was spent on earning profit and not enough on establishing a defense take what you have learned and rebuild either under the same name or start a new corp this time making sure to prepare yourselves from disruption by your competitors and not making the same mistake of fitting your corp only for yield eve is a dark competitive place she will test you but as long as you are still willing to try you can always claw your way back no matter how hard she smacks you down
a corp full of noobs should probably disband tbh because its almost certainly never going to get anywhere
actually its not a bad idea to fly it empty unless you do it afk which is why giving that ship a cargo scan immunity was such a bad idea if flew correctly it already had itive had the same br since it was able to fit a covert cloak fully t2 fit for cargo and never once been shot at even when moving really expensive itemsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
you do realise that engaging brain before hitting undock is an eula violation right also its just so unfair to the newbies

mmmmm  i feel all warm and rosey now thanks
heh thats actually pretty close to what ive been kicking round its not a major part of the csm job to propose things but they humour us by letting us do it anyway
well should not we hope for more to get less in right direction on the other hand i do understand such big changes cant be done right away  even if considered to be good ideas  its a lot of work thinking balancing and devil in details stuff yet this probably can help ccp devs with general ideas for future of the ingame mechanicsand gl with csm x

so gonna go ahead and ask this because i cant read through 6 pages on a mobile that can barely show 4 lines of text at a time and i sure as hell wotn rememebr to come back laterwhat defines a 5050 win chance in ganks is it 1 miner versus 1 ganker is it based on 1 miner versus a 5man ganking squadhow do you scale mechanics that no matter how many gankers there are the miner has a 5050 chance of being safe and how does that eman balanced or another approach how do you determine what a fair number of gankers is to start the 5050 chance at should 1 ganker have no chance to kill a miner should it take 10 for a 5050 chance what shipbase are you basing the gankers flying with this catalyst atron nado etc do gankers now have to travel in groups of 25 tornadoes just to kill a freighterin short how complicated must you make ganking without changing anything needed by the minertrader before its balancededit if the psot if too long that already answers what im asking just tell me the page its on make my poor life easier with this terrible terrible excuse for a smartphone
still thank you for stopping by anywayok some of the things  ideas i have said on this subject in various foruminterview and stuff teach the new players about dscan as part of the npe introduce some randomness in concord response times both longer and shorter than currently an active selfdestuct module that would allow a nonafk minerfreighter to take most of his stuff with him if he choosesi can understand that with so many candidates you dont feel that you have time to read all the threads and listen to the interviews et cetera but if you really want to know you really should read the thread and listen to the interviews
thanks for the responseand i do try and read most fo the threads and interviews its just there are alot so i have to prioritize and not to be offensiv here but i try and restrict that to the candidates with the highest likelihood of reelection so i can judge my opinion on whether to support them or look for someone else because franly its difficult for an independent to compete with a main party whnullsec community backed candidates or an entrenched member because lets face it if someone was reelected once their chances of being reelected again are decently boosted

i live in deep null and always have done due to family commitments i am not currently in a strong pvp corp or alliance i come on when i can and mess about a bit often having to sort out the kids cook dinner put someone to bed etc so i spend a fair amount of the time i am logged on either docked or possed up family life isnt compatible with fleets and roamsi have been playign now for 7 years and have a fair few friends in eve several of which i encouraged to start playing some are in high sec running missions since my alliance is always war decced it isnt exactly possible for me to spend any game time with them unless i leave or get them to join my alliance this is the problem i have with the current war dec system and i think it really hurts new player retention i cant actually play with the people i have recruited into the game and if i dont i think there is a much lower chance of them staying aroundim posting this here to encourage some discussion on the issue and see if you from the other side of the war dec fence can see a way this aspect of the game which looks broken as hell from my point of view can be improved
well you could drop corp and return to highsec to play with your friends or you could train an alt and use that to play in highsec or you could ask your friends to come to npc nullsec jump in a wh or go have fun in lowsec i have the same problems as you have always at war and i cant go to nullsec and just cruise around a bit in my vindicator does that make nullsec broken or should i just adapt 
this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasmake sure new features that encourage small groups actions like the siphons for example do not get nerfed to uselessness before they are introduced by the established power groupsi chose to highlight siphons because i believe the way they have been released and discussed is very representative of the way features intended for one play style that ccp recognizes actively yet get little support from the csm because of a lack of independent active voicesas a note i do not use siphons myself for reasons i will explain more in a moment this is sad as i have been very excited about them when they were released the concept of guerilla warfare is one that i believe both independent solo players and small groups share a similar taste for this is the ccp page introducing siphons it is all about guerillawarfare and this dev blog present siphons as introducing an asynchronous gameplay something that is significant for the smaller entities i cant dream to go head to head with a fleet of more than 2 or 3 individual players so asynchronous gameplay is fairly attractive to me and can generate smaller engagements i can take where a timer is just a lost cause in my case the following community thread ended up being 77 pages long two members of the csm participated publicly one in a very minimal way at the beginning ali aras while mynna representing the goons kept her activity in that thread pretty high together with plenty of other goons this is interesting because of course they represent the main target of this new feature so after a while ccp decided to make a change at which point mynna mostly disappeared from the thread i cant know what happened behind the scene but it seems obvious that the goons got what they wanted from ccp i wish that another csm member representing the other side would have been as active as mynna has been on that topic to defend the siphons there was certainly no shortage of players debating in favor of the siphons effects and as a csm member believing in asynchronous gameplay and guerilla warfare i would have been all over that thread tooso siphons got released their waste factor reduced from 20 to 10 the power groups managed to reduce the more obvious damage to their production line as siphoned content themselves can always be recovered once the siphon presence is identified for reasons that i do not know about ccp did not follow up on their promise that the siphons would not be identifiable by api and naturally there is no pressure anymore to fix this as it benefits the power block with a quick and automated identification of the leaksfrom my point of view siphons are mostly useless until the apis stop ratting them out and that is a pity there are certainly a few things i would have advocated for them like making them recoverable instead of being a certain net loss with a uncertain benefit for the people deploying them as well as doubling the steal output with no wastage for the first 6 hours after being deployed then having the current rates after that and a wastage factor increasing to 20 after the first day of them being deployedif i am elected i will use my influence to defend the features that would allow beneficial guerilla against the larger groupsversion franUFFFDaise
no wurries jens i hope people just vote ofcourse i prefer a number one spot but in general i hope people care enough about eve and go vote that they remain positive versus bittervet any voter is a person who cares for eveballots hold 14 spots i recommend people read up do diedra s voting match and vote mutiple persons 77 nerds out therr to vote on including me provi and null sec addict

bobmon is good guy  1
bobby ending up in csm should at the very least give us some interesting noteslets just hope he doesnt end up having to be the one editing em dedit  12  but only because he asked nicely
top priority
1 for a good csm candidate
dutch are 11
of all the applicants in the csm i like you the best youre a newer player and you dont have an agenda for yourself you create content you share it with others via youtube and because youre not in any of the major power blocks you dont have any political issues in the gameyou dont inherantly dislike anyone for their past exploits in the game you deliver torpedoes mercilessly to complete strangers without prejudicei dont know you personaly but in my opinion it doesnt seem like youre in it to boost your ego like so many others youre in it because you played the game you created a successful corporation and you think itd be cool to be on the csm for the experience and to share your views on the gameplay you lovei feel like when ccp bounces ideas off you you will give them due research and timethis is why i think you out of all the csm applicants will be the best person to analyse current and upcoming csm topicsim a very harsh and critical person and have already posted negative thoughts on other peoples csm campaigns i dont praise people often but out of everyone that has applied for csm so far youre the best candidate in my opinion
that matches a lot of what i have talked about with the npe and the lore integration i think it is a logical thing to push for
its yours now
i would like to echo this us lawn members here showing support are doing so because we appreciate the dedication and competency that weve known thoric for in his duties as our alliance leader perhaps one of the most important distinctions id like to raise is that being an alliance leader in eve is a volunteer job thoric isnt getting paid for any of the time he spends here he has no evemedia site generating adrevenue for him he is doing this because he has a passion and care for this game and the community that shares it all of us players of eve would be very fortunate as a community if we get to enjoy having thoric as a csm member

he is very strong candidate in regards with his communication to the community his desire to see a more robust 00 landscape and his desire to see supers and titans become more useful but hopefully not game breaking as they wereare now however his stance on input duplication hes against it and his unknown position on other multiboxing tools leaves me very concerned i hope he accepts my request for an discussion on one of our podcasts soon
your english was ok but you sounded nervous as hell
whats your personal background in real life what kind of work are you in does it help your chances of election in your opinion why or why notim a graduate student finishing up an ma in geography at the moment i help professors in my department with their classes i dont think knowing my personal backgroundwork will help or hurt my chances in the election but i do think that if i win my background will help make me a better csm representative i can analyze problems and look at them from a broader perspective as if eve is a country that needs to be financially stable with a sustainable and growing populationif you werent running but you could singlehandedly ensure that any other person in eve would be elected to csm who would you pick and whysugar kyle while i may not know much about lowsec she certainly does i hope she runs and wins every year as long as she plays the game its easy to see how much she cares about the longterm health of eve and that is needed one every iteration of the csmother than eve what was your favorite game last year 2014clash of clans an army friend got me into it and its great for those long warps in 90 tidiwhat was your experience with lowsec in the pastminimal i spent a few months in lowsec prior to going to sov nullsec i mined some and did a little pvp but was mainly there to just hang out with some friends theyre the ones i initially joined in moving to nullsecwhat kind of UFFFDadditional challenging and dangerous pve contentUFFFD would you like to see brought to lowsecim not very familiar with lowsec so until i spoke with someone like sugar kyle and got her feedback on whether lowsec has enough income streams i wouldnt have any suggestions there are probably some income streams that already exist which could be updated with additional difficulty or challenges im a big fan of the hacking games in nullsecwhat did you learn from your run for csm 9 that you think will help you this yearpublicity is necessary to get voteswhat marks you apart from the plethora of nullsec candidates running this year other than your alliance tickermy personality and perspective on eve but thats going to be different for every single candidate on the ballot if youre asking what i think makes me uniquely appealing id say that im a nice guy who likes to listen enjoys giving thoughtful feedback and want to see everyone enjoy the game even if its not the part of space that i enjoy
in your opinion what could be done to encourage a more active pursuit of kill rights ie true bounty hunting as opposed to the current common theme of stumbling upon people and reaping some side benefits for an action you were already going to commitnonexpiring bounties id propose changing the bounty system so that they never expire until the bounty is claimed but the person who put the bounty on someone should be able to remove it as well i think the bounty system could also be integrated into the locator agent system so that hunting is more of a career than a difficult hobbydo you think that attributes should be removed entirely from eve online if so why if not what do attributes contribute in terms of valuable game play that warrant them stayingno i dont theyre useful but underused i think ccp needs to change the current skill queue some more so that skillbooks can be injected at skill level 0 but not trainable until the prerequisites are trained a tutorial for new players explaining the skill queue character attributes impact on skill training and training implants should be thorough underuse shouldnt be misinterpreted as useless lack of knowledge can be remedied with educationyour campaign thread seems to be floundering a bit suffering from a drought in terms of attention do you feel you have a better shot this year than you did last if you fail will you run again next yearif i have the time next year ill run again people with things to say online tend to generally be at one end or the other of the agreedisagree spectrum the other candidates getting questions and giving good answers deserve attention they may be better candidates than me in general and some are certainly better than me for players looking for regional representatives of wormhole or lowsec space i do think that i have a better chance this year than lastwhat is your stance on offgrid boosting do you think it is a valid game play mechanic as in your words UFFFDoffgrid t3 boosts are not completely invulnerableUFFFD or would you like to see changes made to force them to be active participants in fightsits part of the game mechanics at the moment but i think it gives older players a distinct advantage over newer ones the only suggestion that ive heard for nerfing them that i didnt disagree with is that they could have a nerf to their bonuses based on range in other words the further a player is from the booster the lower his bonuses would be this wouldnt necessarily force boosters ongrid since there are tons of broken grids across eve i suppose the players who sell virtue sets would be unhappy thoughfinally if voters knew nothing else about you what would you want that one thing to beabove all else i want to see corporate management pos mechanicsmanagement and planetary interaction updated changed or fixed completely rather than patched and i would want the changes released quicker than the sov changes which still have yet to fully be implemented while nullsec waits impatiently my forum campaign thread explains my opinions and suggestions on these things in more detail

i did quite a bit of blogging about csm 8s elections tenure and actions at the end of the year i posted my personal perception of csm 8 grades i would have given while i cant claim to be an insider or know what happened in individual sessions i did do a lot of analysis of what did become publictldr i gave sort a c the only reason it wasnt lower is because he did in fact participate in summitsonly kesper north got a lower grade f for not appearing at allin my book 13 of 14 does not merit another shotauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
many times i hear those in player corps wanting people to leave an npc corp im asked what would i need to be offered or have changed to get me to leave cas ive discussed just that a number of times in fleet or in corp chat with others in cas and player corps sometimes the discussions are short sometimes long and many varied points of view come out when it is discussedlets be honest npc corps are looked at by player corps and player corp members in many cases as a drain from possible recruits they are seen as useless boring worthless by others and even then the disparaging comments of others go far further so lets look in a bit of detail at what i feel are the absolute successes of cas which some but not even a majority of player corps can say with confidence theyve found as well and upon looking at these successes see what i feel should be worked on by all corporations and the ccp devs to bring about truly positive changes in eve onlines imagethe center for advanced studies for many new players they dont even know theyve selected a npc corp during character creation but suddenly they are in it and fairly lost at any given time several hundred players are active in cas many not even bothering to say a single word in corp chat or unable to due to language barriers but here is the new player and heshe is asking about joining a corp or how to do something that the tutorials cover and those tutorials are a massive failure the responses from sometimes dozens of people those form the foundation of what the players expectations can be for this game and in cas they run the gamut of truly helpful and kind to snide and smug but in the majority of instances you get actual helpful comments and replies in cas from players as young as a few days old to some who have been in cas for over 10 yearsits about community a feeling that hey im not alone here and having people who found a home and spend time in that home helping the newbros who come into it ive been in most of the npc starter corps at one time or another and the only one that had that welcoming feeling that feeling of helpfulness was cas and that that resonates with new players and old it even brings out a feeling of pride in cas members because in cas we do stuffhow many other npc corps have a 247 nullsec presence how many have allied corps of former members that work daily with the npc corp memberscas runs or is a main part of many things in eve cas combat day ccd cas combat guild allied guilds and cas members who roam or live in nullsec cas mining alliance fleet mining daily cashole cas and allied guilds c1 wh cas incursions cas explorations cas pve fleeton the other hand we dont baby newbros if you wont help yourself why should we do it for you eve isnt easy eve takes effort to be successful in but cas can and will help those that need it and are trying to succeedso my counter question is this what does a player corp offer or is willing to do in order to successfully recruit someone that has as much as you do available

civil glad to see a rolo brotha running for csmx ill be back after while to ask some questions but i will say that i may ask you to provide some wormhole credentials to these super groovy voters so we can roll you in as a wormhole candidate as wellwe are lacking that area this year 1
unfortunately civilwars is not on leeloos candidate list and is therefore not a valid candidatetoo bad really author of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
hopefully this will be similar to the issue that psianh and i ran into last year and is just delays in approval because paperworklet us know civil
thanks aram hope things are going well for you my friend
it seems logical to me right the engine already supports quite a few simultaneous players onscreen but work would need to be done to render each custom avatar and clothing to a single texture also a way to group things so that you dont have thousands of players all in the same room perhaps some sort of gridspacing system that naturally keeps people from entering a room that is full so that they have to stand outside obviously some thought and time would need to go into challenges like that but the underlying code would be something i think they should build upon instead of trying to reinvent the wheelalso since the eve incarna portion would not require any shooting mechanics it would enable quite a few more players to be in the same room enabling both small tavernlike places with only room for a certain number of seedy characters or large halls with huge ceilings and multiple levels like mass effects citadel presidiumfurther eve is moving to ondemand assets shortly which allows the eve core game with all things eve legion valkyrie eve spaceships eve barbie in stations downloaded could be 20  50 gb those that only play eve spaceships yet still want to download the entire game can choose to download only the spaceship assets in the eve downloader settings of course the players should decide what they want to play when they enter the eve universe if they leave their captains quarters and take the tube transport to their favorite cantina then the assets will be loaded on demand and the wait for the tube to arrive would also work as a way to load things elevators in real life arent instantaneous nor should they be in evei think were past the original burn jita days and the constant iterations to flying in space is great its now time to rethink how to bring all of the visions of eve together into a single universe
ill be there 
id love to participate
i wont be there but maybe you could ask ccp something if they planing to give the next gen poses forcefields too given that 99 of all issues with poses are caused by them bumping exploits skynet ogbsforcefields invincible titan bridges cynoinsideforcefield tricks you name iti am assuming that poses are still on the roadmap for a redesign

ill try to get along to this one
send me the info id love to come to this
drawing attention to yourself like this will guarantee youll end up with lots of pvpers looking to make your missions in lowsecinterestingwelcome to the sandbox
i actually share the sentiment although the solution should be in the opposite directionit is currently 100 risk free to gank missioners no pvp should be risk freegive all ships an innate point equal to a t1 meta zero point yes rookie ships included eve is a pvp game point should be innate rookiescarebearswhoever else should have the capacity to present risk from day one no matter how small
a corp full of noobs should probably disband tbh because its almost certainly never going to get anywherequoteyeah like bni thats gone nowhere really fastexcept theres nothing that stops this from happening with tweaks to wardec mechanics i am not talking about corps which wardec alliances in order to disrupt their operations intentionally but wardec corps who literally send out wardecs in bunches of 2050 at a time with the entire purpose of fishing for kills they completely negate the idea of risk versus reward since the only people at risk are those who are targeted im not trying to bring an end to highsec wardecs im arguing against fishing corps who abuse a flimsy wardec mechanic in order to get easy kills what does it even cost to wardec most corps 500mil isk at the most is that a joke i made 500mil isk doing incursions on an alt today so i can pay for wardec expenses against any size corp in the gamethey blanket too much area you apparently bribe one political figure and youre covered everywhere this is like bribing a cop in mexico in getting away with murder from the tip of south africa to the streets of moscow people can still retain the ability to use wardecs while limiting their endless arbitrary reach instead of bribing concord to easily throw out wardecs at anything because theres no consequences for the wardeccer make them actually have to do some footwork pay per region rather than a flat incredibly cheap fee that blankets all of known highsec spaceyou can run that eve is a dark place stuff elsewhere ive been playing for five years all across eve in highsec lowsec nullsec and wh space i probably spent about 6 months of that time doing any amount of industry focused gameplay and the rest has been pvp its never changed my view that warsec mechanics are poor and full of holes its a broken feature that is incredibly easy to abuse periodit needs a review even if its not top priority it is something that does need to be looked at in the future in nullsec there are restrictions and how far you can chase someone because of basic game mechanics jump range limits your ability to tear across the universe to endlessly hunt a group of player you can pay renter fees in spaces which you are more welcome in order to have some level of security there are no such barriers in highsec if someone wants to chase you they can follow you until the edge of highsec space with no challenges no risk and no consequences nullsec had its power projection nerf how about for highsec now nerf a highsec wardeccers corps ability to project power across all of highsec with no real cost to them this is the sort of thing id love to see in a future csm candidate someone who sees that there are inherent issues in the highsec wardec mechanics they would have my vote

i will vote for you lorelei lerendi i dont know if the caldari navy intelligence self destruct device is your idea but id love that to be advocatedadditionally as for the bounty mechanics if it hadnt been suggested before i would like to see a bounty hunter skill set raising the payout significantly higher than it is currentlyas for wardeccs and player corporations generally what is your view in raising wardecc cost  concord bribe 10 to 100 fold aswell as corporation creation cost both also could be raised in difficulty with skillsnachbar grUFFFDUFFFDe
thanks for stopping by my thread to ask questions the idea is so good that i am sure that something similar must have been suggested before but i did not read it anywherei actually got the idea whilst listening to code players talking about how undesirable it is to be afk i thought how best to reward a player for not being afk and how a nonafk player in a single account can best defend himself from different forms of ganking that is what i came up withoh and i am sure that the caldari navy intelligence have something like that just do not want to give it out where are the elite spies when you need themsomething has to be done about the bountieswell i have advocated more the nondeccable no pos corporation as a means for players being able to group together and avoid wardecsi think once a wardec is running then it is unfair to the deccer to have it so easily defeated dissolve corp and reform so we need a mechanic that1 allows groups of players to avoid being wardecced in exchange for having as a group no real tangible influence on ingame structures taxes et cetera2 allows wardecs to be meaningful declarations of war that persist until resolved either diplomatically or when no longer paid for3 allows it to be possible to bring in as many allies as wanted  on both sides of a fight the increasing costs per ally make involving other players less likely because people want to hold out to see if good pvpers  mercs want to helpi talked more about this here

this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasmake sure api data availability does not provide too much out of game information and allow some kind of ingame data privacy optionmy goal is not to make api data disappears altogether api have a large role to play in a mmo such as eve and there are a lot of excellent third parties tools that use them butthe amount of information api generates automatically is too prevalent in the metagame and favors large groups with the it capabilities to sift through the data and identify information this is currently too exact without even needing to log in what i support will not fundamentally change available information but as it will involve playersUFFFD action it will not be as exact and will add a fog of UFFFDmetagamingUFFFD war effectmy main focus is around the killboards data as i am not as familiar with the other aspects of the api even if i believe that each api aspect should be looked at with the concept of fog of metagaming war in mind what id like to see regarding the killboards is that players opting for privacy would not have their destroyed modules in any killmails so that the exact value of their fit would not be represented with such accuracy all the other information would still be there as it is now more importantly id like to see a human factor to the data gathering and limit the allautomatic nature of killboard data uploading when apis have only been shared by one side privacy for each character would be considered for any killmail and if any of the pilot involved in the killmail has their privacy setting set to on the killmail would not be automatically uploaded to any killboards but the player receiving the kill mail would still be free to upload those themselves once they have it if all pilots involved have not opted for privacy then it would stay exactly as it is nowthis is the only extent of this aspect of my program and i believe it is fair to intorduce a concept of fog of metagaming war around the apis with more involvement of players choicesi have also mentioned in my post about siphons about the consequence of a too precise api data system that allows to locate wich poses are under a siphon effect from outofgame when api have a direct effect on ingame features there are questions to be asked as i believe it only benefit a specific section of the player base at the expense of othersversion franUFFFDaise

this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasencourage new features that would truly allow for a nomadic life style in new edennew eden is huge and only small parts of its vastness beyond high sec are heavy with activities from the current sovereignty holders null sec or inhabitants low sec and wh while most of it remains nearly deserted except for the automated poses that get only get visited once in a while or the occasional or regular farmer the permanency of the eve servers and single world approach adds to that emptiness from the simple timezones requirements as a system may be bustling on au tz zone and be a desert a few hours later or earlier in in eu tz the introduction of wormholes has created real possibilities to be more nomadic as the gates to nullsec are not anymore single points of passages we can roam deeper via wormholes routes while remaining only a few jump away from home but we still all need a home that is a fixed feature home can be an station or a pos both are the main places where our assets can be stored reasonably safely for long amount of time for most of eve pilots it is where you can start from and roam around and then come backships like rorqual or orca immediately comes to mind as potential staples of nomadic life but today risking them for long amount of time away from home is a huge risk for those that are not looking to establish or increase their sovs other options includes setting up temporary poses and dismounting them but carrying those limit the capability to transport other things and benefit from the nomadismhere are a few concepts id like to discuss more with everyone to encourage seeing nomadic outpost in the most deserted parts of new eden and i fully understand that the upcoming activity based sovereignty may change some things in that aspect in the next year a concept of a ship that can morph into a pos thus not having to carry the necessary weight to bring a pos infrastructure with you some kind of respawn bay no jump clone that could allow nomadic players losing a fight and podded to not get totally cut out of their nomadic assets so as to encourage them to participate in fights instead of clamming up a nomadic outpost would not necessarily have timers like structures have and once deployed should still have defenses that only a coordinated efforts from a fleet would be able to take out without needing capital action  the capacity for ships that would become a staple of this nomadism to use any wh so having a max mass like an orca and possibly tie this to the black ops redesign and capabilities to bridge such ships across more dangerous areasversion franUFFFDaise
mikeshould ratting be changed to encourage pvp fits current rattings focus on a single damage type and a single resist encourages pvespecialized fits which in my opinion gives attackers an advantage they do not needshould ccp adapt the same ai theyre testing out with drifters to regular ratswould visible timers for the duration of postjump cloaking and undock invincibility similar to the current timers for jump fatigue and aggression benefit the gameshould damage control be turned into an alwayson module instead of a manuallyactivated one

endiedo you think there should be some incentive for sovholding alliances to move around new eden for example for space to somehow degrade over time therefore encouraging alliances to relocate and fight for better space and creating conflict and contentfor example we have some blocks cfc but not only them which have sat unmoving in the same space for years and years this discourages conflict

new idea security status reworkevery region gets a pool of security based on size and distance from empire if you rat then the security status of a system goes up to 00 but systems that you are not using get less secure making them more valuable over time this will mean that you have to move around in order to make the most money this will make space more valuable and it would attack cloaky camping seeing that they cant sit in one spot anymore it would also stimulate to make alliance more logistical and it would encourage an alliance to fully use their region this will drive content which is always a good thing
hey guys we want people to be actually out and using their space so lets punish them for being out and using their spacethis idea isnt anything new and has never actually been good so throw out the bad idea and step back whats the goal whats the reasoning people should be rewarded for being out and using their space but there should be content whats content mean here pvp of course thats what it always means in this context rightso movement is good because movement means taking gates and youre never quite sure whats on the other side of the gate or you are because your pals are out flying around skirmishing with intruders and providing you with intel either way movement good but degrading the quality of a system to induce movement thats bad so what to do implement missions perhaps simple answer boring answer but it gets the job done no reason it has to be exactly missions of course residents install an alliance command hub in each system which among other things directs pilots to newly discovered pirate incursions sorry pilot the serpentis have withdrawn from the system to lick their wounds but theyve launched a new incursion two systems away ive added a bookmark to your journal good luck get there wipe out your very own incursion  two serpentis forsaken hub and a serpentis haven  and youve beaten them back have to go somewhere else of course because this is a game and because we want to maintain a fairly high population density as people with friends nearby are more likely to group up and fight back instead of just hide the fact that the system is depleted for you doesnt necessarily mean its depleted for a corpmate he shows up twenty minutes later and has two or three sites to himself as does the next fellow ten minutes after that and so on thus infinite pve content for an arbitrary number of people to be able to live in an area yet content that obliges those people to move around and be contentand this is part of the function of the csm were not game designers no but when ccp comes to you and goes what do you think of  its supposed to accomplish  tackle it objectively think like the player you are and imagine how it might be broken might fail because we players do the damndest things
i know how the csm works just trying to give people an idea to think about  discuss thx for your responds though cause thats also a way you can look at it and i agree that we players always f up the devs intentions xd
after researching all of the 77 candidates chance is one of only nine to earn a full endorsement from me hes on my list and he should be on yours
damjan i didnt want you to think i was ignoring your post id like to address a few things we never blackmailed anyone we extorted them your friend specifically told me that wingspan was not the reason he was quitting streaming you quoted me saying i think streams should show players the game is interesting i believe may of the streamers viewers learned exactly how dynamic eve can be if someone wardecced euni it would present corp leadership the opportunity to teach its students how to evade war targets my ego is already plenty boosted by this incredibly sexy orange jacket and no i dont believe in spamming anyone with htfu messages and if anyone in my corp has done this to you i would like to see the screencaps so i can reprimand them
thanks for that bellakalso guys dont forget to check out my just for crits q  a

to combat the n1 fight strategy some have suggested reducing the effectiveness of logistic cruisers logi can keep 1 side from losing anything and if both sides bring enough its a stalemateis reducing the effectiveness of logistic cruisers a good approach to deal with the whoever brings the most ships wins strategyin large scale combat sensor damps are the only commonly used ewar do you think ecm target painters or tracking disruptors needs a buff
honestly i have always hated the implementation of clerics or whatever other games call them ie healers and buffers into eve it turned what was a great spaceship battle field type game into just another mmo like freakin wow where you need to have all the correct party members to have a happy group outing i dont play wow but saw all i needed from neverrester everguest so while the current chant is death to all supers which i also think ccps eyes got way too big when they launched the bright idea of going bigger bigger bigger as though a battle freaking ship class isnt enough from a single pod pilot perspective i would almost want to chant death to all logibut they are here so i will answer the question givencurrently big n1 fleets are very linear in design and implementation because everything that isnt dps or logi is just too big of a pita or trying to be too cute by a half however that saying goes simplicity rules the day when trying to deal with large numbers  the potential of going into a tidi slow moving nightmare variety on the battlefield would be nice but ultimately the objective in large scale chaos is to blow up the other things and traditionally that is done with direct violence not nuanced dancing i cant imagine the pain of prolonging an already painfully slow 10 tidi fight if this game was actually scalable in performance it would be a different story but reality is what it isso even if they were given a buff the underlying issues would make those buffs translate to an awful game experience regardless of how cool it would be to see a real fight ensue based on positioning flanking and nuanced stratagemsaside from the above we do need more parity in the long runlike i said in prior posts i dont think the have it our way mentality of ccp dictated ship design is a real long term answer all we will ever see are large swings in unintended consequences of the this or that nerfbuff to various typesrolesbonusesapplications of ships what we really need is player generated parity through manufacture and design to bring out real innovation and dynamics when it comes to fleet design and implementationif i suddenly were granted powers to nerf logi and buff ewar it would just be shuffling macropoo around the table and forcing people into predetermined classes and ships that happen to be good today the cycle of searching for the perfect balance from the top down needs to be slowly moved away from over time a bottom up approach where users drive the balance through the customizations they introduce in the manufacturing process will shift the onus of balance from overtasked developers who would then be free to work on the actual game experience and world level improvements to the player base and something that is a horrible experience now will turn into insightful meaningful gameplay for all typesdevs could then focus on the game experience and improvements in the tools we use to shape the world but ultimately we would be driving and dictating advances of various things to do with ships and roles to be played

hello some questions for youyou mention the importance of lore and how it manifests itself in the game what are your thoughts of the representations of the pirate factions and players capabilities to engage with them at present and how they might be improved if at all speaking honestly give an example of a nerf to an in game activity that you were involved in in the past year that hit you hard but that you feel on balance was a good change for the game as a whole aideron robotics is  or has been to my knowledge a low sec resident community how do you feel about lowsecs current status in the game regarding pvp content isk opportunities and the fw system overall thank you for your timefang

hello csm voters and candidatesdeclarations of war podcast will do its part to bring you excellent csm related content continuing our well received issue roundtables from the last election this year weve got to do things a little differently due to the very condensed nature of this election with less than a week between the candidates being announced and the opening of the polls and the overwhelming interest in running being shown by over 75 candidateswere going to have three panels being recorded and released the same day rather than have it be invite only im throwing open the time slots for open sign ups key points candidates post below or eve mail alekseyev karrde if youre interested and can commit to the time slotthere are 5 candidate slots for each panel plus an alternate ill edit this post as they fill up dow reserves the right to make a mix of csm9 incumbents returning candidates from last year and newcomers if theres overwhelming interest in a certain panel dow reserves the right to accept or decline interested candidates for any reason at our sole discretion 1900 the changing role of the csm and the ccpcsm relationshipaeon boirellekhador vessdomanarkalt2100 town hallpsianh auvyandersteve ronukenborat guereenarietejune tingalt well welcome the audience onto our ts to ask questions to the candidates live address noirmercscompw will be in effect 15 min before the first event csmxwatch this thread and grrusso for more details
assuming the times are eve time i can do either or both but thats probably greedy  of the second two i work till 1730 eve unfortunately
pick your poison steve if theres a spot free id let you do double duty but with 77 candidates i suspect that wont be the case
i do not feel compelled to talk for two hours about this i think you can interject what pretty much everyone agrees is the problems and their logical solutions1 when timers come out  defenders choice problem time it to land in the weekend2 defense  the more active the occupancy the greater the defenses
hi im around for all slots so yeah 
im hoping for the sessions to go 6090 minutes theres some padding in there to arrange guests take drinks etcalso were gonna go a liiiitle more in depth than that lol
very nice aleks hope these fill up and we get some good roundtables to listen to this year
i would love to join in on the town hall session or alternatively the changing role of the csm and the ccpcsm relationship
lets go for the townhall then
sadly on holidays 9 days of no eve just started goodluck with the orginasation takes always more work then public realises
so when do we get to vote for folk most of us have never heard of
itUFFFDs a sunday and i have spent the entire day playing eve after a successful fleet a small splinter group of dedicated pvpers make the two jumps from our station to camp a pipe which is pretty much all we do while were logged in an hour passes with one or two kills then with a perfectly executed manoeuvre we make our glory kill
hell why not but promise me you will make sure the cms x ccp meeting notes will be released only after 2 monthsdays was overkillwe did not have any time to adjust
xander definitely deserves another go even if it means having to wait months between cz eps its a bitter pill 
xanderjust wanted to mention that i enjoyed your cap stable interview indeed in some cases i thought your answers were better than the questions i look forward to dragging you to my voting block later this week alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
thanks dude the cap stable dudes have done amazing work this year and i was very relieved that they managed to squeeze me in at the end glad that my answers worked for you too
vote for this guy he is a legit fun haver
responding to an in game mail from shadowandlight with permission to repost the response here1i am against input duplication in eve online manually operating several clients however is perfectly fine 2if it requires an additional program to run then it is the computer playing the game for you and my response would be that i am against that i dabble in programing for my real job and i see how interesting it can be to program a virtual army of eve characters and pit it against new eden or other virtual capsuleer armies but i do not believe eve is the right place for it3given current game mechanics yes when offgrid links are no longer a thing maybe but then there are still lots of compelling reasons to have multiple characters logged on such as industryhauler alts cyno alts supercap alts etc the games design at the moment is heavily biased to having very specialized characters you could even reasonably describe faction warfare as a game of alts given present standings mechanics some sort of arbitrary limit seems difficult to place rather as long as software isnt used to enhance or streamline as many as you want really4false parallelism is sort of a nono and i see any and all comparisons of eve to either of those two games to be heavily pushing this fallacy unless they are full of all the errata that would go with such a comparison this seems impossible given the wall of mechanics as well as years of people valuing and depending on their alts 5give people reasons not to multibox carrots rather than just sticks bans and punishments put links on grid so they require an active pilot that is part of the team logi belongs on killmails so people arent tempted to just relegate that to alts its part of the team even putting links on killmails would be good so the true soloist can have something whereas all other pretenders now have their solo mail filled up with logi and links alts you can take this further especially with pve activities currently it makes far more sense to multibox ratting or mining characters than having each one be a real person playing together doing something together the games design itself makes me want to have 3 characters each running a barge or ishtar separately rather than me giving full attention to one client with two friends in the other ships there is no arbitrary limit that i am interested in seeing rather limiting the reasons why people do multibox seems to be the better solution treat the disease not the symptoms
join lyonics bar ingame i you want a chatits great fun listening to the guys who rule the show but i want to know what the guys who are fighting the good fight in lowsec and nullsec want interceptors and ishtars online is getting stale everyone has capital abilities and old nullsec entrances camped by masive fleets lie barren 10 jumps each way with those fleets eve history take the money away from the comfort and security of highsec highsec is the 1 problem with eve ccp needs to understand that moon income goes to alliance and not the individual members incursions you can make more isk per hour than any ratting area in nullsec why should someone bother joining a nullsec corpalliance when he can x up and make great isk per hour with the space police at his back ice mining i really do not understand why anything bar veldspar can be mined in highsec the flow of income should be highlownull period anything else is broken level 4 missions move them to lowsec pretty simple boosters need a revampthe whole slot layout effects penalties everything needs a total overhaul one idea that came up was that you should be able to use boosters to combat people with links when flying solo so i could take a booster to give me skrmish linkscloaky camping removes any point in owning a system for ratting or miningi used to be in a renting alliance all our systems were camped and no one could do anything some afk guy not playing was stopping 20 dudes another reason not to go to nullsecif people recieve linksheals from an alt or bro it should show on the kill mailits only fair if you use an advantage for killing to let people know that you had an edgedockable supersif you can build a super in a pos why cant you build a station big enough in the deepest parts of nullsecwhy should people be able to unplug implants outside of a stationpospods need to be unable to unplug implants and be able to drop some form of implant component or straight up drop implantshowcome killboards and the thought of losing stop people from enjoying evei see it all the time people dont want to undock solo becaue they are scared to lose a ship or incase their killboard gets messy the truth is by staying in station and waiting for someone else to make content they wont get any better its become about getting on mails rather than having a fightcontent should not be sitting on titan for 2 hours only to get some tidi fight for 3 hours its always been about the little guy just having enough to kill that small gang who came into his patchthe big oneuse plex to buy skillpoints set amount or  or speed up training timeby reducing the huge disadvantage new players have in eve when a new player starts in eve he has 2 things going against him1 he cant get in or fit the cool ships that made him want to play in the first place2 he does not have the experience to fly the shipsso how do we fix this the answer is really simple you take the sp advantage away now i have been playing since 2007 and i know how much people think they own their characters and how they think they have achieved something by getting high sp i tell you now you have nothing its an illusion does the thought of easy sp for say plex disgust you well its already happening right now character bazar i can buy a 200 million skill pointed character right now for plex i dont care about these illusions i care about new people coming in and injecting some fun back into eve your advantage is number 2 by the way you have the ingame knowledge of how stuf works so use it why do people still play things like dota or counter strike because you dont start with some crazy disadvantage as a new player it is peoples knowledge of the maps the modules the shiptypes all that good stuff that gives you the edge not the perfect skills bro let it gowhat do we do with highsec
during a talk with some fcs i decided that in addition to alliance bookmarks id like to push to get fleet bookmarks added to the game anyone in fleet would be able to make them capped at 50 but only fleet boss or fleetwing commanders would be able to remove them they would expire from a pilots people  places 2 hours after the last person leaves fleet or as soon as they join a differentnew fleetthis will benefit pvp immensely but also industrymining

this is great thanks a lot for your contribution
i am very much behind better representation for the multiboxing community currently i feel that we are not represented at all we have one csm member stating that it is cheating while multiboxing and ludicrous claims that 99 of the community want multiboxing banned altogether but most of all it is the total silence on ccps part ccp know how many multibox and how many accounts they typically use at the same time they know just how big this community is how do you propose to even get traction that is clearly a thorny issue on both sides players and ccp alike and by traction i mean just some more honest and upfront discussion that doesnt descend into name calling and mud slinging even your thread here is already demonstrated how hard it is with just players and the huge gulf of misunderstandings in the official thread ccp have remained totally silent negligently so in fact fwiw i have 3 accounts i use at once but mostly just 2 i use a os that would and can do anything isboxer can do just as a normal window manager software on linux yea that thing called windows is 3rd party software your using to run eve people even lowly windows has many tricks if you know what your doing i have refrained from getting an extra 3 accounts because of the issue sounding this 1 its the shifting sand of what i can do now i may not be able to do in the future 2 total lack of clarity from ccp
i agree that a large part of the community is against third party applications but utilizes a ton of third party applications all of the time i have thought about going to linux myself and using basically os programming to accomplish the same thing as isboxer but still find my isboxer easier to use and thus continue to use it so as far as real discussion i think it honestly has to start with ccp the community and a lot of ignorant mob mentality will occur no matter what the issue is multiboxing or not i see ccps clarification and lack there of as the higher issue i am not sure if we have a csm member pushing for clarification or not which is why i am running this is appalling and downright childish not to respond to your playerbasei will strongly disagree that 99 of eve wants multiboxing removed they are more in arms about how multiboxing is being accomplished this game is designed for multiboxing and alts to the very core they advertise it as such alot of basic mechanics are geared towards being alt friendly or required the skill queue itself limits what you can do with one character this is not going away and ccp will never remove multiboxing completely but i think they need to pay more attention to it at the momentcheck out my podcast my blog
having received some good questions from shadowandlight via forum mail i feel that i should answer them so that all can be informed on my stance to those questionsmy direct question to you the canidates is from shadowandlight are you for or against input duplication in eve online are you for or against the various tools listed above isboxer autohotkey mutli button keyboards etc should players be able to control multiple accounts in eve online if so should their be a limit a ccp spokesperson recently stated that he would like to see eve being brought to 1 person  1 pilot i am assuming along the lines of games lik elite dangerous and star citizen your thoughts if ccp does decide to limit mulitboxing in eve which it appears they have started to would game design changes make more sense vs banning players or do you feel this is a correct path for them to currently followthank you for your questions shadowandlight i myself am a limited multiboxer at times so i can understand your concerns to some degree i personally have never used a third party program to facilitate multiboxing though i have over the years spoken with a number of people who have done so in various games lets move on to answering your questions1 as a multiboxer at times up to three accounts active i dont use those accounts cooperatively so i have never felt the need for input duplication within eve i do on the other hand have some background in programming as well as testing of games and realize there are issues with input duplication that can cause concern to developers and players putting aside the obvious concern segments of a player base about bot armies i find myself against input duplication for a couple of reasonsfirstly information processing priority this is seen most prominently during time dilation with spikes in data input from a single ip source the possibility of similtinaity can become a rather large issue the more data commands in the same time segment the more conflicts the cpus have in determining prioritytiming which can increase server loads this can lead to odd issues with timing which you can see in many videos on large fleet pvp where prioritization of commands such as module effect timing can become somewhat disorganized and lead to the exploitation of server priority functions to a given endsecondly there is the well deserved caution against exploitation of systems beyond a level of decency i am not saying that multiboxers look for and use exploits but that the use of input duplication can lead to the use of a system in such a way as to exploit the ability to use that system to break the balance of the system itself a good example i have seen in video and screenshots being multibox mining fleets of 30 ships stripping an asteroid belt clean of asteroids in a system within the first hour or two of server up this is exploiting the system to a degree and input duplication allowed these one man many alt fleets to flourish2 third party input duplication programs i am against multifunction keyboardsmicetrackballsetc i am not against i feel that one click allowing one person to give the exact same command to multiple client instances can cause issues that effect the system detrimentally i am not against short macro commands limited to 23 sequential commands example cloak f1 then mwd f2 with click of function button whatever but each instance of eve should have its commands input seperatelyi am also not against the noninput duplication functions of isboxer or any other program that has other functions which are not input duplication programs which allow for easy switching between clients i can fully support3 i have three accounts some have more i do not oppose multiple accounts in general there may be good reason to limit accounts to a certain number which i am not aware of if that is the case i would support a reasonable number of active accounts in my case that would be 3 for others it might be more im sure if it comes to that discussion with the ccp devs that some reasonable middle ground can be found after all ccp needs to make money and account subscriptions and plex bring them money4 comparing eve to other in development or recently released space mmos is disingenuous both of your examples to my knowledge are more like first person shooters with simulation additions eve is far more simulation at the core than either of your examplesbut without good verifiable reasons for a need to reduce players to 1 player  1 account i would fight for reasonable multiple account limits5 developers need to have firm rules for dealing with breaches of the eula of their product the restriction against input duplication i can support but an outright ban on multiboxing would cost ccp revenue as well as alienate segments of the player base changes in the systems of the game may in the end be the way to go but banning against input duplication should be handled with full diligence of ccp there may be cases in which false positives are in fact happening if so then the ways to determine positives would need to be looked at but at this point i havent found any hard evidence that ccps input duplication detection is flawedas long as ccps ability to detect input duplication is working as intended i support the banning of eula breaches in the use of input duplication whether those bans be short term or not is up to ccp to decide but repeat violators should be removed permanently
so i contacted ccp and they said they didnt mind i was working for a game company then i told them that i work at one of the studios that has a team that helps rsi with star citizen im not involved with that project so they said that would be a problem which is totally understandableapologies to everyone who spent time in this thread
sorry but already tried to do it in few hundred battleship fleet you cannot alpha carrier so easily tried to do the same with dreads  no tidi  it just dont work as for structure repping  try ospreys  they can pump shield like non triaged carrier
jump fatigue is supposed to cripple the projection of large coalitions but the logistics nightmare hurts the small guys more than anyone else large coalitions have enough jf pilots and hold enough stations to still get supplies anywhere they need through brute force the small guys are the ones getting boned how are they supposed to hold ground when they cant supply themselves jf range should be increased to jump past blockades of hostile stations so the little guys can have a chance at supplying and holding small patches of remote systems
final range of jump freighter will be reduced to 5 ly
and how does this not then benefit larger coalitions with more jump freighter pilots who can then resupply with less brute force
because they cant cut you off and starve you out
any benefit to smaller entities is a greater benefit to larger ones and with logistics either with logi or supply chains being exponential force factors increasing jf range helps the bigger guys against the littler ones at an order of magnitude more
the bottom line for small entities  possible vs impossible to hold spacethe bottom line for large entities  the amount of jf pilot put to work no difference in end resultwhat you dont realizelarge entities can blockade small ones by cutting off jump freighter supply routes because they have lots of space a jf range increase will allow small entities to supply themselves past these blockades you cant move titansmomsdreadscarriers via jump freighter anywayprojection of major power blocks has nothing to do with jfs moving your daily supplies it has to do with titans and moms moving across the map
too bad thats a big part of what wardecs are for to serve as a mechanism for generating loss and thereby stimulating the economy no its like paying a galactic level authority and it applying across the galaxy whod have thunk itthe only way wardecs are broken or open to abuse is that they can be dodged for free without having to surrender only if you dont shoot backit is not the fault of the mechanic that youre too chicken to shoot back thats your own fault
i am not against changes to the wardec mechanics as they are far from perfect however since this is a sandbox the motivations of people are not always and cannot always be known to you how does the game know that a wardeccing corp is attacking your corp because they are fishing for kills or because one of your members mouthed off and a competitor hired them to wardec you or because you mined out an asteroid from them and they hired some mercenaries to teach you a lesson you are placing a personal judgement on the motivations for actions of other players that you cannot possibly know and limiting this player freedom not only removes yet another tool from the sandbox which diminishes the richness of the game overallpeople always say this when the come to the forums asking for increased safety and protection from player conflict they dont want to end wardecs or suicide ganking or whatever but they just want to stop it from happening to them by changing game mechanics wardecs are a part of the game designed the foster player conflict that drives the economy and provides meaning in the game you want to limit it to some sort of honourable contest between equal opponents that really isnt what eve isi have much sympathy for new players learning this complex game but very little for a highsec pve corporation begging for increased safety so they can make isk in peace you claim to be able to make 500m isk in a day yet your corporation of many players couldnt find a billion or two for a week to hire one of the top mercenary groups to deal with the wardeccers read the last wardec dev blog  the whole system is designed for you to hire mercenaries to protect yourself yet you are so focused on making isk and not lowering your precious iskhour that your corp decided the better course was to ride out the wardecs and predictably disintegrated wardecs are there to force you to spend some of your effort on defense you or your former ceo were too greedy to do so and thus condemned your corp to the graveyard next to all the other highsec corps that thought they could optout of pvp in a pvpcentric game working as intended next time if your corp is big enough where dropreforming isnt an option spend some isk on defense by getting one of the toptier mercenary operations on your side if your corp is small just drop and reform costing your opponent at least 50m isk for your 1m and a few minutes of your time the wardec system does have problems and could be made more meaningful and fun for all involved but forcing nonconsensual pvp on another player corporation isnt one of them that is in fact the very purpose of wardecs in the game you are intended to defend your industrial operation everywhere in this game and that includes highsec attacking another corporation using the wardec mechanics is a use not an abuse of an intended game mechanichow can you have meaningful conflict if one party can just throw up their hands at anytime and say game off and stop it if you dont want to or cant defend a particular corporation you always have the option to leave it the npc corps already provide the protection your seem to want and there is no real penalty for you to temporarily leave a corporation if you are tired of their wars as for risk and challenge like many things in this game that is completely in the hands of other players certainly the wardeccers exposes themselves to all the risk you assume plus significantly more as you can invite any ally after the war has stared for free something they cannot predict risk vs rewards is something that applies to those making the rewards that is your corp so it needs to assume the risk that someone will try to stop them and mitigate that by preparing for or contracting out its defense making your income in the face of other players trying to stop you is really a major part of the gameplay in eve
bni started in low sec where wardecs are largely meaningless if low sec and npc null were more viable for new players you just might see more groups like bni become viable bni didnt dock up when neutrals were in local that just made them undock moreexcessive wardecs ganks etc are all just symptoms of a dead low sec and null sec as a firm believer in solving the disease and not just treating the symptoms the key to a more placid high sec is to actually have content in other security bands thing is you will never have content there so long as high sec maintains the monopoly on population and it is unlikely to give up this monopoly until it loses the monopoly on accessible income basically the only way to make hi sec safer is to give antagonists and pirates something to do outside of hi sec which they really dont have at the moment ironically you can only save hi sec by buffing low and null to the point that they are worth the time and effort
drones have been missing loot table for a while shouldve been fixed by nowccp doesnt even have to make a unique drone flavored table just copy and paste generic mission wreck to drone wrecks voila done almost workfree i doubt anyone will even care what they reprocess so long as theres something to melt down should they choose to loot even scrap metal of equivalent value as other race rats loot will do
sov system usage is what makes it game breaking the big guys will prop up these things all over space of small entities making their systems uninhabitable its the kind of fast easy ehp setup that only supers can grind downrestrict it to w space and it might not be quite game breaking
i was sent an email asking about multiboxing and suchfurther on thatif you can alttab then control your characters that is fine  and maybe some very specific instances of mapping keys from one keyboard to another computer or client but they would be keys unique to each client and this would then cut down the available keys per client for each one you run reducing possible commands not having timed broadcasts from one key and having an inherent cost to benefit ratio
the way that eve has plateaued and considering the learing curve i think the sort of people drawn to eve are the sort drawn to linux i really feel it would be important to try get eve on ubuntus software centre listing and make some song and dance about it
thank you for your reply lorelei ierendiin the interview in the link you provided you said something that caught my attention highsec is underrepresented in the csm thats terrible users and players can create as much content in low and null sec as much as they want and is possible but highsec is something ccp has a responsibility for i dont yet have much insight in the npe but i think new players should be able to get an understanding of the difference between order and anarchy which is just another word for sandbox imo and learn to decide how much they want to or can take before being confronted by piracy et al the first day on and i dont think a few repetetive missions countas much ccplease i and many others would like to do i want to refrain from details pleads and rants for now this is my first csm election and well see what if anything will change i have a strong rpg and scifi background and being a carebear is for me the only way to play the game and btw i only very recently discovered its exact meaning and i think its a dumb word it should be a completely legit playstyle just like pirates or anyone living in wormholes but i agree in being afk is not legit and i agree with your 5050 approachone cant be without the otherok just one rant creating a corporation is too easy and too cheap there should be a minimum bar of what one corporation may expect from wardeccing another in terms of resilience and defense the stronger mostly become stronger on cost of the weak not other strong ones that may be antidarwinian but its a game after alland as for wardec mechanics the cost could be dependant on system security you pay so much and may attack the enemy corp members up to this or that system security after all a wardec payment is a concord bribe and i would like to see a 10 sec concord integrity withstand but the highest bribe or even additionally connection skill and a 05 sec concord crimewatch officer look the other way for cheap that may result in corp members fleeing into higher sec and disrupting their businesses and having a chance to regroup and organize themselves  to defend their pos etc rather than immediately disbanding the corp altogetherthis as much as for ccp having to take responsibility for its highsecgood luck on your election and sorry for the neighborly greetings earlier in the official candidate list your country of origin is listed as germany
my pleasure i am not sure that i agree with that ccp have a responsibility for defining the game mechanics et cetera and the rest of it is just up to us players i think that ccp needs to take a look at the game mechanics that are currently at work in high sec compare them to the other secs and see if there is enough difference there to make things worthwhilethis is eve when we fly out of a designated rookie system we are at risk and exposed to the big bad world i think that it would be bad for players in eve to simply be able to totally opt out of the sandbox the sandbox also includes high sec when you really look at it the differences in sec are more or less just differences in the way players can shoot each other as a proud member of a one man corporation i disagree like i said what i would like is to see my corporation able to bring in as many allies and mercs as i want to help fight my war but i dont need to post what i think againthe form for registering for the csm did not allow me to enter a nationality that was different from my address
i pledge my support good luck to you sir

this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasmake some of the carrier paths that are advertised to bring new people in the game to become realistic like bounty hunterin the past ccp used to communicate to new players about certain career paths that could be done in eve online like industrialist pirate freedom fighter or bounty hunter this communication has changed i am not sure when and it seems that these paths are no longer visible in the marketing efforts to communicate to new players this is a good thing as eve is a very open game and a single career does not make much sense players are free to embrace different play styles as well as different activities while building the skillset of their characters furthermore the bounty hunter path was really not supported properly ingame to be defined as a carreer in the same sense as industrialist trader or pirateccp has thus addressed this point of my platform already by focusing their new landing pages to the games features and the spaceships themselves which is better their action removes a lot of the grief i had about bounty hunting as i was seeing it as an unfair way to lure new players in the game only to disappoint them i am still not too happy about the current bounty hunting rules and i wish one could really make a living out of it i do not like the usage of the current bounty system as a glorified isk leaderboard i appreciated the efforts made a while ago to improve it even if it did not go far enough but by removing this bounty hunter career as an advertisement to the game ccp has proactively defanged most of my grief about this specific topic i can live with the system as it is where bounty hunting may be more of an opportunity to seize rather than a long hunt to do i am sure some very dedicated players still can do it after a while but i do not know if there is a real benefit to it at the moment i would really like ccp to do another pass on bounty hunting and i would support it wholehearteadly but as it is not used anymore to lure new players in i can live with the current statusquo as there are bigger issues to work onthis is an opportunity for me in the middle of explaining in more details the various points of my program to give credits to ccp for the turnaround they have shown in the past year from the new releases schedules to the choices made i applaud the work done this is what encouraged me to put myself on a run for csm and in the public eye something i am usualy not fond ofversion franUFFFDaise
this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasrequest that all players link all their alts publicly with a slight change in the eula this is the most controversial point of my program the point causing prominent members of the public community to shake their head condescendingly at my run for csm x and sigh the point that sets me apart from the accepted norm the black sheep or the simpleton that just does not get it everyone is entitled to their opinions for me this point is the true test of the votes of this csm x to bring independent voices to bearx like 10 years eve is already ten years old and all the doom sayers of eve is dying have been proven wrong so far eve is leaving infancy behind and entering teen years on a human age scale many tantrums have been had and the game continues to grow and offers an unparalleled experience of social interactions mixed with a cutthroat environment where players build assets and can loose them on simple mistakes or a bad look from a powerful individual or long lasting grudges eve is not for the faint of heart or the ones full of great ideals it is gritty and unforgiving but everyone can set their own goal and agenda and expect a reasonably fair field of play but is the gaming field truly fair as the power of a player is multiplied exponentially by the number of unrelated accounts one hasthis was very visible with the thankfully now banned input broadcasting where fleets of bombers handled by one player could destroy a gang of numerous players with a single coordinated bomb run or locust mining fleet could empty a site in mere minutes to the dismay of local residents with a more casual approach to their gaming hobby they were not alts of the same accounts but different accounts organized to operate at the same time in that case they gave away their anonymity to multiply exponentially the effect of one player on the game the community as a whole started seeing that as an abuse during the last year while it was accepted for many years before but as it started being more visible as more players saw it working for some and duplicated the trend this created a snowball effect that could not be ignored anymore gone is the very visible input broadcasting because it became too obvious but it also clearly showed that some players could afford many many accounts and there are still today many ways that are not as visible to influence the game with a lot of anonymous different accounts and only one player behind them from corps infiltration by clean alts to nonproductive cloaky campers that block ingame activity for local residents to trading manipulated by alts of the same player the power of multiple anonymous accounts is very much around but it is not visiblemy goal with this point of my program is to cast a light on it and continue the cleaning process for a fairer gaming field to all players that the input broadcasting ban started multiple anonymous account is simply put a subtle form of paytowinremoving the anonymity does not mean preventing players from having multiple accounts as i believe this is truly a staple of eve but it will change the impact on the game that these extra alts can bring to the same playerall activities in eve are designed around risk versus rewards anonymous alts is all rewards with no risks i have received angry messages saying i am going to kill the spy game where is the difficulty in the spy game today you are not working to turn another player but you are adding a new account and having a real easy no risk involved run at a group of players in their corp that have no other way to protect themselves than not recruiting anymorewhat is the difficulty and the risk of sending a cloaky alt for weeks around totally anonymously so that the recipients cant even know who is behind it and retaliate in other ways a cloaky alt does not produce anything for the game and has a norisk opportunity to jump those that ignore the cloaky camper at the first opportunity why being afraid of retaliation against other productive alts the tenants of this type of play are the worst and most hypocritical carebears of the game wanting to wield significant influence with the multiple anonymous accounts and wield an influence that has little risk involved it is not about the number of accounts it is about their anonymity hence my proposition to change the eula accordinglyi also received multiple messages of various sort about the paradox of me running from an anonymous alt and having this item on my agenda well it make sense for many different reasons first i want to run on ideas i believe will make the game fairer for all and be judged on these ideas and not from the corps i have flew with or the state of my killboard with me you get what you read on these forums baseline statements that helps identify the points i will defend if i am elected not showing my main also ensures that i will not suffer from backlash ingame about ideas that i understand are threatening some players influence over the game playing solo my best defense is into this kind of secrecy  running as an anonymous alt is also making a point about this particular aspect of my program i have little reason to be the one linking my alts publicly while anonymous alts remain a part of the game for all other players if this change i will be the first one to link all my alts to this accountclarification i am talking about the anonymity of alts not the anonymity of players only ccp should know the players names behind the accounts all alts from various accounts of the same player being linkedversion franUFFFDaise
this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasparticipate to the new upcoming sovereignty changes to give a chance to smaller groups to truly own something without having to rent itsovereignty is this year the elephant in the room that everyone and their mother have talked about this is the flag players plant on the new eden nullsec map for all to see currently sov revolves around a mix of power projection strength  playerss negotiated agreements or alliances and of course identifying and protecting the most lucrative corners of null space to solidly control their income much of the space under sov remains empty except for strategically placed systems serving as bases in the various regionsanyone that has been in an alliance knows the meaning of the word cta where the leaders and fcs bangs up the drums to bring more bodies than the expected opposing fleet their easily infiltrated alts keeping them updated on the current count in the opposing fleets the location of those pilots that matter most cyno scouts mostly all alts of highly ranked and trusted pilots to avoid treacherythe regular joes gather fleets get readyish and leave xish hours after being called players wait for a while at a titan to be bridged to an undisclosed system and most of the time nothing happens except for shooting at immobile structures and doing it all over again with the next timer and the nextif things heats up escalation is usually pretty steep if the timer is important in which case tidi kicks in slowing every action to a snail pace and if the spy reports indicates possible odds turns bad contact is broken to avoid losses that would look real bad on the killboardsin short the current regular player experience around sovereignty sucks most of the time while the experience of the leaders is full of constant adrenaline rushes and the efforts involved to support all the infrastructures by the pilots making it happen behind the scenes logistics and all is pretty staggeringit must be said that when the fights happen and are not too lopsided they recharge spirits of anyone involved especially the winners to accept more tediousness for weeks to come gud winning fights is an incredible morale boostfortunately ccp has recognized the issue a while ago already and has been actively working on it with the csm ix members input there is no announcement on what is coming when except for the already released first piece jump fatigue to control power projection but it is unlikely that csm x will have much if any to contribute on what must currently be development well in progress and plans already set to fix the sovereignty issues a lot of voices support activity based sovereignty which i also strongly support spreading players across the various systems makes for more interesting smaller fights all the time what csm x will be most likely called to do is to cover the releases of the new sov system more than influence it still if there is any chance to influence anything that is to come in that area my main focus would be to ensure that some kind of sov can be established by the smaller groups even if this sov is more limited than what a group of players can achieve a solo player claiming sov on a asteroid belt for example or a small corporation claiming sov on one of the moons or a planets pi or a larger group claiming sov on the system itself and an alliance on a group of systems in a region and so forth this would be where the combination of players interaction to defend a corner of space where each hold a sov adapted to their scope would create defacto alliances each layers benefiting from the activity of the lower layers also the experience around fleet fights to control sovereignty should be better spread across all players to avoid seeing 95 of the fun parts of a fleet op handled by 5 of the pilots i do not have any magical solution to this but it is a problem worth discussing for the sake of the game lastly establishing sovereignty should not be tedious but fun and active across multiple timezone and triggering engagements scaled to the level of sov being challenged with multiple point of contact grids rather than a large battle in a single place these are just pie in the sky thoughts of course and as i do not believe we are at the early stage of sov redesign csm x will have to work with what has already been decided on those topics on thing for sure it is something big that will change the game and this new csm will be right in the middle of it liking the changes or notversion franUFFFDaise
this post focuses on digging more into one of my program points and summarize my thoughts or what i said about it in various mediasdevelop the new player resources and first experiences in a more integrated way within the gameccp has recently communicated on new efforts to improve the new player experiencethis read is excellent and the thing i like the most about it is that at last new players will start a spaceship themed game in a spaceship also being directly driven to an anomaly in the starting system is great too ratting and mining as the first two things to do then learning about the rest warping docking undocking finding new stuff to do all that in a format that is not as linear and text heavy as the current tutorialthat looks really good i just hope that no griefer can probe this starting anomaly or the player in it and fleet invite and other tricks of that nature will be disabled until the players warps out of after having learned the basics including not shooting in high sec at someone that is simply targeting youthere is something else that is dear to me that i would push if electeda ship simulator within a spaceship game in short the ability to sample every ship from your station in your starter system through a simulator that will take you in a instance only anomaly nobody else can get in as after all you will not be in real space for a mission specially designed for the ships role this simulator would give you access to the skills at level 5 and to your choice of any of the module to fit and teach you the hard way when your fit is poor the mission could be run multiple times until it is completed after you find by yourself the optimal way to fit the ship and experience the consequences of a nonoptimal fit without losing anything yourselfthe access to ships class could be granted by steps unlocked by completion of related simulations as well as real skill trainings without being too linear and would cover all the ships including capitals so the training sim could be visited anytime by all pilots as they evolve and get closer to actually be able to fly said ship learning process in eve is a constant thing learning the roles and how to fit ships is something that even expereinced players can benefit from even more if they can be exposed without risk of losing stuff to the consequences of poor fit in a training simulator before being blown up for good in spacenot having to install a second client for that purpose and having a tailored mission for the ships role would be neatversion franUFFFDaise
i will be on the town hall panel of the declaration of wars podcast on 31 at 2100mark this thread for more details about their other panels for csm x
this year im starting to have a look at the running csm candidates in a bit more depth and ive written a short review of your campaign which can be found here
good luck in your campaign sab
after some issues the vote match profile is now up
sabriz after a discussion with another player ive been thinking about wardecs and its made me want to revisit something we discussed earlier within this post and in your wardecs recording you state that wardec evasion via disbanding and reforming a corp was deemed an exploit do you know where this was stated at first when ive heard this said i just accepted it and didnt really think about it but since then ive been thinking and cant actually remember anything official or even coming from an official that confirmed it was an exploit ive searched around and cant find it anywhere either and i know that it wasnt an exploit in 2007 2009 or 2011 so im not sure when or where this was said
i didnt play at the time and have only anecdotal evidence for it but ive heard it from quite a number of people also thanks for your harsh but from your position fair comments on your blog
no problemany idea where people you heard it from heard it its one of those things ive heard a few times too and just assumed to be true but now that im trying to source it cant seem to find it anywhere in fact ive found a couple of gms stating the exact opposite and now am beginning to wonder if its just one of those things someone said once that just took hold
james 315 psychotic monk and a few others but those are the two i can name whilst the highsec predator community are often dishonest to outsiders we arent dishonest to each other and monk in particular took that as an absolute principle
its true monk will stab you in the back if he gets the chance but he wont lie to you
that may be the case but that doesnt mean someone else didnt come up with it and it spread though them all evidence i can find points to it having never been an exploit at any point
i vote for corebloodbrothers this year 
coredid you do an interview with cap stable
sadly no i was available every day last week atm i am on eve free holiday which i promise my wife once a year hehe they tried but we couldnt find a matchign slot maybe next week but there is plenty of info in my eve candacy post  my twitter corebloodbro or my corebloodbrothers facebook site interviews and life performance also on forums i just made a little article on my facebook site about sov feel to read and reply to itvoting starts tommorow goodluck too all
just wanted to hear your sultry tones once more is all
who would be the right candidate i mean there are quite a few to chose from all with very good arguments and near picture perfect interviews they all know the games mechanics by heart  so a decision based on knowledge is out if i were allowed to ask only one single question it would be what will you do for mei know core for like 4 weeks being in his alliance and fleets for just three weeks hes instantly your bro accessible forgiving warm and unbelievably patient theres the fleet 145 guys waiting for the go  and here you are as a total noob excited and all hell take the time to go over your ships fittings making suggestions and even giving out his own stuff just to make sure that the noob will have a great time and will come back and he does it casually and with style never condescending always funny respectful and relaxed even chatting you up after fleet did you have any problems keeping up questions will you come backthis guy will make damn sure that youre gonna love this game as much as he does and i guess thats pretty much all i need to know he loves eve and since eve really is us the players hell never let anything happen to this game that would threaten his or our love for it he wont let us down 1 and some much deserved respect for an awesome guy
posting on my main because im voting for you again and proud to say so
hi brood thanks for your post here and on reddit i read both youre incorrect in a few areas however which i feel i should correct just a little bit you werent only kicked for your language as described above you were kicked because of your repeated and persistent use of racial homophobic and antisemitic slurs sure i lost my temper  id personally warned you a number of times about it i dont like people inflicting their prejudices on the rest of us good luck out there mate
thanks for the reply mynxee that such a distinguished former csm member would say so make me very happy and i hope i can be worthy of your kind words brave lives in null we moved here and were planning on staying for a bit  at least until we move into thera when the drifters take over the universe what can i bring to that discussion the point of view of a huge alliance full of new players who are trying to get to grips with the mechanics of null and the stagnant nature of the place  something we feel deeply even in the most content rich region in 00 space i dont want sov to be the domain of a handful of mega rich and supremely powerful players i want it to be vibrant and alive and i want to hear the pitterpatter of tiny newbie spaceships rattling around the joint i want to see malcanis law used to the betterment of the new player experience  which i think is easily possible the opportunities dev blog is exciting im yet to play through them all but they look very promising however one of the biggest criticisms of the tutorials were that they trained a new player for a life of solo pve which is categorically unsuccessful in retaining new players and utterly fails in introducing people to our awesome community i dont see that this is much of an improvement in that regard
i think it could be opportunities like enter a wormhole mine arkanor in nullsec and harvest gas in a wormhole encourage newbros to explore nullsec and wspace earlier on further opportunities like fight another player in nullsec or fight another player in a wormhole will inevitably get the newbro blown up which is often step 1 of the recruitment processhow many more newbros  new factions plant their flag in nullsec depends on how easy it is to steal an empty system in the new sov rules even hero has quite a few empty systems i could imagine new alliances planting their flags in
this is a fairly common problem and unfortunately isnt one that has any clear solution personally ive found a happy middle ground through the way my corporation is run the members of my corporation are almost all heavily involved in npsi groups either as fcs or devoted line members as a corp we dont maintain any blues  blues offer us nothing and in return decreases our number of potential targets ive called members of my corporation as primary on multiple occasions but we are all well aware of how npsi works and what the rules of engagement are even if you see a green star in localnpsi as a playstyle is still relatively new there are still a lot of people who havent heard of it let alone actually flown in an npsi fleet in the sov world in contrast to the npsi world blues do have purpose they help you win wars they are paying to use space or maybe theyre just alts of your friends a member who views blues as a potential target depending on their daily disposition can be considered a liability to the entire alliance when we talk about blueonblue occurrences there are many shades to how involved or at fault a person can be are you one of a hundred bombers killing a target during a hot drop well guns away he was going to die anyway were you the hunter killer who found your friend through unscrupulous means and lit the cyno for a hundred bombers to come kill him well then maybe your alliance has reason to be upsetwhen were talking about ways to engage those who you are normally friendly with both circumstances have to be considered the most popular suggestion to combat this problem is the introduction of fleet standings where the member of a fleet has the option to inherit the standings set by the fc ignoring legacy code problems this should have to have restrictions so that it couldnt be easily abused such as switching from blue to red mere second before landing tackle on a shiny target forcing a member to be docked before standings could be swapped is one practical fix that would encourage using it for the intended purpose that being said  and as i alluded to above  even with the proper tag marking you as a valid target the core of the problem is as simple as conflicting desires and loyaltiesthe groups that you are flying with under the guise of a proper corporation and alliance have goals and desires and their way to enjoy the game the npsi fleets that you fly with on occasion have their desires and goal as well although mostly short term goals in the pursuit of fun and content as much as id love implement fleet standings as a way to broadcast intentions no change in mechanic is going to prevent someone from judging you for participating with an organization outside of their own
the problem with this idea is that there are still structures and pocos in 10 systems which require wardecs to be destroyed and change hands im all for channeling wardecs into more purposeful aggression but blanket restrictions arent going to make the mechanic more enjoyable for aggressor or defender
you had my vote as soon as i read about no off grid boosting on the align yourself with a candidate page then stole my heart at pirate faction warfare
hellomy name is nsa bivas and eve has been a great interest of mine since 2004 although i have taken a few occasional breaks over the years in these 10 years of gameplay iUFFFDve tried everything you can do in eve from mining in the apocalypse battleship to inventions to running anomalies however my main focus has always been pvp and as a proud member of northern coalition i believe i have the insight to make meaningful changes to your pvp experience recently most of my pvp experience has been in sovereignty 00 and wormhole space as a part of pvp orientated alliances starting with ascendant frontier against all authorities triumvirate verge of collapse and now at northern coalition and whether i am solo in a stabber fleet issue roaming with a small gang or jumping into a system with a supercarrier fleet i am confronted with many of the same problems that pvpers face todayyet the isk i use for pvp does not come from nowhere in my time in this game i have funded my extensive ship losses through all manner of activities from production invention and mining to running missions level 4 in highsec level 5 in lowsec pirate missions in npc nullsec and wormhole activities i hope that my term in the csm will also allow me to make pve a more fulfilling and enjoyable pastimemy favorite aspect of this game is participating in both ccp and player organized tournaments such as the alliance tournament i believe my greatest accomplishment in eve was winning the atx with the verge of collapse team the tournament brought me closer to my fellow eve players and i hope that i can bring the tenacity it instilled within me to the council of stellar management where i can bring positive change to your eve experiencethe reason i havenUFFFDt previously posted here is simply due to the fact that i was awaiting acceptance from ccp for my candidacy feel free to get in touch using the methods detailed belowin game channel nsabivas4csmconvo me or mail me in gametwitch chat when im streamingtwitter nsabivas

just so you know chance ill be voting for you its because of you that im flying around in wh space in a nemesis these days
endorsements starting to be announced id like to say a big thanks to rhavas 
cool i was set to evil be the green goblin i think it is greedy but who cares for being a cfc pet to which he then stated he never read any of my candidacy posts i do love the internets he may have been interested in this entry
1010 would vote great capstable interview too
thoric for csm x
i wanted to reach out and thank gevlon goblinas a newly anointed evil csm candidate i would like to thank you for this honor i was only hoping to make it into the slightly naughty list for this my first attempt at candidacy i wanted to let you know i did receive my official evil cat and moon laser today and ill be performing the sacred blofeld ritual and shaving my head for satan tonight thank you again its an honor just to participatethoric frosthammer
i had flown with june for a number of years and know her to be good at what she does i think she would be a great addition to the csm she will have my vote for sure
alekseyev i would love to join you for the nullsov changes discussion domanark  csm10 candidatedomanark cohost clueless space nerds podcast
count me in for the town hall meetingthanks for the efforts of doing this
i would love to participate in either the town hall meeting or changing roles of the csm
i can make the 2100 town hall slot
voting starts at 1130 gmt on 25th of februarymany employers do not know the people they interview for a job that doesnt take away from their ability to do said job the trouble is that csm to my eyes is more a case of large alliances planting someone from their group in the csm much like a flag we have a representative maybe they will steer us in the right direction just watch how they play then people complain about how ineffective the csm is at what they expect done
most of those elected to csm x will take the job seriouslya few will just sort of disappearall the candidates will promise to work for the greater good of the whole game this will in fact be true of all candidates who get electedonce elected most of the work will be secretwhat is released in the csm minutes will be old news by the time it is releasedstill it is better to have the csm than not so i always vote
hi lyonic nice to see another tartan army guy runningsome qshow would you deal with these proposals being dismissed out of hand by devs if you were elected do you see the csm mostly as an opportunity to pitch your ideas or as an opportunity to converse with devs about their ideas what do you think incursion isk goes into mostly  what troubles you about thathow do you reconcile seeking to amplify risk for level 4 mission runners by relocating these out of highsec with seeking to subdue risk for nullsec ratters by proposing some action against cloaky afk playersif i can already buy sp with isk via the character bazaar why do i need to be able to buy sp with isk by another meanslook forward to your repliesmixu
shadowandlight sent the csmx candidates a mail with some questions regarding multiboxing below are the questions and my answersmy overall opinion multiboxing is an asset to eve and should never be completely removedmy direct question to you the canidates is are you for or against input duplication in eve onlineagainst are you for or against the various tools listed above isboxer autohotkey mutli button keyboards etcfor provided they dont violate the toseula should players be able to control multiple accounts in eve online if so should their be a limitplayers should be allowed to control multiple accounts in that ways that are currently available to them there should not be a limit on the number of accounts players can have thats up to a player a ccp spokesperson recently stated that he would like to see eve being brought to 1 person  1 pilot i am assuming along the lines of games lik elite dangerous and star citizen your thoughtsit would kill the game eve wasnt built up or with a 11 pilotplayer ratio i never want to see it head in that direction if ccp does decide to limit mulitboxing in eve which it appears they have started to would game design changes make more sense vs banning players or do you feel this is a correct path for them to currently followmechanic changes are the most effective way to influence player behaviour bans only cut players off from the game or make them start over

back from a busy weekend of workactually i have been blogging since what 1997ish of the top of my head yes old school way of running my own hosted server etc these days its on tumbler
q and a from shadowand light about running multiple accounts are you for or against input duplication in eve onlineagainst been able to control many accounts at the same time is breaking the gameplay the game and the eula  are you for or against the various tools listed above isboxer autohotkey mutli button keyboards etcagainst mostly the use of programs addons modification to control multiple accounts or to gain an advantage in terms of hitting buttons quicker is again bad for the game play and the gamehowever there are keyboards etc that you can program keys in etc these can only be used on the client that you are active on they are not broadcasting to multiple clients as long you are not using it for macros they shouldnt be banned should players be able to control multiple accounts in eve online if so should their be a limityes a fair few of us do have multiple accounts running this is fine as long as you are not doing things to control them all at once should there be a limit i think not if some one wanted to run 40 accounts on the one pc by alt tabbing good luck with the rsi a ccp spokesperson recently stated that he would like to see eve being brought to 1 person  1 pilot i am assuming along the lines of games lik elite dangerous and star citizen your thoughtsit is one person one pilot at the moment every account is owned by a person account sharing is against the eula as one of the csm 9 members found out and got banned if ccp does decide to limit mulitboxing in eve which it appears they have started to would game design changes make more sense vs banning players or do you feel this is a correct path for them to currently followowning multiple accounts should still be fine running a large amount of them is the trouble changes in the game and ui could help to make it harder for people to run a large amount of clients and reduce the amount of people doing it
what are you passionate about
enjoy an endorsement from the executor of a relatively small and meaningless alliance in providence your specific ideas on how sovereignty mechanics should be changed gets my vote
the core of this game isnt multiboxing and alts the core of this game is multiplaying this game as with all mmos are designed around the concept of social gameplay and multiplayer interaction multiboxing and the use of alts is a playerdesigned answer to the multiplayer concept i agree that ccp will never be able to eliminate multboxing but your fundamental perception of this game is so terrible that it is becoming laughable seriously and before you say that i have a problem with you personally i dont let me clarify that my persistence isnt against you as a person but rather with your understanding of this game and your personal views of eve you really dont understand the game very well based on your opinion of the core of the game mechanics
well looks like a problem here standing for csm and it appears your platform is return mechanisms that a significant number of players  consider to confer an unfair advantageinput duplication is now clearly defined as cheating officially unmistakeablytrying to find wiggle room is not a laudable goal and boasting about how you achieved this in other games does not encourage trust in your ethics and in game moralssorry that is not a position i can recommend or vote for
please tell me how a titan or other super pilot is suppose to play this game just leave the titan floating around in space eve clearly has game play mechanics designed around multiboxing its is even in their advertising power of two is promoted as multiboxing
as far as my fundamental perception of this game goes i am not sure what you are arguing about there are a lot of mechanics that encourage multiboxing fleet warp the fact that no player can do anything themselves the skill queue plex etc i agree that multiplaying is what all mmos focus on however you cannot argue that this game advertises multiboxing with both the plex system and power of twoi am glad i am amusing you but at the same time opinion is something we all have and you have yet to sway mine i find yours a little appalling myself but either way you play eve and i play eve your statements directly contradict your signature also my platform is not to return input duplication please read my platform on either my website or this threadexactly this game promotes multiboxing check out my podcast my blog
the game allows multiboxing and power of two supports having alts however you said the core of this game is multiboxing and that is probably one of the most ridiculous things ive heard a player say in this game it is a multiplayer game i will agree with delt0r that a titan pilot any titan pilot or super pilot for that matter or even cap pilot with trust issues would multibox to move their ships around i generally did since i dont trust very many players in this gameagain let me clarify that i never used isboxer or any third party service to multibox to move my capssupers but again these are player problems since trust isnt a mechanic and all of these things that i multibox are related to me not trusting other players which would simply be multiplayer in general how dense can you possibly be your fundamental perception is that multiplayer mechanics are actually multiboxing mechanics that is ridiculously blind none of the mechanics you said encourage multiboxing you only see it because you want to see it that way1 fleet warp  multiplayer multiboxers use it must be a multiboxing mechanic s2 players cant do anything themselves  wrong multiboxers use it must be a multiboxing mechanic s3 skill queue  wrong multiboxers use it must be a multiboxing mechanic s4 plex  wrong multiboxers use it must be a multiboxing mechanic sif you think multiply character training  multiboxing lol wrongi agree with power of two supporting alts but that isnt exclusive to multiboxing your arguments are all fringe at best and you are certainly right about opinions the funny thing is very few people find mine to be appalling and i take solace in the knowledge that you have been well removed as a wormhole candidate in this election
 leaves discussion as one is unable to reason or discuss with one who believes their opinion is the whole sum of reality no matter how absurd
i agree that multiple character training is definitely not multiboxer friendly more along the lines of alt friendly i guess i should really rephrase the whole core mechanic thing into more of a multiboxing friendly or enabling game mechanic does that definition suit you better either way this game has a lot of mechanics that enable and encourage multiboxing yes these mechanics can be used by single players and thats fine but they are also used and are very useful to multiboxersi would be happy to talk about my veiws on whs and the npe everyone just seems to enjoy discussing multiboxing more i think the npe should introduce both wh space and fw space what about youperception is everything and it defines reality to many people no matter how limited their perception might be i am fine reasoning and discussing i have yet to hear anything to change my reasoning thus the nature of discussion is to attempt to point out or defend your reasoning to others we are however entitled to our own opinions no matter how unpopular they might be if you are not willing to discuss and attempt to alter my reasoning while i attempt to do the same in return then i bid you farewell check out my podcast my blog
you mean you have no argument to make if you have a position other than you are all wrong please share it
your ad
why thank you very much quite well done and touches on the main points
i tried to make it unique and what you stand for i hope you like it and it is yours to do with as you please thanks for running and good luck i put it on twitter
csm is not a democracy only winners are the ones who dont vote of course massive amounts of isk will change that
i will start sending out conformations tomorrow for those who have said they can attend
first thing in a long time that does not collide with me working would be glad to attend
that makes absolutely no sense since there are plenty of other ways of cutting off jump freighters that have nothing to do with range
no even a small 1 or 2 ly increase in radius can open up dozens of new routes in some cases creating dozens of additional stations over multiple regions that will have to be heldcamped to cut off logistics erasing certain bottlenecks
so then why not just remove their jump range entirely and just let them teleport to whatever system they want because that is mroe or less what you want riskfree logisticsthe only little guys who should be trying to settle far out are ones who see unused space by big entities and offer an alliancedefense in exchange for settlement rights any other small entity is better off sieging and attacking off lowsec adjacent systems as logistics and staging is infinitely easier
in other words youre saying small entities should either stay out of sov null or rent  what you described  low level regional defense in exchange for offsetting partialfull rent is exactly the same as the current renter system ccp is trying to move away from
actually what ccp needs to do is repair the nullsec industrial complex to the point where you dont have to make jf runs every week for basic supplieseve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
yeah thanks for ignoring half my post trying to act like your pulling a smart oneyes if you want to live in the middle of an entity that is vastly larger than you you shoudl be subservient which is why the alternative i originally mentioned exists and thats pushing for your own territory starting close to lowsec so your supplies and retreatreinforce lines are short and easily based in lowsec stations until you have enough presence and foothold to move completely into nullthis way larger more stabilized empires are pushed farther into null becoming more dependent on themselves for supplies rather than jita while the little guys eating at their empire grow larger and are in turn pushed farther out to own space by the new little guys harassing them in low and entrynull
im all for that but thats clearly not the case currently everything from lack of basic minerals null is always out of tritpyemexllon distribution of these things in belts are far off for production of anything to moon goo distribution youll always have to haul from highsec for missing t2 ship material unless youre a huge entity owning half of nullsec necessitates making jf runs to highsecuntil ccp actually does what you said they shouldnt just pull the plug on small entities and drive them back to highsec
do we even play the same eve are you seeing any small entity pushing into null starting close to lowsec these days you must be seeing something the rest of us cant all we see are the big guys collecting rent from 10 renterland in deep null that will never change hands and use the isk to steamroll any small entity back into lowsec what incentive is there for small entities to try to take worthless high traffic 01 space knowing theyll just get steamrolled back before they can reach anywhere worthwhile
false its supposed to cripple projection for everyone
do i see any no why because none even want to try most people build up a good 100150 man alliance theyd need to start pushing and decide theyd rather stay and sit on their lowsec empire and not get riskyas far as have any yeah there are several alliances with only 1 or 2 systems that have held sov mostly because they dotn go after crown jewel or main tradepipe systems that are still necessary lifelines of big blocs in other words they avoid intentionally drawing all out war with a big entityand besides the entire point of sov going forward is to make it easier for little groups to pick away at the big ones and if anything ccp will be nerfing jf range as they stated when they nerfed it originally that it was a placeholder so nullsec groups didnt collapse overnight logistically though to be honest woulda been a better shakeup if they had just gone ahead with the planned nerf instead of postponing it
hate to break it to you but your 100 man fleet will get rolled by supers funded not by moon goo these days but by deep null renter space whose sov will never be challengedrenters kill rats for isk  pay rent  coalitions use the isk to roll the small guys powerblocks will never have trouble with logistics so long as they have isk printing machine that is deep null renterland their renters need minimal hauling because all they do is rat the small guys that actually want to take sov are the ones that need logistics to replace ship losses
than rather than asking for a band aid champion an actual solution to the problem that doesnt screw over the rest of the game in the process see past the end of your own nose and take a look at the larger pictureeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
no thats asking for not pulling the plug on the small guys and driving them back to highsec before your solution is implemented soontmjf is the lifeline for these small guys until this changes their lifeline should not be cut to the benefit of large powerblocks

once sov null is one single color perhaps
a few ideas that might give both sides of the wardec issue some partial satisfaction1 concord as a law enforcing navy falls very short on getting those with security standings that are low the same for different major faction navies if i can easily outfly the ammatar navy while it declares im a dead criminal in derelik in a procurer of all things theres something a little slow on enforcement boats in general kos doesnt seem to mean much nor is it much of a concern overall in highsec perhaps upping their reaction speeds and they enforce those laws on criminals could give the highsec smaller corps that moment of breathing room to do more than either get ganked or spin ships that breath can save a ship save a pod and possibly save a new player from ragequitting leaving all of us with fewer new players to fly with and against were all losing on this one enforce the law concord or get out of the law enforcement business inept is worse than corrupt as least the corrupt can be bought off2 as a relative r00kie i would like to move and spend more time in low and eventually null however that would mean signing my clones soul over to an already established corp and its alliance for those of us still in that first year thems the options to get out of highsec and out of the poisonous teachings of a few carebears that set newbies up for later repeat failures when out on their own theres simply not a lot of successful opportunities in low and null for a smaller corp of people playing for under 2 years to set up a stake to defend so low and null stay stagnant the constant wars there bring pirates up to high for easier targets were both losing by winning on this breaking up some of that stagnation well that would be an overall win for all3 this character tends to spend more time with industry than pvp i dont neglect those skills for the continuation of my ships lives no matter if im in a mining barge hauler or more combat orientated ship i came into eve knowing others will shoot at me at the most inopportune times i did do some research before downloading the client and going for the trial period expecting highsec to be completely safe defeats one of the reasons i joined however an expansion on what the eula counts as griefing would assist on complaint tickets along with giving a more honest idea of what a new player is signing up for when they undock right now theres not much in the way of a serious explanation other than its eve you get ganked deal with it for those coming over from less sudden destruction of stuffmore hand holding mmos that will keep many of them from resubbing after their initial time purchase is made for an active account at least let the fresh frozen meat know with a smidge more detail what they just signed into when it comes to the daily insanity of eve forewarned is forearmed in many cases this is one of themjust a couple of my wisdom pennies use mileage may varyjeven
actually concord is not there to protect your ships as you may think they are there to impose a cost on the attacker and act as a deterrent for acts of aggression in highsec check out section 5253 of the new pilot faq for more info and actually the rest of the document if you are a newer player highsec is not suppose to be safesec although the combination of the faction police and concord make it very safe if you take a few small measures to protect your ships the real problem is that if you try to give extra safety to new players by increasing npc protections established players will hide behind that safety to make isk outcompeting the new players if you want more safety it has to be much less lucrative so veterans dont abuse it i agree and lets hope ccp keeps this in mind when they revamp the sov mechanics still it will always be hard for a solo and small group to compete with the numbers of the large corps you really should consider joining such a corp as the mechanics favour the safety in numbers  dont look at it as selling your soul but rather a learning experience for later when you want to start your own corp you can leave any time and if you find the right fit for you you can gain access to much game content with no or little downside this is quite insightful a lot of the tears and complaining come from incorrect expectations about the game the recent new pilot faq i linked above goes someway to spelling this out but the tutorials do a poor job of educating new players on what type of game this is and has a habit of sending them off on a pve career of mining or missioning where they are nothing but clueless prey items for the predators worse highsec is so safe now that a player can go months or years before someone wardecs them or suicide ganks them so it is slightly understandable that they complain that the game is broken or that ganker or wardeccer is griefing them when they eventually lose a ship because it is so outside their normal gameplay highsec needs to be made less lucrative and opportunities outside highsec made more clear to newer players to encourage them to leave also the npe should involved multiple ship losses to other players of inconsequential ships so players avoid the trap of becoming riskaverse and becoming attached to their ships it also should be made absolutely clear from the beginning that destroying ships in any security space is part of the game and when people do it they are not insulting hating on griefing or otherwise breaking the rules and as an extension of this that you are not entitled to run a pve corp in isolation from the risk that someone else in the sandbox might try to stop you
wrongyes the defending party can dodge the wardec by simply sitting in the station and effectively deny you fights that results in people being unable to play the game for which they pay which effectively will ruin corporations so far interdiction and such is good and that but lets be realistica majority of the wardeccing groups in highsec deliberately target as many small groups as possible to try and get free kills from them they target players who arent big enough to stand up against them and the second a fleet is formed up the aggressor docks up with no risk as result when theres a lot of allies in a wardec they simply stop paying it and a few days later it is gonecamera switch to the defender now look at the defenders their options are trying to find people to fight you which often isnt worth it from a defensive point of view or to sit in a station not being able to play thats all they can do meaning your silly wardec effectively stops their corporation for 50 million from being able to play the game thats an awfully low cost for such a high impact lets assume that theres a corporation thats five members big they all are active players but not yet invested in pvp due to their situation you spend 50 million isk to extend a wardec for seven days defenders are unable to deal with you and forcibly decide to stay in stationoffline for the seven days now what would that effectively cost the players5 players x 7 days  35 days between the groupif we assume one plex is 780 mil then techinally that wardec of yours costs them 850 million isk in wasted gametimethats a little steep for such a cheap method of wardeccing with no way to end it from the defending sideyou are the one who wants to wardec people but the second they can fight back you back outthe attitude you display is exactly the problem
do you even play this game dec dodging does not mean dock up all week it means drop corp and reform thus dissolving the wardec and all for the price of creating a corp which is nearly nothingdont even bother stepping into the discussion if you dont know what youre talking aboutwhen did i ever say that oh wait typical carebear strawman the attitude that you just made up
yesthey could disband their hard work on building something unique just because some little splerglord with only 50 million isk can have his epeen stroked because he picked on weak groups trying to make this game fun you want a free pass to mess with people who honestly cant fight back against most of the highsec wardec groups simply because they do not have the manpoweryou prey on that instead of taking on a meaningful entity you aim for the weak people so that you get free kills with little to no risk in return that by definition is the problem you pretend to fight against and the whole spirit of this topic is to allow a more comprehensive system to be in place which allows a defending party to end a wardec as well rather than putting this immense power into the aggressors handsif you would be a highsec wardeccer go after marmite and fight them they will have the numbers to deal with youbut dont be a little splerglord hitting the small people while yelling itz peeveepee u need defend urselfz knowing they cant
what hard work highsec corps are little more than a chat channel and a corp hangar there is no hard work unless it took you waaaaay longer than normal to pick a logo theres that strawman again do you actually plan to argue or just attack things i havent saidno the whole spirit of this topic is waah i want more safety i shouldnt have to bother defending myself the npcs should do it for methe defender has far far more power in this than the aggressor does there is zero justification to add more and plenty of justification to take some of it awaybut hell you wouldnt know that you dont even know what dec dodging actually is you just went off half cocked on a rant about something you didnt even understand
yesit is hard work if you want to build something lasting with a lot of member retention it takes a lot of time and effort that people like you ignore blissfullyit has been you who ignores honest problems that people who like a different playstyle bring up because it doesnt fit in your need to grief peopleplayer represents a group of highsec players who enjoy the pve aspectsplayer poses the following problem how are we to fight a war that we virtually can not end unless the other group decides to stop payingthen player asks to set in motion a change that will allow people to continue wardecs but allow players who are on the recieving end to have a potential method to end the war through participation essentially the principle of a wardec being continued onesidedly without a way to counteract that bothers player and thats what he hopes to adjustsummarizing wars are not able to be countered on a fundamental level wars are limited in risk to the initiator after all they decide to continue it or not wars should need a component that gives the defending party a more impactful method of dealing with them
hard work something unique are you sure youre talking about highsec corps here kindly inform us how highsec mining corp 81540283 and highsec mission runners local 10058233 are anywhere near unique when one highsec corp folds due to wardec ten more take its place doing the identical taskin your previous paragraph you said that they were building someting unique while i disagree with this if it were by some large miracle actually something unique then it wouldnt be meaningless and therefore a valid target according to your logic take some initiave and make yourself a risky target get ten people in t1 frigates and swarm those looking for easy kills and those people will avoid you in the futurethe only reason you cant is you are suffering under this delusion that you cant 1015 t1 frigates are enough to give the hardiest linked t3 heartburn sure youll lose a few but then again thats the real issue you dont want to lose anything doesnt matter if you lose the war youll get far far more respect simply because you stood up and fought if the wardecers are half as risk averse as you think they are then even this little bit of risk will be more than they want and theyll leave you aloneyou say theres nothing to stop them from extending the war for as long as they want to play i say youre wrong stop being a whiney little carebear with an exagerated sense of entitlement grow a pair and fight back dont whine that you cant you have the same ability to slap together a fleet of t1 frigs as everyone else your refusal to do so is the real problem not the wardec system
pretty sure they werent meant to have a loot table you get a bounty in exchange for hauling around drone poo
pretty sure all rats werent meant to have a loot table you get a bounty in exchange for hauling around lootoh wait you were being sarcastic
considering that this post was 23 years ago and dust is here legion is coming maybe  just maybe dust can eve can link in a more meaningful wayimagine walking out of your captains quarters and there are loyal dust troops rushing about finding a ship to get to another planet  and they see you what can you fly how fast can you get there erm  umm  a suicide bomber could fit like 15 of you guys with your equipment in there  and so it could go
jen i think we disagree on things perhaps even maybe a large number of things but i think you have spirit and i like your communication style and brain i hope you carry this attitude into csmyou will receive my vote good luck to you with the election
steve has my vote by farone of the best candidates ive seen and i feel that fuzzysteve is one of the best possible candidates1 and 5000 if i could
the following is an excerpt of my endorsements for csmxthe rest of the articlelist is found here best of luck steve
i was sort of reluctant for mining to be reworked by ccp especially given how many parts of the game have ended up after they have been iterated on too many careers have been  on from a great height to be listed here even so i read your concept ideas for how mining could be reworked and i quite like your ideas as a percentage how likely do you think it will that your ideas for reworking mining will be implemented i think we voted for you last year and it seems likely we will vote for you again this year we have one or two other candidates in mind but you are probably the front runner  theyre gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out  rick  find out what   abraham  theyre screwing with the wrong people  rick season four  the walking dead  
pfft
im not fully aware of eve politics nor the people involved in it but i must say that the reaction from csm members to this thread is something of note
all you need to know is xenuria runs every year this year is actually tame somewhat for a xenuria platformif i recall in previous years the big topics was the lack of crossdressing for toons and a gender gradient for every possible nonbinary gender in character creation because apparently eve couldnt be complete without shemales and such silly things like seriously future world where people can eb put into clone bodies 40 times a day from pewpew and someone thinks there would still be transexuals rather than people just opting to swap their bodyeither way long story short lightly trolling xenuria with cold hard logicbased questions is a tradition because the holes he digs are both deep and hilariously awkwardedit also was kinda sad the thread petered out was having fun those couple weeks it was always up on the first page
i am glad that now you can finally admit to trolling my thread
well pointing out faults with the intention of gaining a reaction out of the target is the essence of trolling and pointing out the basic flaws and other such silly things in your posts at least gets you to participate in your own csm thread because lord above knows you sure dont post to answer legitimate campaign concerns
were improving on your candidacy you should be thankfuland seriously if you were ever anything but a joke candidate you would a have legitimate discussions pertaining to your candidacy in this thread as well as opponents trolls and people disagreering with your causes or your person and b engage with opponents to defend and promote your ideas and candidacythis isnt that candidacy threadrather its like a public comedy except the one performing isnt a comedian by profession hes just just laughable which is why its rather enjoyable to participate in the discussion of your candidacy its hilarious van beyus xenuria runs every year and the reaction from the csm when its not one big meh is oh jolly good lets poke him with a stick and see if something hilariously outrageous statement  yt video  incorrect claim as to the actions of opponents  misunderstanding of reality  and so much more comes out  its the real opponent candidates theyre concerned about not the joke candidates
my pleasurejust because it is difficult however does not mean that it is not worth trying
ups and downs are part of mercs workas tora is proberbly the only csm candidate i have had the chance to speak and fly with over the years on ts he will be 1 of my votesi would actually vote for danalee buts shes not in it
thanks and for all of you who dont know who to vote for see the list above here
hey tora we can talk later on ts but id like to throw a couple of ideas at you and the rest here for your csm campaign1 suspect timer when going suspect you can not dock until your cool down timer hits 14 minutes the same as an aggro timer this would concern all players that like use nuet logi in hs loot thefts suspect baiters and when kill rights are activated so if you go suspect you have 1 minute to evade players or tank them to be able to dock up if already suspect and your timer is below 14 minutes you can dock at anytime2 implants i think we should be able to get implants from players corpses that people pod if you grab the corpse and take it to a station you should have a small percentage of there implants if any drop like loot does from destoryed shipsthese are just a couple of ideas and they are just my ideas ps also posted in cp
lets do that fybs the implant suggestion was already discussed somewhere in the postand i am on the cfc list
thanks for all the support mails chats etc i am getting
after reading the post and listening to toras interview twice i am convinced that he understands what eve is about and how it can be improved good luck

best of luck in the election corbexx1 from each of my accounts
you have until march 10th to vote for csm xthe csm is a focus group that needs various strongly opinionated members with a good knowledge of the game and widely different points of views to be most useful to ccp you also need csm members that are active dedicated and show it in the way they have campaigned and the work they put out it is now up to you to select which of us will be part of csm x ccp teams are the only ones making the final choices about the game the most diverse feedback they can get from the csm for future release the best their choice will be educated by the various play styles in use and the sand box will continue to offer play styles for a wide variety of players sharing the same virtual universe but with sometime opposing prioritiesthe stv voting system ensures a reasonable degree of representation as long as you fill your voting ballot fully with 14 names filling it partially is wasting your capacity to fill the csm with a diverse mix of membersi have run my campaign to establish a clear base line about where i come from with some fairly radical concepts that i explained i believe this type of election should not be run with vanilla or populist concepts and for that i will not be on the voting recommendations of most of the popular crowd i only rely on you voters with an independent mind and a wish to bring different voices to bearif i am elected i plan to model my activity toward my constituents in a way that will be similar to what sugar kyle and corbexx have established during their tenure on csm ix i want to thank those that have added me to their ballot recommendations gevlon goblin from the greedy goblin blog rixx javixx from dramaganda blogi also want now to endorse other candidates that i like and will put on my own ballot  i am not going to endorse anyone that has previously been on the csm for the reasons you can read here regardless of the quality of their previous service to the cause  as i wish to represent the independent players i am not going to endorse candidates that are too obviously in position of leadership or official or surrogate representatives of already established large groups i will not endorse candidates that were not able to generate at least 1000 views on their campaign thread being on the csm requires efforts and this is a bad start i will make only one exception to this rule with harek from then i will endorse other candidates which i believe can bring something fresh to the csmso here are the 13 other candidates that with my name you should consider for your ballot to lessen the influence of the power blocks i am simply using alphabetical order their ranking in your ballot is up to you arieteangrod losshelinashterothichance ravinnecitriocinierika mizunejayne fillonjune tingharekmigui xhyrrnlorelei ierendiradu lupescusabriz adoudelplease vote and vote fully
why not run on your main
i have discussed the reasons theretldr first i want to run on ideas i believe will make the game fairer for all and be judged on these ideas and not from the corps i have flew with or the state of my killboard with me you get what you read on these forums baseline statements that helps identify the points i will defend if i am elected not showing my main also ensures that i will not suffer from backlash ingame about ideas that i understand are threatening some players influence over the game playing solo my best defense is into this kind of secrecy  running as an anonymous alt is also making a point about this particular aspect of my program i have little reason to be the one linking my alts publicly while anonymous alts remain a part of the game for all other players if this change i will be the first one to link all my alts to this account
i have been quizzed by shadowandlight at dualboxing about the current discussion of the recent ban of input duplicationhere is my responsei am against keys duplication tools ie any way where the same command can be propagated to multiple clients at the same timei am in favor of multiple accounts per player and multiboxing without key duplicationas you may have read id like all the alts of a player to be public this is an important point of my campaign and this is to better understand the field as right now it is very hard to telli am not in favor of a limit as such in the number of alts but i do acknowledge that too many alt for the same player can have a too profound impact on the game we all share and may be there needs to be a limiti think that brinign the alts in the spotlight for each player will naturally control this fieldi believe one pilot per player would kill the solo play style that i represent i play with a handful of accounts myself and started dabbling in key duplication before it got banned i am glad it did get banned as i was going there reluctantly to keep up with the crowd that was visibly more and more using duplicationsi favor banning players caught in using something that i see as a cheat but i also believe ccp game design should incorporate the out of game tools to limit their effectiveness for exemple i am against opaque backgrounds and in favor of more sounds design to alert players may be even when a new sig appear of on some dscan results in short i favor integrating ingame things that players with the right skill set can do out of game so as to not generate unfairness amongst the players
hello there although you may not be a blogger or podcaster or some other kind of attentionseeker you have my attention with your controversial though seemingly well thought out ideas however to secure my vote you will need to work harder you clearly have some passion about the game and a vision for it but will you pledge to start some kind of blog  podcast  etc to provide regular updates to those who elected you i agree with you wholeheartedly about toolsmechanics that aid small groups and allow them to make an impact and how they are invariably nerfed very hard every time a powerbloc heavy csm wades in how are you going to convince the ccp devs that small groups are important in eve something you should consider adding  thinking about to regarding your proposed eula change by restricting alts chribba style it solves one of the biggest problems in eve someone spending their offtime in incursions renter mininratting or in freighter ganking on an alt to fund their main activities without risking repercussions from any of those groups which is why i like it it also encourages the rpg aspect of the mmorpg however it also makes it easier for someone to discover the alts of a famous or infamous player and harrass them to stop playing the game how will you deal with this argument which i think will be presented to you once players cant hide behind an army of alts the wardec mechanic suddenly becomes closer to one of its initial goals a system for one group of players to settle disputes with another group of players this could also increase the viability of merc contracts what changes would you like to see to wardec mechanics regarding this losec hisec and wsec tends to be where most smaller groups hang out afaik hisec and wormholes already get a lot of attention in csm x what changes would you like to see most in losec to encourage activity there as well as make it more fun and interesting especially with regard to fw in my opinion new players are the lifeblood of eve what changes would you like to see to encourage new players into the game and not just stuck running missions for a few months before finding the game boring and unsubbing where do you stand on new players and how important do you think considering new players and how to involve them is on the priority list you mention you have little experience in hisec yet thats where almost all players begin playing how did you start in eve and what do you plan to do to learn more about hisec and the other activities you say you dont do you say that you are a pvper yet you have posted your campaign on a character that only has 2 depots lost in a 10 system and which was created in september 2014 why are you hiding behind such an alt if you have played for 5 years you can excuse me for finding this somewhat hypocritical im sure tell us a little more about what you have been doing for 5 years in the game thanks for reading and i hope you have a chance to reply before the coming electionsfang
a bump for borat
yes i will what sugar kyle and corbexx have done for their tenure for csm x is my model i will strive to duplicate for those that elected me i will do my best to bring out the arguments read on the forums by the tenants of this play style on the topics that will come up and condense those for ccp this active involvement plus the clear axe of my campaign if i am elected means that ccp will know i am speaking for a segment usualy under represented on the csm in the end ccp is responsible for the balamces they want for the game it will be my duty to make sure they receive the proper feedback this said i am confident that they know solo players are also a group to not ignore as ccp seagull has mentioned solo players a few times already since she became the executive producer yes there is a clear risk of ingame retaliation with public alts which as you know one of the reasons i run under this currently allowed anonymous alt system because of the threats my radical ideas for csm x can bring to my assets i believe such a measure would effectively affect the way players choose to behave with their different accounts under such a risk and will decide on their own if the risk of undertaking specific actions from various accounts that can link back to the same player will be worth it much like a pvper decide of the risk when engaging a combat or a trader risk their isks in the markets after all if one get harassed to that degree he or she has the same tools to see who is doing it too and respond in kind and everyone will still be free to diversiy their alts accordingly right now utilising anonymous alts is an activity that does not fit on the risk versus reward approach that most of the other activities in eve are designed around i would have to read more about this from all sides before committing to a response wardec is not a very high priority item for solo players the only thing i have already heard and that i do support is that a player corp with no fixed assets has no reasons to be wardeccable which is something i would support getting involved for the minmatar faction and help turning the tides in factional warfare against the amarr is next on my todo list in game i have no personal experience with it at the moment and once elected would have to read about it and practice more in that area to be able to present ideas toward the goal you describe for lowsecto be continued
i have summarized my thoughts about new players hereit is truly important to not have them be left hanging in a game that is so full of potentials having large groups create training corps that are funneling them in their structures is a natural state of the eve online players driven experience and it is great to see this developping i certainly wish for them to know that you still can play the game solo but like my own trajectory it is not something that is really doable fairly early ingame if your focus is pvpi have myself joined the game discarded the tutorials and missioning rapidly as my focus was on pvp before heading to a training corp and then joining null sec it is only after a few years and the introduction of wormholes that i have found my solo play stylei wish playing solo in the sense of establishing your assets there could be a reasonable option in nullsec and lowsec too which is why i believe nomadism needs to be developed more and may be a solution for the smaller entities in those spaces together with for example establishing sov on a small portion of a system like an asteroid belt for a solo player yes i like pvp but i am a solo player not a solo pvper often both terms are mixed together ignoring that sometime a solo pvper flies with only one visible ship yes but can have a significant amount of infrastructures behind him especialy intel channels links and reinforcements or srp of course it removes nothing from their skills and the glamour they cast on the solo play style in general i do my own srp links isk making without paying a dime to any other players structure and i usualy pvp via multiboxing without isboxer and i am not using key duplication anymore of course as i am glad it got banned and i supported this change for fairness to all playersi am not exposing my other alts because via my pvp activity locating me is extremely easy one of the reason i would favor nomadism as a realistic way to make a living as well as some kind of metagame fog of war around the killboard data the killboard also dictates so much within the large groups that i believe they are a nuisance to the game which i got rid of by going solo tools to measure  sizes have never been my cup of tea especially in a sandbox game like eve i am not driven by the quality of my killboard in the way i play eve but in the fun i can have doing my own hunting in a space where my assets are at risk all the time
belinda hwafang wrote something you should consider adding  thinking about to regarding your proposed eula change by restricting alts chribba style it solves one of the biggest problems in eve someone spending their offtime in incursions renter mininratting or in freighter ganking on an alt to fund their main activities without risking repercussions from any of those groups which is why i like it i do not think pointting anyone is really useful but at the same time i do believe that if the eula was going to be changed in such a way there should be at least a few months long period where everyone should have a chance to sell some of their characters before public alts become a thing so as to protect the aspect of the image they want to project to everyone
thank you for the detailed answers good luck in the electionsfang
i am a new player but i have spent the past two weeks trying to become as educated as i can with the election process issues and candidatesfrom all i have read you are the first candidate i can definitely say you will have my votekeep up the good work
current ratting no but if new npcs were to show up i would be fine with them being more ai wise and doing things like warping out or calling for reinforcements which would in turn mean that the player would have to fit points to keep the target handy i like the concept of the newer things being smarter but nobody was screaming for belt rats to suddenly be sleeper level or sansha tanked each type will be its own classas for the invulnerability period timers yeah that would be nice i find myself counting out loud when it is a situation where the time means somethingno damage control is fine as it is thus it can be capped out turned off and is a darwin check for people coming into a system and yes i have failed that check more than oncemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

hello mike can you name one issue  point that was discussed during the past years csm meetings and not under nda that you felt strongly about and were in disagreement with the majority of other csm members doesnt matter if you got your way or notdescribe briefly the argument you presented to defend the issue and the challenges you faced if any being the mission runningcasual candidate among the others thanksfang
this will seem to be an odd choicethe sensitivity training drama started early in the csm and lines were drawn ccp tried to calm the waters by having a meeting to discuss professional conduct with the csm it was needed because not only did we have negative people towards the process but also people who brought their in game politics into the csm and continued game agendas this made the council less functional than it could have beeneve is politics and i can play nasty if i want was said to which i responded this is not eve we are a council discussing evesome folks never got it and at least one of them is running again others mocked the process of trying to bring a level of professionalism to the council and made jokes about singing kumbaya they never ever got the message and we suffered for it i will say it again here csm is not about the game politics it is politics so we can talk about the game anyone unable to lay their baggage at the door and discuss things calmly from their positions of knowledge rather than from in game prejudice is doing the game the voters and the council a great disservicethere were other times that i was the adversary but most of them are still too ndad to discussmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i asked a tricky question and i got an excellent response thank you and good luck in the elections mikefang
just looking through some previous replies while waiting for the server cod obviously isnt the same as eve online and you make yourself look like an idiot to say so in eve you can do many activities that are not directly a combat situation although they could arguably in a way be construed as being pvp whereas cod is all about fighting and pvp and there is little else to do there
personally i feel the new awox settings are potentially hazardous because if we accidentally shoot a corpie then concord will come and kill us so i will be leaving it as unsafe as before and before someone points it out i know im the only girl in my corporation im speaking theoretically
we were considering giving you are votes for the csm candidacy as we like some of your ideas such as renovating the wardec system to increase the costs if a large force wishes to attack a small or tiny force we also liked your idea of giving small percentage increases eg to mining yield for pilots who stay in the same playerrun corporations for say three months or more i think you also gave support to i think it was steve ronukens idea  to bring some kind of sovereignty aspect or control of systems to high sec that idea interests me but it would have to be tightly controlled and well thought out otherwise it would end up like the situation with high sec pocos which to my mind isnt healthyit sounds like you would also like to remove high sec from the game which i dont really agree with can you explain your thoughts again on this policy 
just want to throw my support behind sabriz he is articulate reasonable and has good ideas which are all important traits for a csm member
with the safe option turned on you would only be able to shoot a corp mate with safeties set to red otherwise your safeties would prevent you from shooting that being said i leave my corp on unsafe as well
i do not want to remove highsec eve should be balanced on a sliding scale of risk vs reward with wormhole space and nullsec offering the highest rewards alongside the highest risk rookie systems offering almost no reward and almost no risk and highsec and lowsec somewhere in the middle of those twohighsecs two defining traits are the presence of large quantities of neutrals among whom a minority of predators may be hiding and the fact that the defender has significant but not overwhelming advantages in any conflict concord in ganks ability to call in allies in wardecs ability to have armed neutral assistance when you shoot a suspect etcthe game can and should have areas like this
my suggested voting platform1 sabriz adoudel2 tora bushido3 steve ronuken414 fill all of these out with candidates of your choice that are not mike azariah if you do not have enough candidates you care about pick ones at randomthe reasoningideally id like to get voted up on my own rights however if i am not elected under stv a 1 sabriz 2 tora vote is almost equivalent to a 1 tora vote i feel tora is the second best highsec predator candidate and would be a huge asset to the csm whether i am elected or not and my voters might help put tora over the line steve r probably doesnt need help getting over the line but i dont think this should be left to chance the csm needs someone with his unique skillsetmike azariah was instrumental in providing feedback that led to incursion changes while he presented these changes as quality of life changes they have been major balance changes that have further damaged the already seriously bad risk to reward imbalance present in highsec incursion farming eve was made actively worse by these changes regardless of any positive qualities mike may have as a person or organizer eve would be better if his feedback on game balance issues is marginalized or ignoredit may seem that his feedback is irrelevant if you do not participate in incursions yourself but the enormous amounts of liquid isk poured into the economy by incursions transforms the game economy considerably this is true of nullsec ratters as well but null ratters do at least drive small gang fights and occasionally larger conflictsunder stv it is an optimal voting strategy to fill your ballot with candidates that have a fringe chance of being elected if you wish to reduce one particular candidates chance of getting elected
thats my opinion too befor i moved forward to fcon  ive spendet a lot time in providence and enjoyed the fleets with core and thats what shan sind wrote  is the point i will definitly vote for core again his passion for the game and the people i hope he takes this many good qualities with in his work as a csm again to do his best to make our hobby eve a better placeso 1 core for csm x
you say you understand new players new players or the lack thereof are going to decide if eve continues to thrive or wilts away slowly in the coming years i do think brave has clearly done many things right when i would visit barleguet in 2014 i would often be impressed at the numbers undocking to pvp mine probe gatecamp and so onhowever i have never played in brave and have not had the pleasure to create any brave spy characters exactly what a spy would say so i have not had the pleasure to read your corp chat forums or hear your teamspeak what is it that brave does to engage so well with new players and capture their imaginationwhat do you think it is that we the players and they the devs can do to reveal the fing awesome aspects of eve when they are 3 months in and already feeling the drudgery of running some missions in hisecfang
you have my vote because being in bni  i am able to see the work that you and all the others players are doing for us the newbies if it wouldn t be the brave newbie community  i m sure i wasn t playing this game anymore so if you will represent newbies in csm as you do in our corporation  than you should be there for us also i wanna thank you now with this opportunity for everything that you are making for us or maybe i should send a corporation mail with thanks nahh i don t wanna dye before my time  good luck

hello sugari would like fw to be changed so that allegiance to a faction wasnt for most people merely an incentive to just choose the faction based on lp stores and isk per hour perhaps open up special cosmetic items medals ribbons ship skins or something else that could not be traded or perhaps a deeper involvement in the story through certain scripted npc events or billboard adverts or other ways to engage a veteran of a particular fw faction you probably have better ideas already after all i dont spend much time in losec these daysand could we please please have pirate factions in the fw systemi would like to hear your thoughts on my suggestions and if these topics have ever reached csm airtime recently i do try to skim read the csm minutes but i am less than thorough perhapsfang
dont forget my rorqual which has the ore edition skin is named buttered sconebelindai want fw to be more than where and who has the best lp there are a lot of rules and restrictions that a fw pilot takes on to battle for their militia ive pushed for and continued to push for more depth in the war zone more lore and dynamic changes from the war zoneid love pirates moving more into non fw low sec but i dont think just making fw with pirate militas would be that exciting game play having players able to align themselves with pirate factions for other interesting reasons rewards and hard decisions would be fantastic and start adding more to the nature of things i like piracy as a player and piracy as a game expanderand yes there are whole files and conversations in the csm forumsconfluence pages about fw ive been going to members and gathering all of that up from the winter minutes weve had an uptick in fw which is a good thing to see there are many things on my plate for this such as a look over the missions lp and pvp reward systems to name a few
great platform im curious what your thoughts are on current highsec wardec mechanics and if you feel there are any issues that which need to be addressed

not voting for anything pl since i heard excessive use of racial epithet on twitch streams by pl leadership
vote for bobmon
bobmon wrotethe bellow concepts are just ideas based on either ccp ideas or player feedback concept 1 hardcore player mode ccp rise talked about this a few weeks back and it got me interested i did some thinking and i liked the idea to have a special alt who is badass at doing pvp related stuff hardcore player mode in my opinion should be based on the pirate faction lines this would work because it would back up the fact that your char can always be shot even in highsec by all other players this char is special because once you unlock it you get a certain amount of sp that you can use on almost all pvp related skills with almost all i mean that i want to exclude every skill that doesnt require you to actually pvp in your ship such as no cloak and cloak related ships bombers probers no station skills no poss related skills only anchor maybethese pirate faction chars would only have the capability to fly their own pirate race ships maybe all pirate ships havent decided yet because they created these themselves to fight off their enemies the effect of them self designing their ships might result in a small extra bonus but again not sure on this yetpirate chars wont have access to wh space because their focus is to fight their true enemy the big four factions fleet wise i want these chars to basically be solo roaming UFFFDcross new eden but i do think that they should be able to group up with other pirates of their faction but this might result in them getting some drawbacks at forming fleets or whatever pirate chars should basically force a player to be on top of their game or they get killedpirates can maybe even make isk through killing people that do militia related stuff and i would love them to be these little pricks who cause a lot of chaos everywhere their go3 lowsecmake lowsec better for new alliances and players to get into pvp so that they have a place to grow more on this in this you can find herei think if i may be frank in my response that these two bullet points are the main reasons why i will not be voting for you in the csm ill outline my counter reasons below1 hardcore mode while i admire that you think pirates in eve are hardcore i find the concept of alts skipping training and other foundation based skills for the sole purpose of having a max level alt is utterly ridiculous eve is full of alts i myself have six accounts for various uses and im sure you being in pl have members that have dozens of alt accounts putting alts in a position of niche maxed pvp skilled factions for the sole purpose of getting into pvp quicker in theory is okay but when looked at in eves current playstyle of having multiple accounts and characters is rather dangerous and unreasonable various entities would just train alts and place them in whatever pirate faction gave the best bonus for the current meta to support whatever doctrines were niche at the timefurthermore the concept of locking out players of certain areas like whs not only neuters whs usefulness post phoebe for travel and fleet placement but limits the concept of the sandbox as a whole pirates already become locked out of high sec due to security status further restricting players based upon lore or rather your loose concept of what lore should be in eve is rather damaging to an already dying playstylewhich leads me to my next point2 lowsecyour concept of low sec being a training ground for a bunch of f1 pressing tidi fests is not only laughable but is frankly insulting to those of us who live in low sec for the very fights you claim low sec is to train people towards in null null is not the end all nor is it the be all of eve there are many players who flock to low sec to get away from the very grinds and blobs that you claim is the endgame of eve online not only do i disagree with this ignorant concept but i find it rather amusing how low sec is so lightly thrown aside to only focus upon what makes your game playable for your specific nicheindeed why wouldnt we get rid of post phoebe changes to jump fatigue and give players streamlined combat alts with your proposed reduction of nerfs to jump fatigue there would be no use for whs and it would once again align entities who depended upon non fatigue timers and high sp characters with being back on top of the proverbial food chainwhich leads be to my conclusion1 there are already pirates in low sec hi waves2 using low sec as a watered down region where players dip their toes in for very little to skitter off to null is baseless and frankly insulting not only to those who thrive upon small gang pvp but feel very strongly of improving and making low sec and piracy a viable and fun place3 post phoebe changes are staying because it defangs entities who forgot to use stargates and trying to undo them is laughable until you actually approach people as a csm candidate and try to learn their playstyle dont go throwing out ignorant concepts as the best solution or idea it makes you look bad
chance voted for you on all my accounts didnt bother submitting anyone for my second third choice ect as i dont care if anyone else gets on the csm i was close to quitting the game for good after 11 years of playing but your videos and how you help the new bros has made me get of my ass and do something different in eve
it may be a particularly tough and large field this year but as fc of some of fleets ive been in its evident that large and tough fields are your homei vote for you
no more nerfing enhance gameplay  yesenhance the first time user experience  yesnerf the game more to appease the carebears  hell noroll back as much of the nerfing already done as possible  yes

to see my responses to the 60 question eve match survey you can go here
what does any of this actually mean balancing by cost
it means moving towards a model where the invention and manufacturing process actually has an outcome on the ship and that is where numbers tweaking and modifications happen by the players eve has done a remarkable job at creating a market and economic system based on player based manufacturing essentially it requires a different mentality building and invention are actually just that the baseline physics mechanics and engine are all that are really needed ship modules and composition along with various choices in building would provide the customization and performance balance on a daily basisthat is essentially the tldr though i have said it better elsewheres

thank you so much for the interview it was a pleasure being able to sit down with you guys
1 i think that alignment with a pirate faction should be something that is a mechanical part of the game obviously real implementation like a fw type situation would be a very long hard process however there are a number of extremely interesting characters and organizations out there it would be nice to at the very least align yourself and possibly get friendly status with a pirate faction i have known several people who would enjoy that very much2 i do have a carrier  but to be more real i have watched the balance of exploration go back and forth recently and while it does often change my bottom lines and fun factor of these activities i think ccp should have the right to massage features to ensure they are where they need to be if we players and ccp treat feature rebalances as the endallbeall we cripple ourselves from being able to take daring risks loot spew was one such idea3 its hard to say what lowsec really needs while the null problem is so oppressive i think lowsec specifically fw lowsec is in one of the best places it has been in years however as null stagnates low is being overloaded by bored sov folks we really need to get sov working for the benefit of everyone
so voting has begun and i am humbled to have so many excellent endorsementsi would like to point out once more that i wouldnt have taken this on without the full support of my family i feel confident i can put your vote to good use and make you happy with my representation and activity i have written a post about my endorsements for csm you can check it out here
voting is opengogogogo
look at the names in that post such history2012 was a great year in nulsec hbc had 14000 proud sperging assholes all shooting the crap out of each other the southeveo isnt just about ships balancing power projection economics and metagaming spies its also about the ties and friendships we form with other players that transcend alliance or coalition boundaries i think migui knows something of thatthe csm needs a member that knows what its like to go from major powerhouse to utter bottom of the barrel and the long climb back out of irrelevance he also has a stable personality and a dislike of drama unlike certain other candidates if you are a member of test you should be voting for this guy even if youre not you should still vote for him
as cycules ceo he has my full support in representing morts corp and the kadashi alliance
as an industrial and mining mentor to cycule i would like to throw my support behind him in his campaign for csm not only does cycule understand the pvp players concerns for the game but he also understands the plight of the little man he does understand that not every person plays the game the same way and we dont all have the same goals in mindcycule is a well rounded player with the knowledge and drive to be a great csm representative for us all no one person can change the world but with enough people like cycule we can change the eve universe to be a better place for us all
still some spots remaining especially for null sec
i cant make firm commitments that weekend right now due to upcoming potential travel plans if you want me as an alternate im happy to step in for that

1would happily fly with again
hello im ryan farmern the correct person for you to vote for in csm xim not much for running a campaign but i am running this year because i feel ccp has made too many big changes too fast i think we need to look at fixing some of the game mechanics need more useful deployables wormholes need ice belts possibly not the exact same ice belts need to be an ihub upgrade not a lucky geo location better ewar balance reevaluate t2 production ccp to actually ask the community about big changes capital mining ships more risk for more isk comparable to what a ratting toon can makehour dockable capitals in high sec better interface for corp roles same thing for pos roles anchoring timers pi overhaul reevaluate multiboxing policy to be strict on combat and not on industry cloaking ships need bubble nullified but for cloaking devices to use fuel of isos or lo also add a fuel bay and skill that effects fuel consumption new players need better tutorials and something pointing them to verified new player corps other than eveu i could sit here for hours thinking of changesbalances i think eve needs couldnt we allvote for ryan farmern the csm everyone needs to fix eve not just one area of space
this makes me moist
i support most of these changes good luck you have my vote
we have had the distinct advantage of having xander on csm 9 facilitating our insatiable interest in all things eve 1 all acknowledge the work hes put in regardless of whatever they may make of his style2 hes put his weight and intellect behind the removal of multibox automation increasing profits for miners and hopefully increasing the constituency of miners and therefore their stake in the game3 he delivers the skinny on whats going on in the csm and presses ccp to tell us and keep us informed up to the mark but no further4 hes demonstrated that hes independent articulate and hardworking with a deep interest in the game above alland hes a no nonsense scottvote xander if you want to keep on being so well informed
sat down to talk about the process with the legacy of a capsuleer dudes a few days ago recording is now available to listen to here
i have detailed my own ballot and the reasons for it in my latest csm9 weekly report here
viable questions curious for the answers as well
i think the biggest problem for communities like rvb ganked spectre fleet or stille gewalt is the inability to get in contact with players who might not directly the target groupa featuretool like the social groups which was mentioned in the winter sumit is a good solution for thati think you should get on a conscience level the repartee of power blocks especially in the sov space where are finally some people who like the quantitywayi think the running away or accidentally jump inaspect in eve should be obtainedfinally it should not give the fleetdoctrine which always work why should they might work again on ishtar onlinesoonand yes p
so tomorrow is the big dayi have no specific endorsements to make vote for whomever you think best represents and voices your playstyleif you dont know who a person on your ballot is you shouldnt be voting for them

i guess i am always open to hear the reasons why ccp would not think to implement some of these ideas and revel in the challenge of someone as stubborn as myself i see the csm as an oppertunity to shake things up when people get accustomed to the bars or limitations its our job to bend and break themin regards to incursions i think they are fantastic but they are just in the wrong area people in nullsec mainly ratters have been telling me they crave some sort team based isk making source as a 1010 runner i can tell you running anything with more than 2 people is a fruitless endevour compared to highsec incursions i guess my real problem comes down to the security of it all if my cloaking overhaul would be looked at it would make space more secure a trained team could lock down an area long enough to run various things but with the risk there is no riskreward in highsec its all rewardi feel that running missions is great but my main gripe is that people can section themselves off from the forces which drive everything in this game the pvp the problem is that they become so sectioned that they become a seperate part of a community which needs new blood new targets new opportunities while mission runners are a community in itself again we must not lose sight of the driving force of eve by putting level 4s into lowsec i feel it would breath new life into endles dead systems while balancing the riskreward that drake belt ratting in nullsec for his first time has to facebuying sp well to be honest i feel that a character is your identity that you mould over your time in eve its true that people pick up and drop characters alts holding toons with ease but i find myself firmly atttached to the iconic lyonic buying a character with raw isk does not put anything into the pockets of plex suppliers i feel that with increased revenue comes increased development and safeguarding of cashcows milk me there are playing with vast amount of isk who would could finish that training que a little faster or get into that new ship remember if you want to get the sp lets say around 2 million sp per plex you have to find the isk to buy the plex its a whole new area of character development you can right now grind out your assets but no matter what you do your speed at getting into to new ships and areas of the game is slow and i want to open up this game for everyone after all it is our wits that defines the combat not the spi know its hard to open your mind to new ideas but i really feel this would be a good thing and i welcome all comments
1 where should new players go3 how does high sec even come close to being as big a problem as null sec stagnation
new players should stay in highsec until they are ready or their skills say hey cmon time to make some isk to use us the way i have always seen the journey from high  low  null is that is a progression you learn the bsics in highsec then in lowsec you use your knowledge and begin to learn about stuff like gate mechanics station guns using dscan etc then when you know how to handle danger you move to nullsec and learn about bubbles and player owned stations etc maybe take part in some big fleets you already know what the zones have to offer the point is that the sp and the isk should be in balance in these areas as they progress the problem is that you can effectivly stay in highsec your entire life and thats cool but it should be at a cost riskrewardthe thing with highsec is it holds alot of players now sure if lets say my changes about shifting the wealth back to the proper places happened i know that everyone would not leave highsec however i believe that people will start to understand the riskreward  pvp community alot better now they dont have to pvp heck there are miners mission runners etc and they should be aware of pvpers and take evasive manouvers and work for their isk
and yet all current statistic say that null sec is the safest place to make isk and the high sec population is decreasing
here is your campaign ad
hey bud so your statistics are for like a few days so you cant really see any long term pattern also the graph shows there are a lot more players in highsec i am not saying highsec is too safe at all i am saying that you can make too much money in relative safety in highsec i feel that the whole starting tutorial needs to be totally revamped in every way it is a difficult game its far to complicated at hits people with way to much information at the start i would like to see a starship trooper style would you like to know more for the different areas of eve maybe even a preentering the world a few options likei want to shoot peoplei want to mine and make stuffi want to run quests and explore the lorethe choices could mean a different more easy to digest tutorial by having fuller systems in lowsec and nullsec there is more of a chance of someone picking them up for their corp
just to touch on this issue againwhat is it that makes you feel null ratters need to not be threatened by afk cloakers while also wanting high ratters to be threatened by lowsec piracy what makes diminished risk in nullsec justified but the current level of risk in highsec unjustified
good question mixu before i can answer you i need to let you know where i stand on a few things so you guys can better understand my answerwhat is a renter imo i think a renter is someone who enjoys living in nullsec but does not necessary want to pvp he wants to rat some isk run missions mine do some pi all the stuff nullsec has to offer without fighting i think this is awsome because we need more people doing this stuff in nullsecwhen i was in ink i remember fleets going up to ward of roaming gangs who came through our renter space after all we are the landlords and its our job to keep the space as safe as we can keep the space is what makes it yoursrisk in nullseci see risk as that ceptor pilot jumping in and warping to anoms and the gang that follows after to kill the snared target i see risk as dudes popping out of wh space raiding the space which grows fat with the grinding of isk why do i want to remove afk cloaking if a blops gang has say 20 people in it and lets say they all have one alt on average some people have more others none if i put 20 alts into systems where renters frequent for the purpose of dropping on them there is nothing the renters can do they are renters because they dont want to fight remember or fighting is not their priority now you could say form up a fleet etc but thats what they are paying for the protectionso why is running level 4 missions to be made riskier by making them in lowsec and why am i taking risk away from nullsec from afk cloakers simple i feel that balance means there is a counter to something the level 4 mission runner can scout fit warp stabs make safe spots even stick up a pos or mobile depot the renter can do nothing but die when the cloak comes off the scrams are applied and the cyno goes upalong with a local spike i dont see afk cloaking a risk i see it as an imbalance
when you remove cloaky camping though isnt that just removing all risk completely sure there is a chance a ceptor can catch you but if intel is up to date and you are watching it then there is more or less 0 risk the same with whs you can simply just not rat in a system with a wh and keep an eye on intel
sure if you own 20 systems and have poses or stations can an move to these systems what if you own 1 system wh are the place with constant risk nullsec is not wh space there is risk but not as muchthere are enough players in eve to stick a claoked into every system if they are active thats fine but afk people affecting a 30 man corp or whatever is wrong in my book and this mans not for changin
hey alex ive got a few questions for you if you wouldnt mind answering them1 aside from the jump drive changes for the rorqual what else would you like to see changed to make it a unique ship with a unique role once again2 would you support dialing down removing the jump fatigue for combat capitals so they can be used more than once a day as it stands now it takes forever to move them out of staging and into position i know some of this is intended but as it is right now its jumpgo watch a moviethen jump again its boring game play that doesnt have the edgy choice feel people keep banging on about 3 going along with your pos fitting idea are there any other changes to pos mechanics youd like to see done or any changes to reactions pos layout it seems like youre pretty well limited in your choices when it comes to pos design and it neither offers fun interesting gameplay nor rewarding experiences 4 what is your opinion on the current state of pve in nullsec are expeditions too pointless with the new jump fatigue mechanic are the different regions balanced in terms of moons ratting etc if they are unbalanced what would you do if anything to encourage greater balance 4 seems to me like its going to become a bigger question now that the drifters are in the game iirc drifters unidentified structures appear more in different regions and depending on whether or not they add or detract value from a region it will create a disparity while i agree some regions need a boost to their value i think these drifters if they keep on in their current iteration will either be too worthless to attack or if they attack sov claim sov theyll be too much of a nuisance and only further detract from the regions value
question you clearly have strong ideas about eradicating stagnation which i like but why then are you part of one of the alliances in one of the most stagnant coalitions ingame
1 aside from the jump drive changes for the rorqual what else would you like to see changed to make it a unique ship with a unique role once againit has a unique best boosts id like to see the ship maintenance array have the same capabilities as the orca allow all ships not just indy but that isnt to make it more unique just more useful2 would you support dialing down removing the jump fatigue for combat capitals so they can be used more than once a day yesas it stands now it takes forever to move them out of staging and into position i know some of this is intended but as it is right now its jumpgo watch a moviethen jump again its boring game play that doesnt have the edgy choice feel people keep banging on about 3 going along with your pos fitting idea are there any other changes to pos mechanics youd like to see done or any changes to reactions pos layout id like to see pos gunning reworked so that its not a pain in the assit seems like youre pretty well limited in your choices when it comes to pos design and it neither offers fun interesting gameplay nor rewarding experiences the same could be said of several ships when it comes to pvp fits id say its the current meta but for poses its been the same way for ages theres only so many ways to fit a tower for the same exact purpose like a dickstar deathstar etc4 what is your opinion on the current state of pve in nullsec are expeditions too pointless with the new jump fatigue mechanic are the different regions balanced in terms of moons ratting etc if they are unbalanced what would you do if anything to encourage greater balance phoebe freeport made it work to some extent but its hard for any new group to make headway the way jump range has limited attacks geography and range now have to be factored into attacks and defenses and existing empires seem to have enough power to shift pvp resources around to deal with border incursions moon goo isnt balanced but until its made into something more dynamic or a resource that shifts around or decays over time it will stay unbalanced and nice isk faucets for the empires4 seems to me like its going to become a bigger question now that the drifters are in the game iirc drifters unidentified structures appear more in different regions and depending on whether or not they add or detract value from a region it will create a disparity while i agree some regions need a boost to their value i think these drifters if they keep on in their current iteration will either be too worthless to attack or if they attack sov claim sov theyll be too much of a nuisance and only further detract from the regions valuetheyre something new that ccp is still developing so i think the players and csm can continue giving them feedback on the drifters and hopefully theyll turn out well it doesnt seem like theyre even as bad as nullsec incursion rats yet though
as i believe i mentioned in my interview with cap stable the evolution of politics cannot be reversed it used to be that corporations set each other blue and called those standings alliances which were later formalized into a mechanic by ccp since then we have had alliances then setting each other blue and those are called coalitionsi doubt that ccp plans on or wants to formalize any type of coalition management mechanic unless the population of eve drastically increases and i wouldnt support it either although from a talk about the crest api system at eve vegas there will likely soon be new functionality released that allows standings to be set via api thirdparty developer applications which means that alliances who have organized services and would subsequently create semiautomated services to manage standings would technically have a mechanic to better manage their coalitionas for why im a member of one of the largest perhaps in characters though not people alliances in the n3 coalition its because i enjoy it i also reject the premise that n3 itself is stagnant i believe that borders are relatively stagnant and that this  stagnant content however politics will never change and groups have learned the vast benefits in securing their borders cheaply and diplomatically it is to our benefit one type of benefit that we minimize conflict zones however that doesnt encourage fighting eve has evolved from many battles to some wars to a few great wars and then to the supercapitalcold warif elected to csm then i serve the whole interests of eve which would be encouraging more destruction which fuels the universal economy but until then i serve the interests of my coalition alliance and corporationtldr things didnt used to be quite as stagnant and ive made friends here that i care about
thanks ccp should support the media in eve that covers ingame events and more its a cheap and effective way to get more individuals to try the game out
voting is open now get out and vote
literally the only person who i want to vote for 1
well in that case you represent the ants ill vote for you
the following is an excerpt of my endorsements for csmxthe rest of the articlelist is found here best of luck psianh
you do a very good job of not including any reason why i should vote for you in the your op why should i as a vote believe that there will be no conflict of interest considering you run an alliance everyone has bias towards the group they are part of how do we know you wont either try guide the csm to your alliance benefit or guide your alliance using knowledge from the csm

destructible stationsoutposts in nullsec  surestationsoutposts in wspace is a hard no and nonstarter the very thought of them defies the spirit of impermanence of wspace
yep i will there
sugar  just to confirm was the ts info sent out i would like to attend but havent received any details
ill be sending info out in a couple hours so dont panic
ill be there as well will be abit late because of work
should be fun would definitely like to attend 
mails sent with teamspeak details to everyone
it would be really great if we could have one of these in a tz that is a little more us friendly id really like to attend but im working at that time along with 99 of the rest of the people in the americas
if i can persuade some devs to come on later ill happily organise them
would love to come if not too late
i want a gamemode for valkyrie that entails spending twenty minutes triagerepping a structure while the enemy only shows up after we fully triage and have left the grid to drop it back down sarcasm
if its not too late id love to have a chat about it all 
mailed last couple of people
realise im cutting this a bit fine but id like to come if therere still slots free
sent and thats closed now
just saw the twitter message able to jump in
sorry i missed it folksi was going to be there i was just about to leave a user group i was at free beer and work called me with a frantic plea for me to come in and fix a deployment problem 3 hours later i get out
thank you for attending sorry about our troll but he was taken care of quicklyas soon as we get the recording we will make steve deal with it and put it on csm9orgtopics were as listed we discussed capture mechanics timers transfers pointed out that sov is not all that uses structures we went from outposts to pocos and is there a better way to defend and predict reinforcement timers and are they good do we want pos shields or just a safe area and a few more things we ran tight with the 07 show just behind but this is just a piece of the wholethank you again
i put up cyno jammers and have people in interdictors floating around screaming for the blood of innocent freighters i have just erased almost all additional stations that you could supply to in null that you cant get to now with the current jf distances bar those that are currently player ownedthose that are player owned are very unlikely to allow in insurgent force to dock in them to reship so they can line up in formation and take honorable turns shooting at each other congrats dozens of things that need to camped are now suddenly unnecessary to camphuzzah large entities benefit from additional jump ranges while small entities continue to rattle their sabres about how things are unfair and how taking gates is hard
it doesnt work that way youll have to take sov in all these systems and outposts you cant put jammers in other peoples space npc stations are even more tricky youll need heavy presence in all of them to babysit bumpers 237 or random locals will undock and kill them because they canits a game changer compared to current meta where there are bottlenecks of exactly one station to many regions
quoting for emphasis back when i was a newbie my corporation which was about 80 newbies would operate in groups and use liberal amounts of ecm and sensor dampeners to cover our asses usually while running missionswhen the enemy had a fleet up and bearing towards us we would run back to hq where we had all consolidated ourselves jump into ships we didnt mind dying in also equipped with liberal amounts of ewar and sit at the gate they would have to jump through to reach uspoint is everyone has access to the same tools and tactics it is up the individual and groups of players to use recognize that and use those tools and tactics to their advantage and that is more of a mentality thing than a game mechanics issueplayers who have the mentality that they cant win unless they are just as good or firmly established wont survive anywhere in the game regardless of how much time you give them and the reason for this is that no matter how good or established you are or become there is always someone out there better in every wayand players who have the mentality that they are entitled to be left alone because on principle they should not be forced to do anything they do not want to or because they are special or new are simply playing the wrong gameeverything is designed to conflict with everything else pvpers are forced to perform industry and pve in some capacity industrialists and pveers are forced to pvp in some capacity no one is entitled to be left alone no one is entitled to build things even abstractions like corporations and not expect to be pushed around by others and more importantly no one is entitled to success in this game
uh nope check the mechanic there isnt even a cooldown on itim not talking about your meta making friends bullshit im talking about game mechanicseve is a pvp game it says so in the faq for goodness sakesshooting people in a pvp game is not griefing by definition you can end them easily there are several ways to do so stop ignoring things that dont fit your narrative it just exposes you for a fool oh this ought to be rich wars are not able to be countered on a fundamental level false completely wars are limited in risk to the initiator after all they decide to continue it or not also false absolutely nothing prevents the defender from shooting back and thanks to the ally mechanic they can do so greatly in their own favor for free wars should need a component that gives the defending party a more impactful method of dealing with them false defenders have too many already it needs curtailed
i think youre missing my point though so let me write it down in a tldr fashion yes i believe that wardecs in core concept are a rightful and needed thing to prevent ultimate security from being reality yes i think that people need to be able to fight and bring their fleets upon the aggressors no i do not support more security in highsec no matter how many other corporations there are plenty of them were made from a specific viewpoint and that makes each and every one of them unique it makes no difference if you spent 1 day or 1 year on your corporation you work to build something up due to the current nature of war declarations there are some things that bother me all the power to initiate is in the aggressors hands when you want to pay you keep it active yet you get to close the wardec when you are losing without the opposing party having a say in that the current system highly incentivizes the harrassment and abuse of groups who are too small to field a fleet capable of dealing with your wardeclaration this abuse can be an issue for players to enjoy the game which in the end is more important for the health of this game yes even carebears matter theres no way to deal with the wardec other than trying to fight them on their terms i feel theres a component missing that allows a bit more control on the defending side in terms of how the war plays out influence over the process is too onesided and i believe we really need to look into that while preserving the integrity of war declarations i am all for a good pvp system with the ability to keep people on their toes 247 but i do not think that the power to engage should lie with one party so for examplewe could consider making it possible to allow defending parties to prolong a conflict even if the aggressor wishes to end it by paying a similar fee per week as the aggressor this would result in the ability to choose if you want to fight people as well as giving a little bit of a consideration for the aggressor before they wardec people right now if the aggressor loses their fights they let it slide and stop the wardec but why should they why cant the defending party choose to extend the war declaration just to mess with youedita griefer is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game using aspects of the game in unintended ways a griefer derives pleasure primarily or exclusively from the act of annoying other users and as such is a particular nuisance in online gaming communities since griefers often cannot be deterred by penalties related to ingame goals

you might want to edit your previous posts then because youve actually posted the complete opposite of these three things well duh thats how it works in a predator vs prey situation if you dont like that fortunately unlike nature you can just decide to stop being a prey animaloh and the defender can have a say in whether the aggressor closes the dec or not when theyre the ones paying for it all of your problems seem to stem from a pigheaded refusal to actually take the initiative how about you actually play the damn game ever thought of that no the core principles of this game matter more than people who are deliberately playing the game wrong unbelievableyou could and i know this is a shocker fight on your own terms stop acting like youre some kind of victim here you have access to each and every mechanic in the game that the aggressor does and more besides it doesnt people like you are literally giving it away
they are not though and thats the funny part in all this chat its your poor attitude to the game which is ultimately at fault hereeve is what it has always been i find it amazing that someone starts playing the game then complains about its rules later rather like complaining about how another player out manoeuvred you in chess then saying you want the game rules changed to favour you insteadthis sentence alone only goes to highlight your issue you take this way too personally instead of looking for ways to beat other players of the gamedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ive made a conscious decision to see major wardec groups that declare wars on other groups and actually fight different from the small groups that wardec as many people as they can yet run into a station the second opposition comes up you want to fight a wardec be a man and stand your ground when the defenders do bring a fleet to fight youits these risk averse groups wardeccing people but hiding when they are seeing any form of opposition that make the whole system feel weird its these people who simply do it to annoy others that get people riled up against it is it a legal and acceptable method oh yes but does that mean i have to find it a respectable activity no not at all as for you kaarous aldurald i like how you blissfully ignore suggestions that could be discussed while sticking to the points you want to pick apart simply based on a different perspective i gave a solution in my last post that might be an interesting dynamic to not only give defenders means to act back but also to make a war declaration more meaningful since you ignored it i will quote it for you again just so that you dont need to search i am definitely not the perfect player i do not live in highsec at all but i do feel that its not a good thing to force people to either fight which is good or disband the corplogoff for a week that will only force people into larger and established groups leading to stagnation in the long run look at 00 and how four large groups dominate the scene with any resistance squashed before anything can happenalsoif we do not question mechanics occasionally to discuss it and keep the way open for progress you will stagnate we will not get a perfect system and no one is 100 safe awesome but in the end we are well within our right to question the systems in place and think of ways to improve it for all parties not just the one that has the powereditfrom an earlier commentthe underlines comments are my problems with the way wardecs work these days its not about people getting wardecced but about the way people go about it each time you bring this argument up the wardec players begin to scream and yell how eve should be a sandbox yes it should be but eve isnt about you being a special snowflake if you fight when you wardec against defending fleets props to you and i have nothing against you if you dock up when the defenders show up youve lost my respect and will be marked a hypocrit
wardec them back jesus christ do i have to spell out everything for you you already have what you think youre asking for you just cant see through your bullshit narrative to figure it outliterally every single post you have made in this thread is based in total ignorance of the reality of the war mechanic
he doesnt even have to wardec the aggressor he just has to make the war mutual this cancels out any war fees and locks both sides into the war until one or the other surrendersyeah the defender has lots of options at hisher disposal the trick is actually using them and not being so stuck in personal principles or ethics which shouldnt have been brought into the game in the first place because its a game and games dont care about you feel about a mechanic it simply is and you either use it or you dont
mutual can work with that yes his statement was after the aggressing corp had dropped the war however but yeah people need to quit handcuffing themselves then insisting that other people be handcuffed along with them to be fair
id love to have a cargo scanner spoofer  add nonexistent 20 plex to cargo scanner results in addition to the 1 trit in my cargo
thank you for your support i have not received a lot of positive feedback and most of my friends have quit during the time that i was forced to take a breaki have been feeling very negative toward eve lately feeling that all the good ones have gone and it is only the ones that want the game dumbed down more and kills made easier who are leftplease as ever tell others to vote i am relying on word of mouth even if they vote for others more votes means more of the majority will be represented
well i have voted for you well you looked very sexly i sort of voted for all the girls but i think you the was the best looking
i imagine these campaigns can get nasty sometimes just like rl politicsi am here if you ever needed to talk
thanks dont look at my av in 3d view thank you this has contributed but it is more general and game wide
the unfortunate fact is that it was not necessary to troll your thread you were asked legitimate questions and completely failed to answer them adequatelythe reasons i asked questions was honest curiosity after the namescratch incident i wanted to know if perhaps there was something legitimate you had to say about the game that people felt threatened by against my better judgement i put you to the scrutiny of critical thinking and i am sorry to say you were found wanting  and not just a little bit you were badly wantingto your credit you did make some effort to refine what you had to say initially but that rapidly petered out and i quickly found you a were unable to explain why the problems you wanted to solve were actually problems much less needed solving urgently b what other merits you might have  your sole answer was ill do what needs doing which is at best tautological and at worst an admission of total incompetence by virtue of not having the foggiest idea what might need doing and c eventually ceased responding altogether except for continued attempts to get people to quit trolling your threadif you run again next year i will ask similar questions only because of the faint hope i have that you might learn and improve  i am always pleasantly surprised when someone recognizes flaws in their position and behavior and revises them and it inspires me to know that this does happen occasionally i am not optimistic in your case however because a its a rarity that people can critically examine themselves and b you seem to have startling misconceptions about the process you are engaging in that you would need to address before you could remedy your platformfirst elections necessarily involve the candidate getting subjected to attacks and criticism  trolling and part of the test of a candidate is how they respond to this asking people politely to please stop your tactic is somewhat better than taking the bait and ranting at them while frothing at the mouth but it creates the appearance that you are afraid of their questions and are trying to dodge them  because the best troll will add a healthy dose of legitimate question to their trolling they are just as capable of being polite as you are and they mostly were the ultimate effect was that you came across like erotica 1 trying to pretend to be polite and professional while scamming the  out of someone disregarding the legitimacy or lack thereof of hisher behavior the fact is that this tactic might work when trying to troll someone else but it doesnt work very well when you are trying to get someone else to vote for you you do not have the leverage on these people that erotica 1 did in the bonus room and i daresay it is unwise to come across that way to people you want to vote for you in other words your veneer of politeness came across as insincere and a smoke screen for an inability to address inherent flaws in your ideassecond the ideas themselves the csm is an advisory council in a video game and one where underhanded behavior is expected if not entirely the point of playing the problems you cited would be a serious issue in a real election they are not in this one in fact they might not be problems at all and trying to fix them could actually irreversibly damage player interest in the processexcessive control by nullsec blocks and for that matter the influence of carebears and other boogeymen is really not a problem  while some csm members may be drama queens foolish silly unresponsive or lacking in perspective for the most part being evenhanded articulate and intelligent is necessary to get elected and ultimately the csm does not want to give advice nor does ccp want to take it if it destroys the entertainment medium we all enjoy trying to push a video game ideology at the expense of the games continued commerical success is simply never going to be a viable path and so therefore running against that is tilting at windmillsfurthermore some of the problems like buying accounts to stuff the ballot box are so impractical on the face of it that trying to fix them seriously calls into question your grip on practicality the csm again has no actual power votebuying of the quantity needed to significantly influence the election would never be economically practical you are unlikely to convince people to vote for you to put a stop to behavior that is unlikely to occur in the first place the same thing with term limits  while there are occasional people with more than 2 terms the lack of pay time invested and effort of being a csm mean the vast majority of people have had enough after 1 or 2 termsin summary your problems amount to that you treat this election like its a real election in areas where its inappropriate to do so concern over corruption that isnt actually a problem in this context and dont treat it like one where you should you try to shut people up when people never respond to that well in a candidate people remain people regardless of the context you seem to basically have the entire thing 180 degrees out of linethis went on rather longer than i intended but again everything is quite sincere i dont really expect you to seriously consider this but if you do and give your candidacy an overhaul you might actually convince people to vote for you if only because you will have demonstrated openmindedness and willingness to learn from mistakes
i communicate very effectivelysaid the person who hasnt made it clear to a single person what they want to change and when asked refuses to give a clear answer
this isnt that difficult if you are not trolling and actually want to know the answers to the questions these upstanding forum posters have been posting than read the first post of the threadas a tactic constantly asking the same already answered questions is ineffectual you just come off as desperate when doing it
those answers only created more questions which you didnt address in a satisfactory manneras for being desperate youre the one competing for votes with howevermany other people why would anyone be desperate in talking to you your candidacy has never been in a particularly strong position
i hope you like crow
mm yellow
stop being a yeela belly chicken 
i think youre misunderstanding you are the candidate you need the votes it might make sense to say another candidate is desperate if you are in a strong position relative to them but it does not make sense to say this to people that are not running what would any of us have to be desperate about as for the other candidates there are enough that are in a strong position relative to you that ypur chances seem weak its possible youll win but it seems unlikely i dont know why crow would have anything to do with a simple assessment of probabilityif you think youre in a strong position about where do you expect to finish do you expect to beat manfred sideous for example sugar kyle
forgive me for asking but what is your educationalwork backgroundyou seem to approach the subject from a professional point or at minimum wellinformed layman with a good sense for analysis which is refreshingmyself i study political science and have a broad background in volunteering for organising or managing election campaignsof course discussing xenurias campaign is mostly just fun and giggles for me but the csm campaign in general is interesting partly because i get to watch candidates interact with and react to voters and issues with nothing on the line myself
ya know originally poking fun at xenuria was amusing as all hell but the mroe i thought about it i have tried offering legitimate advice along with several others about how xen could improve his communication and public standing within the game to actually stand a chance of winning for realsand we were called trollsits like he insult the people who only offer good advice so obviously even he doesnt care about winning anymoreits just kinda sad
you have my mining lasererm  i mean vote
voted for vaari glory to amarr
lord vaari may your quest to watch over the holy scriptures be blessed in the eyes of the empress jamyl i and her childrenin which i pledge my support
i support this product andor servicethe csm needs the exalted leadership of lord vaari in these testing times
after the 10k wars we have had the last 23 years i never expected so much support for my csm campaign good to see many players can see the difference between an eve role playing evil war lord and a motivated csm candidate who wants best for evethanks for all support so far 
rather than remove them outright what if the faction police corporations were playerdriven corporations similar to faction warfare the only thing responding to low sec status players entering high sec space would be high sec status players remove the faction police ai completely if the new player police force guard the gates well they are safe if they dont chaos ensues high sec would have to become its own police forceas an incentive give the faction police a rewards system similar to faction warfare unique items only purchased through their loyalty points store the federation navy comet its got the police lights already
sounds fun if this would be implemented its something i would join with my own alliance
not to  up your campaign thread with talk about hyperboxing but i just want to make clear that the only person on the open comms show espousing the straw man arguments that the advantages derived from plex conversion to isk having multiple accounts or the use of third party websites for information purposes are equivalent to the use of a third party software to enhance the speed at which you can create inputs into the game was a guest shadowandlight he was a guest because we were discussing the email he sent to all csm candidates which conflated all forms of multiboxing with his steroidenhanced form of multiboxing and falsely made the case that ccp may be trying to get rid of multiple accounts altogether so just so were clear that was not the voice of the show just a voice on the show the voice of the show is proeula and proequal and clear enforcement of the eula actions contrary to the word and spirit of the eula are in fact cheating
100 true to bad we cant discuss the eula here
so should users of elinor be banned too that automatically pulls data from exports and pops trade prices into your clipboard for you thus speeding up your inputs considerably you want the eula to be enforced fairly so why does third party software only count as speeding up gameplay when it affects clicking on multiple buttons at the same time most traders would grind to a halt if you took away even half of their third party tools so how is that not speeding up their inputs practically everything the igb does is designed to allow you to speed up input
apologies i really dont want to derail toras campaign thread i just wanted to be clear that it wasnt the view of the open comms show that any of these comparisons and word parsing of the term unfair advantage were from members of the show they were the views of a player who equates any and all thirdparty softwares and applications to one another as equals that somehow if they confer any real or perceived advantage then they are equal and thus all should be allowed or none should as for my views on elinor what you seem to be describing is a third party software that goes only so far as to populate your operating systems clipboard the user must then paste that data into the actual game client on their own something tells me that doesnt violate ccps eula however if it elinor copied the data into memory and somehow pasted it into the client on its own accord that is where it would probably become and issue but even then ccp could decide its doesnt reach a level of significance to warrant action the debate over isboxer is not whether any and all advantages can or should be eliminated from having an effect on the game although certain people would like to make that the argument because it creates such a morass as to confuse the entire issue in an attempt at delegitimizing it altogether ccp is well within their rights to say this does and that doesnt although i would prefer to understand their basis for that decision based on what you described id guess that elinor is fine whereas input broadcasting is obviously not and isboxers vfx dashboard with a pixelbypixel recreation of elements of the client that then feeds directly into the client is probably so questionable as to risk their accountsps  thatll be my last comment here but id be happy to discuss it elsewhere again this is his campaign thread
i dont mind guys the more discussion the better view we have on the matter
you need a gang to game this mechanic six corpies should do it use eve meetup make sure that bam is hosting in turn hang away from the group dictating range is key to split bam from the blob hell escort you to the bar and then you buy him a drink this is vital then hand off to another corpie and repeat result bam off his facevote bam 
youve just made me realise that ive fallen victim to this tactic several times now i know what to watch out for peve down under  a community for players in the autz
i can confirm he will bend an ear to whatever you have to saypoked him in regards to what is actually a niche problem as in fighter assist mechanicsmeta 
2 accounts from me like the last timeeven if i wanted to vote for some other candidate this time the vote matching tool again presented corbexx as the highest match best of luck in the elections
1 for boratworking with him at chao3 i can attest that he is a hard worker and very passionate about the game he would be a great independent csm representative
you get one of my votes againi am not a hisec resident but i like what you are doing hope you continue doing it
vote match says 40 still voting we need level headed informed active and helpful folks who arent part of the 00 lol blocks
here it is i know you were waiting
im going to vote for you also im happy to offer free training to you on the spell check features of your browser and modern word processors
hi sugar im glad to see you running for reelection  few people have worked harder in the role than you haveyou skipped a couple of questions on vote match both of which were of interest to me so id really like to hear your viewsthe two subjects were whether eves mechanics should be changed to strongly encourage the breakup of 00 powerblocks and whether off grid links should be removed from the gameif its possible for you to update your vote match answers itd obviously be a big help to people like me whore using the tool to sort through the 75 candidates
hey there it seems that three of my questions did not save thank you for the catch i did votematch over a few days iUFFFDve filled them ini do not want mechanics aimed at breaking up 00 power blocks i want mechanics aimed at allowing different groups of different sizes with different reasons the ability to gain sov right now we have a minimum mass that you have to reach and that minimum is very very large i want more dynamic mechanics where dedicated and intelligent people can do something with themselves the reason i separate that from mechanics aimed at breaking up power blocks is because i think building better general game mechanics is the answer not game mechanics with an aim to fix a singular problemoff grid boosting this topic has been around for the three years that i have been playing iUFFFDve reached the point where i donUFFFDt want off grid or on grid boosts i want a rework of the system i do not know what that looks like at this time but after sitting and talking with people watching fights reading battle reports looking at ships with and without boosts i donUFFFDt think this is an on grid or off grid topic anymore i donUFFFDt like what off grid boosts do to people and do to fights yes you can hunt down link alts yes they have been moved from pos but they still hug gates and stations or sit out deep in dead space but they also let people take fights they wouldnt take as well and push their limits then we have people who dont use boosters and are successfulon the flip side if we move them into being on grid we give people another reason to increase their fleet size and then we give that naturally larger fleet an automatic force multiplier because they are on grid the smaller fleetsolo has less of a chance of having the booster with them they lose their options when it comes to fleet comps or they simply lose having boosts altogether i donUFFFDt want to encourage groups to have another reason to grow in size and then add an extra cookie to them for it
3copypasteyou  gorski  have 2 my votes and many 3 use them smart regardlee
thanks for the support and the votes
thats like calling an white australian cop racist coz a white american cop beat up a black guy just because they look the same wear the same clothes and do the same job doesnt mean theyre the same everyone has an individual personality maybe you should give them a chance or maybe just keep calling people out as racists because thats a lot of easier than providing legitimate reasons to dislike them bobmon for csm
do you have a link im curious to see how bad this iseither way not voting for bobman or anyone else dragging their blocs agenda around trying to get on the csm i want to actual healthy change
remember the csm is a representative body there to represent the player base provide feedback regarding upcoming patches and to be a sounding boardsanity check for developers though i have stated specific things i would like to see it was more in response to questions and to provide a flavor as to my thoughts on the game and ilustrate my experiencehowever i would like to stress that i am running on both my ingame experience and my real life change management and training management experience reading through prior year in reviews the csm can be a thorn in the side to ignore or a useful partner to developers in terms of better understanding the game from a different perspective i believe my background will provide insight and benefit to those developing the game we love and it is my ability to bring unbiased assessment and change impact feedback on both gameplay and player quality of lifea vote for me is a vote for focused meaningful quality change where quality of life and actual fun are the primary drivers to motivation and action
that post alone is worth second on my ballot even our shared contempt from the jump changes pales to this
you came out on top in my eve vote match so you have my support and ironically even though you are part of a large coalition your loyalty base is rather small in comparison to othershope you manage to gain a place at the table in what otherwise is a high school popularity contest of people sanctioned by their large cliques

your support is very appreciated and i will not let you down nothing makes me happier then to have support of our members i am going to work very hard and be extremely active i want everyone to be able to use me as their voice i want to know new concerns and create new places to hear these ideas and concerns
your blog pretty much sums it up got my votes vote gorski

hi ryanive been told you are supportive of multiboxingcould you respond either privately or publicly your choice to these questions
yes i do support multiboxinghowever the broken part of multiboxing is overuse of combatif you want a mining fleet you should be able to jetcan assist drones dockundock without worrying about a banbut doing bombing runs or any other pvp or breaking the economy running incursions should be not allowed when using is boxer everything else i think is fine
ryandont you realize that using multiboxing for a mining fleet is breaking the economy as much if not more than running incursions what is the difference between using multiboxing to run incursions and using multiboxing to run mining fleets alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
the difference is that the mining fleet will still be able to mine with or without broadcasting just makes it easier to be able to jetcan and move around with broadcastinghowever it is nearly impossible to run an incursion fleet without is boxer and the features it comes withalso the incursion boxers can bring in 1bhour or more whereas the miners can only bring in 14th that with the same plex responsibilitieslets not get hung up over one point though theres plenty more to eve
hello xandercan you please give me your opinionanswer on the following topics1 destructible clothing  pod gets popped your monocle jack boots and ccp certified panties get atomizedthis has been discussed in the forums and would make a decent isk sink and industry sideline for pi products2 smuggling the current state of it is to say lightly  what is the point of having contraband when its a lottery run by customs officials to haul it to other destinations do you think this will ever be on a small changes agenda3 bounty hunting a potentially huge and exciting activity for new players and bitter vets alike broken beyond repair is there any indication that ccp might address this in the near futurei understand that smaller improvements get the back burner before major issues like sov pos overhauls and nplayer experience but surly there is an argument to revisit poorly build or broken features number 1 and 2  sooner than laterare these anything you would consider bringing to the table if reelectedthank you for your timedan seaveyhoney never sleeps  john russell

you are referencing 200 man carrier blobs if sentry fire from these is too coordinated for a 200 man battleship gang its not the mechanics that are the problem its the pilots and target calling 200 maelstroms can alpha a 2 million ehp target 40 moros can volley a 2 million ehp target 30 naglfars can blap a 21 million ehp target and if you are suggesting that you dont have the pilots to field 40 dreads against 200 carriers you need your head examined 200 anything will destroy 40 or less of the same weight class cap vs cap cruiser vs cruiser etc also who fights a 200 carrier blob with just battleships one battleship does not equate one carrier in kspace fighting a 200 carrier blob bring 200 carriers as far as ospreys no with your plan a single nidhoggur will rep for half the amount a 4 large shield rep osprey 125 per level will with capital reps for half the range which means that a 10 million isk cruiser is more valuable for structures than the ships made to rep structures currently a nidhoggur without triage can output 2065 shield per second and remain stable an osprey can do just shy of 500 and needs a lot of sacrifices to be cap stable and fit 4 large reps gutting the non triaged reps will prevent any small groups from being able to rep their structures in a reasonable length of time did you scale down your concept at all did you think of the 20 man fleets the corporations with less than 50 playersthe problem is you are confusing scale with mechanics yes at 200 numbers carriers are extremely powerful and hard to beat you need to examine why this is with 200 pilots even the nidhoggur of the prior example can spider tank with the gutted reps 384 shields across 200 ships more than enough to make a difference that you will not appreciate
i am a capsuleer many are like me we all are eternal assets are replaceable and i will live on be the change you want to see snuff the flame that burns take action shroud it as reaction the only method an enemy has to crush your spirit is for you to fail in your own efforts to overcome a threat nobody in new eden is invincible and nothing is safe i get podded a lot and i miss the days where you lose sp from not upgrading your clone already that possibility was great for bringing a fight to more skill adapt players skill for skill you had the chance to even the score now because of the weak the game play has been diluted to the level that once someone has more skills than you they always will that to me is not a fixed game mechanic that is a broken and flawed system set in place to appease the spineless ive lost months of sp and never lost sight of the joy the future can hold stop diluting our game play i enjoy a challenge and i value these type of options even being on the receiving end of all the griefer dec crap i enjoy the fact that this is an integral part of the game it grants me the option to do something about it it takes whits drive determination and pure undiscriminating grit stop trying so hard to get rich do what you need to be wealthy the rewards will come poring in reap the benefits of the friendships that last those are the ones that matter when real battle begins the saying isnt dont fly it if you cant afford to lose it for no reasonmost importantly nothing ever goes exactly as planned if you look into my timeline everything has happened for a reason that reason is i allowed it to happen thus i have no regrets any thing that happens to any of us is for that same inherent reason that is eve online that is the sandbox factor it molds us into who we are on this game turn it into content and never ever give up just stop being a slave start being a capsuleer and nothing will be impossible these minute obstacles will become an advantage to gain leverage from as you learn to overcome
oh this is so getting linked in my signature perfectly stated
when you break down all the stats into effect mackinaws covetors and retrievers are really shocking paper bags
isnt any mining vessel a paper bag outside of hisecit is midday and i am feeling sleepy for some reason
skiffs have the right sort of tank done right that in many instance help can warp to you before you pop however there is a big fat price tag on thoseso your one and only real option when reds are around is procurers mine for an hour or two in that and it has paid for itselfthe thing i am saying is that a retriever has 30 of the procurers tank time to live with 96 of the yield so it is an utterly useless ship except for afk mining for the cargo hold where you do not care about your losses
hi i fell asleep earlier what a strange thingyield isnt everything besides being blown up travel time reduces your iskhr significantly rettys have a superior ore holdaround reds no amount of tank is going to help if you get scrammed as far as warping out of grid goes you should already be aligned an untanked alwaysaligned retty has been my goto ninja ice miner i pick systems with an empty local but i dont bother leaving if someone comes inadding more tank to the retty is like piling on lingerie in the arctic i honestly would prefer the ore hold stay as it is
only if you are soloi think the scaling on the ships are all wrong i would like to see tank go upprocurer  covetorskiff  hulkore hold go downprocurer at retriever levels  covetorskiff at mackinaw levels  hulkore hold go upbarge  exhumeralign time go downprocurer  covetorskiff  hulkbarge  exhumeracceleration to warp go downprocurer  covetorskiff  hulkbarge  exhumeryield go upprocurer  covetorskiff  hulkbarge  exhumerthis would make procurers cheap nimble ships that are reasonable mostly as they are nowwhile hulks would have a decent yield to be worth the risk large tanks but slow so they would need support anyone solo mining in one would be a fool and yes this if you havent seen it
had a hilarious mail of support from an old alliance matemy old alliance got spread pretty thin we keep jump dream to dream too fast i warned the leader at the time about this it become a flaming argument with most of them against me so i leftfast forward and the alliance has imploded almost exactly as predictedi got a message basically saying that he voted for me in the hopes that i attack the other csm members and it lands up on youtube might be too much of an inside joke 
this is exactly the way my old alliance used them on those occasions when wed mine in our wormhole easy for anyone to fly and so cheap that nobody cared if they popped we had a big stack of them packaged in the posthe cloud of small drones that even a small group of retrievers could muster was a decent disincentive too you might pop one barge before getting swarmed but if youre in a tincan cloaky ship good luck once they get to you and yeah sure there are counters but again we didnt care and nobody ever bothered to bring a hard counter because thats a lot of effort to take down a few disposable shipsin the year or so we were in the wh we might have lost two three but you also have to factor in that we hardly ever mined
ventures are cheaper
i wonder what his ideas are on being a joke candidate every time he runs
my educational background is in psychology not political science and im certainly not involved with politics or elections professionally however i do quite a bit of analysis in my work and a lot of it is driven by political realitiesid say im basically a layman as far as political science goes but as you say wellinformed and good at analysis in general what ive found is that many people go about problem solving essentially backwards  they come up with a solution that fits their ideas of what a good solution looks like and then try to fit it to the problem this is a perfect example he wants to get elected and so far cant so he invents a solution of combating corruption and then looks for a problem for it to solve you can see this because he shuts down when its pointed out that he has not identified an actual problemthe real problem xenuria seems to face is that xenuria isnt on the csm but he doesnt want to admit that probably even to himself however its pretty transparent because he doesnt know what to do once hes on it other than try to change the selection processi was completely serious about being curious to hear from him following the name scratching i felt it was not fair to continue to hold opinions based on other peoples accusations i think the community is mistaken he is not actually a troll he simply does not truly understand the nature of the csm
so what you are saying is he is incompetent and those a terrible csm candidate
yes however its not an incpetence that couldnt be fixed if he really wanted to unfortunately that would involve making some choices between adopting much more realstic ideas and thinking habits and maintaining his viewpoints and ideals i suspect that making those choices or even facing the necessity of them will be too hard its just much easier to dismiss people as trollsinability to make that sort of choice renders many people incompetent in many areas his incompetence is not unique and not a result  as far as i can tell of stupidity its a simple and very common overcommitment to excessively simplistic ideals lots of people do this because they dont want to be sellouts the other side of that is that idealists often render themselves ineffective irrelevant and therefore incompetent because reality is simply too complex or too far removed from their ideals to permit them to function
its sad that most people posting here have posted more than xenuria has especially with several people offering him help
is this an example of ironywhen the cfcpeople are so upright honest and helpful youd much prefer them to the anticfc candidatekiryen obannon i think you hit the head of the nail withpersonally i think the solution is some personal growth on his part but until then ill enjoy his csm campaigns
i think hearts would be aflutter for xenuria if he just caved and did a remake of this videogive the people what they want xenuriaf
a vote for xenuria is vote made in protest of the state of the game if this years campaign is not successful then a change of message gathering votes from those who simply want to punish ccp could be an effective platform going darkside

thank you i will take what i can get 
lucas wrote a nice blog about the above 
o hey tora i tossed my vote for you in the hat hope you can do good there dont let us down or ill sick my own fedo on you pdeletetheweak
i sincerely hope that the changes to skynet announced today in the o7 show indicate a design shift from ccp to bring assets participating to a combat ongridif this is indeed the case then the next target should be offgrid links
and you were instrumental in a dismal failure to organise creative content for players against incursions
if i had known how busy i would be irl at that time i would never have initiated that event real life can surprise you at any time
haha yeah thnx for the votes om big things and articles i try hard but on quick replies being dyslestic sucks and not caring also lol but thnx for offer and votes ofc i ll need every single vote as voting is high this year it seems 13 k in first 12 h according too ccp so vote wnd then tell your frends and spamm the system u in hehe

what about local name delay  show only number of pilots

we clamor for change in real life politicsbut we accept and mold our own universe in that very same abominationwe should reject all fluffy candidates lying about who they are to get what they wantok not lying but certainly not telling us about that offshore accountwe want this in real life and still quietly settle for the same song and dance here in our universei am pro everything that is legal today in new edensome aspects need tweaking for fairness and future economic and civilian growthi am not running for anythingbut i am the peoples champself appointedtell me your dirty secrets of past endeavors and exploitswe all truly do aspire to themthats why we playfor the damn anarchy and to escape the oppressive governments of the worldto be ourselves and sometimes other peopleif you hate something dont you do it tooreveal your true selveswith exception to current operations
you will note a distinct lack of miner and industrial kills on my killboardthen i have a post history i would be a fool to keep asking for a more even game if i was going to be upset by those changes being implemented
i read your page of teni dont have much experience with many eve endeavors but i read about all things eveand them poor newbie minerswe laugh proudly at killing them 4 day old ventures but an underline of guilt i feel is there as wellminers do need more protectionespecially with these suicidal game mechanics from 5 year players with billions of isk at their disposalthe game is old and must evolve with time1 jenshae
strangely enough people manage to do incursions with other playershow do you propose to bring about all those changes you list in your original post
you can downvote a candidate by filling the lower slots of your ballot up with folks who have no chance of winning you can think of it as a perot effect
more ore out put mex sucks in 00 have to ship it in to build anything
part of what keeps highsec much more profitable is how the range on raw materials has been set i can with time and some luck get most of what this character needs for his industry ocd without going under a 05 rating perhaps seeing that space in the 0604 as an amorphous midsec could change things just a tad for either end by placing more of those raw materials there it draws the highsec only toons into the grey zones while those that live more fulltime in low and null have a slightly better access to the possible profits to be made then it goes to the risk vs rewards on both ends of the security spectrum ratings how luckydefendedoffensive do i feel tonight huh punka second character of mine is the founder and ceo of a very small currently highsec based corp that combined with a little time with both a highsec and lowsec corp are my training grounds for learning for what at least doesnt work for me and a few others in a player run corp theres a few reasons i havent followed any promptings to pull jeven out of the npc corp number one with a bullet would be moving all of his crap again whugh that was pricy to blackfrog his hamster hoard before it would be a higher bill to move it now its one of those things i have a better idea what im looking for in a corp and im not too fond of signing on with any crew without having more than a vague idea what ill be facing in other players personalities the management style of leadership locations and overall goals from the shortmediumlong terms activity levels etcentitled to isolation to run a pve corp without risk got to give that one a big fat no vote that was one thing i didnt think existed when i joined the only thing i consider myself entitled to in eve is a client that gets more of the bugs fixed before the next miniexpansion is launched ccp did you read that line im paying to play so pleeeeze fixie more than you break and quit trying to make my skull esploode from all the updated shiny graphics unless you plan to pay for my prescription pain killers and new glasses if i want isolation while playing a game then its time to fire up the ps3 and spend more time on the save file for ffvii thats pretty play game isolated i play eve for some socialization along with spaceship build and break fun timesjeven
in the dont care if i lose it space i think rettys are good for ice and the ventures for gas
 but it has two lasers it must be better like those battle ships they are bigger and must be stronger hold on while i fill one with t1 modulespoint being counter intuitive designs and newbie traps
all of ours were fitted for the more profitable job of sucking gas
what how dare you not use a prospect did you miss my decree that these must be used for gas and worm holes
you got our votes jen right next to corbexx across all my accountsgood luck and thank you for raising your hand regardless of the result keeping limbs crossed for youedU00A0U00BCedU00BDU008C

hard to use a ship that doesnt exist yet besides we fit ours with surprise tackle because its fun to turn the tables on people but that means that a fair number of them blew up
i voted for him cuz trolz
csm campaign writeups should be carefully vetted against grossly incorrect statements about current game mechanicsyour understanding is not correct here you should be better aware of the rules that affect you
and of course this was already handled about two posts after the one you are quotingbut thank you for reading anyway
thanks  save the fedos 
borat guereen why do you refuse to take a public stance for or against the new order way in high sechere you are quoted as saying you wont take stance on high sec ganking but you did say you are your corp will donate money to fight against it kinda flip flopping are you for high sec ganks or against seems to be a good public topic that could sway a voter either way so i would like to know for sure
here is the message i sent to them the representant of the groip calling themselves heroes of high sec after they asked me to post on their siteas a candidate of csm x i will not take a public stance to a role playing approach of a problem i do applaud your efforts and will pass the words to eve talaminada the cofounder of chao3 to contribute to your cause and take a public stance on it on behalf of chao3i will be happy to discuss more about the game design and possible issues with high sec publicly on separate threads if you want to ask any question to hat effect please use my campaign thread at
this idea is totally half baked first anonymity isnt a problem its a core feature besides the changes that you have proposed would fail to do what you suggest they would do many many players use multiple accounts showing other players which characters exist on the same account wouldnt give everyone a clear view of the persons behind this new group at all unless of course you are proposing that we should know everybodys alts all of their accountsits a bad idea and i didnt vote for you
knowing everybody alts from all their accounts is exactly what i am proposing and doing it by a simple change of eulai am glad to see you post here as an anonymous alt too real recent one toolike me you illustrate pretty well the problem of current anonymity for all alts in new eden you could be anyone already well known in the communityunlike me though you defend anonymity where i publicly want ccp to remove it from the game the fact that you consider it a core feature to your play style is notable but anonimity of alts favors players with a lot of resources ingame orand outofgame in the long run and allows an impact on new eden that unlike most other activities does not fit into the risk versus reward modeli am campaigning so that each player is owned to their own standard of actions in games the current system allows to be dr jekyll and mr hide both at the same time which again favors more fortunate players over the more casual and less welltodo ones
i know it would be tough but if you use a browser such as firefox it will give you red squiggly lines that you can right click on and choose the correct spelling its really easy best of luck for the vote bring on all the apis
