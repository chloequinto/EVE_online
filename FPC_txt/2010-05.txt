ahhh the good old blaster thread how i love thee not reallyive been telling everyone for years how crap blasters are and how much they need a damage boost and now that someone else is saying the same thing lol everyone suddenly agrees anyhoowhat blasters dont need range buffs what they do need massive damage and tracking increasesright now the aclaser balance is just wonderful acs have damage choice and plenty of range lasers have great range and plenty of dps and quick change ammo scorch range is insanewhat blasters need is a nice 50 dps increase across the board a little more optimal for small and mediums and a 100200 tracking boost
i too love constructive criticism bellum while i love your support i do believe that such a boost would probably be game breaking although im pretty sure youre kidding  but still a boost is needed nonetheless
there isnt an argument to be constuctive about its just waaaaa but i was not joking that you should read the link
whatever mate if you say that the changes proposed are going to break racial balance or break blasters youre wrong blasters and railguns are already broken let me give you a good exampletheres an op scheduled and youre going pos bashing your fc asks for battleships that can hit at 50km which is pretty much short range really now youre a gallente pilot and you think alright ill be fine ill just use railguns for this so you arrive at the battlefield and realize all those armageddons apocs abaddons typhoons tempests and maelstroms are all using short range weapons probably coupled with t2 long range ammo and youre sitting there thinking great my contribution to this fleet is next to nothing since im using rails with short range ammo so i can only really hit at 2724 and im already playing in deep falloff so my accuracy is cut down by 50 i love being gallentegranted this example is a perfect illustration of how there is indeed racial flavour and how some guns are for each situation now if what ccp wants is that blasters are better for small gang warfare well great but then give more speed to gallente ships so they can reach targets faster just an example of a proposed change and if ccp does think that blasters are suited for less blobbage then boost railgunsagain ladies and gentlemen im all open for constructive arguments on these thoughts
first of all i support this there is some imbalance but not only in blastersi think there should be one whole expansion on balancing all the races all the weapons and all kinds of tankingi know this may sound like a bit much but its really necessary
apoc mega pulse ii scorch  584 dps  50kmmega 425 rail ii non faction antimatter 468 dps  50kmoh noes now it isnt as good as a geddon since that can field bouncers just as well as the mega can but the geddon isnt as close to cap stable as eitherthe reason that people like amarr ships for pos bashing is not that they do a lot of dpsafter all minnie pos are pretty popular its because they never have to reload and so once you get a cap stable pos basher you can go afk while you kill the thingyou clearly didnt read the link here is one that isnt in my sig so you dont miss itthere is nothing wrong with railguns its already been shown in the railgun thread that the rokh is the best fleet sniper in the game

468 dps at 50 km do you mean at 3630km unless you want to waste slots with some tes just to be on par with the other bss besides try fitting a 425mm megathron designed to shoot at 50 km that can also fit rrs it doesnt work you have to use 350mm which are even worseanother reason for choosing lasers over hybrid guns am i righti will read it when i have time thanksi strongly disagree with this the rokh is not the best fleet sniper its the best fleet tickler it doesnt shoot bullets it shoots bb pelletsin any case thank you for being more constructive this time
oh well then that cuts down significantly the dps of the apocwas an 8 gun version used if youre demanding rr fits i mean in that case run a dominix its a great rr shipthis is because you do not know what makes fleet snipers good
most snipers engage at a range of about 170180km theres no need for a ship that hits 220 and does minimal damage when you can get one that hits at 180km and has 2x the damage
xahara just ignore guomi he tries to attack every topic which tries to bring hybrids back to usefull lvlbtw guomis good fleet sniper cant run its guns more than 35mins from full cap that should show how good he is at balacingin short ignore him
rokh does 320 dps  190km so youre saying you have a 640 dps sniper  that rangesomehow i doubt itoh and dps is not everything seriously go to the other thread weve been over this many times
id would rather have this as an ability which cost a little amount of fuel cap resource or large amount of time because having to sacrifice an entire module slot for a mechanic which is purely designed to be out of battle recovery of your fighters unless triage mode is used does not make it worthwhile plus the idea of a carrier not having a maintenance deck for its primary weapons makes no sense rolewise

my top 3i would really want this to get incorporated it is an entire panel addition and i can see the panel helping out fcs a good deal it also solves my gripes with the autopilot uisell all optionfit ship option by a press of a button
good idea

this
ill keep it short ccp whats wrong with you yes i support the request this mission is unfair compared with the storyline missions from the other factions and as you could probably see 90 of us deny it because the risk is too big compared with the reward
support
lots of support from me had a similiar idea
bottom line is everyone that is opposed to this idea either has t2 bpos or has access to them thru corp alliance or friend they are spewing sheer propaganda at everyone in hopes they can keep their massive advantage over the newer player baseall other industrials crying for facts is plain stupid unless you failed grade school math its not that hard to figure out for all you simpletons out there i will even do it for youthe basicst2 bpo base waste factor is 10 base production lvl 10 vs base waste factor of an invented bpc 50 and production 50t2 bpos can be research just like t1s essentially they have less than 001 waste factor an production level modifierst2 invented bpcs using a decryptors which cost between 5 million for one that wont do much up to and well over 50 million for the best ones you could get 30 me and pe roughly maybe a couple extra runst2 bpos can be copied giving full max runs in the endt2 invented bpcs wo decryptores will yield a maximum of 10 the t2 max run number or less most of the time far lesst2 bpos owners dont have to waste time waiting for the invention process or the extra copying time it takes to get the t1 bpcs to run invention on again no time wasted with failed invention jobs and no loss of isk from wasted datacores and again t2 bpo owners dont have to waste slots to run the invention jobsusing a decryptor cost 10s of millions per job also in most cases it also lowers the chance of success and will never even come close to offering the me pe or amount of runs as a t2 bpo has let alone all three anywhere a t2 bpos lvl bottom linet2 deimos bpo with 01 me and pe would cost the owner 69 million to build these items are all bought from the market and at prices that are all higher than jita prices and thats it owner has a 10 run copy and it costs him less than 70 million to build it will sell for over 100 million on the market quick and super easy 30 million profitnow lets look at a newer player building the same ship inventing from a t1 bpo first and foremost there is also a tonne more skills the newer player will need just to attempt an invention on the t1s bpos bpcs secondly inventing a ship has less than a 25 chance of success with all relevant invention skills maxed first things first the invention process each attempt at invention will require 16 data cores 8 gallenean starship engineering ones and 8 mechanical engineering ones each attempt at invention will cost the new player 48 million isk and going by best case chances one in four should be a success let me tell you that is rarely the case 1 in 10 in my experience so total cost to get a single run t2 deimos bpc for this is a minimum of 195 million isk step two ship components are you ready this is where things get really bad on a stock t2 invented bpc there is a 50 waste factor so if that ship cost 70 million to build it will cost the newer player 100 million to build i subtracted 5 million since you will not need two thoraxes so 195 million pluse 100 million equals 120 millionnow i know some dumba is going to say well you could have used a decryptor and i am not inclined to go into all the different kinds of decryptors but again bottom line you will get no significant decrease in me and pe and with the sheer cost of the good decryptors 50 million for one and its consumed on the job you use it on will simple present a dead wash for any potential benefits it might grant for that one job and only if it worksthese are facts generated on an excel sheet with the market prices from this evening the t2 market is broken because of t2 bpos either ccp needs to nerf their abilities for instance make them have a 4 me lvl and reduce their max runs per copy or they need to be removed from game i will not respond to any flamers ragers or whiners dont even bother for all those who are new to eve and even just invention do not be swade by the liars there is a lot of purely psychopathic people in eve and they will tell lies about anything some time for their own gain come times because they find it fun they will eve n lie about things that can be easily researched and confirmedsigned total agree something needs to be done about t2 bpos either nerf or complete removal

repost of this threadoriginal thread is more than 120 days old so i cannot just bump it and get it to your attentionas the ceo of a small corp i find that one of the tasks i use the most time on is locking down and unlocking bpos to be able to lock down a new bpo i have to do the following1 attempt to start a research job or the like with the bpo with a char that has no research slots available so the job does not start this process includes several accept windows about 10 mouseclicks2 propose a lockdown vote3 vote4 waitas the majority stockholder i would like to have an extra rightclick option for bpos  only open for ceos fx called majority lockdown the effect of the option would be to make the bpo locked down in one simple move instead of the 10 or so mouseclicks i have to do now just to be able to propose the lockdown voteso in essence  if you support a one click majority lockdown rightclick option for ceos vote in support of this topicthank youamanda
ok i am obviously in favour  and i hate this 5 minute wait before i can support my own thread
yup
definitely would be nice
as a ceo this would be beneficial
the bpo lockdown is a really annoying process
ok so everyone knows that bombs are over powered there is no arguing that i propose the following changesbombs cause no damage if bomber is not on gridright now a bomber can simply align decloak bomb and warp off all within less than a second with no riskremove this i win button
wouldnt work as bombers kind of depend on the short exposure time for their survivaltweak the resists on bombs to limit the maximum possible within a certain period of time would solve the issue without ruining the value of the well drilled squadsit is only an iwin button if it is available to the rabble
a timesaver absolutely in favor
would kill for this
hope to see this soon  supporting for speedsomeone didnt read the whole thread
mr bellum you know this for a fact how im sorry to break it down for ya but when you create a thread you realize people are allowed to post their opinions in it you sound mad the only advice i can give you is you need to calm down and let people disagree with you mkay
cmon guys the system needs work and this is not going to helpas much as i could put a boatload of work into what i think a good change to local and scanning would be ccp tends to be deaf to these things not like they dont care lately i have dealt with a game company on drm matters no not that company and seeing what their schedules are like removes any assumption that cpp does not care eve is a legacy system and its hard to change things simple as thatthe way to look at local is from both directions and how that affects you depends on your goal from the gankees or potential gankee everybody is even the gankers point of view local is the tool that lets you know when a threat is in the system without it it is said you will get instaganked all the way back to the start station with a big red l tattooed on your clones ass so its said but what i have seen most of the time is when going in via a gate a half dozen pwnagegeared ships show up on that gate and sometimes another half on the other gate in 00 bubbles go up i have heard many a tale of 5 bs going after one cruiser or something like that but how do they know there is fresh meat local told themthis is why i have yet to use a gate in 00 how look at my sigso you see either someone is going into a system looking for some blood in game and will get some aid in finding it via local or someone in a system is waiting for blood and will be alerted to it by localremoving local will affect them both nobody gets an i win button the predator still needs to find the prey the prey still needs to look out of course belts cannot be mined or ratted in this case really if you have a team you can but this is not my opinion ccp set it up that way they cant stand lone wolves if putting a probe launcher on your mining ship for example to find hidden belts even if you pull in enough isk to pay for the ship twice over per day is too much of a hit then you have to learn adaptation putting some mods on the ship to make it harder to scan will gimp it but if its all about isk per hour then is it still a game or is this breadsnatcher online i can do a 00 radar site in a horribly gimped exploration fit and once managed to online a hack mod in the middle of combat and keep fighting because there were combat probes appearing in the dscan i managed to get the loot by the way do i pound mission after mission belt after belt and rat away until my standings are so high i could smartbomb a noob station and still not be red no i think people dont want to rely on anyone else because they feel its ccp arbitrarily forcing a game style on them they dont want to group up so therefore nobody should have to fit a ship for anything less than making maximum isk while alone but this simple does not work ccp does not want that to workand who am i to dare such opinions this is my main i never joined a corp i work alone and accept that ccp absolutely despises lone wolves but for me that only makes things more interesting so keep hating us ccp unless they come up with a mechanic that makes an unfleeted ship explode on undock this wont matter to people who log in to play not earn imaginary money bottom line is you cannot expect maximum input working alone in a game that is specifically designed against it i only have half a billion isk not counting all the phat loot i am too lazy to contract i like the game stillall that should be asked for is no matter what the outcome that some improvement to the way of detecting enemy scanning operations be made a little more automatic or easier there are already ways to make a scanner have to move probes in closer to get a warpable and thus be detected the ui for scanning is not very good and so everybody should just agree to have some agreement on that and leave the rest to ccp because they change little else
do some missions or exploration in lowsec then come back and say with a straight face that the directional scanner is exciting or thrilling
delayed local works in whs because of the difficulty of getting there the mass limits and the changing nature of the route inor out every 16 hoursnone of those constraints exist in 00 or lowsec so the only effect of delayed local would be to encourage more blobs and make the game less fun by demanding constant spamming of the dscan last i heard ccp nerfed the dscan because it was one of the causes of lagnot supported in this incarnation untilunless ccp implements some other type of intell toolno
this put a delay in local and the only other solution to gain up to date defensive intel for smaller alliances is sit somebody on a every gate in the system and watch it 237 now i dont know about you but that doesnt sound like a whole lot of fun or something very many people are willing to doadditionally over time you are going to get less targets due to rattersminers currently in 00 deciding that its to dangerous to pve there and going back to empirei do support putting a delay on local however there must be an reasonable alternative to gathering intel which currently is not in placenot supported
there seems to be an unsupported assumption running rampant in this threadthat we need instant complete intel of a systemyes we have it now yes were used to operating with it but i am not convinced that it is an absolute necessity its just that weve grown so used to our comfort blanket that we cant conceive of being without itmaybe we should just step back for a moment and think about what eve would be like without instant reliable systemwide intel you see a lot of people complaining that one system is much like another space is all the same etc etc what if the size and layout of a system really matteredwhat if different classes of ships had different scanner characteristics you could introduce variables like range accuracy sensitivity rescan frequency you could also modify these variables according to fit for instance an active cloak should have a very strong penalty to scanner use or perhaps even using the scanner would temporarily disable the cloak active eccm should make one hard to scan but it should also make your scanner less accurate a sensor booster would work in the opposite fashionwhat if using the scanner made you easier to scan what if this varied by sensor type eg using ladar scanners makes you show up more easily to ladar sensors but makes no difference to gravimetric sensorsif we think about the possibilities that dropping local as an omniintel tool would offer us i think that the inevitable conclusion would be that there would be a huge amount of actual gameplay potential added space would seem big again scouting would be more than keeping an alt at a safespot it would become a playerskill based profession and i think that wed get more and better fights to be honest these days 00losec pvp is mostly about evading fights until you can hotdrop the enemy with 3x their numbers it has become stale and its time for a shakeup engaging the enemy without perfect intel would be risky it would be exciting it would be funincidentally i think local in empire should remain more or less as it is
would be a shame to do this to lowsec tbh the fun would sortof diminish after engaging bait for 5 times only to get ganked by 15 cloaky ships what would be left is either people flying the now mandatory nanostuff and blobs with a good helping of now unspottable cloakers eve players tend to find simple and effective solutions blobbing and cloaking becomes more effectivefor instance i did preety much everything when it comes to lowsec piracy from solo which i like doing best to small gangs large gangs and gatecamps when i plug these changes in the picture you know the riskyness of a gatecamp changes very little since you will have covops scouts giving you exact intel on what jumped and so on from at least one system away two in case of eg bellum large gangs again are going to have little problems with intel gathering and theyll have less of a gtfoooo factor since you wont see local jump by 11ty billion as gangs get smaller they get more penalized since less scouts ara available its harder to deal with cloaking ships etceterafurthermore it preety much renders any activity which does not take place away from celestials preety suicidal in wspace where everything has to be probed down first this is ok you have a good chance of saving yourself by watching for probes and wspace has a number of other things which make the nolocal thing work out betteri have yet to find one idea to rework intel in eve which does not carry negative from my point of view consequences
i specifically mentioned strong penalties to scanning with cloaks fitted and really there is a limit to the number of gates that one can attentively watch on grid at once turn away for 10 seconds and you could miss someone going throughas for cheap losec ganks how is what you describe much different to what we have at present all that happens at the moment is engage bait  cyno goes up  haha i pwn u n00bs shall we ask ccp to extend local to include everyone within titanbridge rangeno set your own traps
grasping at straws now particularly with that bit where cloaking recons are just as acessible as a titan  cap fleet orlylook its preety simple rp and stuff aside how does your system change combat and what benefits over the current situation do you think are likely to come from that
i support no local in 00 and maybe even low sec people say that it will sucklag using the direction scan a lot well i basically use it all the time anyways cause local is rarely clear and everyone else should be too so really whats the differencealso how does it make it easier for ganks pirates wont even know your there until your on each others scans and then they have to find you this does however boost cloakers so easiest solution would be to cut the range of directional scanning while cloaked or even make it impossible
this
then it would just make metagaming even more important in 00 if there wasnt a game design mechanic for intel1 login spy join enemy fleet2 analyse fleet numbers and makeup3 relay it to your superiors and organize a counter blob4 5 profityet you also are forgetting some of the conseqences dropping local without a proper intel tool the powerblocs will remain as is even encouraging them to stay together so they can share intel channelsi dont deny the potential for goodfights would be increased its just that that potential would realistically never materialise
well all that is interesting to one degree or another but as it doesnt exist in game now it doesnt very much apply to what the op wants ie remove local in 00 and lowsecimho  that alone does nothing to make gameplay any better and again imho would just encourage more blobbingwhat malcanis suggests has some merit and would give additional tools to hunters and the hunted but until there are some kind of tools for gathering intell on a system other than jump in and pray i cant support this proposal as i believe it would bring more negatives than positives to the gameoh and to the op people dont deserve to fly in 00 and lowsec comment if they pay their subscription they pretty much deserve to fly wherever they hell they want
that is the entire issues pirates especially in 00 know exactly in which system the pveers are
how is this different to what happens now
1 do u know why ppl need that reliable instant intel system that shouldnt require ppl to be an alliance tool to access its the only defense that the target has with the mechanics heavily favoring the attackers and in numbers2 why would u only propose changes to scanning to compensate for this r u telling us that pvp is actually getting those fights rather than the fight itself that thats what it all boils down to to blob up catch your enemy and ez kill to pad your killboard guess what not everyone hides behind a blob like u do and thats why they shouldnt be forced to what ure really pushing forward is not more and better fightsits more ez ganks getting a fight isnt pvpits cat and mouse and your proposal will only encourage more of the evading fights that u  about not to mention u want to make all covert ops frigates useless for the sole purpose of this as well3 lets see what would it be like without local blobs blobs andmore blobs outblobbing small gangs in case u havent noticed ure forgetting most likely on purpose one factorthe players behavior your problem is for some stupid reason ure convinced with this sunshine and rainbows notion that the whole eve playerbase is perfect and honorable that they would gladly and honorably fight a duel or an even an evennumber gang skirmish that they would never in good conscience blob anything that they would not take even one loss from and run from every other situation this might come as a surprise for u butit doesnt work that way either wake up and get back to virtual reality or keep dreaming and idealizing all u likeit certainly aint gonna change the players except hinder pvp or even simply setting foot in low sec00 which goes against ccps stated goals
in terms of time and effort this is by far the most significant part of pvp
yup pvp starts way before the first target lock is established
i was going to post this but mal beat me to it lol
as things are now in eve i wont support this dont even think about getting me to support this as long there isnt a totally new type of local that works in a different way than the current local is workingremoving local today will create 90457860989068450984 more problems for just fixing some small things that really isnt a big problem in eve todayi can see the benefit of having local removed but like i said as things in eve are today i will say this with big letters not supported
lolskills go in your head not in your cargohold
this idea would bring some much needed balance to the pirating aspect of the game
if intigo and dianeces support then this obviously must be a solid idea
this reeks of a good idea
just because williams idea conflicts with your idea of how the game should be played doesnt mean it should be instantly dismissed as a troll personally i feel eve is too heavily stacked in favour of the unsavoury sorts pirates greifers etc and williams idea is the only fair way of rectifying this situation without introducing arbitray gameplay limitations eg wowesque pvp flagging making antisocial play hit pirates where it hurts their parents credit cards should make them think twice about engaging in such behavoirremoved comment unrelated to the game  adida
i think anyone that would harm another players hard earned assets deserves to pay behind in game i fully support this idea
lolbtw mad idea i mean this is kinda reality simulation in terms of punishment just you cant die so called piracy is a lifestyle well i dont know if im a pirate can anyone describe me pirates in evei mean im on nbsi  that means if its a hauler if its a battleship i dont care ill just try to kill it without makeing a suicide
fail proposal is fail
to all who are supporting this nonsense a few things must be remembered eve is neither a pvp game or a pve game it is both but what makes eve what it is is the fact that both need to be taken into consideration on the players part pvp can happen anywhere and it is not limited to blowing stuff up market pvp is just as important to industrialists and carebears as it is to dyed in the wool pvpersso with your idea i will be charged more money for participating in activities that are specifically designed to make the game function the way it does when i blow up a ship i will be charged more money when i modify a market order to make a sale i will be charged more moneyif you fly into lowsec and then rely on your jump cloak to keep you safe while you take a phone call or use the bathroom you deserve all you get dock up before you take the call or better yet dont go into lowsec if you are waiting for a call or even better yet do both at the same time its not that hard to talk on the phone and play eve at the same timethere are so many ridiculous holes in this idea i cant even stand to comment on it further
me calling his post a troll is the only way i can justify it being on the forum its simply too stupid of an idea to be otherwise and he cant possibly be that stupid rightsecond youre wrong on all counts if you want to play an mmo that has no pvp aspects and no personal cost when you make a mistake go play hello kitty online
ding ding we have a winner ladies and gentlemento the subject at hand from business perspective it would be suicide to charge a hugehe stated all pvp not just piracy segment of the eve population more money per month but yeah excellent troll otherwise it put a smile on my face
so the whole that my corp has staked as its territory cannot be defended against tourists who stip out the good ore and run the sights b4 we get the chance to harvest silly just plain silly
i havent read too far down probably this has been discussed but1 they should be able to use covert ops cloaks all the other classes can so should they2 they should have longer jump range than carriers if not infinate inc wh spacejump range  carrier  rorq  dread  jf  mom  titan  black op atm i thinkdoesnt make sense as they ship types get bigger then black ops is the size of battleship hmmm
1 no they should not be able to use the covop cloak unlike the covopsrecons they have quite a bit of ehp so the covop cloak would make it overpowered2 no wh space is not reachable via cynos in purpose
yes to slight expansion in jump range but not to the extent you propose disagree about a cov ops cloak on the black opps ship yes it has ehp but its ehp is nothing compared to that of other ships in its price range and even less than its tec 1 counterparts yes a black opps ship would be powerfull but consider the following 1 its expensive as all hell and a highly desired kill black oppsprimary 2 its skill intensive as hellblackopps over a year of training to get into and closer to 2 years for it to be flown well all a cov opps cloak would really do is let it warp while cloaked the ship is still weak compared to its tec 1 counterpart
bump i realize the courier contract thing works  but come on ccp this is bullliang

proposal increasing mission running difficulty with only a minor changeone way to increase difficulty of npc units in missions is to make npcs actually use their warp drive when they are in trouble when they reach structure that is when npcs lose their shields and armor that they should actually attempt to run and save themselves just as real players dohowever make it possible to warp scramble npcsi believe this will increase the difficulty in mission running as players either have to be fast enough to be in warp disrupt range andor have a friend assist in catching a npc example a friend flying an interceptor prosthis will have the added benefits of encouraging more team based mission running warp disruptor  scramblers use newer players exposed to understanding pvp dynamics and why a warp disruptor is important challenge and increased difficulty in mission runningcons  players complaining of not being able to use their solo  slow sniper dps mobiles to mission run with players complaining of having to run missions as a team players complaining of actually having to use an afterburner in mission running to catch npcsnotes there are thousands of times where in a npc fight player c warps away from npc a when they feel they are about to be blown up and they are not warp scrambled there are thousands of times where in a pvp fight player b warps away from player a when they feel they are about to be blown up and they are not warp scrambled there are almost zero times where a npc fight npc a warps away from player c when it was in danger of being blown up i do not believe this will require a huge amount of coding to implement nor will it require new items or new ai tech for npcs in order to improve the challengemaybe have this only kick in once players are doing level 3 and high missions as well as when fighting non mission npcsoh and said npc can warp back moments later perhaps with randomly fullhalf shieldarmorstructure
it is not a minor change even in that meaning of the definition you are adding several check to what the npc should do and substantially changing his capabilities it is the usual problem if you add those calculations player side someone will hack the client and cheat if you add them server side you add to the burden of the server if that kind of change has to be implemented you need to go all the way as yamamoto suggestednot really a pro even if eve is a mmorpg being forced to always play in a group is a bad idea the only result will be to push people playing in timezones with a limited number of players to leave as already pointed out it will push toward homogenized set up so 2 of 4 of your pro points are actually very doubtful ah last thing if this is implemented beltcomplexes rats should do the sameit will be trivial for 1 player doing 1 mission when you start having 20 players doing 20 missions or the rats in all the complexes in your upgrade system checking if they should warp or not and so on it will be less trivial then there is the problem of finding the fleeing rats if they are the main target a solution would be to require to scan for them but then we will add another request for the server for me the problem is that modifying the pve content one piece at a time will make a patchwork with little rime or reason if it should be done it should be a big overhaul rebalancing and redoing most of it especially if you are speaking of missions where changing only some of them will push the missioning people toward what is easier or make more profit leaving 34 of the content abandoned
in terms of server load this is trivial no opinion on whether this specifically is a good idea or not but im generally in favour of more things that make people actually have to be at their computer to run missions
that is not the main problem the main problem with this idea is severely limiting the amount of viable shipsfittings
yes please
ow gawd yes
fix it
one of the main reasons that i avoid the lp store as much as possible its damn annoyingsupported
i support that idea i would like to see eves gui becoming the best around
supported
i like
supported i have seen this problem when trying to move pos modules  suddenly the ship is moved 30km too
i dunno why nobody hadnt mentioned and suggested that before to be quick fix the activation timers for they to be shown when a module with the only last charge is manually activated its all ok with them when the last charge is used by automatic repeat but theyre not shown when you activate the module with one charge left yourself and when you deactivate module that state when you activate it again and its flashing red surprisingly the timer and flashing are shown normallyit is quite irritating not to know whether the module is doing its cycle or it has run out of charges dont remind me about lags the notification it is not written with big red letters in the screen center the most prominent example are medium capacitor boosters loaded with the 800th charges you activate it its icon looks like it is a unactive unloaded cap booster and then it eventually begins to reload and blink and it is double irritating when you put your charges into a medium cargo container from which they cant be automatically loaded into the cap booster and dont have enough spare cargo space to put there even one cap booster charge ready to be loaded and then you begin to guess when it is time to drag a charge from the container onto the module to reload it and of course failing in it trying and trying again when at last the cycle is over and you see your pretty cap booster happily blinking

the csm should question ccp as to why the alienfx feature was implemented ahead of other more pressing issuesthe alienfx feature will only benefit a tiny proportion of players whilst there are undoubtedly issues in the backlog that would take just as much effort to fix but would benefit far more if not all playersthis is the kind of thing the csm was created for more transparency and communication from ccp
ccp will probably recieve a royalty or commisions for alienfx they wont however get as much money for nerfing blasters as we all know they need to be nerfed
dell you know we got this kind of useless feature in our hardware cant you do something with it we pay you this much money for itccp sureon dev works on it for a day or two  and from the money they get for it they can pay more devs to work on other issues sounds like a good deal to me
orgo out for pizza i dont see them hiring a new guy even if dell paid them
the existing guys need payment too 
i see what you did there
honestly i dont care who pays for the airline ticket while i can pay my own way i hate flying at least a jet  prop jobs im fine with and it doesnt matter to me who is paying for hours on a bloody jet its going to sk either waybut it would be interesting to see who would sign up for csm though if the flight and booze were not covered
would invincibleinfallible concord still be a necessity i could get behind a bounty system that say globally flagged a criminal until their debt was paid maybe an npc bounty of oh 510 million players could add this to be collected upon ship destruction further crimes dig their hole deeper payout  is based on ship type killing a battleship pays more than a frigate etc insurance could be voided not for the initial highsec gank but for the duration of their wanted status this is an unfortunate measure really but i cant think of another way to make sure they dont simply have a friend kill unfitted battleships to purge their crimes other piratesindividuals with low security would be able to reduce their own bounty and raise their sec status by killing them thus a pvp form of security grinding is introduced of course as a tradeoff the suicide part of highsec piracy would need to be removed do you have an idea for how this can be done without making it a true killing field id hate to see gangs of 50 disposable tech1 frigate alts ganking everyone not on a gatestation with impunity and then being recycled even ignoring the above idea do you want less npc consequences and more player consequences or just more consequences in general
they can petition some gms and explain before the court why they killed some innocents and pay reparations to the victims otherwise they can rot in lowsec where murderous vermin belongsi think its time for some real consequence for criminal behaviour jailtime statloss no insurance whatever it takes to stomp out this antisocial behaviour they can do what they want in 00 but dont expect us to pay for their bull in empire space hi there againso how did petitioning to get your horriblefit navy domi go ayou didnt get it back because you were smacked under game mechanicsbbased on ship fitting you dont have a clue how to fitfly ships properly and hence have little game mechanic understandingcyour phoney exaggerated lolgamedesign experience is the rough equal to me drawing runequest modules 20 years ago on graph paper and calling myself a game designerdyou wish to change the game to fairiesonline i wonder why ccp has not hired you yetoh wa lookperhaps you are a decent person outside the game ingame you are a terrible choice for anything that puts you in any position to remotely effect change just go away and be a quiet little furry bear in empire and let the playas playa kindly editif you were to just stick to a pve boosting endeavor or something i would happily applaud your efforts its by sticking your nose in areas you are incompetent and unqualified to judge ieanything pvprelated and hurfblurfing random babble regarding same that makes you look a horrible advocate for change on a macroscale
google hotep shakkara this is the name of anks alt and guild wars character if you want to know more about this candidates feelings on pvp solo play and why she plays computer gamesi found it very interestingank you didnt asnswer mty question with regaurd to vandalism and defacement of other peoples property so i take it you still endorse this kind of behaviour
thats basically how i envisioned it yes could be implemented in an entirely freeform fashion where everyone can participate or when players have to mark themselves as vigilante which could be expanded on for example by the removal of the npc cargo scans for contraband but put that in the players hands as well if you carry contraband and the vigilante scans you hell get killrights on your shipyes killing a player with negative sec status while having a higher sec status yourself should award a sec status bonus i think this postitively influences the roe in lowsec as well as the current sec status hit for initiating combat against a known offender often makes no sense and currently causes many players to lose sec status from lowsec pvp even if they arent technically pirates but just are the ones that shot first seen a lot of this crap with factional warfare as wellthats a major problem yes you cant hold the players truly accountable for their actions because if the consequences would be too harsh people start recycling characters or use trial accounts with destroyersshort term more player consequence same npc consequencelong term even more player consequence less npc consequence
no it wasntwould you care to explain
as a former corp mate of ankh i must publically state that i do not believe she should be a part of the csm her attitudes towards eve are terrible and she has spent a great deal of time in game chat moaning about how puzzle pirates a game aimed at young children is in every way superior to eve apparently the most important thing in ankhs vision of eve will be the ability to change the colour of your trousers i urge anyone who cares in the slightest about the future development of eve gameplay to vote for any other candidate from what ive seen and my interactions there is no worse choice availableive just one thing to say to you ankh take your crayons and go play another game
and she wants that sort of power in eve i have no words
id rather vote my toaster onto the csm than ankh having had to endure a massive tirade on how eve is a worthless game that isnt a real sandbox apparently puzzle pirates is what eve should beand eve cannot be a sandbox until such time as we have tailors from her in corp chat i can think of no one i would trust less to help direct the future of this game
server was already dead for a while in 2007 as most players moved to wow to play with their friends that couldnt stand uos backwards graphics since i was still at the public server lists in the hope of attracting players random players would jump in for no other reason than cause trouble by harrassing and insulting people only a solid german community remained and i switched the ruleset to trammel because they had no interest in pvp and i was sick of dealing with random nutjobs that go from one pvp server to the next just to cause as much consternation as they could until they were banned i wasnt the only server that had a problem with these peopleeventually i handed all code and data to the germans and pulled my hands off it all they managed to get it to work but i dont think it survived for long
goodness another lie from you this time with the partial quotedid you post what was quoted that you snipped out that you decided you didnt want pvperswhat about the fact that eve isnt a real sandbox according to youwhat about your statement that you feel implementation of custom clothing should take priority over ship balance and lag issuesremember the wonderful crap youve spouted in corp chat there are logs a plenty floating about that show what a lie most of your campaign isso once more i say go play with your crayons and leave eve to the people who actually play it and care about it
after a looong background check on your view of how eve online should be changed i guarantee 1000 you wont receive my vote
i believe ankhs ideas provide many merits and qualitiesjkthis cant be serial
those bastards thinking that they had the right to pvp on a pvp server
for someone that goes on about the moral inferiority of most pvpers she does seem to have a rather casual way with the truthim sure some of her best friends are pvpers

im voting for teadaze  mynxeei think theyre both solid candidates with the desire willingness and skill to do whats required to get the job donegive em hell mynxee
sounds good you got my vote
needs a bump go issler 
thanks issler well answered mostly even if a bit vague in some points and you sort of fell for the bs statement the one i totally disagree with  guess which one it is but even though you didnt disagree to it outright at least you didnt agree to it either one may go too far in avoiding to alienate potential voters you know 
thanks for some good questions i tried to get some response up quickly and also to avoid terminal tldr which can limit answer sizes in some cases i dont really have an answer just an opinion in cases like that what i tend to like is to have a more involved discusssion with larger audiences i think as a csm you need to remember you are representing the eve community at large not just your own viewpointsif i had to guess which one you put in to test me id guess strength in numbers again thanks for an opportunity to let folks learn more about what i think i definitely hope other folk will offer some other questionsissler dainzeyour next csm representative
with respect i disagree if for no other reason than while you can hide intent from the game you cant hide your actions and you can infer intent from the action if fleets a b and c are all red to each other and a and b are both shooting at c but not each other you can infer whats really going on and yes before you object i know that this too can be gamed that isnt the point the point is that you can make inferences from behavior a real gamemechanic that implements this is going to be more subtlewhile there is an armsrace aspect to this i should know about armsraces i was on the front lines of the first copyprotection war and wrote the first antivirus program for the mac with careful thought it should be possible to introduce some gameplay changes that make the costs of being tricky and gaming the mechanic outweigh the benefits after a certain point and that has to be better than the current situation where the major trick is bring more guyslet us turn the discussion around for a moment for purposes of illustration which of the following represents your position and why1 lag cannot be fixed ever2 lag can be fixed without any significant gameplay changes if so why3 lag can be fixed by gameplay changes if so which ones do you think are interestingit should be clear by now im in category3 which are you
in principle 2 is clearly correct there is clearly some level of server performance that could handle any conceivable fleet fight without significant lag to go all reductio ad absurdum imagine if ccp invested in a reinforced node for every single node in the game in practice of course this would be fantastically expensive and it wont happen but in principle itd solve lag quite handily as for gameplay changes to solve lag i think youre aiming at the wrong objective youre trying to eliminate laggy fleets which is simply impossible to do with any sort of sane changes an arms race is appropriate for a virus scanner where the activity youre trying to stop is actually bad but you shouldnt seek to get into an arms race with your own customers what you should focus your gameplay changes towards is not killing lag which is a patently unrealistic goal aim for increasing the spectrum of nonlaggy activities for combat this is basically the longdiscussed small gang objective killing lag wont happen but giving people options for avoiding it can
how would you fix supercaps in lowsec
viper get banned from the foramz again
in my view supercarriers in lowsec are fine they are indeed hard to kill but no harder than killing them in nullsec in many cases it is easier to kill them in lowsec in fact i was checking out some numbers the other day and im fairly certain that since the supercarrier boost there have been more losses in lowsec than in 00 what i do think should be reconsidered is the use of titan doomsday weapons in lowsec i think this would result in more titans being used and more importantly more titans dyinga good question
what is your opinion on mods like shield flux coils and autotargetorsi havent decided if im voting for you yet but from all the candidates on this forum you appear to be the most knowledgeable and honourable
my vote has been bought and paid for by cat for catyay cat
once againwho is your main
uhm not that i want to sht up your thread specifically but you hit a pet peeve of mine thats the risk you take when you quote philosophy quotes i guessyoure grossly misunderstanding the core of nietzsches philosophy in your opening statement incidentally your representation is most commonly know as the nationalsocialist interpretation take that as you will godwin to keep it simple despite how that quote might sound to you its not an argument for socialdarwinism in any form quite the contrary most anyone who have taken a freshman course in philosophy or has take more than a glancing look at modern continental philosophy could tell you this forum wont let me use the n word the political n word the fascism n word not the racial slur n wordanyway with that out of the picture id just say that trading has been my main income along with some production stuff and if the way you do it is in any way risky in the sense that you might actually lose more than you invest youre doing it wrong its risky in the same way that level 4 missioning is if you make a stupid mistake it might cost you your 1bn isk pvepwnboat but in overall terms its not
you wrote this on the premise that i havent studied philosophy  his concept of overman is socialdarwinism in its finest if you dont agree with this then well probably your interpretation of his works differs somehow from mine if you want to discuss this further you can send me ingame mail because i dont think that this forum is right place for such discussions if you are not risking anything while trading you will have just a small income comparable somehow to level 13 missions but if you want to make big money you need to start evaluating market and speculating on the price and there comes the risk
i have revised my proposal to hopefully clarify my goals and to avoid any unintentional prebalancing it can be reviewed here or abovethank you comds for those kind wordsthank you tyrion for voicing your concerns to me i have taken what you have said to me about my campaign under advisementi personally dont see my goals as too far out of reach as a member of the csm it would be enough to have ccp and the other members of the csm to agree to any of my proposals and then see where it goes from there that is all you can ask of any of the hopefuls running one of my main goals which has been singled out is a long term one is to improve the pos system in eve the idea i have proposed could provide the a good system that is easy to use and provide the facilities players want from starbases as well as providing added game play opportunities by giving small gangs targets to go after it is probably one of the easiest to achieve out of the other proposals i have seen it could be based on existing code and relatively few models need to be created for it also the recent change giving players the ability to build starbases would not be lost as the structures could become starbase modulesi just want to represent the best interests of the player community of eve and i hope you all think that i am the person to do it please vote for me
thank you for the response i really appreciate your take on the transferable kill rights i like the idea of them being contracted outmostly i appreciate your thoughtful answer you are polling very well in the noobsretlokbroughttothegame voting bloc for what its worth
ive been lucky enough to fly with both of these people in my experience both are dedicated driven informed and balanced and smart enough to listen when that is whats requiredconfirming that votes for tea and mynxee will benefit all of eve
so heres a sample of my blog posts on the subject of eve game design so you can get an idea of my standing on a number of issuesthe folly of relying on side effects  why local chat as an intel source needs to be replaced with a proper game mechanicmy prizewinning blog banter entry on tyrannis including a section on how some small changes can add new pve and pvp opportunities to the gamethings ccp could do to help the mineral markets  prior to the official dev blog on the insurance changes this was a speculation on the kind of changes that would help stop mineral prices cratering and making everyone except the macros quit mining
tamber is the way

you get my vote
so tamber how many votes can you fit in those chubby cheeks
eve tribune interview that was conducted last week
nice website as alwaysdominion was supposed to attract more people to 00just like exodus obviously didnt what do you think can be done to get more people to move out of empire space
what are your views on the amount of communication  devblogs forum announcements new features pages etc  that ccp provides setting aside tutorials etc as you stated above that improving documentation could be one area to improve
ccp is working on the lag impact brought on by dominion they have been hosting test sessions on singularity though to gather data what theyre doing behind the scenes ii dont know csm5 will no doubt ask for an update during the first summit coming up in june only ccp knows the answers to these questions since they have the accurate data players can only speculate i believe that the impact of fighter bombers on pos modules needs to be looked at by ccp itll be something ill bring up along with other csm no doubt
id be willing to bring it up for a vote and see what ccp would be willing to do perhaps tabs could be created and a menu system added that is similar to how you setup an overview only show blueprint originals i would like to see special hotkeys for drone control become a reality along with an even better ui for using themid make the suggestion and try to gather numbers to show ccp that the players want more videos
thank you for the compliment ratnose better documentation of what life in 00 entails for one noone wants to go out in 00 without knowing how the mechanics of that area work because they may risk losing everything they own and im concerned about how the addition of treaties will impact 00 living sure itll bring people out but itll strengthen power blocks even more you wont have combat going on like it should in 00 but rather constellationsregions of people playing simeve
having played this game for over 5 years i have seen it change completely and not always for the best as the ceo of outbreak i represent a unique focus an independent focus free from alliance influence eve is slowly turning black and white and losing its variety but this does not represent the true nature of the game we love a vote for me isnt a vote for the carebear agenda it isnt a vote for the alliance agenda it is a vote for the third way a return to the true essence blowing st up and having fun the main focus of my term will be pushing forward the heart of this game the pvp element and making sure that fights happen more often and not lesssome of the issues i want to addressccp needs to write down the role of each shipship class in the game and what concept they want to do with it this needs to be reviewed every expansion to see whether the role is gimped or overpowered with the new features case in point dramieltempestblack opsintroduce a fast balancing cycle for ships once a month this is for smaller stat changes that do not need to be included in expansions changes to modules guns bonusesintroduce ways to make eve more regional again rebalance range of jump ships or cost per jump etcchange the current aggro timer to include mass of the ship aggressed ships cannot be stored inside a carrierecm nerfold cyno effect yay ovote for alpha vote for pewpew

good luck to you m8

i support any initiative to bring back the old cyno effect
aye
dependsall good points you have there quite the eve buzzword collection actually but do you have any substancevision for 00vision for lowsecdo you really have what it takes to cater to the needs of all eve or just a portion of it sell me your product
why vote institutewell from the time ive known institute hes been someone who i have known to be a capable pvper he has a solid understanding of game mechanics what works what could be better what to do to make things more funhe is exactly the type of person i think would make an outstanding addition to a team working hard to make eve better for all of uswhen the time comes i really do hope you all vote for institute i know i will be and i will be getting all my friends to do the sameall the best insti
got my voteinsty for csm
he is but he is also humble
the csm doesnt have the power to tell ccp what to do  and quite frankly it shouldntwhat csm does have is a privileged position  they are under nda and so know more about the games internals both technical and political than most of the players this gives them a unique perspectivewhat csm should be imho is a filter between the players and ccp looking at player requests and moulding the best ones into proposals that have a serious business case for implementation its clear from this and other threads that this is the way csm has been evolving but i think improvements can be madecsm cant make something happen  but it can make a persuasive argument as to why something should happen and that argument boils down to ccp if you do this you will make more money and here is why
let me tell you exactly what i think you can accomplish as a csm and the approach i took and will continue to take ccp has lots of folks focused full time on making eve better they already have strong opinions about where they want eve to go the csm can adjust those opinions and views with their interactions with ccp what the csm cant do is dictate what goes in eve so the csm can infuence but not dictate the ability to influence is a result of a lot of factors the csm members apparent understanding of eve as it has evolved how much the csm member gets it for example csm members that want to fundementally nerf pvp will never get taken seriously because ccp clearly made a game all about shooting strangers in the face in space the csm members ability to make a logical case for their suggestions the csm members understanding of the technical issues and realities of software engineering and game development when presenting their ideas for example it can be the funnest ever idea but if it cant be implemented in our life time it wont get consideredi also think the process to influence happens as much outside the meetings as inside the meetings so an effective csm needs to be opportunistic in finding opportunities to interaact with the ccp team during their termin summary i think the csm can be thought leaders but cannot be expected to be able to force anything into eve the ability to have credibility with ccp as a member of the csm can come from a lot of places affiliation with a large player block a history of showing some great insite into how eve works and can evolve a history of taking a mature and big picture approach with solid understadning of the realities of software engineering and game development these all contribute in ccp taking a particular csm member seriously and listening to their ideasso any csm that is running making a claim that theyll be the one that makes ccp fix the lag is confused about the limits of the csm and also confused thinking ccp isnt already trying to do that as much as possible also any csm that suggests radical changes in the factors that make eve such a successful sandbox for example trying to seriously increase the penalty for initiating nonconcensual pvp is going to get largely ignored by ccpwith the new inclusion of the csm in the agile methods in use at ccp having a csm member that has direct experience with the processes in place at ccp will be a bonus too ive been driving agile process based development teams for the last 8 years so i am one of the csm candidates this term that can claim direct experience with the processso look for csm candidates that you think will have cedibility with ccp and that understand that their roles are as thought leaders and not dictators in evolving eveissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
that was exactly my point as well to implement aa is a really good idea but ccp has rejected many technical suggestions of times pasthell its indeed little enough that its worth a try again worst that can happen is they say no again best that can happen is they pick it up
sorrythis isnt even on the front page of things im trying to fixvote against me if you wantbut most of the times im in fleet fights the red ships im against are so scrolled out that unless aa effects little xlike boxes  not an issue
eve has always been a great looking game and adding things to help it use the latest video cards to there fullest is something i would bring up for myself as well as too if its something we would have any control over that i dont know pi feel that eve still uses the cpu way too much i 4 box most of the time and the load of my video is next to nothing but it does push my overclocked dualcore kinda hard pinstitute
a major ui overhaul is in the works and i think the next csm will have to await what ccp has already cooked up before they can provide feedback but its always a good idea to gather suggestions you can expect every but of support and pushing from me in that direction
yes this is not top priority ofc and yes i also zoom out during fleet fights but fleet fights even though they are the more exciting part of the game only last about 15 of my gametime maybe less most of the time i will be ratting etc and there i would like my ship not to look jaggyish every major game released from 2006 has anti aliasing the fact that eve does not is stupid yeah it would take ccp some effort to implement it not any more effort then any other game company has put into there product cant see why cant ccp put in the same effort ea and crytec did into there gamesthanks to all the candidates that have responded nice to know your opinions on this matter
probably worded better than i could have im pretty much oppose almost everything that has been typed by her and shes fun to antagonize to bootbut i still have things to offer carebears considering voting for her ive always been opposed to a straight up highsec lvl 4 mission nerf because i think thats bad for the overall game when you alienate an entire group of people who generally do not organize together to give themselves a voice i also have some promissioning proposals of my own and have never voted against issues that are procarebearassuming they dont have other glaring flaws that would harm the overall game or could be abused afterall in order to look for targets to shoot its really hard to do it if there arent lots of happy carebears everywhereeven if you dont want to vote for me and you want to vote for a proempire player candidate id urge you not to vote for ankhsdfadsaf just pick someone else at least pick someone who knows how the game works
yup this is one of the things id like to see they could even warp out repair then come back in
nopebut as you may have read    this is about getting in people who in the future may become real pvp types they dont just grow on trees btwlet the noobs come in and begin to like the game then introduce them to the hardships of eve through lvl 3s and 4s and 5s and the potential gankers     and come to let them love the pvp aspects of the game     and then out to lowsec or nullsec they come seems a natural ascendancy to meand do the rest of the people commenting here not understand how to increase the number of players in this game that is what ccp and us care about after all noi want more pvpers long term lowsec or nullsec dont you
not sure im following you here are you in favor of reducing the risk of hostile unwanted pvp encounters and loot theft for beginning players or eliminating the possibility altogether please elaborate how youd like to protect the noobs as youre describing in your above posts
for the 1 day to 3 week noobs  yes     lets protect them somehow from the nasty 6 month to 3 year gankers what thrill do the gankers really get in this anyway against noobs wonkers really imoonce the newer guys get a sense of how things work     release them to the world of eve who knows maybe they get a taste for things and become pirates after being pirated or become real 00 fighters after being foughtwe need new blood in this game and new guys are just thatbut until they get a sense of how  where  when things are done    yeah im for keeping them interested in the game even if that means keeping them isolated as they run their level 1 and 2 missionsbelieve me  i love pvp lookie here or here   but there is a place and time for itthanks for the opportunity to clarify my position good sir
mazz posted a really nice suggestion about that in the ah last week  competitive missioning where you will not only be fighting npcs but also competing with other players over victory of the mission among other things something along those lines would be awesome imoi have run lvl 4s in highsec some time ago and i find that the iskhr numbers posted are generally a bit inflated as a lot of time is lost in between of shooting npcs by warping moving docked etc i agree however that the introduction of a steeper gradient in terms of potentialiskbysystemsecstatus would be desirable and can also be used as a mechanic in conjunction with planetary interaction to make lowsec more attractivewormhole space was a great step in this direction  and general npc ai has been on the backlog for a long time so it should receive some attention from ccp eventually if there is high demand however a proposal can of course be drafted and i would be glad to assist there
i dont agree that giving new players some sorta world of warcraft protective fuzzy coat of kindness is a good thing i do think that there is some serious work that needs done for the npe but one of the key fundamental aspects of the npe needs to be death and loss if players are not killing them then they have to encounter loss of their ships from npcs quickly first day and often this can be coupled with easy replacements for those losses but losses need occurred nonthelesswe want people in eve that understand that a ship is just a temporary replaceable tool and its loss is expected we dont want idiot wow players who sit around and play missions and put all their earned money into more expensive mods on their ship and when they ultimately loose it theyve lost all theyve worked for for sometimes years and rage quit by isolating new players from any meaningful loss or unwanted pvp initially your only setting up circumstances where players are more likely to think loss is bad this is not the way to learn evethis game needs less hand holding and more death in the npe so i firmly disagree with your proposed idea
while as a csm candidate i must disagree with you as in the candidates have to consider every possible game style  personally if you werent from an alliance red to mine     id love to have you as a recruiter for my corp
ive already been in your corp no thanks and personally i think youd be much better off not in your corp as would everyone else currently in it that goes for the whole alliance
from what i understand in the new advanced combat rookie career missions they send you to lowsec and tell you to going to lose your ship in fact if i remember correctly i think one mission is specifically to lose your ship or get podkilled or somethingso in a way player are introduced to this early which is niceanyway i agree with your post ive talked to people who play wow who are interested in scifi and seemed semiinterested in eve but they say i heard you lose everything when you die i tried to explain that you dont lose everything unless everything you own is inon your ship which you dont do but i wasnt sure i was getting through i agree that players need to be introduced to risk and the golden rule of eve dont undock with anything you cant afford to lose early on and if they cant hack it well eve isnt for everyone
locked at ops request
ever since i started playing the game in 2006 ive never liked the ui and the lack of control that i have over it what are some of your thoughts on how to over come this on a personal and corporation level also what do you think about a more public option that ccp can take as for keeping its users in the loop about what bugs are being fixed in what priority are they being handled and just an overall appropriate time frame for those issues to be fixed
wre an anarchosyndacalist commune we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer of the week by decisions of that officer must be ratified by a majority or in the case of a foreign affair a twothirds majorityif i called myself a king because some watery tart lobbed a scimitar at me theyd put me away
i see what you did there
honestly i dont care who pays for the airline ticket while i can pay my own way i hate flying at least a jet  prop jobs im fine with and it doesnt matter to me who is paying for hours on a bloody jet its going to sk either waybut it would be interesting to see who would sign up for csm though if the flight and booze were not covered
dear ccp incase u worried that u have forgot to implement something bumpieshemmops i know your wathing this section of the forumspss someone got more great ideas spam them here and give slow old grumpy ccp a hand
tired of being unable to hit targets for the first half of fightsthey need range give them that
like goum said the dps is not everything in fleets those who thinks dps is everything is basicly a noob when its about pvp and fleet fightspeoples today looks at eft and looks at how much dps each ships does and then goes omg the rokh  tempest sucks donkey balls because the dps on them sucks compared to other shipsbut im sorry to tell you this but ehp and speed and how agile your ship is is very important in fleet fights towhy do you think i choose a tempest over a maelstrom in those big fleet fights we have its because its way faster and quite alot more agile than the maelstrom yes my tempest is shield tanked so its not getting slow because of armor plates and thatthe maelstrom with the setup we use here only have 89k more ehp and 500600 more alpha than the tempest but those extra 89k ehp and 500600 more alpha is not worth it over how much faster and how much more agile the tempest is over the maelstromonce you get bubbled then you need to get out of those bubbles rather quickly if you want to survivethe tempest also do more dps than the maelstrom inside 84 km because the tempest with 6 guns with the skills at level 5 included is the same as 75 guns while the maelstrom have 8 guns but the reason the tempest do more dps inside 84 km is because it can fit 2x hmls toso ill say not supported
clearly guomingdong or wahtever lives in a fantasy world where you can maneouver and react realistically in fleet fights practically speaking what happens in a fleet fight is you bring the most dps you can because if youre primaried youre dead in 30 seconds and thats assuming you even load grid before you get poddedall the fleet fights ive ever participated in have had the bubble usually collapse before my client has registered its even there due to lag also lol for fitting hml in a fleet padditionalforum 5 minute posting delay sucks
to the first thing well i havent had any problems to load grid even in those big fleet fights we have yes it takes a little time to load the grid but once your in the grid and fighting then it can be good to have a fast and agile ship if you get bubbledand to the last thing what would you fit on a sniper fitted tempest instead then when you have exactly 62475 powergrid left if you take the 2x hmls away from my tempest would you fit a lrar  lst instead that would be used maybe 2 out of the 100 your in a fight instead of using the hmls that can be used like 50 out of 100 in a fight since you can hit smaller targets like dictors and frigs and those kind of ships
totally agree
who are you responding toalso in a fleet fight one of the participants is likely to be where he wants even if you cannot determine which one that will be you can still design fleets around the practice of being where you want to be better than your enemyif youre in a situation where ehp does not matter then dps does not matter and i find it funny that you claim that ehp doesnt matter in situations where you cant shoot backany time any ship on your side is getting targeted and shot or attacked with any weapon ehp matters sometimes ehp matters less than other things sometimes more survivability and effectiveness optimization depend mainly on the predicted call order your opponent will be using in situations where you know youre going to be called first youre better off with more survivability ditto dps if youre called last this assumes you opponent is rational and is calling in a manner that generally attempts to take as much effectiveness out of the fight as quickly as possiblebut within ship types there is no way to differentiate between any two pilots except meta knowledge for instance if you know some pilot always goes full gank or if you know your enemy likes to call alphabetically by name a first and because of this efficient fits within ship types are homogeneous unless there is metaknowledge involved any pilot in an apoc has the same chance as anyone else of getting called and so whatever method youre using to determine where on the ehpdps spectrum you design will always land in the same place for each shipover an entire fleet of ships this reduces down to maximizing the combination of survivability and effectiveness this is the only place where outgoing damage is maximized and each ship has the same fit with both dps and ehp as important as the other and when this is done for all long range snipersie 190km snipers the rokh is the clear winner efficient apoc is 312 dps w 98k ehp  190km rokh is 321 dps w 126k ehp  190kmsometimes it can be efficient for both parties to fit against metaknowledge and for the people using that calling heuristic to use it if for instance the losses derived from calling ships inefficiently and hitting supertanked a names is overcome by the ease of target calling this can still be a solution for both partiesedit for more information please see this section of this post
strange those ships dont have the option yet would it be overpowerd if a carrier is able to rep all its drones in one triage cycle 5 minute cycle cause lets face it you cant deploy drones in those 5 minutes and you do have super awesome repairing abilities dunno how it would get implemented in motherships maybe rightclick or wathever
this 1edit take it a little step further by having the ship orbit the direction your mouse is facing ex if your mouse is on the right side of the screen have the ship start orbiting in that direction once you pressed the orbit shortcut
gotta support this one i want to switch from cloacky bubble runner to full gank at a posccp has stated that it is impossible tough because if one subsystem is missing it isnt a complete ship and the game rejects it with a pod in it but watheveri wouldnt mind if you had to put your t3 into some kind of factory and then after a 30 minute cycle you can take it out and off you go in your now truly modular internet spaceship
i am now starting charity fund which will be used to purchase t2 bpos and then trash them please send your donations in support of this cause to russel trishthank you in advance for your support no seriously those who wish to see t2 bpos gone should put their money where their mouth is purchase the t2 bpo from its rightfull owner and then trash it this way the owners are fairly compensated since if it wasnt a fair offer the owner will not sell the t2 bpoi have nothing againts t2 bpo but hey if you send me your isk you can rest assured that when enough isk is accumlated you can scratch 1 t2 bpo from the game on video for all to see actually im serious nowor let someone else do this would be interesting i thinkstop whining about t2 bpos and do something about it lets buy them all and then trash the mofos
well if invention is so superior then scrapping the bpos wouldnt be such a big issue now would it rid eve of them
hi i am a pvperi have invention alts and i made enough money with invention to buy several t2 bpos but i dont want to because they are terriblethey cant scale like invention and it takes years to come out evenapparently you are unaware of how fast people were getting rid of them back in the lottery too much effort for the reward its not an isk printing machinet2 bpos are easy to acquire just have a look at the sell orders subforumif they are so awesome why dont you just buy a few of them is it because you are poor and want to prevent others from having things you cant afford or is it because they arent worth the moneythe answer is bothedit i forgot to mention that t2 bpos were a terrible idea and should never have been implemented but it is now too late to fix that same as learning skills invention made t2 production fair and t2 bpos are an investment like any other probably the worst thing to ever invest money in unless you get a huge bargain
very simple it is possible to repackage cans and ships through assets why not be able to stack all assets in a location station deliveries corp hangar with a right click option tooall in favour please vote
i am of course in favour
remote asset management has gotten better but theres still a few things id like this is one of them
wow finally something useful from lilan 1
erm wish i coud say the same

once a again no
removed trolling comments this is a place for everyone to share their ideas you may come across an idea that has been stated before andor dont like there is no need to troll each other if you dont support it a simple do not support will suffice
uh no bombs are in fact not overpowerednot supported
while i see where you want to go then there should still be a boundary on what kind of stupid ideas you want to share i mean do you honestly think this topic  idea is good when you see how emo tj have written it and what its all is about i really hope that you say its not a good idealike this emo tj guy he just say bawwwww bombers are overpowered just because he say so and only because he was spanked very hard by some bombers then he comes here to whine and cry about that bombers are overpowered while they are nothe doesnt even have a single reason that the bombers are overpowered see what i mean the only reason is that he got spanked by some bombers and dont like themand if you have seen his other topics in this forum section then i think that should give you a gooooooood idea that the only thing hes doing here is to cry  whine for a nerf only because it doesnt goes his waydo you see now why we want this guy out of this forum sectionnow i still dont support really really stupid ideas so not supported
supported because nightmarex is a moron
not supported because you havent bothered to present any reasons of why bombs are overpowered the everyone knows isnt an argument or a reason its an assumption obviously everyone doesnt know or theyd be flocking in this thread to support itso explain why you think theyre overpowered or let this thread like your other horrible ideas of late dienot supported
interesting i did not in fact know that bombs are overpowered and this thread has done nothing to convince me that they are if you find that youre being waylaid by flights of bombers dropping waves of bombs well good on them for practicing like thatof course not supportedliang
sorry but i have to lol very hard at youfirst of all your supporting the most stupid idea ever in eves history and then your calling me a moron hahahahaand secondly your supporting this because emo tj is an nc alt and you are in the nc to so your just want to support your bff player in ncnice going there pal i mean your starting to look good here i must say
um excuse me but have you ever flown a stealth bomber if you have then you know that if another ship simply breathes on it it will popthe stealth bomber also has the distinction of being the only ship that can be killed by its own weaponnot supported
bombs are the only viable method to counter close range rr blobs a smart blob can counter them with spreading out and making bombs less effective that said  bomberbombs have a viable counter no need to nerf themnot supported
while i am quite active in the assembly hall i have only once read the minutes for one of the csm meetings tbh i have no idea how often meetings happen and dont even really know where to look for the minutesi dont think i should even have to look i want to see a news item when i log into eve for every time minutes are releasedi also want more news items in general but dont really know how to make that happen
they go to iceland every six months and have online meetings with ccp every two the csm has their own meetings every week or two usually but those are their meetings with ccp as for the issue at hand yeah the communication sucks this seems like a nice addition to the process

there needs to be a happy medium between the hunted and the hunter taking away local skews things too much in favor of the hunterif removing local is the only change made then it allows the hunter to scan and probe when and as leasurely as he pleases while someone doing any pve activity will have to do it all the time he is out and making eve a game about spamming a button in order to not get ganked is just wrongand no having a bigger blob isnt the solution either this plan needs to be complete it cant be some halfworkedup plan that only favors the hunters and screws the hunted it needs to be balanced before we even consider voting on it
if you were to remove local then the game needs to provide a intel tool to replace it and unfortunately directional scan is not itmy thoughts on that matter is the core probe launcher would be the best tool for a replacement intel tooluse the core launcher to launch multiple probes within system that would detect any ship clokedvisble within its sphere radius that information is then relayed back to your scanner window to display player and ship class frigcruiserbcbscapital provide a limited active time same with standard probes so they have to be refreshed every 12 hoursthat opinion would be a good solution as it would give active pilots the tools to protect them selves and provide a bane to the macro rattersand as an added benefit would provide a limited tool for the detection of cloaked ships but not the ability of precisely locating themie cloaky ship not moving out of range of a 025 au probe is less of a threat that one popping between multiple probe locationsmy final thought would be to provide a rank 12 skill for this new probe system so you could limit the amount of probes in space and possibly use the other supporting probe skills to define the extent of information you receive backa quick supplement to this would be also allow the ship scanner 30 sec delay might need to be reduced to be able to do a ping to see if there is anything within your immediate vicinity as a counter to cloaked dictors etc as the major impact of a probe based intel system is a massive buff to the tactic of a cloaked dictor on gate
supportedwspace proved the concept
and u wonder why ppl evade so many fights making u have to roam 99 of your time its cause before it starts everyone knows the other side will stack so many odds fleet size against them honestly do u think ppl will just fly blind right into a bubble blob no they wont theyll just avoid 00 altogether leaving u with nothing to ez gank and if u actually thought they would then i grossly overestimated u cause heres a tip other players r not mindless rats with names
im a fan of delayed local since i believe that nothing about gathering intel should be easy not a fan of eve played in lazy mode intel is a vital resource and you should have to work to get it however i support bells proposal only with a caveat that something better replaces the current dscanner orb latis ideas earlier in this thread about adapting current probe mechanics are appealing perhaps with deep safes being nerfed deep space probes could be given an intel gathering capabilityeven though i adore my cov ops ships i like the idea of a probe that can report info about cloaky ships but only how many are within range of the probe not their type or location just a count any such probe should be shortrange and require a special skill to use forcing tradeoffs and difficult choices about what to train is something i favor
what you just said 
at first i thought this might not be a good idea but then last week i got caught in a queue for the bathroom and then got called by my boyfriend im gay in the meantime i was sitting using my 60 seconds of cloak time in lowsec and unfortunately i got back 1 second too late  rip my mining bantam that people should be allowed to grief like this is ridiculous in modern times something must be done
lol very funny 
he tries a bit too hard with cloak of invisibility
imho opinion low sec piracy is an essential element of keeping eve exciting fun frustrating and challenging as are mercenary corpsalliances etc however those who prey on noobs by can baiting flipping and suicide ganking in high sec are more of a sympton of a dangerous thing in mmorpg the boredom that comes from mediocrity
this is being featured in the next expansion you also received a newsletter explaining the changes piracy goes against the eula as it is direct greifingwhile your idea isnt fully implemented there is a lite version being made here
simple fix get rid of the ballchain ie gf  profit
this is absolutly not a trollthreadpunishing pirates in game is not enough i think they should pay more than 15 per month for evealso they should pay more taxes irl
this is possibly the worst idea ive ever heard since make pirates pay for game time in human test ticles
this is a terrible idea and would probably end up killing the game all the carebears crying about losing ships to accidently going into losec or losing them to suicide ganks in empire well those are all avoidable just by actually using your brain if you dont want to use your brain well thats your problem carebear tears are so funny when their so ill thought out
hi hello the eve font is aesthetically unspectacular it is common and features very little room for diversity and modification for example the noble tilde  comes across as a simple hyphen  to the untrained eye yes of course there is a workaround one can bold their text and increase the size to pronounce the subtle curves of this fine piece of punctuation and yet it is still lackingi promise my 4 votes to any csm who will take up this worthy cause 
1 dont agree with covops cloaks2 sure longer jump range would be nice3 t2 resistances4 longer targeting range
while we are at it lets just slap on a covert ops cloak to every ship we think is broken as a solution to fixing it right
thats dumbthey are terrible atm they need a considerable boost imo covert ops cloak and jump range bigger than a carrier covert ops cloak just means that it has a chance of getting out of a gate camp imagine uncloaking a arazu b4 it warps from a gate very possbile uncloaking a bs before it warps easy still would be very killable gangs would actually use the covert jump portal as ccp meant it
question is why use the normal gates for a ship that has a jump drivecloak  wait for covert cyno  jump to it
dont really support this they simply need a buff to ehp atleast as good as t1 ffs and jump range that alone is enough alternatively they could be made into uber recons but that involves dumping current ship bonuses and starting over save for the widow which already is an uberish recon
supporting the op
filthy amarrians for getting free t1 ammo and instachanging ammo faction and t2 ammo is very annoying if you want to use it but no support caaaaallllllllmmmmmmmm
yes because it makes perfect sense to deliberately make the game interface extremely frustrating to large portions of the player base this isnt exactly an issue of game balance  its an issue of game usabilityliang
ill support this when lasers arent so overpowered compared to blasters until then i just see it as the only disadvantage of lasers no matter how dumbyes i trained lasers up and use them constantly why doesnt everyone
yes
as we all know or most of us anyway a rorqual has become the mobile refinery for a pos that can warp around and create clones for us the original design was to create a capital industrial ship to assist in moving ore from nullseclowsec to highsec with ease and to give a booster for miners comparable to a command ship well now we have the orca replacing the need for the booster side of the rorqual to an extent however to those desperate enough they will still spend a few billion isk to get a mobile compression unit i ask what the point is of a rorqual anymore sure we can compress ore to move large amounts around with small ships but it just sits in a posproposalcreate a new pos array to compress unrefined ore at the cost of fuel and still require compression bpos itll still require the same variables as a rorqual but will save some isk and time to those who will more than likely just sit inside a pos with a rorqual anyway
buff the rorq by nerfing it lolso what should all the rorqual pilots do with the months of skills theyve trained once youre able to do it at a posno thanx
so you want the rorqual made completely and totally obsolete no thanks
i have 5 accounts with numerous toonsone of my accounts containing a 54mil sp toon recently got hacked and the person changed the password and reply email address which precluded me from either logging into the account or requesting a change of passwordi raised the first petition in this regard last sunday but have to date 7 days later not received a single acknowledgement from ccp on this i have also raised 2 other petitions to try an elicit a response from ccp and the only response was from gm sayyah to inform me that one of them was filed under the incorrect category was moved and will be attended to by another gma friend recently experienced a similar problem with a wow account but this was completely resolved within 48h of him reporting and he was reimbursed for all items lostthe delinquent logs in regularly but blocks all attempts to communicate with himthis lack of action on multiple reports of fraud and general indifference from ccp is shocking i had to cancel my credit card since it was still tied to the accountdoes anyone have any guidance to provide on possible next steps
i say do the following1 make it impossible without a petition to change certain information like name email etc and censor the information only ccp and the customer should know the email it is actually possible to change your name multiple times too  which is really odd imo haha2 security precautions on ip  mac address changes similar to how banks  wow works different ip  country  mac  monitored to locked account3 account profiling and monitoring back in wow days when i got hacked one of my chars logged in and spammed wts gold etc blizzard banned the account until they heard back from me d4 or for the sake of security make the key chains  authenticatorsanyway good luck with your account issues while i havent ever had to wait more than 2 days for a petition to be answered even in wow it is pretty shocking to wait 7 days 
this is the assembly hall its not for this kind of thing also discussing gm correspondance is badanyway hacking takes time for gms to research and follow up what makes you think that bombarding them with i need response naow is going to make them work faster if anything they should shove you to the back of the queue
would love to hear your comment if the shoe was on the other foot and it was your banking details on the open market or your hard earned ships  equipment being sold the intention of my initial post was to raise awareness and prevent this kind of aberrant behaviour from affecting other players enjoyment of the game i agree with the proposed stricter measures for changes to accountsi dont think it is outside the realm of reasonability to expect gm followup  research of reported issues to at least start with a basic confirmation of the reported information by contacting the person filing the petition this would serve to establish root cause and provide reassurance that the petition is receiving attention
first off i do this this is an issue suitable for the assembly hallat least two players in my corporation have been affected by hacking and lost massive amounts of ships and isk  billions worth ccps answer to this was that they wont refund or return any items sold i also feel fine about gm correpondance being posted here perhaps if ccp didnt have such a godawful ty attitude they wouldnt be so ashamed of having the truth about their secondrate support teams published in publici understand they want to create a dark and unforgiving universe  but it just seems to be theyre creating an arbitrary and malevolent one instead
the game masters will be able to address this as soon as possible you may want to consider updating your petition with all of the account details to expedite the process
i agree with the dark and unforgiving universe  that adds to the appeal of the game there should however be a clear division between game and real life some behaviour such as identity theft are punishable by law and i should think that ccp as a company can not be seen supporting thisa suggested process for dealing with this kind of petition may be1 freeze the affected account to avoid any further activity2 reply to initial petition and obtain additional information required to fully investigate the matter3 perform investigation but set clear timelines for resolution of the petition 72h should allow for weekend breaks4 resolve the issue and permanently block ip to avoid the same person from causing problems in the future5 forward information to authorities mastercard  visa etc for further followup
currently the isk from rat bounties comes from nowhere should it stay that way or should the bounties for rats be more dynamic in nature perhaps rat bounties could be generated by the isk flowing to npc corps from products like poss could we simply get rid of the bounties from npc ships and instead rely on tags to gain the isk when you sell them to npc corpswould another reward be able to take the place of bounties maybe the players should determine how much isk a rats bounty holds
i would be for this if you include mission rewardsbtw rat bounties are paid by concord not npc corps
yes and that is just fine you see there has to be somekind of an isk faucet in the game there cant only be isk sinks else wed run out of money if youre suggesting adding tags then im suggesting well get more powerful tractor beams and that nobody can steal your loot since generally that would be the only way to make reasonable amounts of money the amount of ninjalooters would certainly skyrocket in every level 34 missionhub
well i know the bounties are added by concorde who in itself is paid for by contributions by all the goverment entities within new eden also concorde in its own rights owns space called the concorde assembly which generates iskthen the govermental entities get their isk from tax from inhabitants of planets and us so no the isk doesnt come from no where
i have petition up and no reply
does ghostspider looks where he posts
was boat of gathering violenced reply in order of queue will be addressed waterfall
we will address the petitions in the order they are received in if you have additional information you are welcome to add it to the current petition also removed a forum breaking reply
cool it is good to hear you are for the basics of the proposed ideai do not agree it does not need to be segregated however i do agree that it can be segregated during is introduction in phases in order to make it easier to accept sort a like the way the new graphics where introduced in phases
this would not stop you from fitting your shipwith a friend joining you in mission running you can still have your load out just as you want
i enjoy the idea of this but have maybe a change to the proposal at large  instead of formulating this for all missions make the changes for level 5 missions only so they become what they should have been in the first place gang missions the fact that 5s just took 4s and added neut towers and placed it all down into lowsec was a dissapointment but they can still be fixed another idea would be to make 5s more cap friendly as well to simply simulate real battles you might face and even start some in the process
this sounds like a really cool idea would be cool to have someone tackle and web a really fast npc while a friend applies the dps and also having to chase them around the systemi support this but only if they make these types of missions come from separate agents it will add a little more variety but youll only do them whenever you feel like it
and this would be something would think a good plan as it stands how much fun an l4 is with two persons i do not wish the duo of scram and point to be a must fit for every nonindustrial shipsome missions could warp off and some would not some l4s might be limited to af as a max in gates some might be limited to cruisers some might have very strict timers others might greatly randomize their encounters or change objectives midmission this would all increase diversity and make things more difficultgenerally changing all missions to just fit a select few ships is no solution
which goes back to forcing ppl to fleet thats what lvl 5s r for which is less sandboxing and more wow
idk you can do l3s in a minmatar bc with a full out pvp fit complete with neutralizers and stuff i used to do them to get lp for faction ammo when i lived in a rss station being able to get out of the mission and kill something when it shows up on scanner makes it not so mindbogglingly dullnever ran l4s however  you might want a friend in a interceptor to tackle there or altidk the idea of having less more intelligent and capable rats which you need to tackle to prevent them from gtfoing would probably make it more interestingi mean sure you might not be able to mission in any random failfit but i dont see that as a bad thing and l1l3 would not really be impacted much difficulty wise here
players identify themself with their corporations and alliances or militia so it is only natural that they would like to identify themself with their organisations in daily life just like fans of for example a soccer team like to wear shirts of their favorite teams being able to do so would improve their sense of community and will have a positive effect on the loyalty of players towards eve players would probably want to be able to make tshirts coffee mugs stickers and or scale models with their favorite corpo or alliance logos howeverthere is no easy way to download the corpo logo just copying the image makes it very blurry when you blow it upccp should make a digital version of all corpo logos available through the eve web sitea variation to this idea could be that ccp would take orders for tshirts or other merchandise with corpo logos  a mini eve amamzoncom in which players can pay with a credit card or plexthis would enhance the sense of community among players eve could penetrate in the real worldof course ccp would have to adjust their website this might cost them a bit of time from their software engineers
after i told you in features  ideas discussion that there is a software for it did you even try to find it
how about the fact that a bounty hunting system to prevent or deter suicide ganking is really a nerf to miners as well lets walk you through what would happenpatch goes through with bounty hunting changes pvpers actively go on bounty hunting sprees many ships are lost on either side new ships have to be built mineral prices go updeterrence is largely successful as many people are now dissuaded from suicide ganking previous gankers go to hisec missioning for easy money or back to low sec in the rare chance they might gank someoneship loss is at a low macro  afk mining at an all time high as there is no ability to to combat this activity outside of bumping them without suffering the wrath of many bored by then bounty hunters more minerals are being brought in then demanded mineral prices drop to a new lowthis is probably the best case scenario from any of your proposed changes any of your other proposals that dont involve pvp like bigger or meaningful security hits would simply deter suicide ganking without filling the shiploss void created further driving mineral prices into the groundso i have to ask why do you hate miners too
poor girl you really have no idea how ridiculous youre making yourselfsaying you know about game production when all you have to show for yourself is student projects in which you slapped the title of programmer and designer on yourselfdo you realize that a lot of people in here actually are professial programmers can you see how ridiculous your references actually areyou really need to get the  out of this game and leave it to the people who actually care for it

haha oh wow i can only hope potential voters take the time to read some of this before saying i just want to elect a fellow carebear and here i was starting to give the benefit of the doubt
so you ran your own private uo serverif you have no regard for the uo eula do you have one for the eve eula
gold
may i ask what makes you think suicide gankers form a significant portion of minerals usedand i assume you are a suicide ganker yourself who is completely risk averse you realise this is eve supposed to be cold and dark but you cant handle it when concord doesnt protect your fully insured bs anymore try hello kittynot to mention what makes you think the bounty hunters would exceed the suicide gankers or why are the suicide gankers so incompetent they cant do anything anymore with some bounty hunters aroundserious you seem awfully scared for a working bounty system the ultimate carebears risk averse pvpers who dont dare to go away from concord protection
this riskaverse people that cant look beyond the scope of their own playstyle and trash out at anyone that doesnt play according to their specific nichethat is why it is important to have people like me on the csm people that look at the big picture and truly make eve better for all types of players someone that can represent the silent majority not a select few loudmouths here on the forumsoh and silly trolls that quote out of context still wont be replied to
id like to meet your tailor hes stiched you a mighty fine teflon capesrspostif anyone here isnt looking beyond the scope of their own playstyle its you ill admit that you do have some good ideas but your entire mindset is out of touch you have given absolutely no evidence that youre seeking to educate yourself in essentially any part of the game from flying terrible fit navy domis to avoiding pvp in any shape or form and branding those who disagree with you as trolls says to me that you are extremely risk averse and unable to look past your own playstyle
 ankhesentapemkah  but no tailor shops herehahahahahahahahahahaha omgps i named my new pilgrim ankhs soiled panty hows that for leaving a markedityou
agreedquestion for ankhdo you think up your campaign strategy and proposals for eve while playing puzzlepiratesquestion no2what is your stance on allowing racists onto the csm
eve is a pvp server but it seems to attract the type of lying hypocritical whiners that should be playing hello kitty instead of complaining about how the game is too difficult for them to grasp eve is an mmo and it wasnt designed for solo players who are only interested in rewards fortunately ccp will never allow the cluless minority to influence their decisions or their vision and will never ever turn the pvp off
is it just me or does furb killer look suspiciously like ankhs altany to your motion that there is not sufficient punishment for miscreants in eve i am involved in a 00 war and we are fighting in 00 and low sec not all alliances corps have devlared war as per the concord type thing as we dont need that based in 00 so far i have killed about 22 reds in low sec and my security status has plummeted from 5 to 667 i spent 3 hours belt ratting in 00 trying to raise it and managed a raise of 05you tell me if that is what you are trying to make harder i detest ratting and grinding in a game to raise my security status 1 point per day isnt my idea of fun the way im going it is going to take all year to get a positive status and you say the punishments are not severe enoughplease explain why that punishment of forever shooting rats isnt severe enough for you
we are blowing up miners for their own good
the current security hits in lowsec are a problem not just for these war cases but also in factional warfare and for antipirates some players have advocated to completely abolish sec status hits in lowsec the problem with artificial game mechanics is that it is impossible for a computer to determine intentwould you have any suggestions how you would like to see the security status mechanics behave in lowsec
the incredible harshness of sec status hits is proven best by watching all those 10s podding freely through empire and still ganking ppl in hi sec through the use of an orca in a safe spot loaded up with cheap gankboats for example
you do realise that very few people do this if any
i prefer my canditates to be a litle more mentally stableyou have ceased to even attempt to explain away the disparity between your quotes and your purported views id not be surprised if members of your immediate family were in politics  you use many of the same tactics answer enough of the questions to be seen to replying but ignoring the juicy bits say something enough times and people will believe it womd in iraq i understand the importance of pvp etcin the end your quotes have plenty enough ammo to shoot your own platform downninjatypoedit
what risks do you take you describe yourself as a carebear risk averse you trash on pvpers numerous quotes which you refuse to take responsibility for you want to nerf anyone who doesnt fit your specific niche was this a statement or a confession hint were not here to troll you we legitimately think you are a bad candidate and you only further prove our point by pretending that if you call us trolls enough times all the things youve said and continue to say will disappear if they are really out of context then by all means provide context were all waiting
the thing is every time i provided context it is ignored and the trolls just repeat the same old statement which has just been proven false or pick new things from the post rip those out of context while ignoring that very same context and write up another troll post what is the point of answering if noone wants to hear the answer but are just looking for more fodder for their crappostslike the ankh wants to nerf all pvp while there are a zillion posts now that clarify how my standpoints lead to more and better pvp
tech 2 damage control in effect linked post now states so everyone will assume that whatever was in that nearly 4 year old post needed to be edited from historyi am still waiting for an explanation of these two conflicting statements posted to this forum in a single dayi must be a troll because i require candidates to explain contradictions and empty promises
correct because people do not know the context in which it was posted it came out of an unmoderated trashforum for your info i dont feel the need to be held accountable for something that was posted in jest which is ripped out of context like all the filthy trolls have been doing for 8 pages nowit only conflicts if you rip it out of context as partial quotesas already clarified in the very same post with you rip quotes from the csm needs to convince the game designers but also needs to convince ccp from a business perspective and market their issues otherwise they remain in the backlog and arent taken into the scrum sprintsill base my decissions on a game design perspective but when talking to ccp i will do my best to also market the issues
qft
ehehehe i managed to catch the post before the edit and i wont relate the jist of it here but yeah girls got issues i do continue to enjoy the branding of anyone with a counter arguement or who has dug up some dirt as a troll you shouldnt play in the mud if you dont want to get dirty
miss antspankmyankle or wooteveryourcharnameis the way i see it you have some serious issues with the eveo pvp comunity you want eveo to be pve based game with people losing 20 of their skills or their entire character for engaging in pvp you want eveo to be your nice little singleplayer game where your can kill rats to your heart desire and pimp your ships endlessly  you consider pvpers immoral people evil people for hurting others through nonconsensual pvp you cannot make clearsolid distinctions between this game and real life you want a permanent seat on the csm to enforce your pve and heavenly eveo agenda you make use of smear campaign on other candidates you consider those that actually suport you your pets and mindless minions you edit your initial post to hide your little dirty agenda  now the fact of the matter is eveo is it is a game based around nonconsensual pvp it has one of the greatest mmo comunity i ever seenminus yourself  it gives every player the possibility to make an impact on this fictional universe it is a harsh but still fictional world in which most people have fun blowing each other up it has one of the longest learning curves out there among mmorpg games i joined eveo exactly for that harsh environment those immoral players as you call themfor the freedom we are given within this fictional world and for the spaceshipstell me why would i ever consider you a worthy representative of the player base when youre trying to ruin this game
stop taking her comments out of context
thank you for the nice list of misconceptions so i can answer them once and for allfalse as proven 3 times alreadyfalse as seen by me focussing on fw and 00 issuesdepends on the exact type of pvper were talking aboutfalsefalse im against the raising of the term limits as said in the opening post my heavenly eveo agenda is making eve better for everyonefalse so far i see a lot of candidates in my thread and slandering me on forums such as scrapheap and tweakersnetfalse exaggerationfalse i added more information
i used to not let any of this bother mei never cared about csm or what happened as long as eve just continued to get bigger and more excitinghowever recently that has changedi have been a pirate and a carebeari have had officer fits for mission running and participated in the ganknow i must say i dont think ankhesentapemkah is right for this positionplease dont vote for someone who wants to gimp people who want to pvp in a pvp game
by focusing on fw do you mean running fw missions without ever actually engaging in pvp
ankh i have a question im sure you wont answer because its a troll however legitimate it may bemy question who do you really think youre fooling here if you dont think we see right through you you clearly underestimate the intelligence of this community and its frankly rather insulting
interesting read as one of the faceless voters out there i can say i will be taking my four votes elsewhere
now im not taking this out of context you cant spin this you are a liar you are not against raising term limits when you are taking advantage of them for another term if you are against them put your money where your mouth is practice what you say you believe how can anyone trust you when youre already openly violating your own principles
i cant tell you what all those 10s in hi sec are doing but there are so many of them moving around freely that its obvious to even the daftest of ppl that sec status hits arent that harsh of a punishment somehow however i doubt all those 10s podding through hi sec are there just to adjust there market orders dont you
quick questionwhy do you think you are able to represent 00 while youve hardly ever participated in it as far as i can see all you have done is a few missions and some complexesyou cant make eve better for everybody if you change something in favor for 1 person another will have a bad day now the question is who will have the bad day
or perhaps shortcutting across high sec to get to another area of low or null sec without taking a 40 plus jump routeseriously youre asserting its a problem its something ive hardly ever seen happening i normally see 10s around short transit routes or near market hubsso yeah i suspect they are mostly moving or changing orders
you can get positive again in no time either do it more efficient or just do it for the isk and take the sec status increase as a bonus but even then it shouldnt take too longbtw it is just you you are a paranoid still would like to have boobies though ah well wishfull thinkingyou mean dont let people actually pvp as with bounties you would get honestly the larger part of suicide ganking is pve
that entirely depends on what type of 00 access you have it will take ages if you cant get to a spot that allows you to rat in a noncloaky ship which is quite punishing imoofcourse if you take care of sec hits before you go below 20 its alot easier
i didnt see the original post so i cant speak to its content but then neither did most of the people reading this now they can only work off what you havent edited away and whats said here i can see the original thread and i can see your defence of the post the thread started off with how many people have acctually considered suicide and you posted something in jest as a reply that you removed because it would make you look bad to my mind that translates into you having made fun of the suicidal i obviously dont know whether thats the case  and to be honest you dont seem like the type to do that  but thats sure how youre making it seem if thats not the case you may want to rethink your damage control tactics there are many things you could have said there that might have placated us this not one of them and yet that opposition hasnt stopped you from running again no a lot of them are there to buy implants and skills or to buy light ships that they can run out to lowsec faster than the faction police can kill them or theyre flying to a different lowsec pocket
hi there what are your views on boosting piracy and high sec crime i think these areas have been ignored for far to long and need to be improved
im merely stating that if 10s can move around hi sec so freely to go about there business then maybe having negative sec status aint that harsh of a punishment cause someone was whining about it being all such a big deal
yeah they can move around highsec freely unless they want to use ships but of course its not like this is a game about spaceships after all
yes eve is completely about using ships ofcourse nothing to do in eve but fly ships
definately got my vote 1
im not a great fan of csm tbh but ill give you the benefit of the doubtyou have my votes
bump voting opens wednesday night
and here is our fundamental disagreement i think youre absolutely wrong here for the reasons stated above and in the tldr manifesto as long as the game mechanics do not apply a penalty either tactical strategic or managerial for bringing extra ships to a big battle lag will never go away people will just bring more ships until lag returnshaving each star system or even each grid on a single server will not help in the long run if there are any nonlinear factors at all in the code then even small percentage increases in the number of players interacting in an engagement can cause the computeload to explode and even if the code is totally linear if the number of players in the game increases faster than moores law which is slowing down youre still screwedwe all want eve to be a success and to increase the number of subscribers what happens when eve has 2x or 3x the current number of subscriberswhat you are basically saying afaict is the endgame of eve large spaceholding alliances running big fleet operations is always going to be almost unplayable because of lag so we have to provide other alternatives that involve smallgang combat that wont lag outfine i would love to see more smallgang combat its my preferred type of pvp in the current environment but with the current mechanics how can you have any expectation that any smallgang alternatives are not going to be themselves blobbed into laghow are you going to prevent 25 v 50 becoming 50 v 100 then 100 v 150 then 200 v 300 and so onwhy with some sort of game mechanic that makes larger fleet sizes nonoptimal in some wayand if such a mechanic is devised then why wouldnt the devs apply it to the big blobs in the first placeas for armsraces the devs are already in an armsrace with the players they throw more compute io and better algorithms at the players and the players add more ships to the engagements to capture the improvementsthe way you stop an armsrace is by changing the rules of the game often risky and always unsettling but there you go
what is your opinion on baitingblobbing
first now about barely used arguably useless mods if you totally remove them youll get that one guy who has some crazy setup that uses it and while im really not worried about keeping absolutely everyone happy because i know itll never happen its an aspect of the game that is to me alluring eve has some really interesting fitting options and think this should be preserved there are tons of options when fitting a ship and lots of them are bad  but when you understand some of the basics and come up with a fit that really kicks butt its hugely rewarding some of my first fits were terribad but when i got that one that was fine tuned for excellence i was elated that said there are a glut of mods that could do with a bit of an inspection and rebalanced some of them havent changed since castor and thats silly im cool with it one of my favorite things to do in eve is bait it gives me a rush and puts a smile on my face as far as blobbing is concerned the act of bringing more people than the other guy is an aspect of the game that will never be gone that said i dont want to promote changes that encourage or promote use of the blob
your opinion about blaster platformsblaster in general
thrasher150mm gunsauto targeterl1 mission frigates  awesome and a lot less targeting related rsiyou seem to have one vote extra yay for people thinking things through
you bring up an interesting question is the problem with the blasters themselves or the platforms lets just go through the main blaster boatstaranis  owns blasters work for this making it arguably the best intythorax  garmon may have made the rupture the trendy t1 cruiser but the thorax is still feared respected and awesome deimos  has garnered the nickname of diemost and generally kind of a joke blaster platformvigilant  not very popular but widely considered to be significantly better than a deimos i think if they were cheaper wed see more of thembrutix  i think this ship excels as a blaster boat as well they are fairly popular for bcsastarte  a corpmate of mine said hey i think ill grab an astarte and everyone literally laughed and thought he was joking the ship isnt a good blaster pvp platform and forget about for pve im not of the opinion that every ship needs to be balanced with every other ship some ships should be better at certain roles but this onecould do with some love megathron  not too long ago blasterthrons were the quintessential cool guy ship you knew that if that dude got within 13km of you you were about to enter a world of pain a world of pain now youre not really as paranoid at least im not if a mega doesnt have someone to pin a target down its not much of a threat i know battleships arent solo pwn mobiles but the megathron needs something to tackle and it has to be close but not too close hyperion  great tank but you can really notice the lack of a tracking bonus vindicator  the quintessential cool guy ship its got the paint job its got the extra mid its got the ohgoditburns damage and its got that web that keeps you at the mercy of said damageall in all youve got the astarte and deimos who need a lot of help with megas and hypes a little lacking i think with an overall increase in tracking of blasters and perhaps some added maneuverability to the platforms themselves blaster boats could be cool again regardless of how it is accomplished i will admit that the lack of blasters in eve is a saddening trend that i am aware ofedit windicator
hi catsee this is how i also feel i may have to rig up some kind of dartboard based decision engine sometime before voting dayeither way i support what you are doing you go sisterevil incarn8
feel free to ask me questions on my campaign or about any issues you have with eve
very funny
how in your opinion and please elaborate are destroyers sucking at the moment
i think main problem people have with destroyer hull is that it has no tank and the sig of a cruiser personally sabre is one of my favorite ships and with the upcoming insurance changes which sound like increased insurance for dictors i will fly it even more on the other hand i have gone on many roams in a thrasher and been near instapopped by a bcbs which i think is kind of stupid because they arent really so superior to frigates to justify that level of fragility a second t2 destroyer with more interceptorlike bonuses  mwd sig modifier tracking bonus etc with no ability to fit sphere launcher would be very nice imo
thanks d
up and thanks to keiththe interview
i could just dig into my photo archive and try to blackmail certain ccp developers you know who you are with the possibility of releasing some of the embarrassing photos of them im pretty sure blackmail is against the code of conduct for csm members thoughccp owns the game the csm can only really advise but ccp are not stupid and i believe that the trick is to ensure that for every problem and proposal that the csm members have a clear idea of the effort required and the return on investment in ccps case there needs to be a clear gain in player satisfaction that induces more players to sign up and less players to quitclearly ccps schedule of releasing 2 major feature upgrades per year is based upon player acquisition and account reactivation the csm is much more concerned with keeping existing players happy and thats the primary leverage that the csm have i would imagine that the people best qualified to get consistent action from ccp are those who understand both sides of the roi equation
i too promise heaven and earth and lollypop unicorns will happen if i get electedthe truth is we have no idea how being a stakeholder will pan out for the first 4 csmsthats two years ccp have been disorganized on their end about returning answers to questions posed by the csmthose are questions that ccp suggested we ask too and although most of the csm proposals have been accepted by ccp those are mostly very small tweaks and the csm has had very little influence on the really big parts of the game i think the skill queue is the biggest thing the csm has ever been a part of and that really isnt so big if you think in terms of how much effort it took ccp to implementthe vast majority of the things the csm can take credit for is stuff like this or that button added in this dialog boxso well see how it pans out i know that if i get some real power over ccp i would make them devote more programmer time towards fixing old features that frustrate existing subscribers the most some devs pet project might be nice but the real core of the game that everybody knows well havent been touched much at all and really need some work shiny new features might attract more subs for a short time but crusty old features such as how ty poses and the corp interface are drives longterm players awaya prime example of that is the newbie tutorials ever since they overhauled the whole thing it has been a lot better for newcomers to the game and more people stayed with the game after trying it
exactly the problem is that ccps model of releasing major expansions does draw inback players for a short time but in the long term it is unsustainable as players get weary of broken promises and issues that seep into the gameccps model may work now but with 3 highly anticipated space mmos entering the field at the end of 2010 i think the game will really be in trouble if ccp doesnt adapt their strategy after all it is easy to get a player back to the game if hes not playing anything else or not happy with the thing hes playing but once someone leaves for a different game and is satisfied there the odds are drastically reduced
first i am amazed that a troll thread actually has morphed it to a real discussion about the csm and its powerimpact with ccpsecond bah now i am late to the partythe quote above as well as the need for a csm member to be able to see whether a concept is workable from a coding standpoint is very important a personal pet peeve of mine is the eve font booo hisss switching to a more readable font is not a major undertaking adding a system that allows the player to choose or even add a font to the game is far more complex at the same time ether choice is good from a finical perspective an easier to read font would help with customer retention do to the removal of an annoying aspect of the game or at least that is what i would say to the beancouters a candidates agenda is really more about seeing where their perspective is rather then seeing what they will do for the game this is still an election and votes today matter results are for later and are mootas a last bit the csm is better for small items rather then large ones i would like to see my rightclick to insure ship idea in game i have started doing that every item i insure a ship since i proposed it then i have to figure out why i cant do it and then go to the station insure button it is a simple change the code for rightclick to repair should be able to be usedthe font issue is just ccp being bullheaded i think that will only happen if you have the csm screaming like kids in the supermarket i want candy they will only brake when they are tired of hearing the screamingmy larger concept of expanding npc 00 is a great idea and will befit the game but i do understand that it is unlikely to be implemented if ccp does do something with it it would not be fore several years by then eve will ether have a shrinking player base and it wont be needed or the player base will have expanded to the point where it has to happensumming up anyone can move a mountain it is not about picking up the entire mountain and moving it you find a rock you can carry move that and go back to get another rock in the end they mountain will be movedi should be more awake when posting this kinda of stuff i hope i made sense
it was intended as a serious thread but i was orphaned as a child and raised by trolls so have a tendency to drool and rant when posting apologies for the confusionmany thanks for the informative replies especially mazzilliu and teadaze when i started the thread i wasnt aware the proposal to make the csm in to stakeholders had been put in to practice so my main concern has already been dealt with and trebor summed it up nicely best of luck to all candidates in improving the process some of you may be aware of the kUFFFDblerross model ive used it before to troll the whiners who spring up around patch time but the more i think about it the more relevant it seems to be1denial  ive just made it out to 00 and been given a shiny new battleship this games amazing nothing could be wrong with it2anger  the grid wouldnt load and im going to emo rage on the forums about loosing my shiny battleship fix the lag you useless bunch of ccp drunkards3bargaining  ive got an idea to fix eve so ill make an assembly hall thread4depression  im sick of hauling pos fuel  lag  lvl 4s  rockets  my assembly hall thread being ignored  whatever5acceptance  being a permanent beta tester isnt so bad ill just ignore the bugs and go troll the forumsa lot of players seem to go through a version of this process some will make it to stage five but many will quit before then and i believe theres two big financial incentives for ccp to indulge the csm a little more than they have in the past players are less likely to quit if the bargaining in stage three is successful one day someones going to launch a worthwhile game that competes with eve if ccp wait till that day before sorting the issues that really  players off theyll lose a lot of players development times are just too long to try and fix player concerns after the competition arrivesim genuinely shocked by this ccp are clearly not getting value out of the csm in terms of player retention if this is how little players care about you a bit of time promoting csm successes could go a long wayi assume the lollypop unicorns will be one of the dodgyier bars that are likely to appear after incarna
a good vote is a terrible thing to waste whether you vote for me or someone else every pro pvp vote will help ensure that candidates who understand and support eves true nature get elected so good on ya regardless of your choice of propvp candidates
ehhh that could be a bad thing really hypothetically speaking if ahnkhdjfhsjdhflj got say 30 votes towards her and you and mazz got 25 each ahnkkdjfhskjljf would still win 30 vs 25 even though the majority was against ahnks ideas 50 vs 30 with so many propvp candidates compared to the smaller from what ive seen anecdotal evidence antipvp ones it may end up going that way however anecdotal evidence is anecdotal and hypothetical situations are hypothetical 
on the other hand ank can occupy only 1 seat of 9 if she gets elected so chances are good that no matter which pro pvp candidates get in they will form a majority that can oppose her antipvp ideas
being able to work well with others is a skill that is very important in this kind of council if a delegate is combative rude inflexible or otherwise hard to deal with then you can bet their ideas wont flyat the end of the day any proposals to be added to an iceland summit and thus discussed with ccp need to be passed by a majority vote of the csm proposals not passed by the csm cannot be discussed no matter how driven the candidate proposing them
so youre saying that eve is basically a defective simplistic shinkicking version of missile command at its most basic level and everyones too lazy to fix it or come up with something remotely believablei mean theres merit to adjusting tracking for numerous other reasons as well for instance wouldnt it be nice if the visual engine actually rendered a wrecking hit vs a miss sooner or later these problems will have to be addressed because game mechanics and a whole way of combat are already broken because of the current approach
wont somebody please think of the childrenif ankh got her way then my 5 year old girl would have been banned from the game for suicide ganking a zephyr or she would have been sent to eve prisona vote for ankh is a vote against the next generation of eve players
im saying its a game gameplay comes before realism we have a system that works and creates good gameplay its not what id start with if you handed me a blank sheet of paper but its fine and im not going to overthrow the whole thing just because i find a different system to be more aesthetically pleasing
its a game about spaceships where the ships can fly multiple times the speed of light its never going to be believable it can however at least be playable
aha now i see why people whine about blaster tracking the orbit button in a short range ship is not something you should automatically click every single damn timeits there when you have a particular need to orbit a target to lower their dps like eg youre fighting a larger ship or one with superior dpsehp balance but significantly inferior tracking and stuff amarr boat with  fitfor all other purposes keep at range is your best friend after all youre flying a gankboat why on earth would you want to lower your dps once someone is already in pounding rangeblaster problems are more related to fitting woes below bs level not enough dps to justify them over much longer ranged guns with selectable damage types and 0 cap use and stuff like that
youre a little confused on this  but i know a lot of the candidates arent exactly falling over themselves to run rookie missions so its entirely forgivable i was the only player doing any testing of the new rookie missions prior to dominions release while everyone else was whining about flying titans and getting level 5 skillstheres 2 missions in the advanced combat that require you to lose a ship and youre given ships to do this the whole advanced combat arc is a great thing in general and id like to see some of the mission requirements extended to higher level missions  specificly having to hold down targets with warp distruptors rather than just having them hang around while you kill themtheres also the experimental gallente storyline missions which send pilots into the caldarigallente fw combat zones to kill a bunch of npc haulers protected by caldari ships these have generated a whole lot of whining and i was surprised that when they were brought up at the last csm meeting only elvenlord had first hand experience while most of the complaints were grounded in basic fear of lowsec there were legitimate complaints the agents always sent you to the same section of space regardless of where the agent was it wasnt atypical to find you had to fly 30 jumps to get there they were only for gallente pilots there would be a whole lot less stress if every faction got these kind of missions the missions themselves were actually amazingly easy if you used two pilots in combat frigates one to create a diversion and another to kill the haulers it made me wish that there were some missions in the game designed specificly to require multiple pilots proving more than just extra tank and ganktheres also a bunch of story arc missions that require pilots to go into lownullsec  the arc mission sets are without question a good thing but while the back story is more detailed and involved the actual mission mechanics are still stuck in the same gameplay ghetto that eve missions are suffering from
why dont you tell me  thats the beauty of this you tell me what you want and ill get it done
so if i say that caldari needs to be buffed and someone else says that caldari needs to be nerfed what exactly is it that youre going to get done
advocate that ecm jammer strength be increased by 20 and ships sensor strength be increased by 50

your persistence in posting misinformation deflection and general rubbish that has no bearing on the oprrrrright because fleets never warp in blobs strike onestrike two thats so completely idiotic illogical and nonsensical you cant even really expect anyone to post a rational reponse to it im claiming that dps does matter  much more so than ehp  because the more incoming dps you can focus onto a single target will almost automatically kill it before it even has an opportunity to respond400 bs shooting at one target and youre claiming ehp matters maybe if youre talking ehps in excess of 500k which would be a dreadnought or a carrier but for a bs sized target quite often bubbled please its a joke to claim that 800 or so extra ehp is going to make a blind bit of difference with even a small number of hostile battleships focusing fire  this is also the reason why active local tanking in general is ineffective in anything other than solosmall gangpve situationsyes that extra half second before you pop really helpsok thats a very wordy way of saying you want to maximize performance of your fits and nothing else youre not really advocating anything more than common sense of course i want to fit as much tank as i can however since it is no longer ye olde days of yore where the benchmark was fitting enough ehp to tank a titan ddd in a fleet fight with 800 total bs 400 on each side who are both calling one primary at a time who do you think will win even if the nontanking side only outdpses by 50 or so units each the multiplication effect will wind up being equal to bringing an extra 18 bs or so along its ridiculous to claim ehp matters a damn when you compare it against incoming dps from 400odd hostile ships and finally what does any of this garbage you keep posting about fleet fights actually have to do with blasters
that is a personthat has no bearing on whether or not one side or another is at its ideal range strike three at any time that you have enough dps to kill a target before it has a chance to respond your dps has as little bearing on the target as its ehp if you have 400 bs as you say then each bs could be doing 100 dps with a 4 second refire rate and you would still kill the target in 1 second400 ships with 400 volley each volleys100 dps  4 second refire through 160k ehp per volley so in your claim any dps over 100 does not matter because your mass of ships is going to waste the other side anyway 160k ehp is way more than any fleet battleship is going to have so more dps is totally a wasteexcept no one believes that its foolish so why do you believe that having more ehp doesnt matter when having more dps does that claim is so fundamentally insane that its almost pointless to discuss targets die when the amount of damage they take reaches their ehp if a targets ehp doesnt matter then no amount of dps does either because something is happening here that breaks the fundamental rules of the game that say damage is subtracted from hit points when a ship hits 0 hit points it explodesyour claim literally rests on a presumption that big numbers are big and holy molely look at those big numbers its bullactually the simulation that laing ran in the other thread pretty clearly demonstrates that ehp  dps is the clear winner in a fleet fight with 400 bs on each side extra ehp matters just as much as extra dps and it has as much to do with blasters as hybrids have anything to do with blasters the guy whining that hybrids were terrible brought it up and so i am refuting it
the goal of a fleet fight is to get the enemy fleets hit points to zero before your fleets hit points reach zero your fleet can increase its chances by bringing either more hit points or more damage an extra 800 ehp amy not help you personally if you are called primary but it will help your fleet
realyo my experience completly disagree with this
funny how fast a blaster thread turns into a rails  fleet thread not that we already have such a thing right here in ah
i still cant believe ccp hasnt done something about this its been an ongoing theme for about 4 years now the solution is simple keep blasters as short range and difficult to use as they always have been but make them worth fitting none the less high dps and fast tracking job done
not really when the incoming dps is so extreme that it will waste any local tank that isnt a capital ship in seigetriage mode or a titan no ehp doesnt matter as much as dps because the incoming dps will fry the target before it has a reasonable chance to respond  granted mostly due to limitations of lag but there we have it  thats the practical application and once again with a fantastic duh im not advocating pure glass cannon fits of course you want as much ehp as you can get out of your ship but thats really secondary to fitting for as much dmg as possible to get on top of killmails whilst hoping and praying the opposing fc doesnt call you primarybut hybrids are terrible almost as terrible as you are at actually addressing salient points and keeping on topic absolutely  mostly because some people would rather post something completely unrelated in the hope that people will stop paying attention to the thread rather than actually sticking to the op in that regard sorry for biting  but the stupid it burned
ask the op why he wants to discuss 50km engagement ranges linkif that is the case if you have so many ships that you waste anything then the dps of any ship doesnt matter either that is the key that youre not seeing if ehp doesnt matter then neither does dps if dps doesnt matter the only thing that matters is whether or not you are in range to hit your enemyahhh that is what its really about isnt it its not about bringing the best ship to win the fight its about your electronic phallusedit you see getting on top of killmails does not win fights its gets you on top of killmails we arent here to determine which ship you fly when you cant afford a convertible we are here to determine whether or not theyre good shipsand the problems with the ships are not due to weapon types for more information see the link in my sig
boost blasters
dps matters regardless of ehp because the additive power of many players shooting at a single ship is greater than the capacity of any single local tank and thats the key that you are not seeingfunny because i was under the impression that being higher on the killmail means you contributed more proportionately to destroying that target thus delivering more firepower more effectively and killing the enemy quicker so they are unable to shoot back with their alreadyhavingbeendestroyed ships thus rendering your ehp argument mootand no were not here to determine whether or not theyre good ships im here because ive already determined hybrids are poorly balanced  apparently im not alone in that conclusion  and im asking for a good discussion on how to fix them which you arent providingwhy on earth would i want to subject myself to that
no i am seeing what happens when you add up dps but if you increase ehp by 1 it has the same effect as decreasing the dps of every ship of your opponents fleet by 1if you have 20 more ehp then it takes 20 more dps to kill you in the same time frame which is the same as your opponent having 20 less dpssuch guardians and falcons are worthless miritebesides the inherent inefficiencies involved using that as a metric damage types come to mind youre discounting the effect of people shooting you on your fleets damage imagine for a second that you are shot first in a fleet compared to if youre shot last if youre shot first the amount of damage that you do is equal to the time it takes the enemy to kill you multiplied by your dpsif youre shot last the amount of damage that you do is equal to the time it takes to kill every ship in front of you multiplied by your dps this means that when you increase your ehp if youre called early you increase the total damage that everyone in your fleet doesthis portion of your contribution does not show up at the top of killmails it does not make you look like a hero but it does win fleet fights and that is what makes fleet ships good and that must be accounted for when examining whether or not ships are goodso you came to a conclusion using uncritical methods and youre surprised that someone is going to challenge that because you care about understanding eve enough to have these discussionsnote targeting delays are a symmetrical issue that apply to both dps and ehp equally ie if youre destroying ships fast enough that the limiter for destroying ships becomes your lock time then that same reduction in effectiveness that is applied to a targets ehp is applied to your dps
throwing this into the potwere looking for ways to encourage players to venture into losec in the first place my main is pirate this is hisec mission running alt and will avoid losec if at all possible simply because i know how dangerous it is the main problem with losec at the moment is that the pirates are bored and will attack anything that looks interesting this is mostly each other because there is noone elsetyrannis will up the incentives for going into losec with more valuableless crowded planets but this isnt enough i think that something like a fw mechanic but between pirates and concord would be the way to gojust my 2c

i was just offered yet another one of these missions this time its 31 jumps away 6 jumps deep into low sec space reward is a sub 10 million isk implant and some pocket change makes no sense to accept it really im all for more variance in missions but the reward should reflect the risk and the player should have a choice whoever thought these were a good idea in their current form clearly dont have a clue maybe ccp should open source eve online and have the players take care of the development at least were somewhat familiar with the game oh and dont you just love being gallente
interesting reading trader jen and thank you for your post sony bmg was well within theyre rights to produce software on cds they created for their clients being that they had to protect their clients copy rights against music pirates which is why there is that nice fbi warning at the beginning of every dvd you purchase as well as on the back of a cd case this has to deal with copy right laws and incorrect documentation of software being issued to the end user if you really wish to go down this legal route with me that is perfectly fine being that this same issue has been brought up in multiple markets about a company having incorrect documentation on a product for end users a good example of this is the food labeling regulations on food products or ethanol and methyl tertbutyl ether which a lot of fuel companies used to use because mtbe was cheaper then ethanol which now mtbe is outlawed for several reasons we could even bring up the nuclear industry or a retail outlet called walmart lol there is plenty of legal examples and if you want to continue down the route of computer software we can do that as well im sure i can find another software title by a big company that had incorrect documentation on its protection software it wasnt the companies intentions to scan a personal computer for private information it was their intention to prevent the enduser music pirates from stealing it just so happened that their coding was flawed in a way that it brought legal repercussions being that it installed itself silently with out the endusers knowledge and did not offer the ability to remove itself which in that case is considered spyware or a virus of which it did make the system sluggish and allowed access to thirdparty users of which could have stolen personal data but again i bring up my same argument as before we have software already on our systems that scan your personal data everyday if not every 5 minutes if you truly wish to be safe from such privacy invasion dont connect the computer you have all your personal data on to the internet andor dont have a computer at all
adding an extra process that runs continuously or for a long time is contrary to the idea of need for speed and would seriously mess with fleet fights currently many people log out then log back in right before a fight to clear their cache dial down graphics shut down other processes on their computer turn off brackets restart their routers and various other things in hopes of better performance in a fight if something like this was on eve clients everyone and their sister would want some way to circumvent the scanner to prevent it from using up system resources something like this would hurt more than it helped
i like it but the tinfoil hatmacro miningi am not a macro miner but hate the idea but secretly macro mine crowd will refuse to let it pass
lol typical darius trying to make out a big problem small you think 2 hulks and an orca mining 237 isnt going to make a big impact its not about the solo miners its about the macro fleets these fleets regularly sell inhuman amounts of minerals to their suppliers people have attested to it i even know a corpmate who does it im not surprised 2 hulks going at it 237 thats a lot of ore even the solo hulks can rack up a lotthe numbers dont need to be flaunted by ccp just ask the manufacturers you can get the sources from there numbers dont lie a ship that mines 23 hours in one day is not being manned by a pilot that is for surethat said it really is sort of pathetic how knee jerking the response it by eve players no way totally do not impliment i will totally quit eve its spyware im sorry i thought spyware went around trying to find passwords sensitive documents and credit cards not check your computer for bots people wouldnt even notice it if ccp implimented it the paranoia is hysterical i would totally support this if ccp could get the macros off the game
supported erase the remnants of one of the worst game feature decisions ccp has ever madeon a side note i can not by any stretch of my imagination comprehend why people argue that bpos are overpriced therefore have a bad return for the investment hence are generally worthless and take this as proof for invention being superior people the whole point is that these bpos are simply owned by players that won them and dont require any investment their enormous price tags further show that even if you would buy them the return seems to be not shabby either
at least change all of them to 4 me or less
youre an idiot as with everyone else supporting this thread t2 bpos arent hurting you its everyone else who invents that hurts you the more people inventing the lower the price of the product everyone can invent while a select few have bpos its the people who invent that decide the market price not the bpo holdersfyi i dont have a t2 bpo i invent and undercut people like you on the market every 5 minutes and make you cry tears when you cant understand why youre failing so hard so that you all can come to the forums and whine about how the game isnt easy enough for you 
yes
agreed hence they got rid of them i want my chance to win the lottery or the removal of the bpos
i dont own any t2 bpos and i think its a horrendous idea deleting something which does not present a imbalance of any sort and was very expensive to obtain just because of jealousybesides whats the point with discussing things with someone stupid enough to believe t2 bpo owners break the t2 market somehow
omg this so much

fypnot supported but you dont want support anyway since its a troll post i take it
dont be a smartass just because you believe something to be selfevident it doesnt mean the rest of us think so you have presented your opinion and your experience but you have yet to logically follow us through the reasons why it is gamebreaking and deserving of a change that the rest of us seem to believe it doesnt needif you truly do believe that it is gamebreaking and that you dont need to add more input than you already have then let me run you through my logic of the situation you sayhere is how you can counter this if you are in a frig dont turn on your mwd the sig radius bloom than happens makes you receive more damage and can potentially pop you there is a 3 to 6 second window where a stealth bomber uncloaks and launches a bomb before warping make sure your fast tackle takes advantage of this instead of freaking out about the incoming bomb have logistics bombs can only be launched every minute or so more than enough time to rep everyone in a smallish gang to a safe level if its a large gang then repairs should be almost immediate if a mob of stealth bombers have basically flattened your group in one go kudos to the stealth bomber gang to do such a feat is no small thing and takes time dedication and preparation to perform next time bring more buffer and follow the above steps
apologies let me list my reasonsstop saying i did not list any reasons why when i did but i am sure you will continue to try and derail my thread and twist my words anyways further displaying how moronic you are
again this is purely your opinion an opinion which is easily countered as per the points i made in my previous postsif you truly do think that flying a stealth bomber is not risky then strap yourself in one and play around with it they are far from invincible
there are enough counters to bombers for those who think about it instead of whining for nerfs more then there ever was for aoe doomsday
at least somone gets the point i was trying to makenot that i expected the op to but im glad im not crazy
back to the ing top again fix this i win crap i am sick of losing ship after ship to these damn ships
your trying hard to look completely bumb or somethingyeah im sick of losing brain cells to your ed topics nerf emo tj
maybe you should try asking yourself what you could do differently so that this doesnt continue to happen i mean even a relatively unintelligent animal can learn if presented with unsatisfactory outcomes in a repetitive fashion
if they made it available to see bookmarks on your grid a new minimap would be great a alternate solution that you have to warp from point a which is your launch point to point b which have to be on grid would make things more intresting imo just being alinged to something celestial between urself and ur target is abit too easy imo thats my 5isk of input
you cant post a bomber buff in a thread about nerfing them
bombers are fine as they are i see quite a few die every day currently bombers are an effective tactic against big blobs and the bombers themselves are easily countered by smart movement smaller blobs interdictors and subbs ships this is pretty much the definition of balanced
i woulnt call it a buff more of a modification current mechanics altho i maybe should put the minimap thing in a new thread but im lazy today
a dozen guys in frigates should not be able to wipe out a 100 battleship fleet with ease in just a few seconds this is the very definition of a ship being over powered period
let me guess you had been in that badger when the initiative wiped your fleet with bomberswaiting for titan bridge outside the shield again
fyp
please add a do not support this topic box under support this topic then pleasealso not supported if i could link killmails i would show how often stealth bombers die they arent an iwin button emo tj posts are going downhillif your fleet sat there and let enough bombers drop on your glass canon battleship fleet without doing anything you deserve to have learned this lesson
correct they set there for quite a while clustered right on the bridge at 0kmoh and it wasnt a dozen guys in frigate we had 4 full squads making a total of 9 runs does tj want to nerf bombs enough that a bs can tank 6070 bomb hits
not supported
lol jesus christ man stop being dumbmaybe you should tell your uber ed fleet commanders to stop being so dumb to begin with maybe sitting at a jump bridge with around 150200 bses ready to jump with jump fuel enough to only jump out 50 bses is a very good ideahahah this is what i call for epicly owned in yo face
so because this game has yet another sore eye jump bridge requiring fuel  over a hundred of my friends are punished by losing their ships they worked hard for this is no better than going into low sec just to get ganked by a 50 man camp how is that supposed to be funanyways back on topic my point has been made and justified please give a thumbs up so this ship can be balanced
lol op nc alt spoted grow some balls sht happens lolbtw nice whine can we have cheese with this whine btw did u loose 150 man fleet to a bombing raid today lolmy english sux sue me or bomb me gogo initive u rock guys 
its just your own dumb fault that you get spanked by bombers stealth bombers are perfectly fine as they areoh noes they was d hardcore for they own stupidity well you know what that was extremely deserved tbhi have a hint for you the first thing is learn pvp the 2nd thing is learn to use your braini have been bombed quite some times in my sniper tempest but because we know what we are doing i have lost none to any bombers last time i was bombed by stealth bombers i think i was hit by 56 bombs and got out with 15 armor in my shield tanked tempest so start being way smarter and you can start to be more successfull in eveeve online is not hello kitty onlineedit just to say the same as the atlas guy over me said the initiative is doing a great job with their bombers so keep up the good work the initiative
not supportedtastey tastey nc alt tears yummy150 bs can die to a well organised well fcd 25man bomber gang true but 500 bombers could die to a random solo bomber tooif you really think there is no risk try actually flying a bomber sebo zealotintybubble2seconds lag  dead bombersbeen there seen it done itnot only were they sat on a pos but when you jump into 25 hostiles and nothing is on scan alarm bells should be ringingtheres a reason for that shield around the pos its safe in there purely fcs fault for a bad callop is a fool fact
perhaps after you satisfactorily explain malcanis post a couple up from the quoted one if they had time to make 9 bombing runs on your fleet then you frankly deserved to die especially given the cycle time of a bomb launcher
stop trolling my assembly hall thread caod is that way 
9 runs total made by 4 squads about 12 seconds apart only squad 1 got a 3rd launch i did nothing of value on the 3rd run because i forgot the launchers need to reload pbut theyd been sat on the bridge outside the shields for about 5 minutes by the time we turned up kind of a welp moment for them happens to us all tbh
so lets see you sit a few km from the saving pos shield instead of waiting inside the shield smart way you sit right on the jb while waiting for the fuel correctyou sir got punished for your own stupidity smart people wait inside the shield
with all due respect bull i didnt call him a troll because i dislike his idea i called him a troll because he has a continuing history of posting ideas so incredibly ludicrous that literally nobody believes hes serious i took him seriously for the first few but he has proven himself not to be worth that consideration he is banned from the csm public chat channel  the only person to earn that honour  and the only comment that ban got was why did it take you so long a simple perusal of his comment history should be sufficient to convince anyone of his lack of honesty with regards to the issues he pushes he is a troll full stop do not make a mockery of the moderation process by defending him
at the moment when a pos is low on resources you get a warning mail every hour about it which ceo directors and i believe members with the correct pos management roles recieveit just comes down to spam and is unneed in this extent in my opinionways to fix it which are not mutually exclusivea limit status mails to 24hours and 1 hour before resources are depletedb make these mails optional add a setting to not recieve those mails c remove mails all togeither but add a pos management window which lets you look at the status of all your poss and their resource status would be pretty useful anywayplease support i know i am not the only one annoyed by the pos spam
d keep towers fueled correctly so it doesnt crye use the pos api to monitor your tower
actually i think the op has a pretty good point its annoying as hell to get the mails once an hour once every six hours would be plenty
nah my crumby memory needs reminders when the s about to hit the fan
logically i support my own threadalso i am a director i dont want anything to do with the poss some members want to hold so for me its just pure spam not lazyness
i support b
meetings with ccp every two those should get news articles

this would be nice kinda hard to make informed votes for csm when it is hard to find out what issues individuals pushed for when they met with ccp or if issues csm voted on were raised
hey it would be great if one could choose to be alerted via email the day before your account subscription is over my bank doesnt allow me to transfer funds into paypal after 2100 which is before my playtime making the account unusable every now and thenthank you 
didnt they add the remaining subscription time to the character selection screen
i believe they did but i didnt notice it until i started combing the character selection screen and it is my opinion that 10 days is too big of a margin
i dont personally see any reason why this would be a bad idea and this would be extremely handy for me and people on the doletamber
my main pays by plex but for whatever reason the game thinks im on credit card so it doesnt give me the login warning about there being 10 days left to account expiry ive just taken to renewing my main account when my alt comes close to being due but thats really a silly system this would be much nicer it should be an option for folks who actually do autorenew and it should be a choice about how many days in advance the mail comesalso about whether it goes to email or evemail but yes supported

delayed local has a couple problems  ok actually its got a lot of problemshowever i do like the idea so long as we decide to take it a step further heres just a spattering of ideasincrease belt sizes to over 750km rat spawn locations and ore regeneration talored to fit of course provide beacons for the 0km point of the belt then leave others to explore 750km in each directionimplement a reduction of visual ongrid distancing maybe back to 250km this allows the hunted to hide in the belts and do their work whether it be ratting or mining i think that if you incorporate this sort of stuff in plus keep in the deepsafes why the  are you getting rid of that btw jesus and you might be getting closer to local removal especially in 00 spacehowever 00 soveriegn space should get instalocal because after all its their space
no it didnt w space has many unique differences that make it a totally different kettle of fish not least of which are spawning in jump range and the restirctions on numbers you are misinformed if you think they are comparable
wspace proved that no local works in wspace thats it the mechanics between kspace and wspace are different and the success or lack thereof in kspace can and will vary
supported the game would need a better dscanner though
this would make pvp roams in their current form take way too long i cant imagine waiting at gates for scouts to search every system for something to kill waiting for scouts to identify if players have safed up or are docked in the systems with someone in local is bad enough when youve been on a roam for a whileno local isnt the giant boost to pvp you are trying to make it out to be roams dont use voodoo to find which systems people are in they use local
this it would just kill roaming not that is that great now what should be done is to increase income from beltsanoms  make harder to warp to safe
i think we should seriously discuss proposal of addingchanging several 00 regions with no local with minor to no scanner improvements then when scanner is redesigned significantly and the performance of new 00 is evaluated further discussion should take place on converting all of 00 to no localthis would be a more reasonable request than the current all or nothing approachmaybe call the new no local regions as 1 and since they should be richer than other 00 have all systems there be 1 true sec
while im not opposed to the greater concept of no local in 00 or low sec i agree with deja on this thumbsdown
ok lets separate the pussies from hardcore people with new regionsnobody will force you into big scary nolocal space just dont let your fear get in the way of other peoples fun
himy name is tibalt avalon ingame i would like to make proposal william demeo your an idiot
rofloh man 210 because of your sad attempt at formal englishpirates should be punished because you had to use the toilet ahhh thats one ive not heard beforebut no really not supported gb2wow noob
hello kitty that way oh by the way you suck
i would pay more for my subscription if when i kill your character the character is dead no clone dead
lololoolololololololoooooll wtf go back to wow if you cant take the hard part of eve imo everyone should have a mod which cost 1 isk could be bought on all stations and was passive when you fit it your invulnerable mkayand what if the pirates pay plexs then an extra fee of 50mill isk will be added on like cspa xd
i cant believe there are so many actually biting p
suicide ganking has become ridiculous everybody and their mother are running around exploding stuff and suffering next to no consequences it is not about high value cargo anymore it has come to the point where people suicide their bs for funas so many are not tiring to say concord can not save you but should provide consequences indeed while i too find the basic concept of suicide ganking valid i support no insurance payout for concord kills i mean none at all and no this will not lead to noob players leaving the game in addition to the insurance not covering your suicide ship they become more reluctant to pay other losses because you become a high risk costumer basically you wanne be a pirate deal with the consequences there is still a load of money to be made but you live the life of an outlaw then
there are ways to avoid suicide ganking as above people have postedpersonally i think suicide gankink should be a valid tactic however tehere should always be punishment and loss for doingit what i have always suggested is simpleif concord destroy or are invlved in destroying your ship your insurance should be invalidated simple if comncord are on your lossmail your insurance payout is 0 zero nothing as you are obviously doing something illegal to warrant itbefore flaming me i actually do suicide ganking myself and as much as i think the above should be brought in teh option and risk should always be there
and normally when pirates kill someone they would stay dead we have clones and insurance companies that arent remotely concerned about profit in eve realism would make life even worse for people getting ganked not better
by high risk customer that includes ship losses anywhere right cause low sec and 00 losses would void insurance as well not to mention wars and ing ppl off to give them a reason to blow your ship upand low sec piracy isnt technically illegal r u suggesting we should void insurance on low sec pirates too cause judging from your killboard ud be hurting yourself and your blob wouldnt take too kindly to your suggestion either and speaking of your killboard u do not suicide gank so u dont even know wtf ure talking about love it when ppl impersonate without having to prove it
concord are not there to protect you they are there to punish the outlaws
time is money and ships will no longer be free for anyone come tyranniscapitals are going to have insurance essentially speaking removed completely too which is a nice change
fixed
realy so where is the punish part in loosing no more than 5m isk for a suicide ravenoeverybody who think current high sec pirateing is fine are moronsyou say ppl are stupid to haul expensive stuffs unprotected1st protection would need some altfriends and hauling as fun as now i cant see my friends eager to fly by my transport ship to do the repetative lockrr warp out jump sequencesso it remains to alt so much for the reason it encourage multiplaying it doesnt2nd stuff doesnt even have to be expensive because it is nearly 0 isk loss for the pirates to kill your transportthe loss of the victim hugely outweights the loss of the attackerpirate even if cargo doesnt taken into account fe 1 freighter 700m isk around 20bs to kill it max 100m isk so even with very cheap cargo the pirates come out positively that is so wrong pirating should be all about finding the tasty targets and kill thosenot everythink they whish to just because they can do it due to no real loss it can realy be used as griefing which isnt good for anygame3rd freigherjforca costs so much moneysp that the newer players cant afford them and smaller transports arent that great and even at 100m isk cargo which is not much at all pirates will fire at you4th there is no future loss of anykind other than pirates current ship and a very small sec stat loss5th you dont have to use autopilot to be got ganked better pirates can scan your transport just fine before you can warp off oh and cloaky blockade runner doesnt realy have enough cargo for most haulingcancelling insurance payouts if concord is involved would change this to acceptable lvl pirates would only attack those who carry realy expensive stuffsi would even make concord to pod the pirates maybe even force them to pay isk to be able to reenter high sec without consequences before a give time like 23 days passalso for lowsec piratesthere is realy no drawback after 5 sec status to future loosing sec status at least concord should ocasionally send fleets to kill these pirates and pod them pmaybe there could be a skill which increase the chance to items not getting destroyed when ship blown up for pirate wannabesoh and about that a newbie would be penalized because they are mistakely shoot somebody in empire and get a huge loss is stupid first noobs wont fly expensive ships because they are just started the game2nd there is a popup window which tells you if you realy want to shoot and concord will kill you if you do the noob must be braindead if he still continue3rd we already come to the conclusion that the newbie is braindead to agrees in highsecso can you realy see he would insurance his ship before this because i cant  only if he accidentally clicks on insurance in short do you realy think that 5m isk loss battleships for pirates is a real consequence for agressing in highsecbut i know you are the elit because you can gank hopeless haulersbecuse you are that awesome playersbtw ive never lost my transporter  and i ocasionally gank freighters in high sec but it is still out of control
and wheres the punishment for losing no more than 5 mil in a raven anywhere elseure not supposed to even be targetable in a cloaking transport ship so wtf r u talking aboutif a pilot flies a hac or even t3 in low sec00 and loses it does the loss of the victim not hugely outweigh the loss of the attacker as well should that stop him from ganking it simply because it would hurt too muchyes theyre not supposed to be easily accessible because of their massive buffer and newer players shouldnt even be able to afford valuable cargo in the first place so by the time they do they shouldve known how to safeguard it by nowif its such a small sec loss then why arent there any threads crying about rookie shipt1 frigate losses from suicide ganks why r there still thousands of exhumers infesting the belts thats what i thoughtwhat exactly do u mostly carry that u cant split into smaller loadshigh sec is not a 100 safezone completely separate from the rest of eve u want safezones go back to world of warcraftright because 10s dont have mining alts to hide behind in high sec whenever theyre corneredrefer to the top of the postjust like every low sec00 player who baits then blobstherefore it is possible to stay safe in high sec the problem is ppls stupidityfor a long post u sure didnt think any of this through
this the tyrannis insurance change is a hefty nerf to suicide ganking and i think it will reduce suicide ganking by a fair bit right now if i am using a tempest to gank ill go for a hauler with 50m because why not my tempest probably costs 25m total after insurance if after tyrannis my tempest after insurance costs 20m then i will not go for a hauler with 50m because i will receive on average 50 of drops so 20m loss for 25m gain is not worth the time people will also stop smartbombing and killing shuttlesnothing for giggles because it will cost a decent chunk of isk to suicideyou might see a spree of people suiciding before the patch because these are the good ol days of suicide ganking in the future newbies will huddle around a gatecamp fire as we tell stories about these days
first throw away suicide ganks against something cheap are done by alts that are trained up and disposed of using a brutix or similar not a battleshipsecond suicide smart bombs are done rarely usually as part of some type of event or out of rage against shuttle hauler macros this will happen regardless of insurance reimbursementthird people mistake failed ganks in low sec as suicide ganks usually it is a noob pirate or drunk pirate who made a mistaketyrannis will likely not put a dent in true suicide ganks unlikely that there will be some kind of spree right before tyrannis because people will continue doing them post tyrannis what tyrannis will end however is the build a rokh sd a rokh make profit thing that has been going on for some time now
dont want to burst your bubble but you have missed all 2 weeks old alts in tempestsmaelstroms in uedamasivala lately
this is totally not supported1 high sec is not supposed to be totally safe eve  everyone vs everyone2 you should not under any circumstances fly a jump frieghter carrying large amounts of loots without an escortperiodif you fly a jf thinking it wont get ganked suicide or otherwise you are playing the wrong game eve is a game that is about risk vs reward always has been always will be one of the pillars of eve as a game is nonconsensual pvp deal with itif people in your corp dont want to helpscout you your corp sucks and join a real corp that knows a person with the isk and piloting skills for jf usage is an important part of the industry backbone of their corp and will scout you or you can negotiate with some mercenaries to provide the escort you need3 declare war on the corp that ganked you and take the fight to them cost them what they costed you

yes
thats awesome sauce
hmmmmmmmk then
ooh nice idea
because he is trying to make the ship into something it was not intended fordoes black ops need a boost sure giving it a covert cloak is not the solutioni do think increasing the range it can use the covert bridge would be very helpful
lol are u gallente check out the sin a rifter is better than that shipbetter proposal
i have been thinking on this for a while now and if this is not meant to be posted here then i apologize for that but i searched and did not find anything on what i am about to suggest through the searches i have seen many people in a situation where they have a low security status and are stuck in low sec00 because they are pirates and they have a corporation or an alliance camping them in a station and it is hard for them to escape due to their security status therefore their game is pretty much ruined unless they can get a new clone in another low security system that is if they can afford it maybe ccp can implement a bribe option to bribe concord and lower their characters security status if that is not possible then maybe put an option in account management where this is possible to increase your security status by paying a small fee of maybe 10 or lower depending on how the rest of the community feels is fair or however ccp decides please think on this ideaedited the subject
i wont lie this idea appeals to me i would mean that i could go gcc more often on pirates and t3 flying nubs and not have to really do any carebear crap to recover from such wonderful transgressionshowever i cant support this for 2 reasons1 the hardcore carebears will throw a fit and with good reason it basically means that people with a lot rl money can get a pass card for some of the general ery they commit ingame2 there are already quite a few ways to raise ones security status you just need to dedicate yourself a bit to doing them some current ways of repairing sec status are farming bs rats in nulllow sec do missions in the highsec systems you havent been banned from and raise your social skills
i support this proposal ive thought for a long time that in keeping with eves environment of corporate greed and it would be a good isk sink
this is the reason i cant support this real life doesnt really reward this type of behaviorthough reality tv sure does you see it extensively in video games because by and large their isnt enough of a penalty for doing it and in some instances its promotedinstituting something like this would be like televising a ufc or mma match at a suit and tie steak house affliction wearing meat head douche bags dont mix well with others but often find the money to make even the best places suck for a few hours if given the opportunity
i understand what youre saying and i was thinking maybe it can done by raising the price on it the lower your security status is and maybe make it so that the security status does not go back to 00 but raises slightly and gives a chance to maybe make it through at least 6 security systems and 5 systems
this had been discussed in a 23 pages thread already but i am too lazy to find iti just want to say  all people who you kill got to work for their stuff so do youif you dont want to care about sec status become a pirate or pvp in 00 or just grind yourself up getting the sec status back to 25 or so doesnt take that longnot supported
to easy to suicide gank as it isi do think u should be able to bribe factions for standing though
hello allever since warp to 0 was added to stream line travel its had a negative impact as a side effect on pvp now without unbalancing travel and making it to tedious here is what i proposein high sec warp to 0 becomes 5km still fairly easy to travel but leaves some room for error should u be at war with somebody this distance is debatablein low sec warp to 0 becomes 10km more dangerous space so its a bit tougher to travel but not abysmal stillin null sec warp to 0 becomes 5km it is null sec and travel through it shouldnt be easy as pie however you can use dictors and warp bubbles so it doesnt need to be 10 by default alliances using an ihub could change the warp to distances in systems they hold sov to increase or decrease it for varying levels of people based on alliance standings with max being 15 min being 5in conjunction with these changes you would not be able to make bookmarks within 10km of an object such as stations gates you could still bookmark in belts etc
so to make it possible to suicide gank even with warp to 0
negative side effect on pvp could you elaborate as in how exactly oh yeah you cant lock pods and shuttles landing to a gate now a real shame
piratepvp tears are thebest tears tbh
sniffsniff still crying about that last pod you failed to catch at your pathetic gatecamplike pirating needs to be any easier
the abuse of stealing an enemies pos password and gaining access inside is just plain stupid this opens the door to fleets warping in and bumping out helpless super capsremove this and simply add the option of who gains access inside your pos based on standings that you set on pos similar to how the pos decides to attack based on standings
yes and let blues come steals ur stuff then
ill just say this before this thread gets going  do not feed the troll
wonderfull topic i must say hahahahabut im just gonna ask you those questions though and i hope you will answer it to just give a point on why you are creating those seriously ed posts1 ok why are you creating those topics at all to begin with2 why are you suggesting so ed ideas that the only thing you get back is flames and trolls3 why doesnt you think at least 10 secs before you post some ideas also think if such an idea would be good to have and so on4 why are you making those topics when you know your stupid ideas wont get any supports at all5 why cant you just shut the hell up in hereok thats 5 questions i mean everyone is free to give some suggestions  ideas as long they are fine and that there is a boundary on when you dont need to post ideas at all herebut your topics is the same as i got killed by a rifter in my cynabal for example and then goes to this forum section and cry like a whiny ass baby to ccp that omgomgomgomg wtf nerf rifter because he killed my cynabaland on top of that you doesnt gives a damn to give any reasons at all why those things should be changednot supported again and you will never get any supports by me ever forget it
qft
sisi has been updated with the new planet type distribution perhaps the op author can check for realism
bump
supporting
supportedbecause autocannons are better up where it counts
so why would they fix it now as they had years for this ccp is lazy if it is to fix things  they can only add new stuffs saidly planet interaction comeon who needs that o
i support this noble endeavour butuse currier contracts
bump for the recent battles raging between sc and nc
so what exactly is there to do without a shiprun jobs though you cant move goods to market or gather materials without a shipmarket trading of course you cant exploit market differentials without a shipresearch agents which is about the only thing you can do to full effect without a ship though youll need one to gain the standings first of allstation spin works best with a pretty ship so youll need to be in a market hub for best effect
incorrect you accused me of any number of exploiting in my thread when i ran for csm among them you accused me of flying in stabbed and cloaking ships and bugging plexes without a shred of evidencehowever you did post an image of yourself happily flying in cloakedstabbed frigate and not pulling an aggro from full npc spawn of caldari ratsand when we finally had enough of this crap and decided to show what could be achieved if done on industrial scale amarrminmatar front it suddenly become a problem and exploit in your opinion and you wanted people banned for using it see message from larkonis earlier beforehand you were quite happy to gloat about its use in local and you even said in fanfest fw video that such standing exploit was only valid way your words at 354 to capture caldari plexes and pulled random numbers from your hat on how much isk caldari could farm from cosmos missions via plexing alts damar rocarionbrigadier general
this person is running for csmyou want this person to be running your gameankh has no idea of the workings of eve shes a dhb wildcat ego with a carebear mentality  which is fine for representing those players  who pretends to know everything when its quite opposite that is not the case prove that you know these things you say you know prove to us you are competent in the ways of pirating suicide ganking and nullsec pvp that you claim to know so much about i dont care how
i know stuff about pvp and stuffi do not capture plexes with cloaking frigates that is liessrslyi mean you wouldnt be catching half the flak if you just honestly said im a carebear candidate and be done with it
actually being an outlaw puts very harsh limitations so does the 15 minute global criminal countdown pirating in low sec creates all sorts of issues some of them can be circumvented partially some cant but in either case its a pain in the arse of course you or ankhsdfhdwosjifdsahiiuha or anyone who can possibly agree with her wouldnt have a slightest idea about this since they never tried it which is fine on its own of course but when one such person runs for a position with certain degree of power starts mentioning deleting my characters and only not literally being in favour of it because its impractical ill be so bold to feel offended
i heard cva had a large fleet battle last nightwould the candidate care to comment on her participation in this particular action and 100s of other engagements over the last several monthsthis would allow us voters the chance to judge her ability to understand basics of nullsec combat pvp  fitting oops did i say  i meant ship ofc playing with others who dare indulge in said pvp cuz ya knowthats pretty much what the ole sandbox is all about and knowledge of fleet mechanics and lagnahhhdidnt think so i swear you must be the sole exception to the rule that all dutch folks are cool
wow so when you didnt like ultima online you ran your own server with all the the stuff you didnt like disabled thats almost like some pilot in 00 running a packet filter to mask his presence in local changing the game to suit their play styleand so the only way for you to change eve is for people to vote you onto the csm but youre an extermist it like voting for a republican because you dont like taxes and then finding out that you get all that christian fundamentalism hokey toovote for anyone but ankhicantbebotheredtospellhernameright
 this right here is why you cant claim to be running independent
ha like a democrat candidate in a room with republican votersi wonder why you dont seem to be in alignment with the people you are supposed to represent yeah right
ermthe cloak is off in that picture its perfectly legit to have a cloak fitted to your ship as long as youre not using it to capture the plexes
explain to me how having an organization behind you make you independent
i was starting to think that maybe she had some good ideas but this text for her is political suicide you talk too much to the wrong people unfortunately shame
ive removed offtopic comments from this thread carry on  shadow
good info captain this is quite sickeningi have some questions for ankhesentapemkah but i too dont respond to trolls which im pretty sure she is at least you have the important political traits of not giving straight answers to uncomfortable questions and outright lying
hi there just thought id post and confirm that yes thats me in that chat log and yes thats precisely how deluded ank really is when she thinks no one else will see it the above chatlog is an excerpt from a corp chat from back when i was in afc and part of what became kind of a corp injoke about ank playing with her pp puzzle pirates or something lame like that anything she has to say about pvp is pretty much her talking out her backside as a quick glance at her battleclinic stats will tell you she doesnt really have any and shes got about as much integrity as a politician from louisiana youd be better of voting for me as a csm but i dont think my platform of send me to iceland so i can get drunk and chuck bjork in the volcano to appease the lava god would get me very farwho am i voting for im going to get  drunk put the names of all the candidates minus ank of course on a dartboard and best two out of three gets it
so we have a csm wannabe which out of the eye of the public says that theres no reason to play eve because you cant leave your mark on the eve world and is not enjoying eve and puzzle pirates are a much superior gameinteresting on the other hand shes saying shell represent all players even politicians dont lie that much most of the time and wants to meddle in pvp mechanics despite having zero clue about pvp to the extent shes not capable of even fitting a ship semisensibly or even participating when the alliance shes in is under attackyou know if you just said im a carebear candidate well ok fine i guess carebears want representation too however you wish to present yourself as a candidate which will represent everyone without bias ha ha which is political bs at its finest
thing is im willing to be even the most skittish carebear in eve understands that the pvp is one of the big draws of the game and that without it there wouldnt be much of a market for empire carebear produced goods so a candidate that wants to massively hamper or even do away the pew pew fun times the rest of us like would be bad for carebear businessanks not really representing anyone but herself and her own laughably deluded idea of what eve should be
ankh is a geek of the worst kind the kind of geek whos completly ignorant of what is going on but has the authistic idea of knowing everything betten than anybody else this kind of geek doesnt know shes a geek she even thinks she has strong social skills she will sooner accept the reallity that everybody is wrong and she is right than try to understand why people critizize hernice typical behaviours she exhibits is of god syndrom when being in some kind of leadership position in a gaming community running a uo shard etcankh you are a sad person get tf out of here and play other games you are not helping here
what with all the earnest you dont know me but im running for csm please help me understand lowsec concerns that are popping up in cp its refreshing to be able to vote for mynxee whos been here all along
bumpa vote for sok is a vote for pvp
dont vote for sok hell ruin eve1 bil will silence meyou have my vote
lol
bumping tonight with a simple plea to take the csm as something that can make a difference in a good way to eve and asking everyone to find a candidate that seems to represent what they want in eve and to vote for themissler dainzeyour next csm represntative
hey isslerfirst i heard of you listening to an interview between you and dillon arklight of podded podcast at fanfest 2009 you seemed sound with a cool grasp of the issues then i realised the name rang a bell and i noticed you were ceo of tadao whos alliance wed just joinedthen you popped up again on a video i saw on youtube of the 4th csmprolific indeed youre knee deep in eve and that presence is why you get my vote
con strik waves his issler dainze  the voice of reason party flag
on the point of fixing lag have you personally participated in the mass testing on singularity to help pin down the causes of lag
i am very impressed with your candor and posting elise randolph you are truely an honoureable spaceship guywhat is your opinion on wormhole space do you think it needs a boost in some way like a increase in the decay time of wormholes from 24 hours to something more interesting also why dont wormhole quantum flux generate upgrades work i was thinking of voting for mazziliu but after reading this thread im seriously considering voting for you
you have my vote
i think wormholes are a perfect combination of profit and drawback i got tired of saying risk and reward i love fighting people in wormholes its like putting eve into a time machine where someone dropping a carrier on you made you say  now i have to deal with this the one thing that i can find fault with is that theres a liiiitle too much seclusion for my taste increasing the duration that wormholes are active were talking like 612 hours here will both increase the chance of a confrontation and help the guys that live there with logistics these are the kind of changes i like fixing a slight concern without totally screwing the other partyabout the wormhole sov upgrade not working i think its one of those issues that people probably dont realize exists either the bug report fell under a stack of papers or people forgot about it  either way ill definitely be a voice for those little annoying bugs
hi corbeau i have a question regarding your proposal to eliminate ship insurancei agree with you on the concept that from a pvprs perspective a ship is a ship and if you cant afford it fly something else why should i be able to pay 100m for a ship and not lose that isk when it dies when i can pay the same for another and lose it people fly t2 cruisers that arent worth insuring for example so why should bs be any differentso my question comes at you from an indutrialist perspective the insurance value of t1 bs provided a floor to the value of the mineral basket if you could not sell your minerals you could always make a bs insure it and pop it now this is not great for the game because it floods isk into the economy but without insurance why would you pay that much isk for a bs demand would drop causing the mineral basket to drop as well this means that there would be even less point in mining for those that dont macronow i know that there is no perfect answer because its all estimation but where do you see the balance point being reached do you feel that ccps adaptive insurance change will result in this balance point being reached slowly over time ie that the insurance price will lower to sit just under the bs value which will fall to that of the insurance payout which will lower insurance again etc
what will be the carrot for low seccan u you tell us more detail
summed up and expanded the issues which i care about in one giant wall of text blog post
vote naw
you have my vote tamber 
get back to work maggot i obviously dont give you enough things to do if you have time to post in here
the following pictures are some examples of issues ideas that are on my agendacorporation shared bookmarks
my questions for youdo you happen to be related to the famous dambrevilles of good old mystarawhy do you like badgers so much is there a story behind that perhaps or are you just a fan of death badger the character on your csmtest page a really cool one btw you do have a small dominionbadgerrun pic could we get that a bit larger pleaseon a more serious note on csm4 you sadly only made it alt and even then you have been more active than i few mains as far as i can judge so thank you for that
no purely for writing all your vote are belong to me
er no  its just the theme for my current ships of eve event im not really obsessed with them medium image
hello avallocjust a quick message to offer my support to your efforts for reelectionthere has been some mention of the issues involving mining one thing that i see that i really would like to see changes or at least clarified for my own knowledge is the problem of bot miners is using a 3rd party program to run your mining ship day and night acceptable in ccps viewthe first time i lost a hulk in high sec during the first hulkageddon i was really taken by surprise it was by a very well organized hunting pack that locked me down warp scrambled me and had me sitting in my pod in under 8 seconds i wont go into the details of my emotions moments after that it has occurred to me after learning to live with it and then move on that hulkageddon is really the only true equalizer for honest miners and bot miners as a hard core industrialist with 3 mining accounts i welcomed hulkageddon 2 with open arms i watch their kill board daily hoping to see the names of the many known offenders bot mining that i see daily while mining but this still remains a ongoing problem because most bot miners dont use hulksi am not sure what the answer is do you have any suggestions or ideas on thisthanksnoceth
ccp doesnt find the use of botting acceptable and i plan to question them about their detection methods because i hear from a lot of players that mining bots a continuing problemi would like to see a system added to reward miners for being active during the mining process say add a small minigame while the lasers are hitting the rocks if you do well in the minigame youll pull in more ore than normally this would help make mining a little more interactive toothank you for your support h tecon
your getting the last of my votesgl and hope to see you in the csm again dv
actually i can hardly think of anybody better suited for the csm than a representative from eve universitynot saying that all you politics will be for the sole benefit of eve university of course
cin you got my support not just as a corp buddy but as someone who stands behind your message and ideas nice website too
would vote for old cyno effectoh and hi prom
ive known manalapan now for a couple of months hes very honest even though many think the contrary and he is also quite charitable i personally have seen him donate over 1 billion isk worth of true sansha pos to a struggling noob alliance and also several hundred million isk worth of pos structures to habitual euathanasia he has helped me personally with ship fittings and mission running as i have also seen him do for others he has great financial knowledge as he proved while running dynasty bank and also serious personal concern for the way eve progresses anyone who doesnt vote manalapan for csm not only is a daisy fresh rookie but also making the single biggest mistake of their gaming lives with the exception of one champion miner so look at what the other candidates are running for and look at the age of their characters i guarantee you will find neither a more deserving nor qualified candidate for csm manalapan you have my vote
i love the corpse launcher its exactly the sort of thing eve needs to stop it becoming bland
insti for cm5 or so i think thats what i was suposed to say p   he gives me a carrier when he gets the spot so all vote plz

so all i got from your post is you log on every once in a while shoot some npcs or mine occasionally join a fleet maybe and believe you respresent the average playerwhere is your websitewhat are the most pressing issues in evewhat do you think of the current state of 00what are your thoughts on how to revamp lowsecwhat makes you a better candidate than the other runners and why should someone vote for youit really needs a little more effort to be honest
qwhere is your website a i am not going to bother with one i would much rather play the game in my spare time than work on webpage designqwhat are the most pressing issues in eve a well from the perspective of one who has participated in fleet battles both small and large i would have to say fleet lag i really think this is an issue that need addressed before ccp moves on to some of the more grandiose plans that it has they advertise for eve by showing these grand and glorious space battles that seemingly happen all the time however i have yet to see or participate in one of these due to everything locking up hard to have a grand battle when nothing but your engines will fireqwhat do you think of the current state of 00 a eve has always been and always shall be a player run game especially in the realm of nullsec while i personally mourn the loss of the nrds system in providence being as i was a resident there i know that crap happens sometimes i dont really want to get into the politics of all that however i will say that i think the sov system as it is needs to be looked at in a little greater detail whereas it used to be too hard to take over a system now it might be a little too easy my suggestion would be to make sov blockade units a little more vulnerable than they are right now so that the attacking fleet has to put a little more effort in defending themqwhat are your thoughts on how to revamp lowsec a ah lowsec yes i think every player would like to see a little more done with it than it being the nofly zones where pirates hang out however i would not want to begrudge pirates their fun in eve either even if i do not necessarily agree with piracy myself i think it would be interesting to see concord or even empire to have a slightly more active role in lowsec being as these are their systems perhaps they should have garrisons military presence but only limited and reinforced only at downtime modified so that players can engage their forces and take them out but active garrisons that attempt to stop aggression from happening just like in hisec this would make lowsec a little safer but there would still be some risk for jumping in you dont know if a pirate fleet has been proactive enough to take out the garrison before conducting their illicit activities i think this would still retain the gamble of lowsec yet make it likely to be used more oftenqwhat makes you a better candidate than the other runners and why should someone vote for you a makes me better i dont think that i am necessarily better than any of the other candidates i am merely providing another option for voters and hoping to add another fun aspect to gameplay for myself i dont have a major agenda and i am not in this for power i would like to just be able to represent myself and others those who play the game for fun not necessarily personal or corporate galactic conquest
 what he saidtamber
its the drivel written by candidates that stops me from scrolling down limiting text to a slogan and a few bullet points would prevent a lot of bleeding eyes
this is an interesting point of view but sovereignty gives some advantages that i list here in order of importance1 outpost and conquerable station docking rights2 jump bridges and cynojammers3 reduction of pos fuel consumption4 spercapital building rightsfrom my point of view its right to have big battles for these objectives thus big battles must be there and always will even if its hard to do we must find a way to split the engagements into smaller ones with sort of battlegrounds i disagree with mazziliu and think that my proposal could work is the numbers and details are tuned i encourage the new csm candidates to have a look at my analysis of which i am very proud and sure you may dislike the proposal i make but i am confident that the analysis i do is correct
please come forward with ideas because neither us nor ccp could think of any fair ones in the limited time available for discussion of this topic

every time graphics updates get added either in the form of art assets or engine updates you find a bunch of trollsmorons clamoring to fix teh lag first coding graphics engines and creating art assets are discliplines which are largely unrelated to attacking the network latency process scheduling and database bottlenecks that are most likely at the root of the lag issue point being that pushing on this issue is unlikely to steal resources from other hottopic issuesi believe its an easy sell to ccp the graphics engine is showing a lot of rough edges jaggies due to its age and is turning off a number of potential new players and the tiny font used everywhere is starting to become a big problem when people have 10 laptop screens with 1080p resoultion ui changes are a big part of my campaign because ui design is interfering with peoples ability to play the gamehowever you should also be aware that some of the effects you describe are not things you see in deep space when youre 10 au from a g type star the shadows arent soft theyre very harsh and dark too black as a piece of coal at midnight on a moonless night as an astronomer id like to see proper hdr implemented so that when youre sitting next to the sun or low over a bright planet that those stars and nebula fade away below the sensitivity of your visual dynamic range
you are right of course soft shadows should be used where appropriately for example a temperate planet close to a star with think atmosphere would have soft shadows on its surface because light is scattered and diffused in the atmosphere sun should also fade because at the moment it is the same size mo matter if you are 1 au or 100 au from it clearly therre needs to be a differencecould you please provide me with a link to your campaign i am interested
back when i was working in astronomy i spent a lot of spare time doing concept cgi for my research i would spend forever trying to get planetary lighting effects right in povray i ended up patching the povray code to make it use double precision floating point for the final pixel values so that i could do proper postprocessing on my videos
this is how you sell aa and a font change if you can get the beancouters to think they can get more money or keep less if it from leaving then you will find that the technical issues become moot
this is my blog posting covering the rest of of my campaign issues should you feel inclined to support me im not just about teaching 5 year old kids how to play eve
you people can parade around these forums playing epolitics all you want every single person that plays this game knows lag is the biggest issue that affects the most people every single day i have 5 votes now which one of you is going to grow a pair and tackle this issue head on to prove my point think of how different pvp would be without the lag  without lag you dont have to cycle guns that means things die a lot faster and more of them yes carebears that means you sell more ships and mods  you actually get to load systems and carry out your intentions to fight  campaigns in 00 actually move forward instead of stalemating because the enemy got in system first more sov structures pos and ships die again good for the economy all the people in fw can actually enjoy large fleet engagements and rp themselves to death  your precious little mission hubs in highsec will run smoother  you station hugging war deccers wont blackscreen when you undock the list is endless and affects everyone its quite obvious ccp agrees with me due to their mass testing to identify what causes the lag issues so i ask again whos going to represent the paying customer and team up with ccpcsm and make our gaming experience more enjoyable
someone who has never fired blasters in actual combat has no place trying to theorycraft their changesedit in clarification this sums up one of the main reasons anyone who pvps in this game shouldnt vote for her
lol gotta love the hatesome people take  far too seriously
see bottom of first post 
any candidate who promises to get lag fixed is simply saying what you want to hear to get voted inshocking revelation im sure firstly ccp are already working on the issues caused by dominion and reducing lag in general so nothing the csm say will get it done any faster at csm4 summit we were shown graphs and things to say what they were working on but those havent been made public yetsecondly most candidates are going to agree that lag needs to be worked on constantly including myself to make the game better however all the csm can do is add one more voice to the already deafening crowd telling ccp that lag is badlastly the sad fact is that there is always going to be a maximum number of players that can participate in a single fight before lag hits and whilst that number grows so does the potential number of participants gameplay changes to reduce the needwill to just throw more people into system are the only long term way to halt the spread but that means artificial limitations and goes against the sandbox so have to be carefully consideredit is not a matter of csm growing a pair because only ccp know how their server and client code are reacting csm can raise ideas from players as to how to tackle it and then lag will get put on the agenda so it can be discussed at the iceland summits ccp will take it from there whilst the csm spend the rest of their candidacy looking at other issuesi would be happy to raise lag related issues but i wont promise to fix it because it is not in my power to do so if that isnt good enough for your votes then so be it
i asked for the csm to team up with ccp and find a solution not claim to fix it by themselves we all know ccp completely drops the ball on their own quite often what they need is the csm to be the voice of reason and bring common sense to the situation i think we can all agree a lot of the people working there arent the brightest something you see that is a simple fix they may not recognize right away because theyre drowning themselves in code or whatever they do to confuse themselves oh and this 24 hrs to reinforce systems is crap but im not even going to get into that
i wonder how many csm candidates have turned up on sisi to help during the fleet lag testing thats one of the concrete things that csm candidated could be doing to fix lag rather than making empty promises
black ops need some very specific boostif you have ever been in a sb gang you would know that 95 of time you spend making bookmarks black ops should be specialized ship for sb gang commander with particular functions for managing sb gang as faster sb deployment  ie faster creation of bookmarks for fleet members more accurate sb deploument  ability to warpfleet warp at distance to moving targetsships cov ops cloak is a must no need for high dps  dps will come from sb fleet
lolwut youre confusing resists with ehp i think 1 ehp of a 100k tank would be 1k more effective hit points how is that going to matter when youre getting hit by 400000dmg in alpha strike thats going to give you an extra microsecond no youre pretty wrongthen you might as well add lag back into the equation which brings dps back into the equation as the dominant arbitrating force because the team that is doing more damage alpha or dps will destroy more ships faster and win in this extremely simplistic hypothetical engagement that still has utterly no bearing on the op youve clearly put alot of effort into this but at this point im going to leave you with the last word because its quite clear youve forrest gumped the argument and run off the pitch and onto some train tracks
a 1 increase in ehp will require 1 more dps to kill you within the same time frame whether that timeframe is a millisecond or tenif your targets have 100k ehp and youre doing a 400000 alpha strike then 75 of your dps is pointless clearly you only needed 100k alpha and you have 400k anything over the 100k alpha is then wastedif youre saying that omg the alpha is so high that their hit points never matter then at the same time omg the alpha is so high that our dps doesnt matter either if you add lag back into the equation then that reduces the effectiveness of your dps just as much as it reduces the effectiveness of your hit pointsas for the opit appears as we can see from page 6the ops posts on it near the top that the op thinks that battleship engagement range within 50km is what were discussing and that for some strange reason he thinks acs can reasonably hit that far without tes and is a valid scope that it makes sense to talk about the blaster problemsthis is to say that the strength of railguns is within the scope of blaster problems and that makes this discussion relevanti mean hell this is taken directly from the opthe fact of the matter is thisyou dont know what youre doing you dont know why there is a problem with blasters and you cannot hope to fix it before you educate yourself about the game that youre playingblasters have not fallen in strength since their heyday other weapons have not seen significant advancements that would put them out of commission in the heyday of blasters 45km scorch still existed and the geddon still had 8 low slots and 5 heavy drones in the heyday of blasters vagabonds still outranged and outsped deimos in the heyday of blasters the rupture was still better than the thorax in the heyday of blasters the tempest still had its versatility and range advantages over the mega in the heyday of the blaster you were still better off in a nanodominone of that changed what changed was how people play the game and blasters will never be what you want them to be until people stop playing the game the way they do now and they forget the knowledge that led them to make other choicesthat last bit is a little harsh there are boosts that can make blaster boats good again but they dont have to do with damage or tracking or web speed or ab boosts or any other sorts of convoluted junk they have to do with making blaster ships proficient at prosecuting solosmall gang pvp and with systems that encourage those types of gangs to existyou would know this if you bothered to read the paper that i pointed you towards but you dont because you dont seem interested in actually fixing the problem you seem interested in getting a cookie after which youre going to  that it wasnt as sweet as it ought to have been
im not sure what heyday you are talking about but before changes to siege launchers added hps to all ships projectile ammo and clips changes to tracking enhancers before nanos first came aroundyou know back then blasters rocked
goumi is correct that these things were around back in the heyday of blasters minus the ruppy being better than the rax to some degree that is subjective they both wereare good boats at different play stylesbut to be perfectly fair in our dissimination of informationbase emexp resistances got changed only a nerf to gallente as hybrids dont shoot either type but they do have drones so its not that drasticso long as you are in the situations where drone use is truely viableduring that same patch amarr got a 15dmg boost in addition to the resist change this may have been to lg guns onlyi forget tbh90 webs were nerfed yes a webd ruppy was still faster than a webd rax prior to the nerf however the speeds at which a ruppy could drift into falloff if caught meant that more dmg could be applied this is coupled with the fact that at close range the speed while faster than a rax was not sufficient to cause blasters tracking issuessince the heyday where according to goumi the ruppy was better than the raxprojectiles have recived boosts to dmg and trackingimo blastersrails are not omgcrappy in reality however the power creep that has occured leaves them slightly lacking even under prime conditions for thier use they do not need large buffs to be competative
1 changes to tracking enhancers boosted blasters relative to lasers and missiles also boosted acs more but that advantage was irrelevant2 adding hp to ships makes blaster ships better not worse any time you extend the length of fights you increase the strength of high damageshort range weapons3 nanos didnt come around they were always there people just did not understand how strong they were this doesnt have as large an effect as you would think on the viability of lasers compared to blasters in the area where blasters could have an advantagemainly it served to make scorch better but scorch isnt typically used in small fights as much as it is in larger onesexcept as an opener in those instances lasers were better anyway for the sphere of influence of blasters the changes were much smaller since it was dampened by the thermal damage on mf and dronesthis simply did not happen there was no strict damage boost to amarr for any weapons there was a tracking boost a big one but that had little effect on applied damage intra class and even with relative tracking blasters have a big advantagethe drift on webs has nothing to do with the amount it slows you down if they were drifting out of web after then theyre drifting out of web after the rupture was not better than the rax simply because of webs the rupture was better simply because it was better at everything that the rax didbonuses to damage and falloff yes not bonuses to trackingbonuses to ammo you wont ever use does not increase your trackingthe laser changes that made a differencewith respect to the strength of blasters was really the boost to the zealot from a 4 turret ship that was worthless to a 5 turret ship that had a role the omen also got boosted but it wasnt really enough to make it not ty the reason that amarr battleships were good after was not because they got boosted but because they were good beforethe issue is that people have realized that that play style that the rax occupied is weak not that it was not weak beforeif you got rid of all the laser and ac changesbarring the zealot people would still prefer pulse ships and ac ships over blaster ships people do not realize why this is the case and cannot reconcile that choosing a race should be about choosing what you want to do rather than changing their choice of race to do what they want is why none of these solutions will fix anything or will break more in the processits why the blanket laser changes were bad its why the blanker projectile changes were bad and it will be why blanket blaster changes will be bad if they go through
i am going to briefly throw myself into this verbal melee while im good and drunkall of the fcs that i know will opt to go overkill and launch all 400k of that dps at on target rather than waste time wondering how much of a tank the enemy ships have or many of hisher ships will be needed to kill each one of the enemys and call separate targets for different squads etc so yeah once you go over a certain amount of people on either side of a battle im talking more than 100 on either side then unless you are in a capital any tank is pretty much worthlessonce you bring those numbers down to something more sane say 20 on 20 then ehp becomes a vastly bigger factorthat said i do wonder what this has to do with blasters good sir i took the liberty of checking your killboard you have never once used a gallente ship or blasters or railguns for that matter all you have every flown have been amarr laserboats and riftersthis leads me to conclude that you have been using eft numbers this whole time and have no real experience in actually using them in a real combat environmenti invite you to try flying nothing but thoraxes brutixes and megathrons for a month using only hybrid weapons let us see how well you farehowever blasters and hybrids in general have not been given any buff either not like the other weapon systemsplayer choices were also fueled in part by changes made the game as well they go handinhand when lasers were buffed people realized that in exchange for a 10 to 15 decrease in damage they could fire at 3x the range of blasters and completely avoid the 10km zone of death and if anyone got too close to their medium range laserboats scramweb them and tracking no longer an issueive said it before ill say it again as eve grows and gains new players solo combat will become rarer and rarer why because people find safety in numbers its human nature i call it the herd effect and even if you try to artificially prevent this people will find ways around it always have always will this leaves gallente boats in a odd situation as they are technically geared towards small scalesolo combatso you are right in that fixing blasters andor hybrids in general wont fix things with the game overall but it is simpler to tinker with one weapon systems and to see what happen rather than to screw with an entire lineup of ships much less the game mechanics themselves and none will guarantee anything
i want to take a little bit of time to explain why this might be trueimagine for a second a game that looks like so p1 and p2 are the players c and h are the choices and xy represents the payoffs to player 1 and player 2 p2 c hp1 c 00 11 h 11 00such that if player 1 chooses c and player 2 chooses c each person has a payoff of 0now in this situation the obvious choice to do the best is to choose h if payoffs are changed such that the game now looks like so p2 c hp1 c 00 12 h 21 00the obvious choice is still to choose h this is what the changes to lasers and acs largely were the problem was that before the changes people were not seeing the game as i described above but were seeing the game as if it was advantageous to choose c only after the changes did they realize that h was the better choice even though h was a better choice all alongthis is roughly what has happened herei mean before the laser changes what were the problems with lasers if i was to be believed the problems lay in issues with downfitting capacitor use for new players the ease of fitting omni tanks and the fact that the subbs ships sucked assharbinger excludedi have certainly changed my views since then i have become more in favor of boosting cruisers in radical ways i have given up on the whole making lasers not totally suck for newer players thing and i care less about omni tanksand their effect on minmatar or amarr for a variety of reasonsbut the point still stands the changes to lasers that went through had little effect on the strength of laser shipsprobably only really having an effect of boosting the harbinger relative to others it did not boost the things that needed to change omen prophecy maller punisher etc still suck because those things even after the changes were not good enough to reasonably use and did boost the things that didnt need to be changed anyone saying that the abaddon or geddon needed to have more true dps was smoking illicit substancesthe same can be said for minnie and the projectile changes did the rupture rifter vagabond and hurricane really need range expansion and damage increases did the tempest maelstrom and typhoon could changes to the maelstrompest have been made to make the mael a better sniper and the pest a better ac ship without boosting the rest of the ships yea i bet that could have happened but it didnt and its because people whether good intentioned or not keep thinking that they can just change damage and tracking on a whole class of items and make things good againthis is what blanket changes to blastersrailguns will be if you do it you will just be setting up the next stupid whine about how some other weapon system is underpoweredprobably still blasters frankly
the point was that both tank and damage is pretty much worthless in that situation since you have so much overkill anyway neither mattersbut eventually it will matter as you say and when it does they both matter and they both matter in the method that i describedand you think that would change if you just increased their weapon strength yea it would not also blasters are after missiles medium acs and recons blasters dont fit my play style and probably wont for quite a while not an issue with them per se as it is me making a choice even if they were boosted as you want i would not choose themeasier to tinker with themno its much harder to tinker with them than it is to tinker with individual ships when you tinker with one ship one thing in the system changes that youre simply doing it 34 times doesnt matter when you tinker with weapons everything in the system changes even what you dont want to changeits actually much easier to change the system to encourage people to fight in smaller groups than you think but if you want to do that you might have to attempt to understand how people make choices relating to how large their gangs are the link in my sig might be informative to that point
agreed blasters hould be upgradedall i am saying is the blaster need some serious tweaking to bring it in line with other turret type weapons
i miss the omg that megathron is approaching memomentssupportet blaster dps boost need for closefacemelting weaponnot supportet range boost no need for another midrange weapon
sorry to say it but that time is over long time agoyou wont see a blaster mega like that againthe reason for it is the few hp boosts that ccp have donebut still i can still feel a little like that when im facing a neutron mega in my dual 650mm tempest so its still scary in that way
blasters need change  more damagetracking less rangedeimos needs more ehp to make it alive during approach to target
sure a neutron mega isnt that funny sitting next to u and firing away but not much scarier than an abaddon or a raven examples which both have that bbqsphere of the mega but bigger ones i just think mega and other blaster platforms should be much more of a threat when in optimal than other mid range ships
well when we are talking mega vs tempest here then in fact the mega is 5 times more scary than the abaddon is to my tempest simply because the em and the thermal resists on the tempest is quite high and the abaddon doesnt do much damage to me then its the same with other ships that takes em and thermal damagesthis is tested many times im not even scared to 2x ravens that shoot em torps because last time that happened i tanked both of them since my em resist is pretty high so i tanked them with 1x lar ii
with the new insurance in next expansion it is possible that the rokh will be even more costly vs apocrailgunsships already badthis would completly eliminate rokhs from the fleets hopefully in the following winter expansion ccp will fix this issue too
1 rokhs arent more costly vs apocs2insurance changes are unlikely to do anything of the sort ccp is shooting for 100 insurance of tech 1 ships
1only if you buy the hullinsure it fully and loose it before insurance endsrokh costs more minerals to produce less rokhs from the same amount of minerals that means it is more costlyeven if you get back the same amount of iskif you dont insure it for full it costs moreif you dont loose it before insurance is over it costs moreif youyour corp produce it it costs more minerals2 insurance currently you buy the rokh pay 30 of its full insurance value  it gets blown up you get 100 insurance valuerokh examplerokh cost 1145m in jita 495m for full insurance30164m and you get back 165m in insurance  you have 1m isk after you blow it upafter expansionin the dev blog it says they will change the 100 insurance value to actual market price lvl with current it is 115mso after expansionyou buy it 1145m  insure it for full 30115m345m and get back 115m  you loose 34mso around 30 of its market valuse and as apoc cost 80m vs 115m rokh the insurance difference will be around 10mso that more a rokh would costat least this is what i get to from that dev blog we can see it fully after the expansion is outfrom dev blog  we have our own ideas for how much of the full insurance value we want to payout for each ship class which generally is 100 for tech 1 ship groups 2060 for tech 2 and 100 for tech 3 ships those this is only a portion of the value of the entire ship since subsystems are not included currently however we are interested in your feedback on what you think they should be for each ship class and why andyes ship insurance will now revalue itself periodically based on a trimmed mean of the ships manufacturing materials global market weighted average pricesbtw what ccp should do is drop the stupid tier system it is wrong in most ways
the cost of the minerals is aggregated into its market price if the final price you pay after insurance is not more then the mineral costs are not significantly more there is no reason to not fully insure a fleet shipyour rokh is likely to last longer than apocs for various reasons this means that if youre doing cost by time comparisons the rokh will always look bettermineral market costs but yes either way expect prices to adjust such that their real price after insurance is the samealso at 10m for the hull you just about make up the extra cost of ammodue to crystals for the apoc so youre still even
make rails rock
wow you really dont have a clue what your talking about do you loljust so you know goum the 100 payout is after you pay for the insurance which means the return is 100cost ccp is aiming for zero insurance fraud and a player based market not 100 total return and a mineral floor like we have right nowthis means that cheaper more useful ships will be even better after the insurance revamp and limited role ships will fall even further into obscurity

there are easier and far less intrusive ways to detect macros than to scan the entire computer for macro softwarea macro will repeat on the exact same time cycle as someone pointed out earlier regarding a jita scammer the clicks will happen on the same pixel of the client every time and so onat some point a macro miner needs to unload their cargo hold all you do is start a timer when they do so and count the exact time to the next command and what that next command is if the time gap is always the same and the next command is always the same then youve got a macro issuing the commandsmacro miners might respond by making more complicated macros that rotate through different time gaps in unloading the cargo hold but eventually it will repeat and given that all youre tracking per unload is the number of milliseconds and what the next command is you can easily store a sequence of 10000 pauses after unloading and easily scan for the kind of repetition that indicates a macro is being used once you suspect that a macro is being used and know the repetition cycle you can go through and record time gaps between each keystroke and each mouseclick the specific pixel of each click and so on in order to get whatever level of proof you feel comfortable with in order to ban the playerall of which can easily be built into the client
i have to disagree here  i fully agree about banning rmts but not that macro miners dont matter either macro use is within the bounds of the game and therefore a legitimate activity available to all players or it is notmacro users all kinds including miners ratters missioners traders and scam spammers have access to income that is not available to players who stick to the game rules it gives them an advantage over others because their extra income will mean they are more able to sustain economic losses buy more expensive equipment take more risks and spend more time doing whatever they want with less concern for cost in iskwhen i reference game rules im not talking about concords rules of operation suicide ganking piracy scams etc  these are all within the bounds of the game and there are ingame consequences for them that apply across the boardan example is a player player x who has a macro ratter running belts in an empty 00 system x will have enough income to pay for plex for two accounts and lose many ships so every second they are online x can afford to go out roaming lownull empire wardeccing and generally blowing up other peoples stuff without first having to make isk in some legitimate wayin the meantime xs targets may engage x but their ship losses need to be paid for somehow so they have to spend their time rattingminingmissioningtrading while all the macro user has to do is source another ship to go back and griefharassso my main concern is that all players are playing the same game with the same rulesboundaries and the same restrictionsconstraints whatever those rulesboundaries restrictionsconstraints may be
i very much like this idea have not read the ops suggestion from the other thread yet will have to comment on that one too as far as a secondary process eating up your performance   2x512 sticks of ram are getting pretty cheap might be time to upgrade and for the privacy crap i cant seem to figure you guys out what do you have to hideand for the others who think nonmacro programs will get them banned 4 lifeive filed numerous petitions with ccp during my 6 years playing this game i have also received a 100 response and positive feedback from these petitions in 100 of these situations i was contacted and the situation was resolved if for some reason you are worried that you will be locked out and not talked to forever youre wrong just remember to save the profanity for the wife and kids and keep the petition civil
sarcasmlogging every single keystroke and mouseclick wont have any performance hit at allsarcasmive been shown runescape by a mates kid and it will show you very clearly where this line of thinking leads torunescape is a game that is so amazingly boring and so full of grinding that the only way to play it is with a macroto combat this the developers cycle colours make ui elements random sizes and generally make their game the most horrible looking thing ever madeall so they can make it a challenge a challenge that attracts more people who want to beat itthis whole antimacro evangelist bull is what ruins games with poor features designed to get in the waylet me guess your next suggestion is minigames that popup midmining and ask you to fix the overheating coils of your mining laserso fun way to ruin eve
dear pilotsi am fresh in new eden and the first time i show a big mining op i was amazed this is what i want to be a miner hard descent jobwhen i realize that the most big miners was robots clones or toons as some people call them i saw that it was useless to follow that profession i really dont know what csm can do for that but maybe total punishment from concord to the fake capsuleer should be the answerpunishment always work its in the nature of human kindim sure that those technical guys can find a trick to catch those clonesfly safe

as the thread op a couple quick comments for everyone to kick aroundthat comment is pretty much like being a hospital administrator and hearing that this other hospital found a cure for cancer but they are a competitor so we dont want it sort of missing the bigger pictureso you buy the software designed to specifically exploit the eula just because youve got a ton of free space on that hard drive and youre trying to fill it up not sure about that sure there are some resources that would get tied down but youre assumption of continuous or long time is probably a bit extreme if i were ccp id probably want it to run randomly maybe once or twice a week as a spot check even if something like this were to take up resources im hard pressed to believe it would be anything but nominal and infrequent making it random wouldnt shut them down all in day one but over a period of a couple months youd see macros evaporateyoure free to keep the software installed ccp is not going to send you a nasty letter and tell you to deinstall any piece of software you legally paid and purchased a license for that being said you have a choice in playing the game but if youre installing software your computer designed to cheat that game ccp has a choice as well and thats terminating your account its a two way streetbest regardsjava
1 conversion should be into a single bpc with sufficient runs on it to be put into continuous production for roughly that length of time this would require eliminating software caps to the number of production runs on t2 bpc items which wouldnt be an issue since the only way to get them in the future would be invention obviously all bpos for the same item should be converted into bpcs with the same number of runs regardless of pe level of the specific bpo2 i think me on the bpc should remain the same as the original bpo me is an important aspect of the bpos and expensive to research for every day you spend researching me youre not building itemswith the caveat that i would prefer to see those things supported
ive only seen this one thread by emo tj and im suspecting a troll particularly with the no more contentcounter points just support this posts however im going to give the benefit of the doubt and presume ignorance insteadstealth bombers are excellently balanced they have times where they excel and also times when they crumble in nanoseconds there are ships that stealth bombers are deadly against big ships or ships in clusters and there are ships that will tear them apart anything that can target and tackle them quickly particularly if they prop with abs and provide significant risk to sb pilotsin short stealth bombers have strengths and weaknesses  this is the epitome of balanceif youre serious and not a troll i would suggest you start making some productive counterpoints to the many points that have been made against your proposalalso please note that i am in the nc and love sbs and their counters the way they are
does a bomber in real life sit over its target for ages and fly around in circles lollingno it does its bombing run drops its payload and gets the  out of dodgei fail to see your point
if you fit to be super fast locker then you do not have enough hit points to survive the bomb and lets not forget they always fit stabs so that means you need to have enough alpha to pop it in one shot this means more damage mods and thus less hit pointsbasically your dead one way or another but wait let me guess i still have not provided some reasons or something to make a valid argument please keep spinning this and trying to derail my thread you are simply bringing more attention to this over powered ship and more and more people are realizing itplease give more thumbs up people
i do not see any stabs on any of the stealth bombers that died in the incident that spurred this proposalyou only have 1 thumb up and thats from some guy who wants to do the opposite that another guy is doing youre right you haventlet me impart some advice that was given to another guy who spammed proposals here in the assembly hall by avoiding our arguments and continuing on as if we said nothing you do not do your proposal justice
ops proposal is dumb this proposal is not supportedim not gonna even bother wasting resources explaining why
we will be allowed to interact with planets soon in all areas i think we should be allowed to have a lite version of sovereignty in hi sec where we can use jump bridges as well as harvestersmoving stuff from 00lowsec to hi sec is all fine but smaller corps  alliances dont have a chance at this i would like to experience moon harvesting without going into unsafe spaceplus it makes sense to have jump bridges this will allow us to jump past those 05 suicide ganking systems ofc standings should applythe only things i dont think should happen are cyno generators and cyno jammers it wouldnt make any sense not sure about refineries but dont have a problem with them
and i was wondering who would be our troll this week dont feed the trolls
as it stands now hi sec moons are useless how is it we get to interact with the planets take resources from the planets but cant from the moonsstandings are easy to get with isk so lets say we change the way standings work and have the corp standings decay if the player with excellent standings leave this should apply to faction onlythis way only high standing corps will be allowed to deploy poses a nice risk reward lets also make it so you need 9 faction standing to get special stuff like jump bridgeas it stands now moons super caps and sov stuff are the only things that make hi sec stand out from 00 this will attract more players and we will also be able to play with new stuffthis shouldnt affect 00 and will encourage pos warfare in 00 something most people miss since dominion
buried in amongst all that waffling was a proposal to allow us to use harvesters in high sec i assume you meant moon harvesting arraysand yet you dont think this will impact lowsecnullsec at alli think weve found emo tjs new alt
people miss pos warfaremind you  maybe look at the war between nc and sc and check how many towers die theremoons in highsec arent useless starting from 07 you can put up posses for researchin lowsec you can start moon mining and reactions starting with 03 and belowand in 00 you get all the sov goodiesa natural progressionyou want to get more from it you got to risk more
im not saying we should be able to harvest more moon goo than lowsec  00 but at least allow us to do this with limited resources like r16s at best and just increase the charter requirementsnot sure what message you get when you try to anchor  online one but whats is the point of not allowing these in hi sec doesnt harm anyonee hisec isnt always safe theres gankers etc someone sees a pos in your cargo while you are on autopilot you will get ganked knowing that theres more use for ind ships now because of pos items will make hisec more dangerousplus you could always war dec someone
you cant anchor moon harvester and reactors in anything above 03 so not even all of lowsec allows moon mining
and im sure the message or reason it says it pretty odd too yes
fypagainyoure the reason they invented birth control ingamesystems are already jammed by their respective empires and refineries are controlled by npc corps you nubbinterrible troll is terrible post on a main already derek chu

i also support b  many poses are held and run by individuals and dont need to alert everybody in a directors position when theyre lowa could also be a configurable option and removal of mails altogether isnt such a good idea im all for customizable configuration
not a bad idea they do get annoying but you need to think a little differently hereinstead of limiting status mails to 24hours and 1hour make a bunch of options like 1 2 4 8 12 24 hours and you can configure the tower or the pos management window like your idea in c on which countdowns you would like this would let people that kind of like the constant reminder and can still get it but those that are ed off by it can turn it off
i too pay for my account by plex but with credit card as a backupit would be great to not have to keep checking up to determine whether or not i need to buy plex cause it would be annoying if i had the isk available for plex but my credit card got charged because i had been busy enjoying the game rather than constantly checking up on the logistics of account managementeither make it easy on us wrt notificationsreminders or make the game less engaging and fun i know which i prefer so supported
looks more like pl voted for this so the whole thing gets on the ccp tables they seem to be pretty sure that the monkey has not used a cheat but i am pretty sure that if he has killed mostly macros and ccp will investigate close a lot of bans for bot users are in the pipline seems pl even owned the botterclub in the way of political warefare yoy
confirming that those wanting a balanced implementation are pussies
since when is refusal to change statusquo considered wanting a balanced implementationthats like the republicans on healthcaremy argument was against people who want to do nothing
perhaps if you read dejas post instead of spewing mindless and childish insults youd have noticed he is actually for a change of the status quo he even goes as far as suggesting an idea which you simply refute with bah yur a  instead of adding to it or being somewhat more open a change like this needs balance whether you like it or not
i have read his post carefully again i see no proposal for change i only see a refusal for changethis is exactly the republican defense strategy  deny everything create an illusion of alternative plan never show it to anyone refuse to cooperate stallif you manage to come up with a balanced proposal thats not meant to be unattainable for hope of failure ill apologize for being too cynical
signed
its funny that you keep bringing up republicanism to attack those that disagree with youbut think about it who are the ones wanting to play cowboy shooting everyone without regards to anyone else or without balance who are the ones that are willing to make  go their way without concern on what the majority of players think or without concern on how it might affect the overall health of the game who are the players that usually resort to insulting and demeaning someone for proposing an idea even remotely championing carebearism you got it thats you the real repuclicans of the game you are the elite cowboys that dont give a  about anyone else but yourselvesmore on topic to remove local would require a helluva boost to the directional scanner defensively increasing the value of belt ores isnt always the solution the scanner as it is is already broken to begin with pushing a change like this will just make things worse propose a change for the scanner that can compliment and bring balance to the removal of local and im onboard
as a compromise perhaps there could be some kind of indicator of how many are in local just a small number on the overview controls or something at least then youd know if local was empty and not worth effort to look for targets
spot on matrix maybe the elits should stfu and go to wh space and stuck there if that is so goodbtw have you noticed that none of the supporters actually get their isk from beltsanoms in 00low sec
remove local put dscan on automatic mode ie autorefresh every 5 seconds if auto checkbox ticked also scanner should not show ship type only its signature radius so you never know if youre warping into a carrier or just an mwding battleship
to everyone supporting this if the dscanner is fixed you do realise bellum didnt include improvements to that in his proposal right that youre giving a thumbsups to the proposal of ditching local with no dscanner change
lolyeah heres me full of fear1111 i said i support the concept of it because i agree it would be fun read im not scared i simply said i do not think the game in its current state will support a reasonable implementation of what is being requestednice pooflinging though that was impressive
and do you also believe that a couple new nolocal 00 regions should not be added because if you cant enjoy them nobody else can
i dont believe i even discussed that possibility in any way it wasnt proposed in the opi doubt seriously ccp would ever do it but i certainly wouldnt care if they didthe op put forth the notion that all 00 and lowsec should have delayed local because it works in wspace thats about as fallacious an argument as youre likely to find on the subject of delayed local in 00lowsec that is what i have commented about nothing more dial back the froth take a chill pill and quit assuming things about me you dont know me what i like or what i want to the extent i think its necessary and germane to the topic at hand ill provide such information
i cant believe i am even posting in this thread but absolutely not you cant be biased against how people want to play the game what if ccp and its intese love for pvp said everyone with a possible sec status had to pay more for their subscription it is a terrible idea
010this is sadshould be banned
made me laugh good troll

electronic attack frigs are pretty much a weaker version of the recon ships and uses the same set of skills apart from its electronic attack frig skill rather than the covert ops skill  reoon ship skilli think rather than having them as a seperate ship type they should be counted as a third covert ops ship including changing the skill needed to fly them to covert ops also as they are so similer to recon ships apart from being smaller and weaker they should be given the option of using a covert ops cloak and be able to use a black ops jump portal this would give covert ops team ecm support in the form of frigs rather than the larger ships
while i support this initiative i disagree that the skill should be changed i would also be amenable to them simply fixing the ships to not suck so bad even the comparatively awesome sentinel is really really sucks its important to remember that these ships are frigates  and an oversize fat frigate is a dead frigate i dont even care how they fix eafsliang
instead of giving them the covops cloak how about giving them more base hitpoints so they arent as flimsy as they are atm
no they should notif you want a cloaky surprise  option then skill for it and pay a hundred mil
yeah as marlona used to say  covert ops is not the answer to fix every broken ship in the game a small ehp buff to move them a bit closer to afs might be nice
already being addressedthe vast majority of suicideganks are done in bss where the bs pilots get back most of their investment by the insurance systemtyrannis is changing the insurance system and is reducing payouts on battleships devblogthat will make it more expensive to perform suicideganks and hence less profitablehow much will this change things we wont find out until a few months after release some of it depends on the degree of payout reduction the mineralprice recalculation will certainly reduce payouts and it remains to be seen how much of an additional ship class based reduction there will bewill it be enough of a change maybethe only reasonable thing to do with this issue is to wait to see how the tyrannis changes impact the situation and revisit the issue in several months
and exactly where in that same 1 month old devblog does it say anything about battleships at all let alone nerfing insurance or r u just being a tool
for the reading disabledso ship insurance will be marked to marketyes ship insurance will now revalue itself periodically based on a trimmed mean of the ships manufacturing materials global market weighted average prices this means the insurance quote when you are buying insurance will be now estimated and may change if the payout occurs during the next insurance periodmeaning no more payouts which are larger then the market cost of the minerals which is why some t1 ships are close to freecurrently you have the situation where insurance payoutinsurance cost is roughly the same to the market price of the ship which makes the ship free which will no longer be the case throwing bs around will now definitely cost some isk most likely around 15m per bs or 20m per bs
no the real newb here is you recycling alts is definitely against the rules and every suicide ganker knows this i certainly know this but you do not gee thats telling the recently boosted artillery make a perfect suicide ganking weapon a tempest can one shot any mack and most hulks checkout hulkageddon tons of the kills were made by solo bssb attacks happen often in highsec by 10 players since they dont have time to wait for targets then need to smartbomb whatever is there i am not sure what you are smoking but no one is going to throw 3 bs to suicide shuttles if the bs costs you 20m or more each to suicide im not even sure what a macro shuttle hauler is have you played this game you haul stuff in shuttles with a macro rightthere are a few groups that do suicide in groups of t1 cruisers and t1 destroyers and the like and they will be the cheapest to operate and they will not be affected much but dont kid yourself a lot of the suicide gankers are t1 bs and t1 bc right now and the cost for suicide ganking in those is going way up this is really basic logic but if the cost goes up people are either going to stop do it less be more choosy about their targets all of these result in less frequency of suicide attackthanks for playing but i know far more about this subject than you ive done it all baby
i had to laughon subjectless payout for bs may reduce them being used for babyganks on barges and such stuff but you dont need them for this anywaystill it matters little for freighter and mission runner ganks as it has been said a few posts before if a bs costs you 1520 mil you might think twice before popping a 50 mil industrial but it makes virtually not difference on the bigger stuffthats why i too support the simply with concord no insurance proposal thereby its still lucrative to gank the juicy targets but at least the loot fairy has a say in it also still no one is save in highsec but the possibility that there is a real reason behind a suicide gank other than the laughs and 100 chance to make profit hopefully increases
virtually no difference cool story bro
elaborate but let me do it for you with one exampleone corp with at most 10 bs gank another bs overkill scenario mostly 5 are sufficient their last 12 skills executed in the last 2 weeks made between 14 and 4840mil with an average of 1bil per kill values according to battleclinic investment per char after insurancenow 5milafter 20milUFFFDreturn through loot per char and kill100milthat translates into a decrease of profit from 95mil to 80mil per kill wow what im saying with virt no difference is thats its still a nobrainercome to think of it now that i actually did the math for the first time anyone willing to pair up and suicide a bit
it just simply means that ppl wont be making a profit from buying a ship insuring it then selfdestructing it for a profit and no matter how that ship was gonna get blown up the net cost even with a reduced payout will be the same because in that case it was already cheaper to begin with anyway but hey way to talk out of your ass especially with your imaginary numbers just like another tool who also tried that same exact crap
would have to see the killmail on this one i note the op has disapeared from the thread and has only made 4 or 5 posts ever and dosent know the name of his alliance matei would like to see this out of interest as a jf has more structure shield and armor to start off with then a normal freighter and geta a 10 bonus to hp per jump freighter levelthis makes it a very tough hitter in highsec i would like to see how many bs were used to kill it he also claims only one agressor got a standings drop whut and when he claims that his mate lost a billion isk in credits the split between the amount of pilots needed to kill the ship would be penuts basically im calling bs on the opskunk
i like how you all are saying that concord isnt meant to protect its meant to punishthat wasnt always the case concord are the police were the police and would turn up lightening fast and protect however even if there has been this change in roles concord arent punishing anyone there is no major loss for the pirates doing the ganking they get their insurance go by more ships and do it all againi think that a insurance contract should be null and void if the ship is destroyed by concord ie the contract expires but pays nothing back to the player if it was concord that blew them up its not unreasonable to say or do that you think if someone gets in a high speed chase with the police and is forced to run your car off the road thus totaling it do you really think the insurance company pays for the car to be replaced in that instance no of course not
trollskunk
in order to make pos work less of a headache i propose the followinganyone with starbase configuration role can remotely transfer things around in the pos for example be able to transfer isotopes to the pos fuel bay from the corp hanger or maybe other items from the corp hanger to other anchored things at the pos like guns and such i will say that you should not have the ability to move things out of pos modules to the corp hanger to prevent people from remote stront timing a pos they could introduce a new skill that dictates how close you have to be in order to remotely do a transfer
i would love this so very very much i dont expect itll happen though  im 99 sure theres something in the festering mass that is pos code preventing it from working like this still i wants it and yeah im supporting an emo tj thread god help us all
throws a big stone at herschel
am i the only one that is totally bored of these patchs that are aimed at the carebear imo the last 3 patchs arguably excluding t3 and sov changes have been solely based on satifying the urge of the cearbearplanetary int rorqual orca sov changes probing wh space the t2 bs atm are only really for those who run missions and used as a jump bridge supercap buffs cant really be classed as pvp basedi think its time for some decent headway in the pvp genre another dictor commandship even another bc and destroyer would be nice another type of capital ship faction frig t3 frig another type of weapon beam remote explosive timed shield placement mini sieging please ccpsure this game is mean to be played as a gang but what about those people who like to do it solo once in a whilethis post is kinda fragmented and doesnt tackle one specific angle i want discussion not trying to win an argument just want to get some opinion
1 many people use t3 in pvp you dont2 super cap boost was definitely a boost for pve also people use their supercaps even less than before dominion3 probing changes really made the live of pvpers worse the time it takes now to probe out ships went down significantly4 sov changes not pvp relatedi just wonder  you play the game rightso far  nothing to support here the proposal is way to unspecific maybe start the discussion in features  ideas
then you started it in the wrong forumfeatures and ideas is a couple rows further down the forum
lets see what was in those last three carebear patches 1 dominion an overhaul of 00 sovereignty mechanics a change to supercapital weaponry to make fleet fights less stupid and motherships more effective the fleet finder to make building those 200man fleets easier and a massive acrosstheboard buff to faction ships carebears gotan exploration tutorial 2 apocrypha an addition of 2500 new 00 systems with delayed local which are the basis of a new production chain that makes awesome cruiserclass ships new scanning mechanics that dramatically shorten the amount of time it takes to probe someone out the carebears got a new and interesting type of rat but its a type of rat that basically forces you into cynojammertakedown tactics at the high end 3 quantum rise serverside changes which created the possibility of reinforced nodes for fleet fights the speed nerf that pvpers had mostly been asking for for years weapon grouping which everyone loves but which also has some very positive effects on lag and bombs got a lot cheaper carebears gotone mining supporthauler ship so yeah what are you talking about
yeah sorry obviously this is in the wrong sectionand tbh t3 is out of the price range of most people to use in everyday pvp so are supercaps so are t2 bs sov changes are not exactly pvp related i wouldnt call shooting at stations and poss fun or pvp probing it mostly for plexs and wh space if u checked the  of gangs that go out for some fun id say that a high  dont have probes weve been using the same ships and weapons since the game started just wanting something new to play with maybe if they revamped assult frigs id be happy but i think its more than thatill ask a mod to move the post
carebears got the orca will be getting planetary interaction and loot rebalancingcalling the last few expansions industrialist is a ing joke loot rebalancing is the first serious look ccp has taken at rebalancing the aging mining proffessionwhen ccp comes out with a real industrialist expansion maybe then you can whine a little
carebear someone who does not wish to pvpso this is another wannabee piratepvp that thinks eve should be played hisher wayand again piratepvp tears are the best i could bathe in them
you do realize all the ships you fly are made by industrial playersi mean i reactivated my account a couple of weeks ago and started pvping but i dont mind more industrial patches if it means replacing my ships become cheaper
please dont define industrialist as carebear there is a difference there hasnt been a major expansion which has really dealt with the industry side of the game ineverindustry ui overhaul pweeeeeezzzzz
this wont stop macro laming but it will make macros useless to the point where people wont need them theres three types of macros the ratter 90 of 00 the hauler and the miner 90 of empiremacro makers find ways to make macros easily and will creatively continue so we have to look at what people use macros fori am not sure why people macro haul probably for trade goods or something anyway macro mining  ratting is done purely for isk so i say we do the followingbuff mining make asteroids contain more than mission junk so much more that you would be able to make equal amounts of isk from mining than missionswe should then increase the amount of minerals required to make stuff for the obvious reasons like about 50 or somethingso where do macros and ratter come inhave it so each ip is only allowed to mine  rat soo much a day they can go over that quota but once they do they will go into a siege farming siege where they ship wont move until dtin addition to this they should get announced to all people in that region by both channel notifications and mail they will also have aggression since shooting rocks is classed as hostility to asteroidsthis means miners  ratters can be attacked if they mine  kill too much and wont be able to move  warp  log offwhen the ship dies or dt happens they can mine  rat again because of this freedom i think a quota limit of 2 hours is fine
are you serious about this one
010
yes what purpose would a person use a macro using one for 2 hours is pretty pointless this will make macros inefficient
so my ceo tells me fix your sec status problem atm i could do power ratting for 34h a day and get my sec status fixed in a few days depending how bad i had been before whistleswith your plan the required time would doubletriple easilyalso what about people enjoying mostly pve in the game 2hday and then we tell them come back tomorrowhow about normal miners who dont use macros 2hday and then we tell them come back tomorrowhow idiotic is that
people enjoy mining o i was being generous  2 hours but its fine you can still mine for longer if you are mining in a fleet and you go over your quota you will experience industrial pvp perfect to merge pvp and pve together mining will be buffed ofc so 1 hour of mining will be the equivalent of 10 hours now macros will just be useless no one will pay for a macro to do what they can do quicker in an houras for ratting with the warping from hostiles etc 2 hours would be plenty of time the problem is people are leaving macros on for a long time because they are useful afk tools imagine getting a program that does two hours worth of work a day only some people would still use them but the numbers will be soo lowthe ip filter will limit isk seller companies from selling sure they will be able to use proxies but is that really worth the effort for 2 hours a daythis would increase the price of zydrine too making lowsec mining better
010i rat and mine and i do both for more than 2 hours a day when i do it lets just take the mining sidei use 2 accts so that means the most optimal for me is the setup i use hulkorca as most will agree will mine more than hulkhulk it takes even with tech 2 crystals and drones mining with a max boost almost to over a hour depending on belt density to fill a orca with your proposal i am only allowed to mine 2 maybe 3 orcas of ore a day when if i am on a project to build a lot of things i can easily on the weekends spend 1012 hours a day mining mining already has a hard time keeping up with some l4 and most l5 missions on the isk per hour ratio what your talking about would mean i can mine 2 hours a day per character meaning i would have to train my miner to fly the orca and my orca pilot to fly a hulk to max ability so i can now mine for 4 hours a day and then i would have do something else the rest of the time i want to play that daywhile i agree something needs to be done about macro miners etc i am not going to grace the rest of your post with a response because i agree with many of the people opposing you already and as for doubling the mineral cost of ships and mods let me know when you want to pay for a 120 million isk drake or a 21 billion isk freighter just triple or more the cost of everything on the market at the tech 1 level and double the cost of tech 2 that is what you will see happenedit for spelling and grammar
so really what you are saying is we should try it out and if it doesnt work revert back to the old method sounds good to me tbh
wow ive rarely seen such poorly thought out ideas posted in the assembly forum this is epic fail in so many ways my lunch break couldnt possibly leave me enough time to write it all outill just leave it at epic fail leaving it to the masses to inform you whyback to work
not supported if i want to travelmission with one account and mine with the other i do not wish to be have to stop that
judging by the comments i think people will be happier if the limit was increased to 4 hours instead i will edit my original post to reflect thisi also thought rats should spawn more and give less of a loot  bounty this would make ratting open to everyone so alliances wont have to restrict space to corps only
how is just drop this idea and think of a different way to try and stop macros you start putting limits on what people can do for a given time and they will go find a different game that does not care if they sit around for hours in one location doing the same thing over and over when their rl is too busy for them to be involved in more active parts of the game
there were days when i was still working on my masters degree that i would mine while writing papers sometimes 8  10 hours a day on the weekend so basically what youre telling me is that my subscription money doesnt entitle me to the same playing time as yours unless i am engaged in activities you agree are of limited interest to macro usershow about you stop drinking those dumbass shakes in the mornings that might help
fyp
if anything this is a reason to not vote for cat
nooooooooooo leave cat alonethis suggestion is the answer to all macro problems only one way to find out tbh

harolds example of neutral rr having the swaying power of ecmdampscramming someone without concordokken is a very legitimate comparison and manalapans elaboration that an aggrotimer would result in nothing but squads of rring hospital domi mercs interfering with a war they didnt pay to be a part of is also a valid point the docking timer will do nothing but stop the lone logi ship alts which are simply the tip of the iceberg in this problem the only example in hisec i can even consider as a defense as to why someone not in your alliance would need to be rred would be the pair of dudes running a mission as a dpslogi partnership who arent in the same alliance but isnt that what an alliance is for in the first place that extremely small case is the only example of someone being screwed over by harolds proposal it wouldnt affect nullsec and lowsec itself needs a look  as far as rring someone 10 with no gcc anyway so that is a discussion for another timetldrharold is right and only people who want neut rr are people using itps manalapan for csm
i especially liked the part where to op acts like he knows what hes talking about speaking as someone with a hell of a lot of experience with neutral rr both being used for me and being used against me let me say thisthe only sensible fix to the rr mechanic is to have any rring ship inherit the docking and aggression timers of their target in other words rather than creating its own timer it should copy the timer of the person being rred rr already inherits the aggression timers of the target but what it does not do is inherit the docking timersexample i shoot someone once and they shoot back i decide i want to deagress and dock up for whatever reason 15 seconds after i stop shooting in other words 45 seconds before ill be able to dock my friend starts rring me rather than having to wait a full 60 seconds to dock he has to wait as long as i do 45 seconds presuming he continues to rr me until i have 15 seconds to dock his timer continues to mimic mine and so as soon as i can dock so can hea blob of rr domis will always be overpowered just like a blob of falcons or a blob of anything at some point fights do become a numbers game whether everyone involved in the fight is in one of the 2 warring corps friends of the corps or hired to helpof all the elements of a fight rr is by far the easiest to counter its extremely short range it takes a lot of capacitor and presuming that you argue that logistics ships are op logistics at range are extremely vulnerable to sensor damps logistics up close are extremely vulnerable to neuts or just dpsthe current mechanic is flawed but most of your supporters are just whining along with you quit acting like its the end of the world i regularly fight people who have rr when i have none and rather than spending my time complaining to ccp about it i find ways to counter it myself note for those who are bound to respond lol tort you have liek 8 rr alts noob i have 2 alt accounts each with several characters on them sometimes used for rr both of those 2 alts are currently unsubscribed and have been for the past 2 months
awnser no they should incur there own 60 second timer witch will constantly resey while they are activly repping youfaclon v domi this particular comparison you make is out of context the reason being that fleet of falcons will be assploded by concord if the join a fight without first pulling agro somehow whereas the hospitaldomi fleet can rep anything they want to without any reprocussions under current mechanicsecondly a fleet of falcons will melt to a fleet of domis who fits a sensor damp on a pvp ship with exception to pvp setups boosted by bonuses i have never fit one of these mods to activly use in a pvp battleship or cruser as they generaly detract from my tank or tacklethe logi as a ship is op although used in boath pvp and pve aspects of the game it is also abused by playerscorps and alliances alike i for 1 detest this kind of gameplay as it has a tendancy to take the element of danger away from a fight for the recipiant i am always happy to recive help from my corpaliance friends but that is where my tollerance for this mechanic endsagain i 100 support the ops argument sorry me spelling most probably sux
i think people keep saying they support neut rr because they counter it with more neutral rr thats hardly a fix if someone can positively affect one side of a fight they have no right being a part of someone else should logically be allowed to negatively affect the other side without concord interferencethe other example is just kill the rri enjoy small gang warfare and while neutral rr doesnt phase a fleet of 20 because they can annihilate the threat it is a massive game changer for the general smallgang hisec wardecs any counterargument that says well maybe you should get more people and just blob or maybe you shouldnt be wardeccing and be a carebear is ignorant and overlooking the vast majority of wars in hisec it is currently impossible to fight outside of any trade hub with less than a full squad against similar numbers without the fight being severely stacked against one side of the other within seconds of the fight starting resulting in one side being annihilated and the other losing everything to a force that turned out to be 2 to 5 times their size and sometimes it isnt planned out that way but bored guys camping their targets who were looking to pull aggro in spidertankfits involve themselves where they shouldnt betldrpeeps want wars to only exist between massive corps that have 2 to 4 neutral rrs on alt accounts that are invincible until they decide to get involved
lets get this back on the front page
why not to 5 roflvl for medium projectile guns and change hybrid guns skills to projectile skills that would work
i do agree that changing the skill to something more relevant would be nice i would however like something more useful a bonus to optimal range would do mwd speed how is that useful if i have target far away i use sentries if i have target close i use heavies in either cases drone mwd speed does not matter i would like something more productive like optimal tracking damage not gonna happen ishtar has quite a lot already tank

yes because what this game needs is more overpowered stuff sarcasmnot supported
110because you are a worse troll then emo tj and thats saying something
i figure theres about an 80 chance of troll but you havent annoyed me lately so ill give you a serious answer regarding the details of your proposal i have to say that your sense of game design sucks 200 damage bonus plus a 75 rof is effectively 12x base damage that frigate would do roughly abaddon dps im sure i dont need to elaborate on why this is a bad idea regarding the basic idea behind your proposal while the idea of a ship that melds all the t2 skills together does amuse me it strikes me as poor design it would be nothing more than a tool for the old highskill players who can already use every other tool as it stands now speaking as one of those players this might replace the daredevil on the actually makes me want to fly a frigate list but it wouldnt be good for the game stuff like this should be faction ships to make them accessible to newer players so yeah not supported

locking this thread by request of the opalso please remain constructive when replying to a thread you are welcome to disagree but please do so in a constructive matter
i support tildes and i support tai paktuplease dont break the forum layout i removed some of your s zymurgist
hey dawg we heard u liked tildes so we put some tildes in yo tilde thread
i support the cause for the noble i will dedicate my csm efforts to the revamp of eve font and most specifically the mighty tildea vote for manalapanis a vote for the tilde
making bpos look different from bpcs has been proposed all over the place but i cant find a specific thread in here for the current csm termim going to go one step further make a slightly more specific proposalmake bpc icons different from bpo icons by creating a watermark on the icon indicating the number of runs remaining on the bpci know ccp has given some reasons why making any graphical distinction would hurt database performance but i am proposing a completely clientside display change this is similar to graying out locked items in a station containerjust have some overlays for two digits 09 each and an overlay for a greater than sign 21 overlays total apply the appropriate overlays to fade the portions of the bp icon appropriate to the number of runs remaining if there are more than 99 runs left it displays 99all computed and done clientside
alright while i would like this ccp has already said this will never happenyour proposal doesnt help because the database information already has to be queried to build that watermark for the client to know what to do it is a unique approach to the idea but doesnt help with the database load
ok so i understand that right now the database just returns the item as a blueprint and doesnt say if its a bpc or bpobut seriously how hard is it to change the database to have different item ids for bpcs and bpos and thats not an ignorant rhetorical question  i used to manage sql databases professionally its not that hard and you can return the number of runs on the bpc in the stack size variable heck since bpcs are inherently unstackable you can store the number of runs in the stack size variable
1 how many bpobpc in your hangar mine get sluggish opening now i wouldnt like ti to have the speed of the old bookmark containers 2 adding a extra column in the database is easy sure but checking that it will not break some thousand different processes that use the database is hard
im not a db professional and this is gleaned from bits and pieces but heres my understanding of how it works for every item in game there exists a single typeid for the appropriate blueprint an item cannot have two different blueprints just onei expect this is because reprocessing is based on running the item backwards through the blueprint so the process would screw up badly if multiple prints existed as such bpcs and bpos must have the same typeid and data like is this a copy and whats the me are stored as attributes because of optimizations to help reduce database lag attributes of an item are not read unless they are specifically asked for and theres no good way to ask for a specific set of attributes like is it a copy without forcing the client to query all attributes of every item in your hangar which would cause completely unacceptable lag in other words you cant break them apart by typeid and you cant break them apart by attributes theres no good ways to distinguish them the science and industry windows blueprints tab can do a detailed info search on all of them because it isnt loaded often but its not something theyre willing to do on the inventory screen also you misunderstand how items are stored with regards to stack sizes an item is either packed where it has simply a typeid and a stack size or unpacked where it has all those other fun attributescontents modules insurance names me there is no stack size variable for a bpc because a bpc is an unpacked item the only way to get a stack size variable is to have a stack of packaged bpos off the market so no dice storing the runs count thereedit given that theres a 90 chance that your next post will be a variation of thats idiotic ill preempt you i think that you i and most of the staff of ccp would agree that it is however legacy code being what it isin ccps case mostly undocumented basement code its unlikely to change no matter how idiotic it may be just look at poses
afaik you are correctitems are either singleton  unpackaged  or nonsingleton  packaged bpcs are always singleton as you cant have a packaged bpcsingletons are always of stacksize 0 or is it 1  im not sure  but its always the sameso that field is free to be used for bpc runsstoring bpc runs in stacksize would be feasible  how many bugs would need to be picked out after implementation is anyones guessas bpcbpo differentiation is pretty much the biggest bugbear of most industrialists it would be worth investigating as a solution if nothing elseanother possibe solution would be to use the high bit of the item typeid to indicate bpcwhen jobs get installed for production all thats needed is to mask out the high bit
actually the way it probably works is thiseach item in the game has a typeid that identifies the type of item each item also has an individual item id call it individ that identifies the individual item it tells the difference between the 2732 scourge missiles in your cargo hold and the 102753 scourges in your hangarwhen you look in a container ship cargo hangar gsc what have you the game goes to the database and fetches everything within that container how this is done depends on how containers are implementedwhat gets returned is the contents of that container each item has the individ for that particular item its typeid a stack size and an indicator of if the item is unpacked or not id implement this as stack size 1 for assembled items but it could be done another waythe client then displays an icon based on the typeid the problem is that the bpcs and bpos have the same typeid so the client cant distinguish between the two so to find out which it is the client would have to query the db to get the item details on that particular individthe only way to fix this is to give bpcs and bpos different typeids which yes is a pain in the butt and the size of the item tables combined with the limited amount of available downtime poses an additional challenge plus the client would need to be updated with to recognize the new ids and use the new iconsgiven the client changes this could only be done as part of a patch release but the database script to split the ids on the table isnt that hardputting the number of runs on the icon would require storing it in the stack size which to be honest is almost certainly more trouble to implement than its worth but i still think its a cool idea
lag its a problem everyone knows it its no secret that if a server is bogged down with a large amount of people jumping into that system is inherently risky due to the client sometimes being unable to load the system before their ship is loaded to the systemsimply put in stressed situations a server will load a players ship into a system but it might be minutes before the client has loaded the system thus making that player extremely vulnerable to attackthe proposal is as follows ccp should create a system that will protect players jumping through a gatecyno bridge if their client is frozen in lag for jumping through only eliminating lag in ordinary fleet battles is not the concern hereone method that i have heard before is increasing the cloak timer on ships it is a good one but only a temporary fix since ships will decloak and in a fleet battle on a gateit is likely you will be decloaked if it is big enoughthe other method that i suggested was a jump limboin which ships do not go directly from system a to system b but instead go from system a to system c a barren uninteractible load point from which a client can load the server on system b before being dumped in system b with the advantage that they can actually fight backmore on that discussion in this thread link
agreed
oh tripplesupported how about using the same notification popup like with new mail skill completed etc and while youre at it also add contracts to it those are terribly hard to spot too
this is my first post with a suggestion in 5 years of playing eve so bear with me here its 200am as well so i might need some help building on this ideamy main gripe is with local chat providing too much intel everyone says ccp wont dumb down local until there is a fix for gathering intel directional scanner what i am a proposing below would probably be viewed as a partial fix but it might be one that would work good enough to allow local to be dumbed down sooner rather than neveri propose the creation of a new module the name of which is not important its function however would be when activated to allow a ships pilot to perform directional scans there should be two versions the standard directional scanner and the covert directional scanner the standard variety would have a set max range like 10au exact range is not important now and the module can not be used while in warp it should also use the ships capacitor while activated the second version a covert variety would have an increasing max range with astrometics skill level can only be fit to ships which can fit covert ops cloaks can be used while in warp and does not use the ships capacitor the covert variety would function much like the current directional scanner but maybe allow it to reach to 25au again exact range is not important now with astrometics v fixes the nerf on that skill trainingthis would increase the importance of scouts and decrease the number of idiots flying around a system spamming the dscanner every 10 seconds or whatever the limit is on it now it would also allow the delayed local change for 00 space and low sec because again it will reduce the number of idiots who can spam the dscanner id also like to see standings icons and the redgreen light buddy icon indicator removed from high sec locals but lets not ask for too much all at once local chat in all varieties of space just gives away too much intel possibly going with a straight text list as mentioned in other proposal threads of the pastif this has already been proposed my apologies as i said its after 200am now and i didnt search too deep
oh yea i support my own idea and good night
so you want to remove the directional scanner from ships unless they fit a module for the purpose local or no local this is a bad idea
and what slot would this module go inhigh gimp all ships that have a full set of hardpointsmed gimp shield tankers low med slot ships have to drop tackle for itlow gimp armour tanks damage nanoso no bad idea directional scanner has been needed enough thanks
regardless of whether this item would require a slot or not its still a bad idea the lag it would generate due to constant queries to the database would slow down the servers drasticallyim sure youve heard andor experienced the lag from fleet fights since the computer has to render the location texture maps and activities from all nearby ships now the server would have to pipe the information on ships and quite possibly their locations to each ship with one of these devices fitted to iton top of this youre gonna remove any visual indication of status of the enemy at war horrible standings etc this is gonna lead to a cluster in low and null security space and whining will be immense from surprise ganksim sorry but local is a much less cpuintensive solution to intel at least for now all the computer has to do is query the pilot and standings relations for local whenever a status change occurs most likely by activation of a stargate or other form of travelim sorry but this idea will not work even if it was built in to all ships not supported
nah bunyip i am not sure but i think he means that you need to fit a module and only then you can spam the dir scanner button so that would indeed decrease laghowever lets follow his logic1 lets remove local2 oh wait then you force everyone to smash the dir scanner button every 10 seconds3 solution lets remove the directional scanner then you dont have to smash the button every 10 secondswhile he completely skips the actual problem and calls everyone who is trying to stay alive by smashing the dir scanner instead of waiting nicely until they get ganked idiots
please elaborate why you think it would be a bad idea not just a bad idea because it inconveniences you but the whole of eveyes it would most likely be a high slot module just like that of the cloaking device would you like the cloaking device removed from game since it gimps ships with hardpoints as well those that feel that they can not survive without a dscanner are free to fit one to their ship im not saying you cant dscan at all anymoremaybe you didnt read my post correctly what i am suggesting will in no way increase load onto the server side it will in fact decrease it by allowing a smaller percentage to ships to use the dscannerhow did i skip the actual problem sure it may not be the best solution but its better than the current situation ive actually allowed for the repair of two problems at once both sides cat  mouse lose the ability to dscan if youre gang doesnt have a scout youre probably looking to get ganked anyway why does everyone in gang need a dscanner what purpose does it serve when local goes up by one and 50 people in gang all start hitting the scan button it serves as increased load on the server i fixed it
no it would increase the number of noobalts sitting in system spamming scanand if people dont have the security provided by the current dscan especially without local theyre just plain not going to go to lowsec or 00 because the risk and tedium arent worth it and then cue bleating about why dont i have any targets nerf highsec i suppose
cant say that i like this idea especially for ships like mining bargesexhumers a retrieverskiff would be totally blind to anyone else out there or unable to do their mining job if they had to fit a dscan module
what i was hoping for was a proximity altert dscan upgrade module  such that if something came within 10au of you it appeared either on your overview or in a notification of some variety maybe just auto appeared on dscan anyway i cant reasonably support thisliang
proposaladd a characters current manufacturing and science research jobs to their respective menus descriptionshow what the total jobs your character has active in the science and industry menu and the manufacturing menuyour client would need to query the server to get this information and queries may need to be restricted to lessen server load such as how your items dont update for 10mins etchow it works nowas the total amount of active jobs isnt show you have to refresh your active job list and then manually count your active jobs or alternatively you keep putting jobs on until you get a message that says youve reached your job limitprosless clicks and micro managingconsalthough this proposal would require small server queries it could escalate with all the industry and science loons out there  which may cause moar lagexample imageplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesvote tamber for csm fiveall your vote are belong to metamber

i fly a redeemer occasionally and yeah a rifter probably is better as said they need bs performance in addition to their role bonuses and by role bonuses i mean the jump drive and ability to fit a covert jump portal generator the sins agility bonus and all of their cloaked speed bonus should really go even the redeemers tracking speed bonus is questionable at bestso buff ehp buff jump range and take a look into some of the bonuses attached to the bos skill id like to see the current bos skill bonuses replaced with some sort of ew but thats just me but a covert ops cloak is not needed if all it got was a cov ops cloak theyd still be terrible

not supported unless suicide ganking takes another nerf u can instantly buy all the isk u want via plex but u cant instantly buy back sec statusu have to grind it and that helps keep suicide ganking in check
thats a pretty dire suggested change its basically regressing eve back to the old need bookmarks to visit a region state bookmark a spot 90km behind the gate and warp to it at 100 neatly circumvents your proposali know people bemoan the fact that eve was bigger back in the day but wtz is great im lazylanding some arbitary distance off a gate sounds like an invitation for gangs to sit there with 3 sebos trying to pop crap before it can approach i dont think i need to write too much more since the chances of this happening are about on par with me getting a threesome with the current hollywood a list
i thought people were being over zealous within this thread but then i got pointed in the direction of this thread from some time ago and it opened my eyes to your attitude to eve and pvp carry on guys and gals ank needs stopping for sure
girl powahhh you totaly have my vote pleae dont listen to the trolls and work for a player pirate free highsec compiuter pirates are okay tho your idea about reducing player skills by 20 for any pirat actions are perfect for removing the grievers from this game maybe just make it 1 skill randomly chosen so the trolls have nothing more to complain
obvious troll is obviousits become awfully quiet in here i still dont have answers to my questions which makes me think to move my votes to someone else whos participating in these elections more actively
seconding this i had picked up only a vaguely negative view of ankh due to threads like this one but that linked thread makes everything so clearbest quote so far is thissays it all really
this not 1 or 2 replies that confirm our concerns about your nopvp eve online but 11 pages of your deluded idea about how the game should be changed to suit your selfish desires you scream consequences in that thread i say this thread is consequence enough for you
some of ankhes opinions and some really juicy ones yes fair representation even though were parasitic scum all of these quotes can be found in this thread if anyone doubts they are valid i just thought id post them to save everyone else the trouble
and she calls those misconceptions
a fun coincidence step 1 type ankhesentapemkah into the forum box step 2 i use firefox right click ankhesentapemkah for spell checking result 1 unrepresentative result 2 misrepresentation and just to contribute something meaningful i refuse to vote for someone who confuses video games with reality killing someone in a game is like tagging someone in a game of tag its just a part of the game no one actually gets hurt maybe im one of the few people who doesnt emorage when i lose a ship but id like to think most people laugh at off just the same as i do the only people who can be griefed are the ones who take the game way too seriously
this
well no overzealous does cover it besides this is her thread isnt there already a different thread on this issue just ask your questions if she doesnt answer to your liking dont vote for her
yeah there are many places better than the thread on ankhe to discuss ankhe given the context there are very good reasons that people need to be informed of who this candidate really is were here to make sure no one gets deceived into believing shes a proper candidate
consider this most people arent awesome forum warriors and will simply see her name and by far the longest thread in this forum popular gal this anksomethingsomething must be just sayin
seeing as this is cleary not a game or type of gameplay you likeby your own admissions you seem to find this game is inhabited by slavering griefers with a room temperature iq might i suggest you go back to puzzle pirates and leave us to it 
anyone with any familiarity with these forums will know that long thread  bad
wow  where do i vote
youre in the wrong damn game sweetheart i can picture it nowfw commander  wts entering the system load your gunsankh  alas i must abscond shooting people in a virtual game with fake weapons is evil i joined fw to stare at a 3d box in space flees 00and for more seriousness you claim to work for a game company who is currently producing several mmos yet you fail to present what you actually do there are you the frontdesk secretary or do you get the coffee and volt for the programmers what is it you do exactly i am also of the firm belief that engaging in one area of game production doesnt make you an expert in any of the other areas which can be seen with your ideasopinions of 00 and pvp warfare even using uos justice system as an example is absolutely ludicrous if you have any experience at all youd know that this system in its totality was ultimately removed and abolished like a year or so into the gameimplementing harsher penalties isnt the answer as others have stated there are plenty of those currently in place properly educating the player base on how to avoid being ganked destroyed or massacred is though how can a player who absolutely loathes pvp possibly make unbiased changes in that field of play that betters the game as a whole rather than fulfilling their own selfish interests and personal niche sorry no vote and stop spamming my eve mail box with your damn fliers about a movie
i endorse this candidacy and my vote will run this wayanyone receiving this much opposition in a thread must be doing something good
talk about short sighted people cant leave their marksso chribba isnt it nice that you have left no mark in eve and nobody knows who you are hey ricdic isnt it nice that people dont bring up your massive haul on a regular basis man goonswarm alliance was all screwed up theyre totally gone now and nobody remembers themin eve everyone leaves a mark eve just doesnt rely on ingame mechanics to force that mark to remain ccp leaves it up to us  the players  to recognize who is important enough who has had a large enough impact to deserve being remembered over the yearsthose who do leave a lasting mark in eve have done so in the minds of the players not in a database row somewhere
you do not get off the hook when suicide ganking someone they get kill rights on you and on the one occasion it happened to mei didnt lose anything valuable v  i got my own back on the gankermaybe this is the wrong csm you are trying to get in for hello kitty online is always open to you ccps own words are that they mean it be a harsh dark place where you are supposed to feel slightly angry when you log in and are never truelly safe ccp want it to be a dangerous game and a lot of other people do to you will not change anything
that quotepage needs its own thread tbh
source threadyou know i might respect ankhs opinion if she actually spent any time as a 5 red flashy dude who was shut out of empire high sec and forced to live in low and null sec that isnt the case however i think ankh is mentally unsound if playing a game makes someone antisocial either that or she is a very dedicated role playing type in either case i dont want her on the csmfor the record i have a carebear and i have an ebil red flashy pirate i know and enjoy both sides of the game

a question whats your stance on the new not really but theres several threadnaughts about it remove local requests
im in favour of a delayed local  invisible until one has spoken but it would have to go accompanied by a suitable upgrade to the onboard ship scanner
can you please elaborate what functionality would you expect from a upgraded onboard ship scanner
the csm campaigns are really heating up and there are some great candidates this election tough for someone to stand out in a crowd like thisso again id like to make the case for the pilots of eve to consider supporting me as their csm candidate1 i am mature and take this seriously that means i show up and will for my complete term i understand every idea has a benefit and a cost i have 30 plus years experience in software engineering and years of actual experience in the games industry i also have no interest in gaining some personal advantage in eve ill never be part of a scandal or breach of trust with ccp2 i am not part of a special interest like a large powerblock alliance or one of the many celebrities runnning against me i really am just another player here in eve in terms of my focus and interests3 i recognize eve is inherently a pvp game and will always support the right for another pilot to try and shoot someone in the face in space i will want the face shooting to be made interesting challenging and potentially rewarding for the target if they can avoid the face shooting thing as they slip about in space4 i also believe the the ecconomy of eve is key to its appeal that it is truly a player driven economy so eve has to remain interesting to industrialst and traders i minored in business and understand economics in rl5 im accessable and love to hear from other players in eve if you have an idea ill pay attention when you share it and i will take the time to think about it i believe that while the individual csm should bring their own experiences and views to share with ccp they are ultimately the representatives of the greater pilot base of eve great ideas can come from almost anywhere so i am open to hear what folks think about how to make eve even better6 i think i understand the idea of stakeholder with ccp better than most of the other candidates as a result of my direct experieces professionally in agile software engineering process this is the professional world i live in and i think i can bring a lot to the table when representing the pilots of eve to ccp7 eve has to stay fun i am all about having fun in eve ask anyone that has been in my corp or alliance the randomness of space would have to create some humor once in a while with eve being such a rich and complex experience with a challenging learning curve we need to remember that you have to have someting enjoyable about your life in the verse to make you want to keep logging in eve walks a very fine line between huge fun and a grind at timesso please feel free to bring up any points youd like my views on thanks for taking the time to read this and please remember to voteissler dainzeyour next csm representative
no i havent  mostly due to conflicts with other activities wife kids dog robot
if you cannot spare an hour or two every other weekend how do want to find time for all those csm meetings players issuesproposals meetings with ccp etc 
how about making them easier to find instead of increasing their duration in kspace its not that big an issue since youll generally have 12 signatures per systems if that but an unfarmed wormhole can have dozens of signatures which makes finding paths through wspace more effort than its worth most of the time
that is pretty cool make it so dedicated covops frigs can get the ability to filter out nonwormhole signatures as it is right now if im looking for people in wormholes i get way more benefit bringing a probing arazu than i do a helios so this also gives covops frigs a more defined role i think it has some promise maybe if it becomes way too easy to pin down wormholers have these ships eliminate two types of signatures so if youre looking for wormholes you can still find some radar and magneto sites but you get to bypass the numerous gravimetric and ladar theres something good in here ill do some research as to what wormholer dwellers think about this
hi cat fanboi herei dont know why or how i became a cat stalker but i wont rest until you are csm brofistsdont give up cat never expose your main stand for what is right this is the futurex
good question but you answered it yourself i think that with the new insurance system we will finally reach the same mineralproduct price which we would if all insurance was removed overnight so from the industrialist point of view it doesnt matter exists there insurance system in the game or not market shall stabilize itself and maybe miners will start mining various ores not just veld in highsec and arkonor in nullsec also after yesterdays the initiative alliances bombing runif you dont know what im talking about check caodtheir killboardscrapheap forums i was asked what do i think about current status of bombers i think this is very reasonable question and i will answer it heremy position on bombers is simple they are fine to achieve good results in a bomber you need lots of practise and player skill most of the players fail to understand this but if you would try you would find out that bombers in the hands of unskilled players deliver only lulz not the bombs there is only one alliance i know about which mastered the use of bombers  goonswarm all others try to repeat the same success with various degrees of failure you should also remember that presence of bombers removes easy mode for the fleets fleet members nowadays need to be constantly aware of possibility of bombing run and spread themselves out it also brings new tactics and various improvisation to counter enemy bomber squads so i think its only for the best i understand that some of you fellow eve players would want to be able to fly in semiafk mode and just shoot when you are told but i disagree such combat is bad for the game and just allows for the f1monkeys to think themselves elitepvpers so i disagree with statement that bombers should be nerfed they are fine just stop being lazy and learn to counter them
whats to stop alliances putting hundreds or thousands of smartmines blocking their main entry systems so they would have to be limited and priced accordingly to how much dps they could doim not a fan of this as it means you dont need to defend your own space its no longer pvp its pvethe tournament training idea is good and could be taken further to allow true 1v1 up to say 5v5 fights where both sides have to agree to allow only certain number and types of ships into the arena and thus you know there will be a fight without other ships interfering these arenas are essentially considered 00 but could be in hisec and lowseci dont agree with allowing system targetting as it overly complicates things and would likely increase lag further to allow for these calculationsthe suicide attacks in empire can be most often avoided by flying the right type of ship depending on what youre carrying i dont really see a need to change it the golem is allready the best ship in its class why would you give it a better bonus than the other other faction shipsi do like the escort mini carrier idea though
short answer to both of these questions  im not claiming to have all the answers but if voted back into csm i will continue to support proposals relating to these issues the most important point is i have relevant experience in both of these areashowever i do have a few specifics for those wondering about my position on thingssov for smaller alliancesactually taking sov without help is most likely out of the question at the moment and im not sure it should be the issue is that if a group of 50 active players could take sov then 500 players will be able to take sov with no trouble at all  and that is ignoring any people trying to defend im willing to look at ideas around this but for now it isnt realistic for smaller entities to take and hold sov without initial help from other alliances if the promised formalised treaty system was in place this could open the playing field a bitlowsecthe first major issue here is to define what lowsec actually is other than 01 to 04 space  in lowsec you of course have pvp and pirates but you also have factional warfare split between pvp mission running and plexing industrial pos moon mining reactions drugs agents all missions up to and including l5s logistic bases carrier jumping assets to 00 and so on the pvp is a bit different in lowsec to 00 but that is down to removal of bubbles and bombs and currently doomsdays and the addition of the global criminal flagccp seem to treat lowsec just as a stepping stone to 00 however i understand that for some people 00 sov war is not the eve endgameso which of the areas of lowsec needs to be improvedlowsec needs different things added to it to give the various inhabitants reason to stay in addition there needs to be a clear divide between lowsec and 00 this means adding things to lowsec not available in 00 the reverse is already true lets have a look at specific areaspirates we hear a lot of people talk of consequences for your actions but when players choose to become pirates they dont really gain anything  i believe that as highsec is closed off to a 5 and below pirate that something should open up in return i have mooted the idea of pirate only stargates which would link different systems than the usual gates this would give pirates a mobility advantage when stalking their prey or when being chased it would also open a potential flashpoint in systems for antipirates to lurk the idea isnt fully formed as yet but i have been discussing it with pirates to get feedback for anyone wondering my sec status is 5 and so this wouldnt actively benefit me industry im not sure what to suggest here much depends on how planetary interaction turns out any improvements to pos mechanics would be a welcome boost but that isnt unique to lowsec if players have good ideas for this i will give them serious considerationfactional warfare i have run fw missions but unlike other candidates i have also participated in the adhoc fleet fights and had fun shooting other players  fw has the potential to be so much more than the current system allows it should be the best place to pick up a quick fleet and go pvp till your ship explodes unique navy items were a nice boost for the mission runners but the pvp side seems to lack rewards and many of the fw mission runners are not willing to pvp more dynamic missions or missions that put opposite faction players in direct competition could be interestinghopefully that gives some answers though of course it does open questions too tldrif elected to csm5 i will support proposals to improve lowsec
the problem is the steamroller mechanics of sov warfare if you have enough momentum you will plow through an entire region and there is nothing a small alliance can do to defendso the issue is something radical is needed pidust is supposed to influence system sovereignty but how will being able to defend a few planetary installations stop a giant capblob from denying you access to the planets anyway seems like an issuepersonally i think if you want to hold space you actually have to be there to keep sovereignty up it should be more than just planting a flagon the other hand if people are supposed to live in more confined areas in order to make room for more diverse alliances there has to be more stuff to do than just grinding one sanctum after another in your thanatos cause id imagine that gets rather boring in the long run
vuk lau was elected to the 2nd and 3rd csm serving as chairman initially after reaching the twoterm limit elvenlord then took up a similar agenda in vuks place for the 4th csm also serving as chairmanfor this next 5th csm session the two term limit has been abolished because its clear that there arent enough serious candidates actually prepared to work hard through an entire csm session or in some cases just bother showing up to the weekly meetings and that blocking people like vuk from standing again and limiting elven to only one more term wasnt in the players interests since we both enjoyed our time on the council and found it productive being genuinely surprised how receptive ccp are to the csms ideas we will both be standing this timethe 5th csm will sit for a full 10 months and for the first time will have a stakeholder status when it comes to eve development allowing the council to prioritize specific featuresfixes from the backlog each expansion this makes this session by far the most important yet its therefore essential that the players get represented by delegates who are serious about the task and will have the stamina to work hard at it through the whole sessionin the past we have both gotten more than twice the votes needed to get elected so it should be possible to elect us together but we need you the voter to help make this happen we will be pursuing very similar policies but will together be able to raise twice as many issues and work twice as hard at harassing ccp to fix stuff so we are kindly asking that if you had planned to vote for either vuk or elven you help us both get elected by tactically voting as follows if the main character on the account youre voting with has a name begining with a to k you vote vuk lau if the main character on the account youre voting with has a name begining with l to z you vote elvenlordthank you for you votes and we hope youre proud of the tough but constructive line weve taken with ccp so far on your behalf vuk lau  elvenlord
our simple plan we understand eve primarily as a pvp game where pves role is to provide a modicum of stability and certainty to contrast with the apparent chaos of playerdriven competition that could otherwise seem overwhelming to new playersour definition of pvp doesnt limit itself to stuff that goes kaboomey in the dark however and we fully appreciate and partake in the industrial economical political and other lessobvious forms of competition that make eve such a rich universein our view 00 and the playerconquerable side of new eden are the end game of eve the place where players get the most opportunities to make a difference in the grand scheme of things and write history yet we certainly dont discount the critical importance of the empire experienceboth as training grounds for future nullsec dwellers and as the heart of a different and equally important pvp ecosystem empire is where new players and future alliances can sharpen their teeth where business tycoons and war profiteers can quietly scheme play markets and influence distant conflicts and where those who found themselves on the losing end of a territorial contest can recover heal and prepare for revengeone of the oftoverlooked cornerstones of eve especially by pvpers is industry but not by us we know ships must finish building before they can go boom in space miners would have nobody to sell to and traders would have no wares to peddle without industrialists industry and logistics are the glue that holds together roidlickers mission runners killboard s and fleet admirals thus players who tackle those thankless behindthescene roles in eve should be heard and represented for nothing much would ever happen without their effortsduring the course of past csm sessions weve found ourselves working on every kind of issue and aspect of the game imaginable and this will be the case again however the particular issues we will continue to fight especially hard on are fixing of broken unfinished or legacy features in preference to continually adding new features this includes for example server performance in fleet fights the roles system factional warfare some ship balancing and so on the poor state of eves customer support this is obviously a tough issue for ccp to tackle or to even acknowledge sometimes since they cannot just assign some coder time to fixing it instead it cuts to the heart of the management of their company and the culture thats grown up within the gm department over years however with the csms growing influence were confident some more meaningful progress can be made eventually in the meantime we dont intend to let the issue drop
why vote for us besides the unrealistic hope of ever owning a veldspargrazing equid because we care about eve as much as you do if not more because we have a vast personal experience of most aspects of the game on both sides of the lowsec border and on the border too because our perspective on whats good for eve extends beyond what helps us and our best buddies wtfpwn by next expansion and more importantly because we want to keep playing eve and enjoy it in the future and a prime condition for that to happen is for the game and the map to get as deep rich wide and diverse as possible your game matters to us because its what makes eve worth playing if you joined yesterday and have nfc where you want to go from here we want you to get the opportunity to explore as much as possible as soon as possible so you can figure it out if youre a n00b we look forward to meet you as a future partner or competitor and its in our best interest you get every chance to grow into a formidable opponent a friendly neighbor or a mysterious stranger if youre a missionrunner well help make your life more interesting until the wormhole drones get tough enough to make you realize you could be ready for another kind of epic arcs if youre a combat pilot regardless of friend or foe we want you to log in and have fun going boom in the dark no fighters no wars  no wars no joy if youre a logistician ceo or director we want you to finally have the tools that will allow you to share your workload with corp and alliance mates to stop burning out every 6 months and to get to fly a ship with highslots once in a while if youre an fc we want you to not be alone anymore herding cats or drumming in the void at 6am for the third night in a row  well help you have a talk with the n00b and combat pilot above if youre a small alliance with dreams of frontier life we want you to have a fighting chance against a mindless blob and to make a home for yourself in 00 more by talent and dedication than numbers if youre sitting in a boring alliance in 00 we want for you the possibility to go have fun in empire until you find a better one instead of ragequitting if youre dabbling in factional warfare we want it to teach you skills that will make you a force to be reckoned with once you cross over to nullsec if youre an industrialist we want for you the power to differentiate yourself from your neighbor be it by branding your products researching better bpcs or running a coop without getting arsed if youre a miner we are going to look hard for people who have ideas about making your game more fun if youre a trader we hate you yet we need you but thats how you like it right if youre a twobits scammer we have a bridge to sell you in jitavote for us for more info you can visit our website
vuk lau is perhaps the finest specimen of the male race i have ever met physically he is nothing short of an adonis amongst weaklings he has a razor sharp wit and intellect he is until now and perhaps for all time the only man who has been able to tempt me into partaking in a homosexual experiencein all seriousness though vuk lau is a good chap very competant and dedicated to his role in game and on previous csms he put his own life at risk by confronting the gm department for you the player
vuk lau is a man with some great ideas and has been willing to listen to anyone i will be voting for him and i hope that others will do the same

elven ty for listening
vuk will yell at the devs and stand on their desks after a few drinks for you he will even offer them sexual favors to make sure your agenda becomes theirs in my time at ccp it was hard to resist his manly charms but nothing happened honest in all seriousness vuk was one of the most engaging and scary members of the csms i had a chance to work with he was never focused on any one area of game play and was nonbiased in his opinions at times i think he was more interested in nerfing his own alliance than helping itif big serbian men pounding on tables and yelling at the devs is your idea of a csm candidate then vuk lau is your man
this question is entirely void now that ive actually read elvenlords bit guess he gets ze vote

love some of the csm candidates
who the hell is vuk lau we agree on 73 of things s
thats a great tool i especially like that i can review where the disagreements lie when picking between a few different candidates  much better than just the number since some issues are not as important as others
excellentnow it has to get put on a banner at the login screen until the elections end in the news andsoforth
updated the op to reflect the most important issues and conversations ive had with the community
many platforms and ideas by other candidates but lets start with the most important thingmy priority fix the lagguysgals i have just read some csm  vote for me  messagesi know that we have a considerable number of people running for csm 5 this year and that the choices are going to be difficult to say the leasti am not going to politically bash anyone in order to gain more votes for myselfbut we do need to decide in which order of these candidates we should vote fori believe that i am at least one of the men for the job for a variety of reasons above the resti was in csm2 first as an alternate then became a full csm2 memberthe last 2 csm elections both csm3 and in csm4 i participated in due to an error on the side of ccp for csm3 and lack of just a few short votes in making alternate for csm4since csm2 csm3 and csm4 i have spent a lot of my free time with past and present csm members on a daily basis through facebookthis allows me considerable contact with csm and others on current issues and upcoming issues and expansionsi also make regular trips to iceland for reasons other than eve related businessthis not an attempt to get a free ride as i can do it myself at anytime and do it frequently as i have friends and family in icelandi was at fanfest 2008 and 2009 and participated in conferences and discussions that are eve related rather than wasting time and making a fool of myselfi have played this game for the last 7 years and the majority of my corp has played for more than 5 years i also desire to form a coalition of competent people to help players to see some of the things we enjoy most in this game to be fixed or improved or even addedthis coalition would be players that have a good grasp at the needs of this game to be made better for all players not just some cosmetic work but real improvements such as the laagggggghow about more server hardware or other improvements that can make this server more reliable for our game playsure there are little things that need to be fixed here and there which could and should be addressedand yes even more love to the pirates because lord knows we like to shoot them but seriously dont they need a few more perkslet them use the bubble in 3 on down and thier bombs isnt it supposed to be low sec for a reason besides too many regions of space connecting empire to 00 where this should be allowedbut i do think that the insurance for these so called suicide gankers should be null and void or at the very minimum that platinum insurance should pay out less than 50sure it should be allowed thats not the problem but you ever had to pay lower premiums or deductibles when you have been found at fault in the accidentthere are many small medium and large fixes to the game and so many pros and cons to all of them to list them all here and argue their pointsi know that the majority of you would rather avoid a wall of text to read but ask your questions here and i will be happy to answer themextreme ceo of eye of godthank you
 reserved by me for updates you can vote for me here
what do you feel that you can bring to the csm that nobody else canwhat separates you from the rest in relation to campaign targets and actual competancy andor experience in relation to the topics that are wishing to raise if you get electedwho the hell are you and why should we care
theyre already working on the lag issueswell with that out of the way i see that you have zero platform
how hard is it to readfyi were still working on my official statement
some ideas are good yes but ecm ecm already got destroyed by the nerf bat the way it is now could even be considered slightly underpoweredi like everything else though
for 00 i would like to see a more regionalized eve conflicts need to scale down again big conflicts with 10 and more alliances on each side should still be possible but not be the norm smaller alliances need the ability to fight without getting drawn into big northsouth ideological issues rebalancing jumprange and jumpcost will help reduce the projected power of large alliances and force them to decide which conflict they want to interfere and not be able to move their capitalblob onto all smaller fights within 2 regions of their hq changes to local with an revamp of the scanner would also help making eve a better place againlowsec needs a boost as well ideally i would like to see a dedicated industry branch that is only available in lowsec implant production springs to mind here as seen in whspace people are not totally adverse to risk as long as they have enough reward and can have some fun getting the reward the knowledge gained there should be used to make lowsec more attractive
 i very much support this notionthe current jump range takes all strategy out of warfare and turns it into the tactical slugfest it currently isforce projection capabilities are a key factor in strategic warefare as it is now every major power block in eve can project a decisive force to nearly any point in the universe at nearly any given time
nerf might be the wrong word biggest problem i have with ecm is the drones and that they are too powerful another thing that needs looked at is the eccm as they are currently not in line with other counter measures

thats because youll probably only get the one
question for all candidatesif elected to the csm what balance changes to the game would you advocateyes we all want to see the ui improved and we all hate lag i want to hear you take a stand on an issue where the user population isnt in 100 complete agreement
as noted my campaign is primarily to fix the little things first  however some balance changes could be considered little changes as it wouldnt take much to implement the after speaking with many players regarding what theyd like to see precedence for the requirement of balance in these following areas is extantrockets  improve their viability as a small weapon number of potential solutions but something needs to be doneassault frigates  make these actually more appealing than flying a t1 frigate again some varying solutions but one i tend to prefer is giving them another bonus to keep in line with other t2 ships huginn  split weapon bonuses split ewar bonuses  bad for this shipdestroyers  currently they have a tough place in the hierarchy of ships they could use some thoughtjuicesferox  needs some slight improvement to bring it inline with other bcs perhaps a tad more cpupgthe list could go on but i feel overreaching only decreases your chances of getting anything accomplished at all however little feasible things is the way to go many ideas previously backed by csm have been rejected on the simple basis that they were too large if you value giving priority to little fixes like this vote for cinori aluben my priority is that ccp make these little things a priority cinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom

assault frigs already raised by erik finnegan on behalf of take caredestroyers raised by z0d on behalf of take carerockets raised by dierda vaal of eveuniin addition to that drone improvements are still on the backlog and related issues have been raised by take care ever since csm1 drones need implants damage modules and rigs like the other weapon systems im also a strong advocate of a reevaluation of hybrid weapons with the tracking issues of blasters in particularmost obvious balance issues have been raised by the csm a long time ago ccp promised to allocate 50 of their devtime to fixing old issues and making balance tweaks but now a year later this obviously isnt the case i am a critic of ccps expansion model where they keep steamrolling out unfinished expansions and jump on the bandwagon to the next one before all issues are ironed outthis in my opinion is the priority issue
destroyers already raised by dierdra vaal in csm3 pas the csm also goes over previous issues im sure to bring up destroyers afs and rockets among others balancing will always get some attention and is an ongoing process so the best thing we can do as csms is keep asking ccp for these changes
black ops  how about a better jump range then that of a snailassault frigates  make them useful somehow  somedayreworking of supercaps yes  i understand most people dont care about this  but atm they are increidbly unbalancedreworking of pirating insurance yes  pirates should exist  pirate insurance needs rebalancing howeverreworking of blasters  rails they both suck atman entire reworking of lowsec that it is a cool place to live for those not wanting to live in highsec  00a rebalancing of 00    reworking of    so many places to go  so much time so little to do  wait  srtike that  reverse it
most issues dont have 100 player agreement butid like to see ecm counters get some more attention it seems unbalanced that a welltanked bs fitted with two t2 eccms can be practically permajammed by one falcon and yet ive seen it happen quite a few times rather than buff one module eccm as many are calling for changes that would force fitting tradeoffs and increase unpredictability would make things more interesting on both sides of the battlefieldone idea along those lines to implement some skill  module combos that would passively affect specific jamming attributes of an enemy ship the cost to fit would have to be significant to force reasonable tradeoffs on the other side of the fence ecm modules might also be tweaked to have particular susceptibilities forcing ecm to more carefully consider their own fits i am no ecm expert by any stretch of the imagination thats why ecm balancing is the topic of one of my upcoming focus groups i want to hear what some ecm experts have to say on the matter as well as others focus group topic details and schedule will be published in separate posts hopefully this evening est after work woulda been sooner but a rather demanding software release this week is keeping me from focusing as much as id like on my internet spaceships agenda 
as a ecm specialist recons v etc i can tell you ecm is absolutely not overpowered can a single falcon pilot seriously hinder theres no such thing as perma jamming a eccmd battleship but if youre lucky you can get a few cycles in a row a eccm battleship yes but it needs all of its jammers to accomplish this if a recon pilot in an expensive but paperthin ship dedicates most of the mods on his ship most jammers signal distortion amps ecm rigs  so no notable dps or tank on a single target i feel its not unreasonable to seriously incapacitate that ship and of course you never hear about all those times people simply shot the poor falcon pilot because his jams failedour paper jamming ships already lost their range bonus  so were now in range of just about everyonesorry didnt want to derail the thread but people who want to keep nerfing ecm even after the recent changes make me raaaaaaaaggggeeeeeto make this post slightly constructive  if you agree with me that ecm does not need to be nerfed vote dv o
perfect then all of my suggestions have precedent as i mentioned thanks for giving more force to the validity of my post i will agree with you also that drone boats need a little bit of love from the sense of drone control and drone ai which would improve their effective dps and micromanagability of their power however drones should not become fittable miniships thats really pushing it those are the kind of ideas that past csms have put out that are too overreaching and ccp is going to whisk them to the side because theyre impractical unfeasible this and they should be able to use covops cloaks
dierdrerage if you must but also consider participating in the focus group and sharing your views i talk to plenty of folks that think ecm balance isnt quite there yet
what about adding a script to eccm so you for example could switch your sensor type imagine a tempest running around with amarr senosr would have to be balanced so if you switch sensor type you would only end up with about half your orginal sensor strength
black ops w covert cloaks im ambivalent on this one but since black ops main purpose in 00 warfare seems to be bridging in covert fleets rather than directly engaging the enemy so id say keep it the way it is firstthe bellicose  id really like to see the gun bonus swapped for a missile bonus and give it one more missile hardpoint to make it a minmatar missile cruiser  with target painting minmatar have a missile frigate and battleship so give them a cruiser too assault frigates  doing their bit to say sometimes its ok to fit an afterburner id like to see a bit more work on the aborted changes that were introduced during the development of dominion i love my harpy but my hawk suffers from the rocket balance problems which are also eternally being worked onecm  ewar in general  we have a bunch of ewar sensor systems anti sensor systems and theyre all kind of their own domain sensor boosters help you target faster or at longer ranges but are also a counter to sensor dampeners eccm makes your ships harder to jam but also makes your harder to probe down theres huge scope to rationalize all these mechanics into something a little more ordered and expand play options while were at itccp should consider making t1 ammuntion types affect falloff as well as optimal range because theres almost no point to fit anything other than the highest damage type in blasters or autocannons pulse lasers have decentish optimalalso on the subject of ammo i believe the game would benefit from some differentiation between faction ammo types that reflect races fighting style for example hybrid charges are produced by the caldari and gallente the ammo could reflect racial focus with the gallente version doing a coupleof percent points more in terms of damage and the caldari version giving a bit more range and lower cap use but with a smaller damage bonus and lets not forget noob ships  everybody flies these at some point the ibis  seriously its a caldari ship that cant mount missiles my first few ships were railgun platforms which meant i never really played with missiles until i was flying a rokh so make it harder for other noobs to make this kind of mistakethe impairor  while im on the subject of noob ships its bonus is ridiculous you cant fit enough lasers to make the laser cap bonus matter switch it to a laser damage bonus for some fairness the velator has almost too much damage switch it to a 10 falloff range bonus for hybrids so it doesnt need to spend forever getting close
yes we can we can hope we can dream but when we wake up the only csm candidate ready for the future is me and the future is coming its coming and its bringing with it massive changes to production pvp armored kodiak bears attack blimps and enough weaponized robots to turn hope into a fourletter word you want hope keep dreaming you want change put out your cup you want freedom vote for me as csmsome may say that my bid for csm is too late in the game late to the race late to the party well i say the party doesnt get started until i arrive and while the other candidates are serving special interests im serving the good people of eve a steaming pile of change with a side order of suck itwhen people ask about my position on gate camping i have two words for them attack dogs no turrets no concord just dogs attack dogs its time for people to learn that this freedom isnt freevote for me if you want to liveplumpy mcpudding for csm screw em all the whistles go woo woo
from what i gather the ideas that are brought up for the csm to push forward to ccp have to be voted on by the csm and ccp will only look at the ones that are unanimousso what happens when someone like ankwhatever is on the csm now i believe that she will get voted on as most people that will vote for her dont read the forums or actually agree with her idea of a personal single player gamesay for example when a proposal is raised to the csm that ultimately makes gameplay in hisec better like the proposal of docking timers related to ship size but will affect a lot of players negatively what happens if ank finds this affects her beloved mission runners ie their loot pinatas when wardecced get creamed trying to dock so she votes against it does this matter and the proposal will go through on a majority or does it need to be unanimous of all csm memberswhat im getting at here is that someone with so polar opposite gameplay ideas to what the game actually is especially with the new terms to csm members could actually make the csm obsolete what course of actions are available to rectify this
the process is as followsa proposal is raised in the assembly hall forum it has to be in there for at least 7 days before the meeting for public review comments and supports even csm delegates have to abide by this rulea full delegate not alternate then raises the proposal which puts it onto the next meeting agenda adding it to the wikiat the meeting the proposal is debated if needed and then put to a voteif a majority is reached then the proposal is added to the next iceland summit for discussion with ccpif a majority is not reached then the proposal is rejectedthus a single delegate cannot block anything nor can they push something through without getting majority support so any candidate unable to play well with others is going to find it tricky
thank you teadaze apologies for the misconception that it had to be unanimous
most of the issues i proposed during csm 1 and 2 were accepted unanimous by the csm though the polar opposite ideas are a myth propegated by a few trolls and slanderers here on the forums
keep on spinnin you honest politician you
id imagine that pvp and 00sec issues will have a fair representation seeing as so many seats will probably go to the big alliances alot of people play the way anhk does and they deserve a voice  whether it is through her or someone else but i imagine the seats for that play style will be smallim sure ill get bagged for say this but atleast she puts alot of effort into her campaign tamber
we are the mice who have been handed the bell by the catany power the csm has is by the grace of ccplooks up and reads the above and shakes his headbut    i dont think they are just paying it lip service i do think that we will have an effect on the gamelook at the platforms and you can see those who have their own personal axes to grind those who are trying to mouth the words and hope they get picked for the choir and those who are willing to represent the population and make the game better not just a corner of the game but the whole damn thing but in the words of the old joke how does one eat an elephant one bite at a time we have to say where we will start but if you are looking for someone to kick in ccps doors and start making demands at the top of their lungs    you are going to be wasting your vote change does not come to the screamers    it comes to the people who can make a reasoned argument combined wiht a suggestion for how things could be betterm
so many agree with the points above and glad to see it as someone wise proposed the business model a few posts up yet even with so many existing csm candidates trying to return to their existing seats     so few actually showing a history of doing these things no names mentionedvote them all out even if you dont vote for metime for a change
same reply as every other black ops threaddo not make them any better at offense or defensedo give them more range for jump andor better fuel usage for jumping the gangdo give them covert ops cloakdo make them cheaperless mats for buildit is a fragile special use ship it is designed to get groups where they could not usually travel and do it covertly the whole covert concept goes out the window when a black ops has to warp anywhere at presentif black ops are given better resists andor dps they will become pvp ships which we have plenty of already not every ship in the game needs to be a damage dealer
heyim comming back to the game after a long break so i might be a bit rusty but id like to add my 2 cents to the argument the problem is in the ships you can have an awesome armor repair amount or tracking but in the end of the day you only have one bonus to damage you move with the speed and grace of a brick in a bucket of tar and have minimal effective range gallente ships partialy because of blasters but mostly because of the ships design are easy to exploit when going into fight with minmatar and amarr ships you know youre going in with a handicap theyll do damage sooner and you wont be able to balance that cause you dont do much more damage overall if they can pull range on you youll die without chances to win going against caldari blaster boats is kicking yourself in the balls because they have your dps and alot better tank ofcourse all of this applies to caldari too but theyre alot more effective with null in scrambler range also they have easier time fitting ion guns due to low pg requirement on shield tankid simply reduce the mass of gallente and caldari blaster boats because i cant wrap my head around the fact that ships with lowest range are one of the slowestalso goumindong and nightmarex your elaborated examples matter only to you and dont matter on a daily basis i dont have much to work with here but it doesnt seem you have any experience with blasters at all
dude u just admited that u are not using blasters u never were and never will so in this case u are arguing against blaster buff just because u are either afraid of blasters beeing better then they are now and your tactics of killing blaster boats with range and better dps will become obsolete or u are afraid that u will have to skill some other weapons too to use them in some situationsanyway i think blasters should be death bringers and that is fast and heavy death bringers they were until two things happened hp buff all accross the universe and web nerf with first we couldnt do anymore hit melt run tactics u have to stay there and risk it to be blobed or get problems with tracking since webs cannot hold stuff still anymore with second even if u got into fair equal fight any sane pilot will start orbit u and slowly moving away thus causing problems with tracking and sooner or later get into your falloff where your eft dps doesnt count anymorei was specced pilot for gallente and i respecced to amarr and minie just because gallente became slowest hitters and meh when it came to fightingi still rather choose lasers beacuse it gives me engagement range of 45km with scorch 15km with mf for 90 dps of 5km ranged blasters or projectiles for engagement range of 30km with short range ammo good tracking and no cap usage while ships are fast and agile
strongly supportedlong range weapons i give a crap about but if blasters get their chainsawofeveflavor back omg close range weapons would be so balanced and each with its own flavor sweet
completely supported i want to fly my blasterships again even though i do love my lasers and autos lol
if youve bothered to read what ive wrote on the issuesee link in sig you will know that that clearly is not the case
goum likes the status quo but wants artillery nerfed a bit so his lasers are the best choice in all situations again
what seriously what is it with you and lying the changes that i proposed boost blaster boats specifically cruisers specifically frigates specifically and the only changes to laser ships bar frigates and cruisers are nerfs
im not sure where the lie wasbattleships are largely balanced  you like the status quo for bsyou want local reps to be boosted to handle instant damage  indirect nerf to artilleriesif your argument is that lasers are not the best choice in pvp i guess that can be debated overwhelmingly most people would argue that lasers are the best choice in pvp though bar midrange where high damage artillery ships shineat the same time as boosting local reps you switch the local rep bonuses from several gallente ships with the resist bonuses on several amarr ships net change amarr have bonuses for the new and improved local reps and gallente are left with incompatible fitting options higher builtin resists mean a plate is a better choice than resistance mods but plates slow your ship down which you dont want on a blaster shipyou are arguing against a boost for blasters in this thread remember yet claiming you propose a boost for blastersthese points withstanding i agree that cruisers and frigates need to be reworked as the roles laid out for them in 2003 have been completely overshadowed or removed by other ships since that timeoh i also dont agree with this nerf t2 talk
and what did i change about bs balance you didnt actually check did youuhhh are you reading the same thing that i am reading because that is not what i suggested and that is not what would happen in either caseuhh yea you didnt read it did you not only did i not suggest thatneither boosting local reps in that manner or giving amarr those bonuses but to suggest that resistance bonuses are worse than rep bonuses man what you should just hang your hat in shame at that one seriously you should not be having any discussion on balance if you think that onei am arguing against a boost for blasters because boosting blasters is a terrible idea it will not fix the problem and will simply create more whines just like the laser boosts and the ac boostswhat nerf t2 talk no one suggested that
you can lament all day long here goumindong blasters will get boostedits only a matter of time so please for the sake of godstfu gtfo of the forums for once and get some fresh air you seem to be in urgent needand people stop replying to him he is a fanatical antigallente troll and some kind of wannabeassemblyhallcelebrityaccording to the time he spends trolling gallentebalancing related threads he has absolutely no life at all he is doing such since years nowdunno what this is all about but maybe he is trying to force a meme and wants to become a forum celebrity or somethingyou cant argue with him because he will always find another excuse and twist your words so just ignore him he throws unrealistic dps numbers into discussions not considering falloff etc when you tell him that his numbers are off he babbles something about its not all about the dpssorry mate but you are just ridiculousi eagerly await your whines when something will finaly be done about the blaster problems
you made the maelstrom a more agile battleship because turning was apparently a problem you gave the mega longer lock range and increased scan strength neither matter if the ship cant get into range you made the hype slightly faster which is a slight boost to a solo blaster fitfor battleships the fitting of repairboosters units needs to be brought down closer to the level of 1600mm platesextenders this is a huge boost to local reps the ability to fit more reps than could be fit previouslyastarte gets resists loses reps absolution gets reps loses resists brutix gets a resist bonus loses rep bonus while im at it wtf omeni highlighted the part where you agree with me you dont want to boost blasters you think a little more speed or a little extra targeting rangestrength is what they needsmall boosts that are diminished when you also boosted other shipsyou want to cut the skill requirements for them effectively everyone who has put the time in to use them will be left with having trained to level 5 if you forget doing this the jump from lvl4 to lvl5 is extremely long as being a minor boost in damage making t2 the baseline means the training people put in does not provide as much of an advantage as it used to less advantage  nerf
do not feed the troll
do not argue with goumindong
sometimes i think he sincerely believes this stuff i mean he wrote a 19 page document and a little rational criticism is all it will take for him to realize that he is wrong then he argues that the rokh is bordering on being an overpowered ship
no the rokh is truely an op ship it was proven with math why cant you still accept it
how about we continue this here no need to clutter this thread with discussions that are not towards the merits of the proposal in the op which is about increasing the range or damage on all blasters because of a perceived inadequacy of the weaponsif only you had rational criticismstill waiting on that explanation for how repair amt bonus  resist bonus by the way the nickname for eve has always been spreadsheets online and its not because the math doesnt correspond to the gameplay
pretty simple yet can be useful
me like it
its obviously both or people wouldnt be trying so hard to take away one facet the handeye coordination part of it i suck at manual piloting old and slow but i wouldnt really want to see it dumbed downnot supported
i doubt ccp would go for that particular suggestion i believe theyve said before they dont want to make local any more of an intel tool then it already is dont get me wrong i wouldnt object to that change but i doubt theyd go for it combined with the removal of portraits it would be an amazing intel tool but id settle for just removing the portraits

you have my support for bms on grid showing in spaceperhaps a perbm checkbox or perbmfolder to say if you want it displayed that is possibly terribly processor intensive though
good idea
yes please
great ideas1
more interesting lowsec im in
1 for this idea tessen
this is a fairly standard utility that eve doesnt have we can change our portraits and quite possibily our avatar come eve incarna we can even transfer characters to other accounts however we cannot change our nameswhy is this is significantnecessary it probably isnt for most people not until were able to express our characters in greater detail with incarna but i dont imagine it being a difficult feature to impliment technically the mechanics are already there given names can be changed for breaches of eves tosit will allow those who want a more lore abiding name to change it for a price and it will also allow feroxguy apologies if that exists to find something more appropriatename change fees and limited uses will act as a deterrent for any shifty behaviour given players are able to create spy alts and engage in other metagame activities makes a name change seem pretty harmless anyway the best deterrent however would be to create an ingame persona or alias history that mimics employment history so in summarypaid name changelimited changes per accountingame alias historyvery long cool down interval between name changes if more than one is allowed
should be limited to once imo but supportedive been wanting to change the numbers out of my name for years
i agree that once is all that you should be able to do with this we can also have the name at the top rather than a name change tab for instance it would appear like spaceman aka feroxguy in the information window or maybe just have it listed under employment historysupported as there are a few characters whose names i wish to change
i would expand it to include during character transfers but i would be ok with a once in a lifetime name change as long as as bunyip states the old name is clearly visible and we can insure that standings and everything else are associated with the character id in the database not the name ergo changing your name doesnt erase the standings people have set to youedit and by clearly visible i mean up on the show info panel by your current name like bunyip also said not buried in the employment history or something
you can already change your name via character trading making it harder to keep track of people by reputation in a game where reputation is so important is just a bad idea not supported
identity is extremely important in eve and i can see this getting extremely messy if this proposal was introduced even though your proposal suggests a way to track past names most people probably wouldnt bother clicking a showinfo to find this information out if you do something naughty with your character you shouldnt be able to just change your name and wipe your slate clean there must be consequences to your actions ingameyouve made a decent proposal but i must trust the little voice inside me screaming no and not supporttamber
this not even with a name history you would get my support
if a bunch of folks dont have the extra isk to buy plex wont the price of plex come downcertainly but as the price of datacores goes up the folks who arent farming them will start wont they eventually there will be more paying customers farming datacores as opposed to inactive alts on unpaid accounts farming datacores market will return to present status as pvpers decide to spend the couple of months training to do rd there will no doubt be a short term spike in prices as the supply ramps up to meet demandthis is not an exclusive market anyone can train the appropriate skills on their characters and farm datacores theres no barrier to entry beyond training some skills and building rep with some npc corporations
as it stands right now i can only use t2 close range turret ammo on ships using t2 close range missile ammo
i think that would make a more balanced solution to the projectile problem too a flat cap cost changes the role of the gun as the only noncap using gun

how does ccp tell if legit software installed on a computer is being used for macro purposes in eve or notthey dont they cant this proposal is ridiculousthe same software that is used to macro eve is amazingly useful for a wide variety of purposesi would rather be more productive at work then play eve but i dont think id deserve to be banned for using software at work to increase my productivitythis is a blind proposal that doesnt see the issue clearly and has put forward a solution that hurts the innocent more then those it is designed to targetcome up with a good solution and ill be behind it but this i hate macros lets make eve  talk is just stupidand no i dont macro and i dont encourage it within my corp but i do enjoy that eve isnt full of minigames software scanners and other harebrained solutions
again i think that there are different topics being discussed herethe macros you are referring to keyboard and mouse macros are something that are caught in a broad definition of the term and an eula needs to be broadly defined so that its hard to get around its wordingthe kind of macro that is being opposed is the software that runs the eve client automatically without any input from a human being and is specifically designed for that purpose alonestrictly these are not macros but applications or scripts unfortunately the same kind of technology is used for keyboard and mouse macros so its hard to tell the difference from the server sidemy suggestion would be that it would look for specific software known to be used explicitlyexclusively for running an eve client its not hard to find them and then if that software again being very specific here is installed the eve client wont runccp has every right to have their software not run if they know for certain that the eula is being breached having software installed which has the sole purpose of breaching the eve eula is a pretty good signif its legit macro software used for productivity then that comes under a grey area as it could potentially be used to breach the eula but it also could be legitimate so i would take an innocent until proven guilty approach
if this proposal is for anything like blizzards approach then people are being banned simply for having the wrong brand of keyboard
actually one of the brilliant things about eve is the way the design minimizes the number of commands that need to be passed from client to server in most mmos youre making keystrokes and clicks many times a second all of which turn into commands that have to go to the server in eve thats reduced by several orders of magnitudeand im not suggesting logging every single keystroke and mouseclick of every user im suggesting that once you are 99 sure youre dealing with a macro you turn on logging for that user to get sufficient data to fully bust them on the other hand if you feel that someone unloading their cargohold every 323431 milliseconds exactly is enough evidence then you dont need to log anything beyond thaton an interesting side note when you ban a macrominer or automated goldfarming bot or what have you usually the person you ban just goes and buys a new cd key on a business model where each cd key costs 40 that gives the game company a lot of revenue from replacements for banned accounts on the other hand ccp makes their money on subscription and little on upfront software costs so maybe the same enforcement incentive isnt there in this casethen again the new accounts still have to train up chars to fly the mackinaws or hulks or buy said characters off the market either way ccp should see increases of account subscriptions for that training but the revenue stream is much more murky here than with other games

well actually other mmos do it heres a clip from the competitors press release based on a warden account banin keeping with blizzards aggressive stance against cheating in world of warcraft we banned over 30000 accounts in the month of may and with that removed well over 30 million gold from the economy across all realms the banned accounts were taking part in activities that violate the games terms of use including using thirdparty programs to farm gold and items which severely impacts the economy of a realm and the overall game enjoyment for all playersthis press release is a couple years old but in terms of eve currency that probably equates to about 3 trillion iskso yes it can be done because its been proven successful simply put ccp buys the macro software looks at the code and then writes its own specific code to detect it the code is then implemented accounts running these specific applications are flagged reviewed and banned youre not going to beat that solo programmer who writes his own macro those guys will keep writing them just to try to beat the ccp guys at their own game but the guys who are writing the code explicitly to make a profit on ccp ip will walk due to the constant investment in time and resources to make their programs function it will no longer be profitable nor will it be profitable for people who get banned due to the amount of time required to get another hulk pilot skilled and back out making isk using a new macro application only to have it detected and banned againjava edited for typo
mining is an afk activity you dont need a macro because the game does everything for you without input until your ship is full or the asteroid dies in both cases this can take over an hour what do you need a macro formining is like shooting a pos turn on ts turn on guns turn on the tv

bumping this for more attention
this proposal was up on the last csm meeting but there was some confusion as to what was intendedlet me clarify this if i cani would want a new extra rightclick option which should only appear if you are a ceo with the majority of the votes in your corp this new rightclick option should be stating automatically lockdown this bpo and if you click yes to that your bpo should be locked down without a 24 hour delay and without the need for a vote processthe reason this change would be beneficial is that normally you have to go through a long and painful process just to get to the voting option for a new bpo see op and then you have a needless 24 hour waiting period where the other share holders can vote  but if you have the majority of the shares why the delay after a concluded vote the ceo has to actually approve of the vote toothat is really tedious and a waste of time for players who are usually doing a lot of tasks in eve too sure we all play eve but ceos and working directors are very likely doing more than joe random player why not help the ceos save some time and be less annoyed at a ridiculously bureaucratic processso in short please support this proposal
this module will have one purpose only and that is to cause your ship to self destruct and do major harm to othersin addition to the initial self destruct aoe damage it will also do a secondary ew function tootheir suicide aoe will be 10km and do race specific damage default damage set at 50 x base hp totalfor example amarr suicide module  will do em damage only so say your ship has a base hp of 10k and you activate this next to 2 people they will each receive 5k dmg  0 resistsin addition to this the ship will give off a second type of aoeamarr  everything in a 25km radius will have a minor penalty to optimal range and tracking of turrets like tracking disruptorscaldari  everything in a 25km radius will jammed like ecmgallente  everything in a 25km radius will have a minor penalty to targeting range and scan resolution like sensor dampenersminmatar  everything in a 25km radius will have a increased signature radius and a reduction in speed like webs  target paintersthe module will have a 5 second activation timer before exploding you will be unable to move  warp and the only way to prevent exploding is to be destroyed before the 5 seconds are upactivating this module will cause you to have all your resists reduced by 50 too this wont affect the damage given out but will obviously affect your hp you can use this in all space however the second you activate it in hi sec you will immediately get aggression and attacked by concorde careless of if you are close to someone or even if you deactivateuses similar to a last stand protocol like a upgraded version of self destructing only with styleyou can deactivate this module by clicking it however your penalties will still remainthis can be fitted on anything that has hi slots is useful for caps in the event of traps
words can not describe how horrible this idea is please give it some more thought next time
does concord get to kill your pod
he is our troll for this week what do you expect
dont feed the troll
there is a nice risk reward mechanic involved in this it would be a nice addition to super caps just in case something goes wrongseveral self destruct mechanisms work like this in general and it would make a great additioni forgot to mention pos will get a anchorable structure that has this too however the range will change i will make a seperate thread about it laterpeople obviousily wont be able to abuse this as you in effect lose your ship using it in hi sec while allowed is very difficult todoit makes up for not having bombs in low sec too and is a nice ability too i always find before a ship dies that their should be some last stand offensive attack ideal against blobs tooimagine this a big 00 alliance invading a small alliance the small alliance is limited to stealth bombers and suicide bombers only however the big alliance will have nothing but super caps and capsas it is now the big alliance will win i understand big alliances are threatened by this but surely this change wont cause you to lose space
people already can selfdestruct super caps do it often to prevent the attackers from getting a killmail and still get the insurance payout add aoe and you will assuredly have a fleet self destruct in jita for lolz on a regular basis
as i said concorde will intervene in hi sec well before they explode this will also be a module so the chances of a dread sacrificing a weapon  siege mod for this wouldnt happen unless their plan was to suicideit would create surprising situations plus 5 sec gives alot of time for weaker ships to escape the damage raidus is worse than bombs but it could change the outcome of a battle and create some interesting situationsimagine spotting several ships which you cant take out alone solution is either to bomb or now suicide gank give them a dread bubble them and in 5 seconds 700k dmg will be dealtmost sci fi related stuff have some last stance protocol this is generally why a self destruct is there and this would make a great additioni understand you feel threatened but this would only add creativity to fleet fights again yet not as op as dds
threatened i would use this a lot you could grab some rokhs take off the fittings except this module platinum insure them and run through 00 until you happen upon a camp then sd way more fun than buildarokhsdarokh for isk
has anyone else noted that caldari will jam everyone while the other effects are described as minor i foresee many blokhs
it would be far more effective using lockbreaker bombs tbh i did think having a neut aoe on amarr ones but void sd seems a little opthe jamming itself will affect everyone so it wouldnt really work well unless you go in solo first anyway
so fit to a small sig frigate with heated shield hardeners and shield booster activate module when close all ships no sorry all enemy ships lose locksor a few max shield extended discoing or fof shooting bssessince you wont need a lot of skills and it is only needed as a throwaway thing this can be done by an alt is about 2 months then alttab back to your main and see a severely weakened enemy blobnow many people would not dream to bring an alt to a fight because they require maintainance in time but this would be a gamebreaking side dishoh and in before the lag monkeys
skill wise i was going to leave that open for discussion but i did think about the person having bomb deployment v in order to use this plus if this happened and people used a frig considering the penalities you get it would be very hard to set offsaying that the ecm wont have a 100 jam i wont bother with numbers atm and not to mention 25km radius for 1 aoe jam isnt really all that op but for the sake of numbers lets say its 50 of the ships current sensor str so a rokh would only be 12 str jam
currently from radar loot you can get things like second hand parts etc which are used to create data interfaces for invention you also get the blueprints for data interfaceshowever because data interfaces are hardly destroyed they will probably become pretty much worthless if you are stuck on a stack of interface blueprints and not enough new players will do invention to make them worth creating in the future that means that second hand parts electronic links elemental crux etc will also be worthless i currently find myself leaving the parts to create interfaces behind because i have too manyi think the csm should look into the radar loot and maybe see if the parts to create interfaces can be used for other things interfaces should degrade over time and be unrepairable like t2 crystals this would ensure that the market for interfaces and their construction components would not be in vain
rumor has it that tech ii bpos are getting killed if that happens invention is going to increase to fill the void i doubt anyone is going to say much on the subject though
regardless of whether or not t2 bpos exist there will remain an upward limit on demand for data interfaces because they do not die
with new players coming in every day possible inventors in the future there wont be much of an upward limit
since the new probe system every noob and his brother are doing exploration and now the market is flooded with interfaces and bpcs of them so those things are now worth very little i would say go into low sec but i have not found anything different in low sec that i can find in high sec when it comes to radar sites so null sec is your best bet for better radar loot such as ship data interfacespersonally i would like to see exploration take a lot more skilling to stop so many people getting into it and make sites harder to lock thus needing most exploration skills at 4 or 5 to get a lock i use to enjoy doing wormholes too but now i cant even find one that does not have people living there and since they can probe me out in less than a min kinda pointless im just frustrated with exploration in general i cant even go into low sec without either getting probed out in seconds so i have to run and i waste so much time or if i stick to high sec i have to compete with 2 month old toons for 410 deadspace and such then i get called a carebare for running plexes in high sec just cuz i dont want to pvp in a pve fit vs 5 people that are pvp fit i also dont want to fly with a gang to explore cuz then i have to split the profit which sucks these days cuz everyone doing exploration and prices are crap which is the root of the problem hmmm i may make my own thread on the exploration topic but i doubt people will see it my way and i really doubt ccp would to
you really think new inventors enter the game as fast as that loot drops i mean at any given time there are a hundreds thousands of radar sites available to explore in the gamethe player base is growing but no where near that fast especially because only a small number will go into invention
easy solution  damage interfaces on each use so they are destroyed eventually there limit is gone and the prices are back up until they reach some balanceinterface and decryptor prices fell so muchsince i started exploring over a year ago i dont even bother with radars anymore interfaces are worth 110th of what they used to decryptors are at 15th probably
tech i bpos dont die only tech ii crystals die giving laser users a huge cost savings over ammo users scripts dont dieis there a legitimate reason why they should be a consumable these things are found from anomalies right the most profitable profession needs a boost
this is a good idea
t1 bpos have a base price because they are sold by npcs if they were dropped like data interfaces they would sell for next to nothing in no time crystals scripts dont die you could argue modules dont die for that matter you could argue ships dont die oh wait have you seen how often ships with all those modulesscripts on them go boom they die all the timei dont think youve tried exploration if you think it is the most profitable profession if you are referring to the ability to find wspace and make big isk ratting there i think that is a different argument entirely you have to understand when people find the radar sites they get grumpy then move on to find something else
with the current local chat there is no point of seting up an ambush because you know a ship just ratting in a belt is a bait ship if there is 10 other reds in the same systemor a couple jumps away which can be easily known without probing or watching gatesi say just delete the participant list on local chats
yeah baitblob needs a boost pls fix ccp ok
only supported if static belts are removed and made part of the exploration system that way everyone has to work for what they are after
whs already defacto require that you use a covops cloaking ship or alt with covops cloaking ship to catch people which is cool because you have variety and stuff and people who like that system have something to dohowever i really do not support making all of eve the same as whs the current system enables you to find targets wout a heavily specialized ship or alt but it also enables those targets to see you coming if theyre watching local which makes for a rather reasonable systembut yeah removing local would have to go hand in hand with something like that else you completely break all nonexploration stuff
i remember reading an old devblog which mentioned that they were planning to remove static belts and add them into the exploration system but allowing the basic system scan to scan down some of the lower end belts while leaving the higher ends only findable via probes
could probably make some noise here questions for todays ccp hammerhead interview
it works in wormholes why not lowsecnullsec not to mention it makes covert ops ships much more valuble in gangs because of scanning power this would fit perfectly with the deep safe changes coming
again no local would destroy regular pvp do you know why there are occasional carrier losses in wspace because wspace is so safe that you can rat in carriers thats what no local does catching people ratting is rare in fact i would guess more people die to sleepers than to pvp in wspace
this i cant believe how easily trolled some people are d
it is almost a good idea but entered the epic fail zone when it went to losec you go to losecnulsecwspace you take your chancesnow in hisec concord offers consequences but not protection the consequences are obviously too low as one can find suicidegank grief squads anywhere you find highend mission running who hasnt seen the wad of sensorboosted fullyinsured cheap bss waiting for a tengu to undockmake the consequences a tad stiffer for obvious nonwardec hisec griefing one day ban every time a hisec illegal kill takes place three day ban after the 5th kill within 30 daysnot too harsh for those who still cannot live without carebear tears or really must have the loot from that iti5 full of bpcs yet may tweak the killing down a tad on those who just want to play with their shineys in hisecanother alternative is all insurance is voided for any player who takes part in nonsanctioned hisec pvp as the aggressor this option would allow for serious griefers to not only get a kill but possibly get a newb to aggress first and lose his insurance as well as his shipjust a mental exercise really as nothing like this will ever happen
i am here to propose a complex solution for ewar this proposal is based on following opinions there need to be several ewar types viable in a game all equally viable and important the worst of them need to have counters i am not discussing target painters here as they are very different from most ewar types and i do not see much wrong with them target painting drones are worthless 5 sig rad bonus per drone and a stacking penalty really apart from that everything is fine so we have following pieces of ewar and there counters at the momentwarp scramblerdisruptor warp core stabs webefier  afterburnermwdtracking disruptor tracking computersensor dampener sensor boosterenergy neutralizers  energy vampires or any module that improves capnow lets look in more detail first of all i think warp disruptors and webbers work as desired when we get into other types of ewar there is some attention needed every single modulecounter has a positive effect upon its shipcarrier that generally improves its performance that provides incentive to fit that module as it will be usefull even if no ewar of that type is applied to your ship vampires help you with cap sensor booster provide faster lock time and lock range tracking computer improves your effective dps by improving accuracy of your guns eccm drains your cap and does nothing yes ladies and gentlemen if a falcon does not show up on the field eccm is totally worthless its an empty slot even worse because if it was empty you could at least use it as a heatsink when overloading now lets look at effects ewar has on combat effishiency of a targetwebscram decreases target velocity making it harder for target to avoid damage also traps target in place preventing it from running target still fights back with full powersensor dampener decreases targets lock range meaning target cannot fire on you unless target gets close to you only useful when you can outrun your target target can still remoterep stacking penalty present energy neutst shuts down targets active tank if taken to extreme target might not be able to fire cap dependant weapons only used on large vessels and specialist ships target can still fight back in case of buffer tank and buffer independent weapon it has no effect upon combat capability of the target victim can counter it by getting out of relatively short neut range disabling cap intensive modulestracking disruptor  can decrease amount of incoming damage by decreasing optimal range and tracking of turret based ship useless against drones missiles doomsdays bombs only useful when fighting a less mobile target when you can outrun target and stay out of its optimal and when you can keep your transversal above his tracking has no effect on remotereps energy transfers so on stacking penalty present ecm  stops any remote effects from the target no damage no remote reps no shooting nothing not only that but eccm is worthless on small ships as it cannot boost their sensor strength enough to resist ecm this is also the only nonnumerical ewar type without a stacking penalty what i suggest we do add a stacking penalty to ecm you cans still jam the same amount of people however putting more then 34 jammers on one target wont work anymore though that means that if someone has 2 eccms fitted they are nearly unjammable i find it fare that if one dedicates two full slots to countering one specific ewar type out of 6 total ewar types he deserves some fair protection from that ewar type after all how useful is arazy against a ship with two sensor boosters why should target painters the poorest of all ewar types have a stacking penalty and ecm should not
as well eccm needs to have no stacking penalty what that means yeah if someone really hates your falcon he can put 8 mid slots full of eccm and never get jammed i think that is fair same goes for sensor backup arrays now apart from that the percentage bonus needs to be replaced with a numerical value so that eccm is equally useful for all types of ships say each eccm adds 20 sensor strength now if a captor frigate marauder carrier ships fit that they all gain same amount of protection this is a eccm nerf on carriers does nothing for battleships boosts eccms usefulness to everything else ofcourse exact figures might need adjustment but i think i got the general idea across now this is still the only module that is useless to fit if you dont meet an ecm boat so what shall we do initially i wanted to merge it with sensor boosters because logically these things should be corelated but that would essentially render the ecm boats worthless as everyone and there grandma would fit a module that makes them invulnerable to sensor dampeners ecm and makes them lock faster so for a lack of better idea lets merge function of eccm and a passive targeting system i think this is about the best choice weve currently got which makes the module at least marginally useful as an alternative it could allow you to lock more targetssensor backup arrays this module sucks it gives you very little sensor strength and takes off damage modstank i have three options and i cannot decide which one should go through1 remove the sensor strength boost and let it allow for unconditional acquisition of one target no matter what happens lock on that one target will be maintained 2 merge its functionality with singal amplifier that way you get a module that is gonna help with eccm and damps and gives you targeting speed 3 as an alternative merge it with signal amplifier and let it reduce sensor recovery time by half so you only spend half of the time jammed as you normally would this means that for each one of these modules you would need twice as many jammers on you as you normally would to permajamm you i fundamentally disagree with the way ccp made marauders particularly vulnerable to only one type of ewar why make them only vulnerable to ecm not neutrolisers wbefiers or anything else the logic is beyond my understanding if it was for me i would like to redo the entire sensor system and tie ecm eccm damps and sensor boosters together logically
fixed sensor strenght will make unprobable frigs easy but everything else will stray behind i want to be able to fit together an unprobable loki with fixed sensor strengthnow making the low slot module give a fixed lower say 15 bonus and the mid slot an active bonus as is now might be a lot better this would fix part of the stacking problems as wellabout stacking for incoming ecm that i can see as useful the  calculation should not be very hard
although i do not exactly agree to your proposal as a whole i love the idea about eccms and passive targeters being merged together this will give some more really need usefulness to both of these modulesso you get my 12 support ps please bear in mind that im not an ecm pilot so sorry for my dogmatic approach im not going to argument why i dont agree with the ecm changes as i am an eccm pilot 
unprobable ships mecanic is to be honest stupid how on earth does sensor strength make any ship easierharder to scan down i say we just replace scannability of all ships with a fixed value and thats it end of story
hehe 0 support as it should remain p
ive asked this same question many times people get downright militant if you suggest this shouldnt happen thoughback to the idea of eccm v ecm fitting 12 eccm on most ships would defeat ecm by making it significantly less likely to be jammed the only time when this is not true is when an ecm ship is fit specifically for your ship ie they know exactly what you are flying and have had time to prepare in that case ecm should jam the crap out of you  working as intended the reason people complain about ecm is because there are no other benefits to fitting eccm unlike other ewar counters this should be the counter to ecm
i fear it risks undermining the fact that the underlying ecm mechanic needs to be looked at chance based thumbtwiddleall the ewar needs a going over to bring it up to speed with the numerous changes to modules and ships that have taken placebut if you want to limit yourself to treating a symptom by buffing eccm try this outeccm both mid and low keep their  boost but with a second static modifier of 10 which one is used depends on the ship it is fitted upon so that a bs gets the  value and smaller ships get the static  whichever yields higher strengthadd to that your idea of having eccm directly counteract the ecm by reducing jam time up to a maximum of 50 ie around 10s to get that maximum reduction you would need 34 modules so that ecm is not made completely useless perhaps let it be determined by base sensorsboosted sensors ratio up to the ceiling to allow smaller ships using the static modifier to get there with fewer modulespassive targeters are useless no matter what you tag them on you very rarely needwant to target more than what is allowed for a given ship and the skill is deadfast to train rank 1by making eccm actually influence not just the chance of a jam but the quality of the jam you are more than halfway towards a bearable system and wont need artificial read useless effects to be slapped onto eccmonly because it treats a symptom and not the disease ecm on the whole is phenomenally broken as a mechanic and module both and needs some serious attention  but it must be done without breaking the caldari as it is all they have damps are meh but gallente t2 ewar boats are still in use thanks to the second point range bonus minnies are still used despite the web hit and the amarr were able to weather the neutnos change by spamming cap injectors on everything
so every ship should be scannable that i oppose vigorouslyeither a module is made to lower scannability or the game as it is now is nothing like the new situation
rr  involved in a fight  needs to get docking timernothing needs to be done to docking for non agressed shipslamers need to get off the stations and go find a real fight
how about just increasing the docking timer when you engage in aggression one minute is awfully short
if rr was aggression and got criminal flags life near empire stations would be dramatically different however that would not fix docking games in 00
perhaps had a boss skill for this unit that includes some additive measure of tracking disruption very small signature radius and much larger bonus mods in my mind what the inital idea here is to have an electronic version of the interceptorwhich in general is not a hateful idea
so basically you want the ewar cruisers being able to have support from ewar frigates when bridgingwhy not give hacs covert ops cloak too so they can support the ewar cruisers and then give afs covert ops cloak to support the ewar frigsnot supported and tbh there is not much wrong with the ships they are damn powerful in frigate class engagements and are flimsy for a good reason
please no there are already far too many cloaking ships in the game and there are heavily used and all cloaking gangs are too commonplaceeas are meant to be frigate equivalents of the combat recons there are already two classes of covert ops cloaking frigates might as well put covert ops cloaks on every ship lame
itd make more sense to actually move the combat recons out of the covert tree and into an eas tree instead of needing covops 4 as a prerequisite force recons need eas 4as for eas themselves ive had a quick fly in a sentinel and while it was fun theyre far too fragile for their cost so as others have said an increase in hitpoints would help
how about this have two types of electron frig have one being a combat frig that is tougher and one a covert ops which has a cloakthe two recon ships would have the covops and eas skills as prerequisite as you suggested like the command ships have logistics and has skills as prerequisite
this wholeheartedly supporting how do we know they suck because only about 20 ewar frigs are sold every day in jita just the crow alone outsells them over twice as much every day ive only had one pilot fly them consistently in my entire pvp career
instead of piling on more contentheres a few examples out of many hundreds that it could fixdrone interfacecorp management interfacethe login queue hanging up and not logging us in when till we exit and restart eve even though were 2 in the queueblastersrailgunsexploration sites dropping useless large t2 bpcszooming in on our pods when our ships explode so that our computers lag out even if we have ship explosions turned offclarification essentially the next big patch should mostly include design user interface etc and bug fixes gameplaymechanic fixes like hybrid rebalancing should be secondary throwing in too many at once would probably create more problems than it would fix however a few gameplay changes should be fine

supporting my on topic
i support your listed topics that need some work but i would not support a new update soley to fix old mechanics the chances that something could get broken even more while they fix everything would probably be very high due to the complexity of the game and code i would however support incrimental fixes like they already include in each patches but on a larger scaledo you however have any solutions for these issues specifically for the blastersrailguns balancing if you do please post here or share with me in a convotamber
i think hybrids definitely need reduced powergrid especially rails but blasters too for example 200mm autocannon iis the largest small autocannons require 9 cpu and 4 powergrid while light ion blaster iis the smallest small blaster also require 9 cpu and 4 powergrid autocannons end up doing more damage than blasters since its almost always possible to fit the largest ones whereas people end up mixing neutrons and ions most of the timeother than that theres many things that can be done such as increased tracking and damage gallente ships in general need more speed but not more agility so that they can quickly apply their damage and can actually get in range without dyingfor the purposes of this proposal though the details arent important if ccp devotes enough time to fixing the little things then theyll find a good solution for hybrids and for the other things that need to be fixedthe main purpose of my proposal is to fix design issues like the drone interface mechanics like blasters and such are definitely secondarytamber its probably a bad idea to make tons of gameplaymechanic changes at once since we wouldnt know how they work together but a few mixed in with many design changes should be fine
well i kind of want the next expansion to have walking in stations but a wis  over 9000 bug fixes patch would be pretty nice
so ratting in ultrapimped bs should have no risk at all really
if this gets implemented changes should also be made so we chould fight against concord and ecmneut concord or blob themofc with a sec hit
are you capable of more than platitudes tell me about this no risk thing im interested but i dont see it
and i like how idiots like u keep saying that high sec is supposed to be a special sanctuary free from the horrors of the rest of eve when its still similar to low sec and 00 in the sense where there is no major loss for the pirates doing the ganking and when everyone gets their insurance buys more ships and do it all over againu think u can take a vehicle into any war zone lose it and expect the insurance company to pay for that too no of course not otherwise they would void all losses in low sec and 00 as well way to not think at all
i think they should just remove insurance i was in a 5 sec caldari system running some missions for standing and in local someone was yelling as he was getting ganked in his golem by 8 legion of xxdeathxx guys all in battleships they scanned him out in his mission and saw he had an a or b type sheild booster wish i had saved the link for the kill as i cant find it nowanyway so this mission runner lost like 2 billion isk for ship and mods vs theyre over insured ships that they lost really no isk as the sheild booster alone was enough for them to all make isk i find this sad and really takes any fun away from the game what i really get a kick at is these pro legion of xxdeathxx guys call him a noob and a carebear when really they are the sad noobs in this case calling themselves such pro pvp people by hunting down some mission runner in high sec only to gank his pve fit 1 to 8 i mean wow the skill i cant handle the skill involved in such an operation i am humbled by the skill hahahahahahahai love to pvp but i would never do something like that even if it meant fast isk its just lame and no real fun in my opinion i rather join an alliance that fought for a reason such as expanding ones null or low sec space or defending vs invaders even piracy i think is fine as its a legit risk vs reward that also takes some actual skill and intel kill the insurance system plz
yes but those are usually fit with heavy missiles sad yes travesty yes potentially used as a suicide gank ship noyes but that noob was in nc and ratting while his alliance was at war he deserved to die and be laughed at in local name of noob celariname of alliance majesta empirekillmailthis was not a suicide gank
found the killmail of the person getting ganked in local while missioning this is why insurance should be removed
legion of xxdeathxx  against all authorities also im extremely impressed that the gang was able to identify a ship that had all that expensive gear on it and assemble a gang to attack it without the mission runner getting suspicious i mean if i had a boat that expensive id be a lot more careful about flying ithe wasnt in a huge mission hub so he had to notice someone scout him then 10 guys show up in local a bit laterheres an api verified km he was tanking npcs for a while before they killed him also they got very lucky on the loot drop
sorry about the against all authorities i thought it was them as there was a group of them flagged and in pods but when i saw the mail i saw it was someone else and at the time that this happen there were 143 people in system i think he warped out of the mission after one of the guys was harassing him from what i gather from watching local as he was flaming big time then he went back thinking he left then when he got to the acceleration gate they were all waiting for himyes this guy was noob and made a lot of mistakes but i still think ganking is wrong
ive been concerned with lowsec as being more useful to people other than pirates factional warfare and pvp i logged on to sisi to see how the changes would effect the hemorphite hedbergite and jaspet ores they all do get a nice amount of minerals added to their refine yield but it doesnt help them compete with the highsec ores it is still more profitable to mine highsec ores over the lowsec onesthe new hemorphite yield is only worth about 67 more than the old one in liquid isk without going into detail logon to sisi if you want to know morewhy would anyone ever venture out into dangerous space when theres not even a good reward for it im not pushing for lowsec ores to be worth more than 00 but certainly more than highsectheres still time before the expansion hits lets show ccp we care about our pirate infested asteroid belts make lowsec ores worth more than highsec
mining in losec is inherently more dangerous than mining in 00 because you cant secure losec spacethe only way to reanimate losec mining is to introduce something that cant be found anywhere else
nullsec also sports bombs and bubbles ive lost barges due to this just because you cant secure it as you say does not mean its any less dangerous than nullsec it is sad to lose 6 barges to bombersalso these ores can be found in nullsec as well why arent they getting a bigger boost if just for that reasonsupporting my own topic
you are forgetting that at the same time of the buffing of low sec ores there will be a nerfing of mission loot and drone alloys with a probable increase in value for the zydrine and loss in value for some of the minerals found in high sec so the proportional buff of low sec minerals probably will be larger than the 67 you cite that if the market follow ccp previsions something that is not granted
supportedwhat if instead of their current changes ccp did something like this note the numbers are for illustrating a concept do not take them literallyveldspar 333 units refines 500 veldsparscordite 333 units refines 525 veldspar 200 pyeritepyroxeres 333 units refines 550 veldspar 225 pyerite 100 mexallon 10 nocxiumbistot 333 units refines 800 veldspar 350 pyerite 210 mexallon 20 nocxium 350 zydrine 170 megacytebasically it would never be more profitable to mine in highsec if lowsec and nullsec ores produced as much highsec minerals as highsec ores in addition to also producing lowsec and nullsec minerals
drone compounds have less high end and more low end minerals now close to 78 less i would say i dont have perfect refine could be wrong about that drone compounds did not make up a significant portion of the tritanium pyerite mexallon or isogen mission loot did and with less of that being brought in due to changes in loot drops these minerals will rise in value as welleven assuming the lowend minerals dontt rise in price and assuming a 78 increase in price for zydrine scordite is still worth about 40 more than hemorphitethe changes arent enough something else must be done with the lowsec ores to make them worth more
i will agree with the op on this onemore needs to be done to balance out mining maybe even going so far as to make it so that only x types of ore can be found in lowsec
they really do need to increase the value as a miner there really is no motivation to go and even think about lowsec mining when the riskreward ratio is completely skewed
this is a very clever and well thought out idea emo tjsupported would love to see more creative ideas
emo tj and musical fist support this idea whats the punchline the ability for someone with starbase config to instantly turn off all the corp poss by yanking the fuel out of all of them
heheh  tj was only worried about stront timer but that is even more evil
how about allowing coupling arrays to link inoutput hangers between various assembly arrays ie t2 component output hanger feeds into equipment assembly array hanger less micromanaging all around also please allow my blueprint list in si tab to show the 3 various listing options and remove the annoying autorefresh of the list
if you are on the corp blueprintblueprint tab double click on the stationlab you want to install from it opens in a new window switch the science and industry window to the jobs tab start installing jobs from the new window voila nothing auto refreshes anymorehth
nothing like that you could not remove anything but just move stuff out of the corp hanger at the pos and put in pos moduleslets say a module that runs out of fuelammo you could remotely move ammo or liquid ozone into it without having to actually be at the pos
when i go to page 2 of this threadi get this
you most likely have a virus  keylogg i think you should immediately contact ccp then format your computer
disable signatures someone has a signature on a password protected host
gone now wouldve expected the forums to not allow such a thing to happen
that would require that the forum checks ever url when you enter the page that way you could quickly dos the forums you dont want that signatures off is the better way
it was just a bad signature link but i fixed it im going to lock this thread as it really has nothing to do with assembly hall and the issue is fixed fingers crossed
fail if anything industry needs a real expansion
heyits not the most burning problem but proplem none the less im really only posting this because of how annoyed i am by how much potential i see in this ship first of all it is the absolutely worse designed ship in this game its a logistics t1 cruiser that doesnt have any space for its essential modules i can sort of understand the layout from a mining perspective because i guess ccp didnt want to make annother osprey so they just sort of gave it 2 high slots for missiles and just 1 drone for defense perhaps i dont know but why why not give it 3 low slots 5 medium slots 3 high slots and atleast let it launch 3 light drones what would this do well for mining to get it out of the way it would just trade dps for tank pretty much let your drones do all the damage and tank a bit more than an osprey i have highsec rats in mind but whats most important and where the potential of this ship is it would let the scythe do its rolemy point is this would open the ship for actual gang use ive done gang operations in ospreys exequrors and augorors those ships have roles in gangs that are easily taken by newbie pilots i personaly dont see any problem in balance with the slot change or drones the ship has 4 real slots for its logistics just like other t1 cruisers the capacitor problems would be smaller or none i guess but then you cant really fit a capacitor booster you wont overtank it for solo pvp either cause it barely exeeds 500 pg anyway the ehp is very small overall besides the dps isnt there at all it also wont make for a gimmicky ewar platform because blackbird has more mid slotsit could make a fast agile support to hac gangs or bs snipe gangs sort of give players the feel of flying a scimitar like other t1 logistics do for their t2 couterparts just different gang bonuses also tracking links could finally see some pvp action even if just a littlewhat you guys think id love to see this ship finally in use
scythe is horrible as balance for how fantastic the scimi is however it should have rr bonuses like the other tier 3 cruisers tracking links really
first of all let me start by saying that as an independent game developer and game design academic i am vehemently opposed to macro use of any kindthat said this idea is so terrible that words simply cannot describe just how terrible it is its so horrid and poorly thought out that i am wondering whether it is in fact a troll poston the assumption that its not im going to pose a scenario due to rl concerns a player can only play other than updating the skill queue or market orders once or twice a week for any length of time on the odd occasion they can play for 78 hours at a stretch they would like to do what they enjoy doing either ratting mining or pvp after all they are paying for their accountif their funds are a bit short for pvp they will need to spend a bit of time filling their wallet and of course being the conscientious player they dont cheat by having a macro do this for them so they think right im going to spend my playing time ratting the belts trying to get faction spawnsin your solution after 2 or however many hours their ship stops and wont move until downtime so what play time this player has available is now screwedyour solution penalises legitimate players more than macro users particularly those who arent aware of how the internet works all a savvy macro user needs to do is ensure that their macro includes controls so that 5 minutes before the quota time is up it will reset the adsl router or whatever is being used for a connection and tiens viola new ip and more macro rattingminingtldr i think the post of epic fail summed up just nicelyabsolutely will not support
is there a thumbsdown option
playing devils advocate for a momentinstead of a 2 hour or 4 hour or whatever limit per day make it an allowance you get 4h per day that roll over if you dont use themweekend warriors will have 20h to make isk over the weekend and otherwise intermittent players will have huge allowances of time to use when they decide to playof course this does nothing about markettradehauler gankingscammingmoon mining ectand theres no need to use ip when you can simply do it per account
its interesting how youre the only one supporting your proposal time to log in a few of your other accts i reckon
honestly this would just make macroing worse this would increase the demand for ore macroers are more adept at cycling through accounts and characters than others this means theyll just have more characters running switching between them as their allotment for the day runs out very few nonmacroers would go through the troublebad ideaif you want to get rid of macroers come up with a more complex system for hauler missions there are fewer macro miners than you think most mine drunkafkwhile doing something else which is perfectly legit
supported because i prefer that nrrs get a dockinggate aggro timer the fix was already proposed by the pitboss last year raised in csm3 by dierdre vaal where it was unanimously passed by csm3this issue is still listed in evelopedia in the issues in process category defined as issues that have passed through the csm and are waiting for a response from ccp in response didnt ccp agree to flag neutral remote reppers but wouldnt go for the dockgate aggro suggestion i couldnt find documentation to back this up no wonder considering how much csm backreading ive been doing the last few weeks i hope someone from csm will chime in and clarify while there are a lot of interesting suggestions here and elsewhere for fixing neutral remote repping an aggression timer seems like the most straightforward fix im curious why it hasnt already been implemented
you look like your feet smell real bad
shell most likely get in anyway despite being called out on just about everything its hilarious to once again watch her melt down in a csm thread though keep it up i too believe player killers are immoral
akdfhgfhsrfgdfsmkeh you should forget the csm and put in an app down at fox news
people like this make me and others really think twice about the csm and its validity
miss ankhesentapemkah your detractors have quoted you as saying in eve youre all irrelevant and that players have no lasting effect on the game at all how would you work to change this and what does relevance and last effects mean to you
i see ankj more as one of the hippies on pmsnbc or perhaps npr where we should all hold hands and understand eachother and give hugs
ive answered this before but it got lost somewhere in the sewage in this threadim game designer and my specialities are economics and balancing right now im designing a competition system programming a piece of software that automatically generates droptables and writing the design doc for two of our upcoming mmos
please let me know about those upcoming mmos should be a huge success with you designing them
i promised myself i wouldnt comment in this thread but as i watch this train wreck unfold i fear ank might be elected and honestly i dont think she will play well with others in csm 5 if that happens ive heard comments from csm candidates i am confident will be elected that drive me to make these observationsif you are thinking of voting for this person let me make my case for giving someone else your vote instead1 if you are voting for women i am one of the handful of women running so please if you just want to vote based on gender consider me mazzilu or greymouse we all share that attribute with ank and do it without the drama ok mazz does bring some drama but a lot of folks would say the good kind of drama  the next csm definitely can work more effectively with the other women running2 games or software engineering experience several of the csm candidates are more qualified for example i was one of the coinventors of the programmable 3d pipeline introduced in direct x 8 i was also part of the small team that got billg to approve development of the xbox i have 30 plus years as a software engineer of which 5 were directly in the pc gaming industry and have had formal training and certification as a scrum master ive managed large development teams in all capacities up to the director level i currently work developing requirements specifications and driving product teams in the mobile device industry look into some of the other csm candidates there are definitely some folks running with real world software industry experience3 carebear i am a committed carebear ask anyone in my corporation or alliance i want to point out i do that while still respecting folks that like the shooting folks in ths face part of eve the individual that tried to assassinate me in the alliance pvp tourny a couple of years back ran against me in the csm 3 elections and said if you wanted someone that had provided years of care bear bliss to her alliance then folks should vote for me again there are some other great care bear candidates in this election4 im not running to get a job at ccp honestly i think that is anks goal i think the rest of the csm candidates are doing this to make eve better and not for their careersso in summary please consider other candidates i started out respecting ank when i first encountered her but over the last couple of years i worry that she is too immature random and closed minded to be effective in the csm i also wonder why she would run for a governing position in a game that her conversations seem to show she has such contempt forso please think long and hard before supporting ank i think there are a number of folks that would do better by you if you elected them insteadi encourage other candidates with similar views of eve as those that ank is running on to offer themselves as an alternative in this threadissler dainzefemalecarebearsomeone who likes eveowner of a car that eats minis for snacksalso now with a campaign videoissler dainze campaign advisor videoprofessional software engineer with real games industry experienceone of a bunch of better csm candidatespushing post reply with much reluctance
in which we find that ankh finds alternative views to her own as sewageonce again would you care to comment on what experience with pvp aside from getting ganked flying fits nullsec possibly aside from random ratting sov issues and fleet battles you actually havealsoim pretty sure you shot yourself in the ass with regard to job prospects at ccp with your rather hatin comments regarding eve lightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolt
i see you manage to totally ignore all the quotes from yourself how do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you dont even attempt to refute your own quotes 
a question if you dont like the game and show only contempt for it as is evident from your statements what is your personal interest in playing internet politicianpersonal gain or trying to change it into something completely different which you could enjoy puzzle pirates in space are two logical choices which spring to mind
well after all this ankwhatever bashing i decided to read the take care manifesto and am personally going to actively campaign wherever i am against these bunch of hisec dwelling idiotsfor one they want to nerf alliancepersonal 00 income and try and make 00 into a nrds kumbeya sholealongside making hisec safer for those mission running twerps you can see through their agendaon hisec wardeccingcarebear land anyone
is it just me or have we made anakakdsakdaskdkasdf go emo and missing in action she hasnt responded in a day or two lol
know who you are voting forand now consider whether you want eve to grow into the kind of game these views would foster
erik finneganhe was part of take care but unlike ankh brought valid criticisms and concerns of the carebear community to the csm to counterbalance the playstlyes of other members and those they representedfree erik and free us from this vitriol spewing egomaniac with an axe to grind
ankh  whats your views on returning to days gone by where participation by ccp volunteersemployees in the game occurredie where sarparti serpentis actually was flying around in that stolen ship through tribute piloted by a person or when those dread guristas dreads attacked those poss in the north etcthese events were a nice distraction and im sure events like these would be welcomed back
really ive no recollection of this id love some screenshots though if there is any
heres the thread about it
one question for you why do you hate eve so much ankh that you apply again you really wanna destroy this game that much
at this timeie in the futureso a stepping stone would be kind of useful for a future event  its kind of inherent in the terminologyskunk
absolutelyjade constantine raised this issue but since this issue was passed on to csm2 and jade handed it to me thats why were both on the documentfrom minutesno live events team exists ankh analyzed other mmo live events and mentioned a few examples uo moved in the direction of how over time companies changed having developers in game to having volunteers run events which moved on to the volunteers demanding compensation and the live events being disbanded guildwars went the route of having automated events ankh went on to say that a similar system could be added to apocrypha considering the new content coming in types of events that could be introduced story driven  outcome can affect the eve storyline or small storylines that can be played in game competition events  pvp tournaments treasure hunts puzzle solving automated events  temp agents appearing convoys luminaire titan type of thing ccp has thought about having devs to play characters in game events unfortunately ccp devs really dont have the spare time for that  theyre developing the other risk was to imbalance the game running events in specific areas pattern raised the point that they are events they happen rarely to help introduce storylines ccp responded that they do something like that through the rp storylines on the website its not the same but doing it with devs running characters it takes away from development time issler pointed out that corps run their own events and if there was more ccp support to promote those events it would be great ccp thinks that giving tools to players to create their own events are better pattern pointed out that people have different play styles  some enjoy the guided rollercoaster others like to create their own things tusko brought up the old live events were done both large and small and a lot of people enjoyed them as they added spice to the game ccp agreed but that stuff required an insane amount of manpower to organize that they can no longer assign manpower to ccp has on the drawing board to link news to market events  ie planet runs out of wheat wheat orders in stations near that planet start getting generated requests like this one go into a priority list for ccp by adding this as a higher priority something else would have to fall down bunyip suggest a way for players to let ccp know about player events so that they can get advertising pattern pointed out a lack of history to eve by having live events and people involved it can allow for viral style marketing ccp agrees but pointed out there are drawbacks with doing that and would require a reshuffling of priorities to allow them artistsprogrammers would have to be tasked to events issler would like for ccp to encourage the storyline in eve its a great backstory it needs to be broadcast darius thinks that by adding more storyline would impact on the ability for players to create their own stories tldr csm and ccp agree that more events would be great but it is a question of priority as well as trying to allow the sandbox experience of eve to be effected by storylines as well as allowing players to affect the storylines more monuments will happen live events are much harder to do but they want to do it there is no timeframe for implementation of this but it has been added to the list
i say againi see you manage to totally ignore all the quotes from yourself how do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you dont even attempt to refute your own quotes not only do your own quotes make a liar out of you  you then simply ignore any posts that call attention to them
great i love geek girls o
they serve a purpose i give you that
indeed  you and other have made my choice in vote alot easieri voted for mazzilliu
and eve is going to explodesome people take this csm too serious for their own goodccp will do what ccp does no matter what csm saysat the end of the day ccp will make business decisions not decisions based on a group of people who represent less than 15 of total subscriber populationyou eve fanatics are just too funny to hear and readdont forget to have fun its just a flipping game
i still think this issue should be still pushed rather than take a back seat i cannot see what time a short event would take from the devs and tbh with the faction wars ongoing there is more than enough oppotunity for events to take place without interfering in player owned space or politicsccp just stating they havent the time is a get out of jail free card rp written storyline only interests a percentage real live events taking place will interest quite a few more imooh btw thanks for answering

you have my sworderraxevote damnit
this post outlawthere are a number of ideas in this post some of which are interesting and maybe even good im wondering if you have any thoughts myxnee i know youre strongly interested in the expansion of lowsec viability and im curious if you see anything worth exploring further in that postoh and by the way you got my vote
mynxee you know you have my votes even though i come from the complete other side of the spectrum i know you well enough to believe you will listen to all sides of any given argument and have an incredibly firm grasp of the mechanics of eve not to mention you have your finger planted on the pulse of the eve communityprobably the most mature openminded yet driven candidate we havevote
while id be more interested in can and should blob tactics be discouraged i think thatd be 600 am for me which is early for a sunday but if you need anyone for what will breathe life into low sec i should be free
x me up for the bringing life to lowsec sessionalso vote mynxee you scurvy dogs or even you nutritionallybalanced and wellfed dogso
i voted for you gl
mynxww my dearsince the my first option crashed and burned in cp you have my vote and i will be getting my alliance to support you toogood luck and see you in space 
improved range and decreased delay when scanning in small cones autoupdate function every x seconds just to name two that is of course if ccp would want to keep the current scanner and not replace it with a new mechanic
i think theres also a case to be made for modifying scanner characteristics according to ship type range precision accuracyhaving a cloak fitted should also penalise scanning having an active cloak should heavilty penalise scanning
some interesting balancing and ship role specialization options can be found there  itll be worth checking what ccp thinks of it
alsovoting has opened
you got my vote m8
questionhas anything your supported actually made it into the game and how do you feel about itskunk
ccp doesnt work on such short term unfortunately but i have good hopes it took 6 months for the previous csms to show their effects on the game and i dont expect it to be much faster this timeif you are questioning whether we i had any influence at all i welcome you to read through the iceland meeting minutes and the subsequent ccp blog unfortunately the minutes arent transcribed on a perperson base but i assure you that i used up more than my fair share of speaking timeeverything that i proposed was however met with approval from the present ccp personnel  which shows that if nothing else i at least understand their game philosophy 
why issler is importantcoz you dont want ccp just listen to solobobatla go go go issler
4 low sec needs smuggling eve has teased us with the idea of smuggling since the beginning but it never really got implemented if i want to be be a bad person and slip about with questionable cargo low sec is where it should happen introduce new market goods with some degree of illegality also pick a class of ship and make it the smugglers ship of choice the idea of smuggling could fill pages with possibilitiesi think this is a good idea ccp wouldnt even need to introduce new market goods there are already several items slaves small arms and various narcotics that are illegal in most places in empire buy orders could be created for these items in some low sec systems at a profitable price the more illegal it is the more profitable it should be just dont get caught
youtube seems to be working again i hope you all take a chance to enjoy the results of tada o ai teamissler

mazziliu what are your opinions on the inherent immorality of player killing please people serious debate only
when players die they need to stay dead itt eve is full of zombiescheck out my csm campaign video
a corpmate asked me to elaborate on my scienceindustry issue ideas on our own forums ill paste my response here as wellthe first thought that comes to mind is poses just pretty much everything about poses including the interface for manufacturing researching and moon mining its a confusing interface and manufacturing is frustrating when you need to have the minerals at a pos and inconvenient when you cant reprocess modules at a pos most people i have seen that use assembly arrays only do it when there is no alternative at player owned stations with little manufacturing or t2 producers to get better speeds the science  industry interface needs to be able to remember more settings maybe be able to set a default build count or dont make the player choose just exactly which of the many identical slots they want to use to make something there needs to be work on that so theres less clicks to get something that you want donealso the assets tab needs work on itnot strictly part of scienceindustry but you use it a lot when organizing its hard to sort through your things when the bits of data arent sorted into columns  of jumps and  of items are not visually lining up just another terrible piece of uithere should be some sort of alert when you have jobs ready to deliver not one every time a job completes though it would get annoyingthe ability to sort by meta level in the inventory isnt added yet still and it should bei do not like how player owned stations are inferior to npc stations in almost every way manufacturing and science slots included for the sake of populating 00 people need more convenience in player owned stations by providing a reasonable number of slotsand finally and most importantly a way to distinguish bpos from bpcs i dont really care if ccp rejected this idea a million times before it can reject it a million and one times
i will be voting for mazz with one if not more of my altsfor the boobies
what are your thoughts on interactive storytelling in eve mainly if players should be able to greatly impact what ccps writers will write or if those writers should have full control over where they want the story of eve to go
by running for csm i am making a commitment to devote the time to csm activities that means that it gets priority for my personal recreational time less time spent on the robot shows will expire unwatched on the tivo and less time having fun in eve  though probably more time in evethis is entirely different from not being able to be available for a particular op at a particular time due to outside commitments
def better than the pandemic chick whose platform seems to be ovaries i said pvp votenot voting yet but you will probably get my 2any thoughts on additional viability of t1 hulls non rifterincursusmerlintristangriffen frigates destroyerso7
as your former at7 homeboy i feel obliged to vote for you since i missed the final match and you died dont blame me though blame the colts if theyd had a sunday night game i wouldve made it and you wouldnt have been yelled at by shamis for dying theres no one running that understands the game and how to improve it more than elise
cat you amuse meyou got votes from 5 of my charactersgood luck and give those pirates no restmr epeen
i think if ull become a csm ill have a bit more targets so gl mate
according to matchevecsmcom i have to vote for you
the voting has begun dont forget to vote
my vote for you old friend good luck
some of you may have noticed i am running for csm i am you probably have noticed i put no self promotional message in the candidate space not really that good at self promotion i have taken some heat for not having a catchy campaign slogan unfortunately i have no funds to pay for ad guys so until those isk orders sell on ebay i was forced to ask the small handful of people who will admit to knowing me for ideas the results became the campaign message posted beside my namethe truth is that i have read those other messages and i have a confession to make i dont have an intimate knowledge of all aspects of the game i cannot glibly talk of eve economics while juggling complex formulas for determining the damage caused by a speeding missile i havent raised 37 issues personally before the csm and held ccps collective feet over the fire while they made flawless changes to improve each and every one of our gameplay experiences i do not smote the heavens causing super carriers to spring up where only asteroids belts existed and finally dds do not shoot out of my assinstead i can only tell you that if you have an idea explain it to me and if it will improve eve i will work to see it reaches ccp maybe just maybe they wont screw it up when they put it inps please vote for me
thank you for your comments i will try and give you an idea what i was thinking on each of thosesmart mines could be limited to 1 per gate and there would be a limit to the damage they could do it is not meant to be the only means of defending a system it is just a means of making an aggressor think twice and they could always be destroyed could be a delay before the mine recloaks as to give an attacker a chance to remove it this would need to have further discussion so that 00 is not filled with smart minestraining arena that does have a lot of potential i agree again needs a lot of discussion around it but it would be useful to have in gamesub system targeting i think that is or has been in planning for a while and i dont see it as causing that much more lag and it would make pvp more interestingempire suicide attacks i dont want to stop pilots being able to conduct these attacks as it is a viable tactic i just think that pilots that do them should not receive any insurance payouts on the ship performing the attackmarauder class ships i feel that this class needs some work maybe not necessary as i have stated but there are some improvements that could be made it should be a powerful ship the question is just how powerful can it beescort carrier would be an interesting ship to have in game
voting is now up you can support me by following this linkvote early vote oftenalso check out dierdra vaals vote match site
how do i get you to take on a proposal i have some issues with corp deliveries  i want to be able to sort them by region is that something you would be taking on even if you are not i presume a trader
the procedure for any proposal is to raise the issue in the assembly hall check the sticky post at the top of this forum for hints and tips on raising issuesas far as getting somebody to pick it up you can eve mail the proposal link to the csm reps in game and one of them should raise it i do pick up stuff outside my core gameplay when i feel it is being ignored
for those interested i did an email interview with keith neilson there are other candidate interviews to read too and im glad to see the eve blogging community taking the csm process to heart
voted a couple of times for you gogo teadaze best of luck

when i look back in the years i have invested in eve online and they are quite few i can not neglect the fact that this game became one of my main regular habits one of my sweet choirs one of my if you like almost family memberswhat always amazed me was my close to the perfection will to play more and more of this game to interact with more and more of the ingredients of this artificial but so vivid deep space world which fully surrounds me every time when im flying the very world i would never live to tell in real lifethere are few people which are beside the ccp employes making that possible since the introduction of the csm and the election process only few and those few are coming down to vuk lau and elvenlord are the people for which i do solemnly believe that they are investing best of their abilities to improve my regular habit my sweetest choir my family member and that they are really concerned about not only temporary moment and state of it but the future near and distant as welli do believe that vuk lau and elvenlord as one of the most impressive if not the most impressive experts of this game will invest all their will knowledge and time to make every aspect of it better empire low sec or null sec alike and that they will use the power of two on this level to make coordinated and determined impact on ccp for continuing to make this game our favorite pass time of all timesvote for them by you is for you and all of us
as ideas for the game go this is more plausable than some that ive read however at this time i would not bring this issue before the csm because the originator of the idea did not tidy up her room
im answering these one at a time because its late hereone of the problems that has been with eve for as long as ive been playing is that in terms of mining lowsec has been pointless with ores no more valuable than those in hisec indeed even poor 00 ores failed to be more valuable its something thats quantifiable where the riskreward equation clearly goes the wrong way now i sincerely hope the mineral rebalancing introduced in tyrannis will help this disparity i doubt itlow sec does offer a bunch of things that can be exploited by players in an organization that supports them  level 5 missions  factional warfare arent generally solo affairs and im not saying they should be however the truth is that most players in empire view pvp as too risky and dont see any difference between lowsec and 00 and players that jump into player corps typically go straight from living in hisec to living in 00 at which point they view the rewards in 00 as being greater and the pvp is easier when you don thave to worry about sentry guns and security statusideally lowsec needs something unique something that embraces those mechanics unique to lowsec i loved the corruption concept that came out of the meeting in las vegas and while im really not wanting to see a lot of new content added until we clean up the old content id say that adding something like this to give a unique angle to lowsec would be near the top of my list for new content
the first thing that strikes me about blasters the optimal range bonuspenalty for ammo makes almost no difference to the effective range so theres no advantage to switching ammo types to anything but antimatter or the t2 ammo types with the other short range weapon systems ammo still makes a difference lasers have much higher optimal compared to falloff and projectiles have a selection of short range damage types available id be in favour of examining changes that might deliver some advantages to switching ammunition types theres also that eternal oddity of gallente flying slow armour tanking ships and favouring guns that require the ship to get right on top of the targetat the battleship level rails lack the dps of beams and the alpha of artillery but they get great range however i rarely find ships engaging at the kind of extreme ranges where rails come into their own medium rails have fitting requirements that feel a little high when youre trying to fit a t2 sniper eagle or feroxdo they need fixing theres a lot of people who think they do so as a csm candidate id certainly like to raise the issue in more detail with ccp
all my vote are belong to tamber
why should anyone vote for you when you cannot attend csm meetings even during the campaign period where i would presume it would be paramount to show your worth
you are correct and this issue has been mentioned a couple of posts upalthough i am only an alternate i have attended all but two meetings both times i missed without telling the secretary in advancei did however work nightshift on both those days and the meetings were at 6am if i recieved a full seat id be willing to change to dayshift which i have already recieved permission for from my work that is what im worthtamberedit the meetings were 5am6am
getting up at 5am to do something for 35 minutes does not seem unreasonable i presume csm is not w live video feed so you could do it in your pajamas if you wanted to be there
no not unreasonable at all if you work normal hours and usually i dont need to wear anything xtamber
no amount of mindseye bleach  
getting up at 5 in the morning to talk about internet spaceships and being naked while doing it thats dedication
you have all my votes gl
voted t geez got me to send you 1 isk on a lotto and vote for you all in one day now i have exceeded my output and need to go back to bedgoodluck chief would be nice to see someone south of the equator on it
voting is open
1st off you have my support will you be bring ideas to the board this time around that will help newer alliances to get a foot hold in null secie sov bills dont cost as much
yes i believe the sov costs needs to be adjusted there needs to be better incentive for new alliances to venture out into 00 and i feel dominion missed the mark
avalloc you have my vote even though youre a goon
friendly bump
by fixing these issues and tightening overall gameplay hopefully as a result it will help weed out other issues and improve the game as a whole keep it up im listening
my top was dierdra vaal 70 obviously rigged
75 teadazethats my guy i guess or girl
illectroculus defined 85teadaze 80would go for tea again but that support for converting t2 bpos is a tough call
ccp should spend more time fixing old content and less time introducing new contentreceived the most strongly agree and the most important questionccp ffs remove head from nether regions and fix the bugs the lag and ban the cheaters and macroers already stop introducing new broken crap until you doonce youve done that go back to your harebrained schemes and pie in the sky ideasthis idea that new toys attract new subscribers is poppy do you know what attracts new subscribers satisfied current subscribers who love the game because it works and cant stop talking about how full of win it is
nice tool definately not sure it covers all the issues though top 5 matchesmazzilliu 73 teadaze 73 sokratesz 72 elise randolph 70 omber zombie 69which make enough sense however what makes no sense at allankhesentapemkah 63 mynxee 63darius johnson 50
darius johnson 64 looks like ill be voting goon edit and where the hell is cat
nothing about multiple accounts  
hopefully not running as cute as the forum trolling from that pilot is i dont want that anywhere near csm
interesting i ran a strongly disagree for everythingscwarze apparently disagrees the most with everything on the list50 match he is also my least compadible when answering for realcenturax apparently agrees the most with everything on the list 17 match ironically my most compatiblequick statistics the most disagreed upon question presented among the csm candidates was the core combat model of eve lacks complexity and is too simple which is sort of sad since eve is pretty simplethe most agreed upon question presented among the csm candidates was bounty hunting as a profession needs some love from ccp and with how broken the bounty system is its no surprisethe most important question presented among the csm candidates was ccp should devote an expansion cycle to revamping the user interface
thus the reason why its an open vote i though am also curious as to where cat is on there
warp disruption fields should be usable in low secthey are usable in low sec the focused script is basically the whole point of hics if you mean bubbles in low sec that is pretty funny imo and you should call them bubbles because ive never heard anyone call them wdfsi gotomber zombie77 mazzilliu 70alpha12125 69helen highwater 67teadaze 67dierdra vaal 55great tool op wont be voting for you though didnt know omber zombie was so cool this tool definitely is switching my vote was gonna go for teadazeelise randolph now gonna go omberteadaze
am running lol but was away for the bank holiday weekend o which had the effect of me not checking my evemails and thus missing the deadline x
very nice of you to make this tool this time around too dvthough it seems like oz is the man to vote on
an excellent tool i got 65 for dierdra vaal however i couldnt vote for this chap due to his support ofinvention and production should be made more profitablehow exactly in a player driven market ban the accounts of those undercutting the market jesus if you dont know how invention works why should anyone vote you in when you want to do the above hint invention is perfectly profitable as it is nowashina sito made me laugh vote for him to stop people scamming so i guess i am voting for manalapan whoever that is
great little tool for getting an idea of who to look into futher
neat tool but tbh some of the questions are fairly ambivalently written  you should try to rewrite them to avoid multiple questionsstatements per issue it may not be all that serious but the methodology is left wantingeg the wardec system is unbalanced in favour of the agressor and should be changed there are three rather different things going on here that the wardec system is unbalanced that the aggressor is the favoured party and that this needs to be changed the only proper way to interpret this is if you agree with the statement as a whole but that means that other similar issues arent being addressedit also leaves open the problem of which of the parts need to be addressed and how which is probably a more pertinent question to most if i think that the wardec system should be changed but not because its unbalanced and unduly favours the aggressor what should i vote if i think the system is unbalanced and in favour of the aggressor but shouldnt be changed what if i think its unbalanced and should be changed but so that it favours the aggressor more  then what etcso just a general tip for the next time only test one statement at a time if someone creates a compound issue like the one above cut it down into different parts and have the candidate in question say that theyre positive or negative to all of them
very interesting indeed ankh and i have about 43 in common lol
most of the questions didnt interest me at all they merely reflect what you find important
kinda expected dierdra vaal 107  match butankhe will be so pleased ankhesentapemkah 71vuk lau 70esharan 70meissa anunthiel 70dierdra vaal 63scwarze 45it is evident many csm candidates agree on many issues which i hope bodes well for the next csmso it shall be ankhe or cat nice work dierdra vaal 
keep in mind that you shouldnt just vote for your highest match do some research into what the candidates stand for read their websites talk to them etc
thanks for putting this up again dierdra
i saw something like this on yahoo about the current uk elections very nicemine showed centurax as 70 followed by vuk 68 eekvery nice eitherway how does ccp work with multiple accounts and voting each account gets to vote but does it get classed as one person or can a person just have several accounts for the sake of voting
quite a few of the candidates landed pretty close together on my results top ones weredierdra vaal 68 axexut 64 darius johnson 61 manalapan 61 meissa anunthiel 59 avalloc 59on a random side note the mess of colours and symbols on the result page is kind of painful to the eyes any chance of a more visually friendly layout
two veeery similar candidates no really the  match is a silly criterion alone for voting the good part bit of this site is that it enables you to see the stance of candidates on some often debated issues without having to ask them one by one in their threadshowever claiming ankh has similar views to say vuk is just beyond silly one of them has expressily stated that people who violence other peoples ships are immoral irl that puzzle pirates are a better game that people who violence other peoples ships are antisocial deviants who need to get therapy irl and stuff just check the thread 
yeah i looked at the  instead manalapan who scored 64 had  in most of the areas i am interested in though she doesnt talk about some of them on her blog hmmvuk on blobbing is cool but omg  not giving suicide gankers full insurance 
nice toolbut it would be nicer if i could pick a list of say 3 to 5 candidates to compare to my resultsthe huge table it is now makes it hard to readand there are quite a few candidates that i personally deem unvotable so i wouldnt want to compare with those anywaysabout the result it saddens me that the best match is 65 with one of the candidates pretty much proofs that there is none which stands for what i like about the game
most matched is 69least matched in 30so i can choose between jack johnson and john jacksonjj i think your two cent tritanium tax goes too farjj well i think your two cent tritanium tax doesnt go too far enoughjj doesnt matter 9 of us are getting free holidays just make sure you pander to enough bitter old veterans on shc and youre goldenjj im getting a sex change have you seen how they flock around females like flies round dog puddings on there
i got noone above 50 the first time and had to change my answers twice to get someone up to 67you all suck dit did correctly guess who were my top candidates i had already decided based on threads alone so it was able to figure out who i disagreed with the least which is neat
well instead of me being on there looks like i am kinda the middle of the road anyway lol x
yeah i didnt like that bit either but most others were even worse so eh i can tolerate disagreeing with one thing i guess
just like last year an excellent tool which i will probably be using to narrow my view on the candidatesi do have one request thought when it comes down to comparison for example the candidates can give weight to the questions they find important i would like to see that as the person comparing you would be able to tick per example 3 boxes to give weight to the most important statements to you which are then giving more weight in the comparison
not gonna use the  thing but definitely helped me make up my mind 
interesting for sure here were mineteadaze 83 helen highwater 75 fatmarrow 73 mynxee 70 avalloc 69 issler dainze 68 ankhesentapemkah 68 dierdra vaal 68 lycanthis 67 centurax 67 mazzilliu 67 900v 67 illectroculus defined 66 corbeau lenoir 65 sokratesz 65 meissa anunthiel 65 alpha12125 64 tamber 64 korvin 64 elvenlord 64 paritybit 64 extreme 63 axexut 63 ashina sito 62 chip mintago 62 omber zombie 61 katabrok first 61 darius johnson 61 vuk lau 61 navy lady 61 trebor daehdoow 61 cinori aluben 60 alorithe 60 elise randolph 58 esharan 58 placcar 58 scwarze 57 institute ofwar 57 greymouse 54 manalapan 54 avicenna sarfaraz 52i thought it was more informative just to look as the s didnt really tell the whole story some things i dont really care about either way bombs in low sec wh poss being more vulnerable while others did matter a lot more would be interesting if there was a way to rate how important is this question to you in addition to the simple      system there is now nifty tool will cause me to look at some candidates more than i might have otherwise
cat isnt in it two questionswho the heck is illectroculus definedand why does he match my answers
interesting have you considered collating  publishing the views of what the voters think
i got illectroculus as well thanks its a helpful tool at least to see who i should look at further
i think this is pretty accurate i tend to agree with sok on almost everything plus hes a caldari cap pilot like my main o
so that the csm candidates can directly pander to the popular views of the votersdo you think they are that corrupt that theyd simply lie to get a free holidayyes i think youre on to something here
teadaze 80
extreme 86for all i care i voted
oops that is incorrect should be strongly disagree i had a busy work weekend knew that the vote match was happening but had not been contacted my longest time in eve from this past friday to tuesday was to get the vote match password so i could input my responses i was in a big rush to get out the door and i guess i missed that one when recheckingsince i felt the questions were a bit meh this time around i am not surprised i am landing in a meh position with the posted compatibility lists cest la vie
mazzilliu 77 mynxee 73 sokratesz 73 teadaze 72yeah thats about what i expected interestingly i think mynxee and sok are better fits than mazzliang
when the candidates filled out their questionnaire they had to chose 3 questions that were very important for weighting purposes i am not sure why the users are not given the same option they might at a later time it would help with the odd piratecarebear matching that this round has
ccp should spend more time fixing old content and less time introducing new content stupid not everyone works on the same things the team fixing content isnt necessarily the one adding it
im missing an option to flag an issue as very importantunimportant to meand i would also like to be able to compare myself with a smaller list of candidates the guy im going to vote for has only like 53 but agrees with me in all the points that are really important to me
this is a great tool thanks for making it i stickied this up top until the 19th of this month so that everyone will be able to use this tool
thanks but moving this out of the general discussion will mean a lot of people dont see it
after knowing and working within eve alongside lyc for too many years nowi can say yes i am biased but this man works tirelessly behind the scenes for our corp and is knowledable on almost every subject within eve he and a few others within corp are our eve wiki he has always shown integrity in everything he has done he would make an excellent candidate for csm he has shown his knowledge over the years is invaluable in making decisions and also he has solid ideas on how things should be my vote will most definately be for him btw i am his ceo so obviously i am biased s
after having watched lycanthis almost singlehandedly manage our entire corps infrastructure and logistics over the years i know that there is no other person id rather have as a csm representative lycanthis dedication to the game is awe inspiring and i know for sure hell bring a focused down to earth intensity to the csmthis is not the candidate to vote for if you want empty promises of 100 fixed lag and amazing flashy new ships this is the candidate to vote for if you want genuine useful fixes to problems that are actually within ccps power to aim atps lyc we want better cyno graphics and more awesome effects  ship death animations too thanks
another friendly bump for someone i have voted for 
1st post been editedupdated
you talk of allowing pirates to use bubbles and the like in lowsec but this has me curious isnt one thing that a number of pirates complain about that there isnt enough incentive for players to go into lowsec wouldnt allowing bubbles without increasing the allure of lowsec space for other players simply make it so less people fly there and thus it becomes a loss rather than a benefithave you any particular thoughts for how to address this
pirates need some of these advantages as well as alliances who are involded in mercenary actions against large alliances they are paid to destroyhow many times have you had a war dec with someone and not had the ability to bubble them in low secthe people who visit low sec learn from other players very quickly about the hazards and dangers of travel therei do not think the dynamics of people getting to low sec and 00 have changed much or are ever going change muchyou have the grown ups pool and you have the kiddies pool sooner or later regardless of the danger the new player is going to venture out thereand hopefully skill himherself well enough to be able to handle themselves before they even attempt ityou learn by trial and error to survive out here in low sec and 00 space if you dont it gobbles you up like a big fishall you need to do is learn to be smarter than the big fish until you can get to be as big as it is
hrm i fear i was misunderstood and must have worded that not very clearly what i was trying to get across waswhat is there to draw anybody other than pirates to lowsec at the moment very little aside from thrillseeking this is something that both nonpirates and pirates bemoan the former because they have no reason to step into lowsec risk for no reward and the latter because it lessens their possible targets i was curious if you had anything in mind to make lowsec more appealing to nonpirating sorts and i ask this as hopefully one of those piratingsortstobe making lowsec more dangerous would simply make it even less populated than it is now until the only people left there would be pirates with no targets other than eachother anything in mind for that or do you disagree with the idea as a whole just checking your feelings on things is all 
ok you want to draw more people to low sec for other than obvious reasonsmake the bounty system a type of ratio for people with lower sec status that are repat offendersthey keep tract of declining missions for agents so why not keep track of consecutive sec hitswhere as the more numerous they are the more the bounty a player increasesand ccp foots the bill for the ratio such as 213141 and so on for the x times the offender is a repeat on taking sec hitsthis makes them valuable targets for bounty hunters which btw also needs some toys to assist themmaybe some skills that work similar to locator agents only more percise information as the skill progressesso we have the bounty hunters helping to populate low secmake mining in low sec more valuable than it is is another way to entice players to low sechow about the new pi stuff maybe that can be made a worth while low sec endeavormany ways to fix this and would be welcome to any ideas on the subject as a csm i could follow up on these idea of yours and many others
free bump  you got my vote mate
i support this product andor service
of all the issues you plan to address what for you is the biggest priority
the biggest priority for me is making eve more regional again and limiting the projected power of capital ships so rebalancing of capital ships is on top
bump for great ideas
yay 0cast your votes now
there better be cake if you win
still running interviews
i cant see the picture that is attached to the f11 navaid proposal is it just me
i have added an update to clarify the intentions behind my proposal
it was showing and then it wasnt weve had issues in the past with ccp renaming things ill have a look later but for now the image is also hosted at the csm minutes site
shows for me atmsweet mama i have been drooling for a common destinations kind of interface for ever looks like a good baseline to start from will be great to see it in game sometime after incarna
historically the candidate at the top of the page got a boost in votes just because for some reason lots of people vote for the first option guess who is at the top of the page this time around
lets see vote for you or get a sexually transferred disease the std wins
funny that there was no whining about this the past 4 elections but now that its ankh at the top of the list there are two hate threads about already plus a whole lot of qq at scrapheap challenge
i doubt that is the case any normal person even if he read and heard nothing about csm will base there vote on character portrait country of origin and what is written there if soeobody does not care to read tehy would no care to vote if there is indeed a bunch of s that vote for the first candidate on the list without reading and they do represent a significant portion of eve population they get what they deserve
fully expected you to come in all holy complaining that you would get a free advantage
any reason you have hidden your corp and alliance tags from the forums not trying to appear as independent whilst being in a large alliance i hope
good to see you were paying attention at csm2 when this issue was raised it also came up in discussions at csm3
better click here
hiwould you care to further comment on your qualifications to judge and represent pvp combat nullsec sov mechanics and the fact that you feel anyone who dares question your opinion is made of sewagein addition would you care to clarify your anticcp stance given the huge number of antieve comment you makeand finallywhen you are not selected for csm will you ragequit and return to puzzle pirates for good in order to leave your mark therethank you for your timelightning bolt lightning bolt lightning bolteditalso would you care to comment regarding rumors circulating you are using a macro of some sort to spam mail pilots in jita and other locations within eve with your csm false agenda
should be randomized every time the page loads tbh
thats us told
nah vote for me instead
sure there was whining ive complained multiple times its a terrible system
because its only you thats so blatantly clueless about aspects of the game you dont even trouble to hide your desire to ruin
dont worry i voted for none of you 2 as i dont think you are any good for eve either of youproblem solved
welcome to evewhere all the players love tearsbut the devs love them even moarthat guy in her video has extremely awesome eyestamber
the players dont have to deal with ankhasdafsa going to their offices ccp is trolling themselves lolololol
troll this troll that damn girl your just obsessed with that wordmaybe your csm candidate election is trolling toooh and your moaning about how the list of candidates is presented but you have some drizzle about being a girl and also to visit your facebook page  good effort
what are you talking about the nonrandomized order was complained about as soon as it went live in the first election
i personally brought the 1000 bonus votes issue to ccps attention 2 months agoccp responded that this matter will be under investigationi am glad that it is ankh this time that was placed on top rather than some other candidatestime will prove myour case about with how many votes difference ankh will become chairman
you could have done the same thing an election is about gaming the process to get electeddarius johnson will win has enough goons to vote him in just on thattamber has been running the soe lottos and that developed a name within eve they just missed making the csm4 and was an alternatetea daze has the agony pvp anglei could go on i do want to say that just because people have some sort of an advantage whatever that advantage does not make them a bad candidate that is winning by gaming the system in the end it is the players that make the choice to who is elected the first in the list will result in more votes but those votes would not catapult someone into being elected they would still have to reach a decent number of voters on their own merit the same as anyone elsethe last election the minimum number of votes needed to get a seat on the csm was roughly 740 i placed in the middle of the pack with 350 or so votes i doubt that by being at the top of the list i would have gained enough votes to get a seat ironically i was actually the last on the list for csm4 i submitted 2 hours before the deadline it took 3 weeks to get a response from ccp about a concern i had i went for it anyway since time was running out they got to me 3 days after the submission deadline and we dealt with the issuein any case there has been 4 elections so far and no one seems to have brought up this issue there is nothing to be done about it now if you want it changed for csm 6 fine make it happen otherwise htfu
fyi darius no long runs for csm
im curious to know just how much ankh has been playing eve for the past 6 months she only started showing up in my addressbook noticeably since ccp announced they were abolishing term limits in other words when she knew she couldwould run for csm again
it does feel like she is just back for the csm i mean if you are serious about puzzle pirates it doesnt leave much time for any other gamesissler
since i am a bit daft and had no idea on who to vote i just voted for ankh since she was at the top of the page what can i say some of us are slower than others
i too saw the shiny avatar yelling internetgirlidliketo exploding on my screen when i pressed the vote buttonbut then i remembered i hated her socks of and tasted a little sick in my mouth
as a former corp mate of ankh i can safely say that in the last six months she has moved some pos fuel and ed about eve being a pos apart from that her contribution to corp operations and activities was nonexistent she was not involved in a single alliance operation even as providence was burning i find her claims of having experienced 00 during her time with cva to be wonderfully ironic
its impossible to know what specific game mechanic changes are feasible without knowing the code but i am pretty sure that whatever change does eventually get settled on will include some sort visibility reductionin other words right now you see everything on grid you have a gods eye view of the situation this makes it much easier to organize and coordinate large blobsif on the other hand the more ships you brought to the fight the more your ability to get a good idea of what is really going on degraded the value of an extra ship would be reduced and the value of good leadership especially the ability of multiple smaller groups to cooperate would be enhanced thered be more chaos more fogofwar and potentially more fundone right fleet fights would tend to normalize at the size where the current server infrastructure can handle things without too much lagthe problem with such changes is that they are a huge risk ccp obviously doesnt want to break the game and the law of unintended consequences applies to eve more than any other game i know ofthe upside of going with a fogofwar approach to fixing lag is that potential fixes can initially be tested by installing a perceptual filter into the client it would be relatively easy and require no server changes to temporarily change the client so for example you only can see the closest 50 ships even if the server is still sending all the data to youthen when you find a set of gameplay changes that have the desired effects they can be migrated to the server to capture any addition io and compute savings they generatepersonally i think it would be great fun if a subspace storm swept through new eden over a period of months causing various changes to the visibility rules it would probably spark a lot of conflict as the various alliances tried to take advantage of the changed conditions and game the rules being testedthis issue is one of the reasons im running for csm btw
since everyone else was doing it i thought id make a csm campaign video as well it took me a while mostly because i have never produced videos before i hope you guys find it funny
awesome
nice can i have your stuff opps wrong post lol
good grief and ur a example of the csm
nice vid  voted
1 footage shown outside of someones basement2 female player3 slim playerthis video didnt fool me one bit jk aside nice work  but im still going to vote for cat xd
i got a professional video for the more serious demographic which you can see here
someones knickers are in a twist
look at me look at me i want attention
well tbh  a lot more professional and a better sell
i would
well its all down to whether you take the csm seriously if you do  the the ankhaphatmawhitbread video is superior if you dont then the mazz video will probably tickle your fancya quick look at the outstanding issues the csm have given to ccp on their collosal an i mean collosal to do list would probably lead one to not take it serioulsyskunk
i have to say it is really good
chuckle 1 vote from me cause that was funny and if its not funny its not worth my vote
haha go back to macro evemail spamming people in jita
this is fake because everybody knows  girls dont play eve
propaganda dude propagandaissok 3
haha oops i guess firefox doesnt spell check every single type of text box
sadly votes go on past accomplishments of csm and there have been none infact ccp dont even listen to you infact ccp hardly ever meet you infact ccp dont even acknowledge the existance of csm infact despite hundereds of supports on some threads ccp still dont do anythinginfact i give upfuk itfunny vid tho
men play evewomen play csmwtb vid of catso voting is open is it
id go for a slightly dorky chick rather than a politician any dayaaaaargh stop moving the camera all the time its not cops
rawr catfighthow about you both slip into something less and have at it id vote then
moved from general discussion all campaigning should remain in the jita park speakers corner forum
thanks to this thread i have made my mind upnice video ankhesentapemkah and you have my votes
can i vote for the guy in the car hes the only person in either video who isnt  poor on camera
thanks for setting this up again
thanks much dv this is an awesome tool its interesting to compare how close the positions of so many of us candidates are based on our answers and important questions was it similar for csm 4 i cant remember
no positions were more spread out last time around not by too much though this time there is no hot button nurf x type of threads about those help to spread the numbers a bit additionally a few of the questions were a bit of a no brainer answer everyone is really going to give a thumbs up to a ui patch but it is something that ccp canwill never do at least in one go as the question states kinda makes the question pointless and waters down the matching process add to that there is the fix bugs over adding new content question which is basically the same thing just about everyone will agree and ccp wontcant do the end result is a bit more muddled result this time aroundfunny note you mynxee and ankhesentapemkah landed within 6 of each other when i did the vote match survey its really kinda funny since your one of the cps anitankh candidates guess pirates are really carebears at heart or are carebears really pirates edit reread after posting and saw that my post sounded dismissive of the votematch service i did not intend that i think this is a good thing for the csm election it is just that this time the questions are not as well selected to truly differentiate the candidates so while it narrows the field a bit the user has to do more research on which candidate is best for them this time quite honestly that is not such a bad thing
thank you very much for doing this again
nicely done thanks
perhaps it needs a few more divisive questions all things considered mynxee is pretty reasonable and there werent questions like should all low and null sec space be changed to 10 security and should people who pod be banned from the game
tada o is happy announce our new political manipulation ai is live and online it has been given its first task help issler dainze win a seat on csm 5issler dainze campaign advisor videoissler dainze your next csm representative

video seems to be working again enjoyissler
hee hee that was quite funny good luck in the voting fits antineurotoxin hardener ii
oooops
a mishap of some sort i take it click shadow
does anyone out there have a compiled list of ui fixes we want to see everyone is screaming fix the ui it seems a logical task of the csm to compile a list of specific fixes we want to see preferably one broken down by both implementation difficulty and priorityheres some quick suggestions allow items in people and places to be moved by dragging into open folders onto items within those folders rather than having to be dragged onto the folder bar itself implementation should be trivial include thousands separators in contracts for large numbers of items this changes 500000 zydrine into 500000 zydirne not only is that much easier to read it will also cut down scammers who advertise the contract as being for 5 million zydrine implementation should be trivial make bpc icons different from bpo icons implementation hard  very hard priority and so onhanding a nice long list of specific fixes to ccp is more likely to get them accomplished at least the ones that are simple to implement of course compiling and maintaining said list is no small task but csm volunteers are all eager to take up such useful tasks to benefit our community right
if someone would bother reading assembly hall finding a thread like this would not be hard for all those candidates that cannot be bothere to open assembly halllinkagethere where hundreds of other suggestions some brilliant some not so brilliant that sank under piles of garbage like lets ban everyone from pandemic legion and etc i tried to compile the ones i could findfeel free to add whatever is needed and ccp has stated they cannot give bpcs and bpos different icons for technical reasonsas an option ofcource ccp can rework the whole thing from groundup creating something completely new and neat
hey guysmy agenda is quite specifically inclusive of almost all these issues although i havent compiled a list with all of the suggestions from the assembly hall i have most of them noted and and infact a large amount have been posted or supported by me over the years feel free to convo me anytime im aroundtamber
since csm cant bring up issues that have already been presented to ccp at a summit it makes sense to look at evelopedia to figure out which assembly hall proposals are duplicates information about what ui fixes are in the backlog and how they are currently prioritized is something i plan to request a discussion session for in iceland if elected it would be useful to correlate that data with issues raised by csm and proposed in ah so that redundant effort can be minimized how much info ccp will share and whether cam will be allowed to share it with the community at a meaningful level of detail remains to be seen
any reason why dj is not on the list of candidates you can vote for
so instead you promote running on a platform of lowsec  we need to do something what quite i dont know but rest assured something will be discussed somewhere by well lots of peopleskunk
lol good work opskunk
he withdrew due to rl issues
chip mintago  the councilor you deservechip mintago is the candidate who will get action on ccps promise to provide opportunities for solo and small group pvp opportunities for them to fight it out with each other instead of getting swamped by giant blob fleetschip mintago is the councilor you deserve see chips videos and website at

yes yes yes yes goes into a corner to finish what he started
trained for one decided not to bother buying one fully support a boost to these ships
very new to game and i have to admit that i would play more if the font was bigger im tired of having to lean forward just to read and theres a lot of reading in this game1920 x 1080 at least size 16 please

not much time so will make this quick1 emexp resist nerf this resulted in a 18 increase in dmg for scorch and 12increase for mf these numbers are roughits 184ish and 115ish dont have a calculator atm so did it in my head2 for some reason a dmg increase sticks out in my head for large lasersbut i may be remembering an effective dmg increase from tracking given fitsfights at the time its been a few years since i thought about it 3check patch notes for dominion tracking was increased for arty to get the variation between tiers correct this is why i said projectile i agree with 1the playstyle inherrent in blaster boats is largely out of fashion or as you say weak blanket boosting tracking andor dmg wont make it a stonger playstyle unles you overbuffwhich would just be breaking everything elsebutbetterstrongermore popular playstyles were boosted in dmg and trackingwhich just serves to make a subpar style even more worthless giving hybrids a boost can at least return some of the ground lostthis doesnt mean that ships cant be modified if a boost occurs the tracking bonus on megaranis could be removed if a general tracking buff was implemented for example or removing turret slots from drone boats or you get the ideaeditadded last paragraph
this assumes that youre always shooting at armor and that you have no dronesfor instance lets look at a harbinger shooting at a brutix that only has a dcii for a tank before the change the brutix had roughly 34600 ehp against a harb with scorch loaded after 32980 a difference of 491this damage advantage clearly goes up when the  of hit points in armor goes upfor whatever reason but its never so pronounced as the simple vs armor numbers would suggestno such analysis was done and if it were it would be very suspect see that is the thing it would not return some of the ground lost the boosts did not make them gain any real ground in terms of what was best you still dont have a reason to choose blaster boatsthis is why i said that if you completely undid the laser and ac changes it would not change peoples preference for lasers or acs over blasters
on the first point i cannot check your numbers because i do not have an old version of eft handy and i do not have the inclination at the moment to work it out by hand however assuming that your numbers are correct it only stands to reason that shooting any ship that has a bulk of its hp in structureshield with a dcu ii would see less  benefit given the 60 resist of a dcu ii and the fact that base em shield resist was not changed thus why a gank brutix andor only fitting a dcu sees a smaller net change and why when you fit plates the numbers scew back towards the 1812figure a harbinger shooting another harbinger would see a larger  gain by comparison unless cookie cutter fitting is lses on harbs now with that said empfusionhailbarrageetc got a boost during that resist nerf by virtue of it hitting armor andor shields harder no change on the structure buffer tanks though then things got boosted for projectiles just recentlyre your objection to the lost ground argument if you argue that boosting blasters dmg andor tracking will not change the fact that we will have no reason to chose them over acs or pulsethen there is little reason to object to a boost in the first place you can be confident that such a boost even a large one is absolutely worthless in terms of what is bestnow if you argue that such changes large boosts for examplewould be detrimental then suddenly blasters are best at something and considerably enough better than anyother option that they break eve this is what you have said in earlier postscan you please clarify your argument for me i find it unclear
there is so much eft bullst here i have nothing left to puke with but my own intestents
i did it with the current its why i only used the dc 1 tech 1 adaptive magnetic plating with 0 compensation skills  5060 em resists on armor damage controls resists are not stacking penalized and so the base works when its activatedif we go to 3 trimarks dc and 1600mm plate the difference becomes 56166 ehp after 60954 before a difference of 85 for scorch less for am now i am sure we can break 10 if we consider big active tanks or zealotsshooting at big armor tanks but in the end its not that significantdoesnt mean i agreed with the change quite the opposite the point was that we werent talking a move to domination due to it especially since the strength of other damage types in those situations was still quite strong relatively theyre not that uncommonsmall amounts to the effect to correct for the aclaser boosts it wont have much of an effect that doesnt mean it wont be possible to boost blasters to have an effect but consider either of those two scenarios if you boost them a small amount and theyre still terrible nothing changes except the already good vigilant daredevil and taranis do more dps but now you still need more changes to blasters so the whines will continue if you boost them a lot then you will overboost things and move things out of whack and then you will get whines from laser users or ac usersand that is what is being asked for here either a boost to damage or a boost to range a boost to damage can have significant consequences for ships that dont have as many issues a boost to range would be paradigm breakingan example of what i am attempting to describe might be this imagine that a strength of 6 is the proper strength for a ship and there are 5 ships that use the weapons ranging from strength from 1 to 5 if you boost the system such that the ships in the middle str 3 hit the proper strength then you have a set of ships from 4 to 8 two of which are still underpowered one of which is just right and 2 of which are now overboostedrather than do that its better to evaluate each ship individually and ask why its not performing and what it needs to perform without breaking the paradigms the answer imo is pretty clearly that the thorax and hyperion need speed and agility and that the brutix needs to be brought in line with the tier 2 bcs but that is not what is requested so i cannot give my support and will continue to argue against such changes
it is much easier to boost hybrids then cut back those ships which become opsnote that ccp didnt do this to laserprojectile ships which are op atm currently 90 of hybrid ships are lacking efficiency and half of them are completly uselessif ccp fix them one by one it is fine with me but i cant see how that would happen if i look at how they balanced in the past
awww boohoo maybe you should find an effective way to use the ships with hybrid guns then maybeits not all about dps dude
well i can argue with you here blasters are all about dps but since im really bored ill add this log into eve and play it a bit for once really buy a ship like a cruiser id prefer if it was fitted with blasters but evrything will do in your case just leave your 50 friends and an fc behind go for a roam i mean undock set your autopilot to 0400 set security pentalty to 100 throw a dart on the map and goif you do that ill proudly become the first person on the eveonline forums that will actually care about what you have to say
well i can agree that blasters is mostly about dps but blasters already have quite alot of dps so its fine as it isbut i was more thinking on railguns that the dps isnt all there because if dps have been all in fleet fights then my 1400mm tempest would suck badly but it doesnt the tempest is pretty nice in fleet fightsand rokh and mega with railguns works good in their ways to
im impressed restraint not feeding the troll anyways what you have said is the problem we have here you and goumindong he never touched a blaster in his life so im more than happy to ignore whatever he has to say only think in 00 fleet battle terms not what happens on the daily basis to people using blasters in their t1 frigates cruisers and battlecruisers right now flying blaster boats consists of hopefully ramming your target and trying not to overshoot overloading evrything and trying to kill your target before it moves too far awaynot trying to sound like an elitist pvper here but most of the time all it takes is to click to the right or left as the opponent and you start the fight at 10km blasters dont do nearly enough damage even if youll manage to get into range to make up for thatimho what is needed here is redution of mass to some blaster boats or least try it out on sisi again im not an expert on ship balance but it doesnt seem reasonable that ship with lowest range are also one of the slowest
to the first thing yes blasters is very close range weapons and you just have to live with it its how they work its like we who use autocannons are in 80 of all times in falloff range and have to live with way lower dps than the eft shows they havesimply because when you goes into falloff you lose dps and even then its working pretty good that way for autocannonsits just the way how you use the ships with autocannonsbut to the blasters again they do poor damage at more ranges but the thing is to get inside optimal on your guns fastest possible once that happens you can do insane amount of dps ofc if you decide to move 15 km to get inside optimal on your blasters on the target then it can hurt a bit if you get shoot before you are in optimalbut in most cases the dps the blasters have does so much dps that they do so much damage that they can manage to kill the target before you die then even if you had to move 15 kmso its all about taking risks like an abaddon pilot is doing against an ac tempest with dual heavy neuts orbitin the abaddon at 1 km because the abaddon wont hit that tempest any good and the tempest will tank the abaddon because if the tempest is fitted right it will have a bit high em and thermal resistsor like having a neutron mega inside 5 km on your tempest thats not fun i can tell youso its not only blaster pilots who have to take risks to get something killedand no lowering the mass on some blaster boats is not the right way to go
supported tracking speed should be inversely proportional to intended effective range of turret other hybrid disadvantages compared to autocannons in small gangsolo warfare1 cant switch damage types hybrids are useless against t2 caldarigallente hulls but projectiles are effective against all t2 ships since they can switch to damage resistance hole2 hybrids use cap energy nuetralizer means game over for any gallente blaster boat auto cannons will still deal damage
this is a good example on someone who doesnt understand the advantages and downsides every of the weapon types have and then dont understands the balance between them
what exactly is the downside of an autocannon compared to a blaster again
fighting in falloff and lose quite alot of dps and on top of it doesnt have quite alot of dps to begin with
fighting in falloff is an advantage since the blaster cant hit it surely there must be some other reason
blasters are the shortest ranged weapons on the slowest ships acs are on the fastest ships and have longer range pulse have fairly insane range and only a slight decrease in damage compared to blasters and ac on ships that are faster and have more armor than blaster boats please explain how this is balanced
dont forget torps with insane dps insane range and nice platforms
yeah and then the blaster mega have the advantage again that if he scramble your tempest and web you and keeps you in his optimal once hes there then the blaster pilot have a big advantage to righteach weapon types have advantages over other weapon types that is weak in something like autocannons can keep hitting in deep falloff while the blasters cant really hit you but if you look the other way if the blaster mega can keep you scrambled and webbed inside 5 km your in troublesee where im going
as long as you can wait 10 seconds for your torps to land most close range ships will have fired their second or third shot by then torps work best at extremely close range where other ships have tracking problems but missiles do notexcept that requires the use of two midslots and assumes the minmatar ship doesnt also have scramweb and requires the gallente ship to magically be fast enough to catch the minmatar ship and keep it within range
lets take the blaster mega vs the ac tempest here againa smart blaster mega pilot fit warp scramblers instead of warp disruptors but a tempest pilot doesnt fit a scrambler but a disruptorso what does this ends up with yes the blaster mega can keep you scrambled keep your mwd disabled while the tempest only have the mega disrupted so it means that the tempest cant use the mwd to get out but the blaster mega can use the mwd to get back into optimal of the tempest if he wants so it means that the tempest is dead meat if that happensso its all about not being inside web  scram range of the mega in a tempest and thats gonna be as much of an issue as a mega have to get into web  scram range to the tempestofc if you jump into a system and lands 20 km from a mega it shouldnt be an issue for the tempest but if a mega warps right on top of your ass you might be in trouble if your in a tempest and gets scrambled and webbed by that megabut if that mega had been an abaddon for example then the tempest would never move away from the abaddon if you want to fight the abaddon the tempest will then mwd as fastest possible really close to the abaddon and orbit it at 1 km and then shoot himdo you understand now what im trying to tell here its just a basic understanding on how each ships and weapons works
im coming at if from a smaller ship perspective where time to get out of webscram range is much less in vast majority of the cases the autocannon fitted ship will get outside webscram range and then kite the blaster fitted ship to its death the minmatar ship is faster has as many if not more mid slots for websscrams etc
you also havent read what ive written have you the problem with blasters is explicitly that they cannot be solosmall gang platforms if they dont have the speed and agility to perform tackling duties and still get damage donethere are only two blaster boats in the entire game that are slower than their pulse laser equivalent that is the taranis compared to the crusader and the thorax compared to the omen few would claim the omen is superior to the thorax and the taranis is not considered a deficient ship the deimos is faster than the zealot1657d vs 1406z the hyperion is faster and more agile than any amarr battleship and the brutix is effectively the same speed as the harbingersome of them might not be fast or agile enough but that does not change their actual relative speeds you ought to respect that when doing your analysis or people wont take you seriously kinda like when you say that resist bonuses are not as good as repair bonusessrsly still waiting for the logic on that one
i see what you mean but thats minmatars job to kiteamarrs job is to always keep range while gallentes job is always to get closest possible fastest possible and caldaris job with missiles is something totally different again than the other 3 races have
suportedwhy do you suppose 1on1 mega vs tempestyou said mega is more dangerous than abaddon to your tempestthats true because damage typein other casehow do you think about meet t2 ship or shield tank shipin this case tempest is more useful by choosing damage typeyes acs strength is damage type and also blasters strength is only dpsbut everybody know that blaster just has a little bit moreyes so dps must be boosted  and also tracking too
liberal sparrow it was an example to show why blasters are fine and why autocannons are fine in their wayand those things with blasters and autocannons will still be valid if we are talking 5 vs 5 or 20 vs 20you still have to get close to your targets in your megas fastest possible while the tempest have to kite other ships that it should avoid to get to close to but still be within rr range to the others in your gang as much as you canedit you said that blasters just have a little more dps than other weapon types on paper yes but try to include resists into it all and dont just look at the eft dps and you will see that a 2x damage mod neutron mega does like 56 more dps than a 3x damage mod abaddon after resists on a target that is armor tanked for example if the abaddon use 7x pulses and one rrwell to make it clear you all are supporting this topic only because you mean blaster ships is to hard to use and then want blasters boosted so your life in eve can be easierlike our lifes with autocannons and minmatar ships is any easier than blasters and gallente ships is now
fixed it for you a tempest would likely have neuts as well so a blasterthron best kill it quick before it has 0 cap doesnt take long so no a rationally fit ac tempest would laugh in the face of a megathron you dont fly a pvp ship solo without scram andor nuet and expect to survive against another pvp ship but this is 1v1 with pvp ships which rarely happens in a gang or fleet blaster boats are useless shooting a miner or ratter can be done as easily in a dustbin with a staple gun as anything else not a rational niche for a ship if it can be done by any properly fit ship
bagehi dont be stupid do you know the reason why tempest pilots doesnt fit a scrambler because most of the time you have to keep distance and with distance you cant keep the targets scrambled and if you cant keep them scrambled then they just warps away thenand if you have to get close to an abaddon or geddon it doesnt matter if you have scrambler or a disruptor fitted then because they arent going anywhere as long they dont fit scramblers then but what is the odds to find an abaddon or geddon with warp scrambler fitted tiny i will sayyeah the tempest will most likely have dual heavy neuts fitted or one heavy neut and one rr but what does those neuts really means to a gang that is full of passive tanked ships that just gets repped by others in the gangit doesnt helps that much thereyes against an active tanked ship or smaller targets the dual heavy neuts will help alot against that in most cases
blasters cannot do their job even if they get closest as fast as possible because they cant apply enough effective damage when at optimal because tracking sucks at very close range therefore better tracking proposed qed
if you just sit still and just shoots then yeah i see what you mean but at least use your brain and move around to try and get the transversal down as much as you cantrust me it helps alot to move around as much as you can
the tempest will die long before the blaster ship is capped outif the hyp is in close this holds true even for a half and half hyperion that is running its rep the entire time let alone a blaster ship that doesnt have oneneuts are less about dealing with ships the same size as you and more about having an option to stop ships that are smaller than youif the blaster ship isnt doing much damage then neither is the other ship to the blaster boat this can best be seen with the mega and hype the mega has a tracking bonus and so has the best relative tracking of any bs in the game this means that if its missing so is the other guy except the other guy is missing harderthe hype has the space to fit 2 webs this gives it even better real tracking than the megathron which has the best raw tracking of any battleship in the game
sounds good in theory doesnt work so well in practice how about just having a blaster have an equal chance at hitting the same target at its intended range as an autocannon does as its intended range thats it not asking for more damagevolley not asking for more dps not asking for increased optimal not asking for increased falloff not asking for omnidamage ammo not asking for less cap usage just asking for equivalent functional tracking ability
theory is practice in eve unless youre claiming that there is some bug that is messing up the tracking formula for blasters claims that you are not hitting as well as others are simply not truealright so lets reduce the tracking of blasters
no other t1 or t2 gallente ship has a tracking bonus with the exception of the tristan and its a split weapons platform making the bonus only partially applicable is your proposed solution to add a tracking bonus to all gallente turret boats
so neither ship can hit in the blaster ships intended range only the autocannon can hit in the autocannons intended range see a problem here and intended range does not equal optimal range
hehe i have more kills with eagle only as kills he has phe must have awesome experience from ingame same applies to nightmarixand they want to say us how good blasters are they only see those on market or in eft
and the taranis that would leave the thorax and brutix without tracking bonusesdeimosastarte have a falloff bonus but they really dont have tracking problemsit seems that you did not get the irony in your comment so let me explain it to you1 at the optimal range of acs they have worse relative tracking than the blasters optimal range granted looking at a ships tracking relative to optimal range is pretty dumb really all you care about is its tracking whatever range youre at now which means that blasters track just as well or better than acs2 you specified hit chance at intended range this is funny because the intented range of acs is in falloff which lowers hit chance such to equalize hit chance at each ships intended range you would have to reduce the tracking of blasters since blasters hit more often at their intended range than acs do at theirsof course both of those are pretty funny because they both subscribe to the fallacy that two ships can be different distances away from each other but hey its the fallacy that you used so its the fallacy that i am perfectly happy to laugh at you forthis is not the first time the same pointless allegation has come up you are describing situations that cannot happen unless you are deficient as a pilot ship fitter or a bug exists that aint my fault
offhand light nuetron blaster ii 03165 radsecheavy nuetron blaster ii 01 radseclight 200mm autocannon ii 0315 radsecheavy 425mm autocannon ii 01056 radsecfunctionally the same tracking done with your trolling
yes that was the point you see you complained about the relative hit chance at intended range the relative hit hit chance is a function of both the intended range and the tracking since the intended range for acs is in falloff that has an effect on the hit chance of the weapon even at 0 transversal ac ships will be missing at their intended rangei was pointing out that your evaluation was ridiculous blasters clearly track just as well as acs pulse lasers clearly track worse range only has a function when youre describing the optimal range characteristics of the weapon which is a separate issue all togetherif blasters have good tracking then they have good tracking end of storyedit i have just about gotten you to water lets see if youll drink
is this a way to show that you dont know much about how the weapons works at alloh and there isnt anything called heavy 425mm autocannon ii or light 200mm autocannon ii fyisorry to say it but i have a very bad feeling that there are many players here in this topic that just screams boost blasters without even understanding how blasters autocannons pulses or torps works at all
the numbers are accurate even if the name is wrong you agree
now look at the optimal range of the blasters and then look at the optimal of the autocannonsis that a good enough hint for you to realize that the ranges have alot to say on how your hit chance is lol looking at the tracking number only is going to make you look funny and dumblike 800mm ac gun with emp l it have 3 km optimal with 0054 tracking while neutron blaster cannon ii with antimatter l have 45 km optimal range and 005412 trackingwhen the 800mm ac guns gets to 45 km where the neutron blasters have its optimal range then the neutron blaster cannon ii have more tracking  hit chance than the 800mm ac gun since the 800mm ac guns are then in falloff at 45 km and falloff reduces your hit chanceand then look at mega pulse laser ii with multifrequency l it have 15 km optimal range and 004219 tracking and guess what at 15 km the mega pulse laser ii have waaaaay way more tracking  hit chance than 800mm ac guns would ever dream of at 15 kmthe tracking and ranges on those guns with the stats i have is taken from ships with no tracking or range bonusesnow put the neutron blaster cannon ii on a megathron and you will get 007442 in tracking with antimatter l and that is quite alot more tracking than a tempest have with 800mm ac guns with emp l even more tracking that a tempest with dual 425mm ac guns with emp l have toand this is somerhing you didnt understand
hit chance not tracking different things
yeah i fixed it in my post
i guess it is to much to ask for goum and nmx free blaster threads is it
when someone just screams boost blasters in here and then right after that just shows that they dont have a single clue on how those weapons works or other weapons works then yeah someone have to protest
im taking this approachi need a t1 battleship with t2 fitting that can perform really well in small gang roaming pvp having level 5 skills in all battleships and having fought 3000 battles i have a pretty good feel for what works and what doesntright now i feel that my best options for close range pvp battleship are the dominix typhoon and tempest megathron would be pretty down on my list below rokh geddon and abaddonthat said megathron used to be my 2nd favorite ship  like 3 years agothe main issue with megathron and i suppose with blasters in general  fitting requirements are too harshthe damage advantage of blasters is completely insignificant in light of all the other variables that need to be considered ideally i want to think that blasters are kings of close range pvp but thats simply not truei give up on blasters except when i decide to fit some electrons on dominix  as something extra i adapted by using other shipsi dont believe there can be any meaningful progress regarding blaster issue while ccp designer suffer from damage phobia illness i dont think they have even acknowledged that they have this problem its much easier for playerbase to find work around this issue

yesterday i had to change email address since i somehow managed to get a virus that stole all of my contacts in my mail so now the old email address is being used by some spammers to send out spam mails with my email address and then sends it out to all of my contactsbut the thing i saw when i changed my email to some sites that had my old email address was that when i changed the email address to the new one then some of the sites sent out an email to the old email address i had that my email was changed to the new oneand some few of those sites who did it even sent out an email with an activation link to the old email address so you could reactivate the account you have on those sites with the new emailso in this case you cant just change out the email and then use it with your new email address before you have reactivated your account with the new email address from your old email addressand do you know why they do it yes its because of security ding ding ccp time to wake up on thisand this is something i want to see here in eve toand ofc that we can have the option to lock down the character for being used or being sold ofc you need to have the option to choose how long time the character  accounts should be locked down so if you know you wont have the chance to log into eve for like 6 months then you can just use the lockdown option and lock the character  account down for 6 months just to be sure nothing can happen to the characters  accounts in the meantimeeverything that makes the security better for our characters  accounts is always something im gonna supportso this is 100 fully supported by me
a simple but effective idea
not too sure what you mean by that i was under the impression that it simply sends the character to a different account name hence the personality would be different but the name remains the same and keeps its past history
yeah but you the player can get a different name under which to do business for most purposes thats enough
thats metagaming this proposal suggest possible ideas to completely avoid that given that players can already have unlimited accounts trade characters and delete characters there are already far worse avenues than a name change
id support it in principle but i think a reasonable grace period is warranted training expires after a couple of dayswhy not make this a 30 day grace period i like to be able to go on holidays and know that my market orders are still there if my account expires while im away for a week or two it would be nice to pick it up again with my market orders and datacores ticking over rl people regularly go on holiday for a couple of weeks and their businessesjobs continue to operate for a reasonable period not everyone closes down their business for a 2 or 3 week holiday coming back to billions of isk after 6 or 12 months is a bit much if youre not paying your subscription
pvpers decide to spend the couple of months training to do rd doesnt compute most pvpers will not spend a couple of months training a pve skills unless they already have all the pvp skills in several races seeing the average lifespan of a eve character i doubt that there will be a lot of people entering datacore production so t2 prices will go up a bit but not much as currently there is a oversupply of inventors for datacore production a few days after account expiry would be reasonable for market orders there is no reason at all to discount them if the character is inactive they are already penalized by the character not being active and following the market and they have a natural expiry date already voted for the removal of datacore ghost farming i am against the removal of buysell orders from inactive accounts

ridiculous suggestion that has already been discussed more than once in the past t2 bpos havent been the free isk printers that the op thinks they are ever since invention was introducednot supportedben
firstly i dont own a t2 bpobut not2 bpos dont influence the market nearly as much as people think read up on the qen articles about productionarguments about something being too good and therefore should be made worse are generally badyoud do better arguing the invention is a poor cousin and needs a buff id support that cheaper decryptors better mepe results from invention etc would be better outcomes in my view
dude a tiny amount of bpo manufacturers produce more than half of the t2 ships in the game a tiny amount of bpo manufacturers produce more than 13 of the total number of t2 items in the game and thats excluding t2 drones and ammo of which a tiny amount of bpo manufacturers produce more than 60i think its you who need to read the qen
those numbers are so utterly useless there are so many crap modules i wouldnt even think about producing as the profit margin is non existant same goes for many shipsif you strip out the bpos for those crap items  they would just disappear from the market eg shield recharger just to name onethe real interesting numbers are missing in the qen like percentage break down for all items that would give us a real picture of the impactbut then again  how can we trust an economist that isnt really playing the game and doesnt understand why prices move to what direction in eve pye prices eg
they should be removed without doubt
forgot to support this doh iraqi information minister nothing to see here t2 bpos have no impact on the market i repeat no impact impact on the market and the statistics are probably wrong anywayyeah like the interceptors all those crap interceptors with no profit where the tiny number of bpo manufacturers produce a whopping 84 of the total number producediraqi information minister but its probably different for everything else i repeat different for everything else
change t2 bpo into bpc with a number of run equivalent to jita monthy sell averaget3 production process the opposite way to get t2 bpcsame skills but not magic chance factorthen t1 everyonet2 empire and you need to pos investt3 lowsec and lower

also being able to multiselect bpos and apply a vote or action to themunlocking several hundred bpos every time you move and relocking them again is just a pain obviously i support this  anything that makes bpo management easier for the leadership
a stated aim of ccp with the dominion changes was to lure people to 00 it might seem strange that someone from a pvp alliance is looking to get miners into 00 but its about population growth and miners who come to 00 will also learn some pvp so its good for everyone the industrial index which is what is needed for certain exploration sites requires miners to maintain it miners need a place to refine their ore with the current system minmatar outposts have a clear advantage over the other outposts to lure miners ie they can achieve a 100 refine with a little effort and start out with a refinery  albeit a rather poor yielding one even before upgradesthis proposal isnt about nerfing the minmatar outpost or taking its advantage away but it is about bringing the other outposts up to some level of refining ability so that they are viable for miners the sole reason for these upgrades is to lure miners to nullsec unprotected miners  dead miners ie miners that will soon learn to bring protection while miners who bring a protective detail means profits for them and pewpew for the rest of us frankly ganking miners is no fun but fighting their security team is so without further ado heres what im proposingupgrade the minmatar outposts base yield to 35 and reduce the upgrade bonus to 5 per level this still caps it out at 50 for level 3 upgrade but will provide an instant boost to the outposts out there with level 1 or level 2 upgrades or even those without upgrades for that matterupgrade all other outposts to a 10 base yield to provide the most basic of refining a max skill pilot would get a bit over 60 without an implant  slightly better with the implant but still less than two thirds leave the upgrade bonus at 10 per level for these outposts meaning the other outpost can achieve a 40 base yield but at considerable expense a 20 or 30 base yield would be achievable in any outpost with a level 1 or 2 upgradethis provides some incentive for miners to do their thing and will allow manufacturers access to more minerals in 00 overall this makes things more self sufficient for an alliance in 00 without making it too easyive linked a spreadsheet showing that a 100 yield would be possible in a nonminmatar outpost but would require considerable training the minmatar outpost maintains its supremacy as pilots would need less training to achieve good yields at these outposts while other outposts have at least a reasonable prospect of attracting miners changing the values in the green boxes will show how different skills can achieve different yields in the different outposts
the reason ppl arnt in null is because of the image people getwhen you say nullsec to any highsec player they thinkima get blobedima get gatecampedpeople will ransom me then kill me anywaysall the things i wanna do are avalible in highsec or wormhole space so why go to 00make a new mineral that only spawns in ores from 00 and low sec  more people go that is all
protected miners  dead minersfor normal mining op you will only bring 1 or 2 ships for protection bit more if you are only doing it as cover to bait a cloaker one to tank npc spawns and maybe a zealot or something to pop the random sb or advanced tackler besides that your protection consists of warping to a pos in time since hulks are way too flimsy to be anywhere near a fight even if they got 200 snipers protecting them not to mention it would be way expensive to have a serious protection team with miners
although i like the solution its not addressing the primary issue null sec mining in most cases is a very very high risk proposition from a miners perspective and it really has little to do with outpost  pos refining rates as it does with survivabilitynull sec mining only has a proportionate risk  reward equation under the following circumstances a youve got a security team parked on the hulks usually you need a security team big enough to scare away anyone dumb enough try and pop a hulk expensive and difficult to organize b youve already got a system that has sufficient mining level and deep in null sec space that sees little traffichulks need a buff to surviablity  escapability better yet  start talking a t3 ships mining exhumer because the drop in null sec mineral ore prices doesnt make providing security viable anymore i would be the first in line to pay 600m to 800m for something that didnt make me feel like a giant bulleye as someone whos his share of hulks in null sec give me a chance to atleast make a break for it id be interested to see how that balances out against the meta 0 nerf in a couple weeks as long as a hulk is fish in a barrel and nulllow sec mineral prices remain where they are the risk  reward scenario doesnt pan out unless you are one of the lucky few i mentioned in the paragraph above maybe prices of null sec minerals will make it viable to pay for security again but thats not probable since its probably more designed to offset the insurance changesjust my 002iskjava
helloit will not make move miners to 00 but it will make people upgrade the existing systems and build real living placesthen you will have more miners simply because there is more people around the same systemtotally 100 even if just 5 for the last upgradeli
i dont live in 00 but all the material ive ever seen on minmatar outposts say that your proposal of 35 base refine 5level is already exactly the numbers that they have am i missing something here
other than hes drawing conclusions that just dont make sense no not muchrefinement at a minmatar outpost caps out at 50 to 80 it wasnt the best but it didnt suck either if im not mistaken i was there saw it myself problem is there was a tax that kinda messed it up so perhaps it is nearly 100 dont remember i know it wasnt 35 check bpos for outposts thats where youll get the base facts at because my refining skills pushed it pretty highpoint is the op is horridly misguided or misguiding the publicwhat he proposes would make alliances much more efficient and richer when it comes to the economicsin all honesty his alliance prob got the crappiest hand dealt with there space and ended up with a ton of outposts none of which are minmatar or only one and having trouble getting there goods refinedthis is nothing more than a stealth threadnaught trying to change the game mechanics in there favorgood intentions but they go straight to hell at least the proposal is rational just not good for the gamenot supportingwhile i would personally like to see all outposts get used for such things i feel changing that now would really mess up the balance of power in a big bad ugly wayif it was that much of a problem i say outposts should be destroyabledestructible rebuild what you want problem solved
firstly  yes i screwed up the minmatar outposts current status  my info was badly researched so the minmatar outpost doesnt need a change to its refineriesanyway its been pointed out that the same situation occurs with labs factories and offices eg the minmatar outpost gets zero lab slots out of the box while caldari get plenty and the others get a fewso i guess this proposal should be broadened to include labs offices and factories maintaining the factional advantages but bringing a basic level of all services to the outposts out of the box and allowing upgrades would make outposts a little more like an npc station
double agreement with highlighting the changes from csm and definitely more visibility on where we can find the meeting minutes id be interested in reading about it
this
asked for previously was being looked intofull support from me
i see your point not entirely sold on the idea but it looks better with a sensor strength based ecm before it said jammed no  chance and high skills
seeing as you typed me a nice long reply im just going to list everything that is wrong with this idea no fitting restrictions listed ibis of doom incoming 5 second selfdestruct sequence that is way too short for a nonship specific weapon random bonuses purely based on already existing ships within the same race the mention of supercaps if this weapon is installed on a capital and the bonuses is increased towards said shipsize then this will be the new iwin button for alliances with deep pocketsi see where youre going with this idea seeing as you mentioned the inability to bomb people in lowsec and highsec but this is not a good replacementwhat id like to see personally is the usage of ewbombs or a variation on this in lowsec
you cant kill an ibis in under 5 seconds
i like this idea 
hello people im currently running for csmhere is what i would like to bring the table  a new module for da mothership that would enable them to recreate the phenomenas encountered sometimes in the wormholes  like more shields or better armor resists for the entire gridthat way your fleet would have to be designed to go in harmony with the effect of the module while also knowing the effect might benefit the other teamthus bringing back the name  mothership to its full potential and scariness vote for me 
am i reading this wrong arent these already available in the ganglinks that you can put on command ships battlecruisers and carriers and motherships not sure if that got nerfed or not
no you are not reading this wrong gang links have similar effects but what i am proposing would be more powerful and affect everyone not just your fleet so the enemy might take advantage of it also the phenomenas in the wormholes also have downsides to them like less capacitors and those comes along side with the bonuses
so if i put in a mothership mod that improved shield recharge while reducing cap and planned passive tanked drakes for my own fleet i hope the enemy turns up in cap dependent active tanking ships then if they show up in passive drakes then i suspect a spaiits worth considering
but wormholes are not like normal systems so you cant really compare those 2and supporting this topic now is just plain stupid since the op have no ideas on what can replace localand eve wont really work without a local as things are nowso not supported by me though
give a comprehensive explanation on how you are planning on implementing a totally new and improved ship scanning system how it will balance cloaking how it will affect defender  attacker balance and moreif it doesnt impress as the changes to exploration then your idea is just the equivalent of a kid jumping up and down screaming to mommy buy me candy by me candy
againstif we pay for sovereignty what do we pay upgrade or if im right the maintenance of the system then jumpgate and communicationim agree if you link this point to the sovereignty and the standingwhy the roamer can know who is in im paying for the tcu and gate not themif you dont have standing then you jumpp in 00 as in wormholeif you are in good term if the owners you know who jump inif i go rpg to the endwhy blockade unit must be set in the system if i pay the bill for the gate i dont want bad people to enter in but this will kill roaming gangsbut be more in a rpg line
supported for removal of local constellation chat would then have a use and might actually get used
how are wormhole systems not the same as a normal system both have planets belts complexes moons but not moon mining of course poss and gates yes wormhole ones move but still the same mechanic i cant find one difference between nullsec and wormhole sec aside fron the moving gates and general lack of capships as for lowsec to wormholes the only difference is bubblesbombsetc and the previously stated differences are you saying that moving gates makes such a big difference so as to make it impossible to remove localas for replacement of local the mechanic is already there its called scanningfit expanded probe launchersend combat probe to center of systemscanprofitnot that difficult to bring a proberno need as probes and scanning work as they are nowfrom the cloaky gang aspect it gives them a much more defined role from the defender aspect it will stop carebears and wimps from crying about afk cloakers other than that not much change you already couldnt find them now you just have peace of mindboth get a nerf and boost attackers can now stage attacks and be less likely to be detected until the attack is on the way but at the same time defenders can ambush and trap attackers much easier
jag kara please answer me thisas you say you can just use the probe launcher and stuffs well yeah that kinda work to some point but do you really think there is someone that want to spend a whole day to find out where every of the players in a system arespecially when you think about bigger fleets it would sucks horribly to scan out some targets to later find out that you had wasted hours to scan out players that was in different spots but suddenly are at the same grid as the others right afterwhen you think deeper into this this will for sure never ever work by just removing local without replacing it with something else that can replace local
the db server and network developers would be lynching the game designers and csm guys from the rooftop of ccp hqi dont think you entirely comprehend what youre asking neither is bellerus
the difference is the safety from roaming gangs 00 has roaming and more pvp because1 roams have local allowing them to identify if there are targets to probesearch for in a system it also allows them to identify when they are being followed by a defense scout2 roams dont have to worry about the wh collapsing getting stuck on the other side of eve 3050 jumps from home can be rather annoyingroams rely on local not voodoo to find systems with targets1 would you suggest people wander blindly around looking for things to kill with the current scanner and no local that is what would happen of course this would be a boost to solo combat to some extent solo pvp ship against ratterminer that it2 this would be a huge boost to stealth bombers as im in love with stealth bombers im not going to complain much but im confident many would be crying for blood nerfs over this3 you seem to be under the mistaken impression that things people attack would last long enough for defenders to respond attacking fixed targets would be 100x easier without local metagaming would dramatically increase as spies would become the primary method for finding fleetsps everyone would fit eccm to be unscannable
i support putting it into delayed mode but as said there really needs to be an improved directional scanner to go with it i pirate i do fleet fights and yeah i even run some low sec missions the first two would benefit from such a change the last would become horribleas it stands my mission base is pretty secure mostly blues there and local tells me if a neutral or hostile comes in i dont warp off and dock like a pansy each time a neuthostile enters but it does put me on alert for probes at which point i start the usual scan every 5 seconds deal till they leave or i confirm its a nonthreatening ship without local id have to sit there and hit scan every 5 seconds from the time i leave station till the time i come back yes i can do it but im far more likely to stop traditional missioning instead this is keeping in mind i solo lvl5s so 30 minutes of missioning gives me a solid 70100m isk single clienting even that wouldnt be tolerableeve needs a radar and radar warning system as has existed in militaries around the world for 50 years if something like that is implemented so i get automated updates and some sort of warning of probes even if only a few seconds before a warpable point i would fully support removing local in any case i think this should be a high priority for ccp
i was thinking what would really bring people from high sec into low sec and what is a very common thing that people do in high sec then i thought well there a tone of people who mission and by all the poses at every moon in high sec there are a tone working on faction standing so they can place that pos then i asked myself why do i only do exploration in low sec and not bother with missions in low secso here is my proposals make missions like pvp how well rather a spam of npc ships that require you to use failguns aka railguns make the mission consist of 1 to 3 uber npc ships that are pvp fit such as blasterswebmwdscam sort of like a leet overseer from a complex this way the mission runner can use a pvp fit to run his mission and have a real chance to defend themselves if they run into a lone pirate at a gate though you are still screwed if there is a camp also you spend less time in the mission so you are less likely to be probed out another thing i know people would love is if you could run missions for pirate factions and i have an idea that would add a twist to it that will make those carebears to want to come into low sec in addition to the pirate loyalty point store you get a new option to spend those points on and that something call bribe a public official what this would do is allow you to bribe a public official to give you faction standing for that empire at a faster rate so say your running serpentis missions you could get gallente faction standing just imagine how many people would come to low sec if they could more quickly boost their faction standing to either fix it or to place a pos in high sec rather than grind missions for months in high sec i even asked around in local as i was board doing sell orders i asked what do most of them fear about going into low sec and i got a bunch of noobie players saying getting ganked at gate by pirates so i had a thought about this as well and this i know will be a very unpopular idea to pirates and i mean i like low sec pvp and such but i think we need to accept changes if we want more targets i say sentry guns be increased at gates and stations in 0403 and the current number be left alone in 0201 it will make people feel more safe and if this brings in more people you will have more people to maybe catch in belts as they ratmine and targets you can probe out i mean im sorry if we have to actually hunt rather than sit at a gate but its something i think could really help bring people inin the end i think these changes would not take a tone of effort by ccp to do and i really think it would appeal to to high sec people giving them a fighting chance being in pvp fits and make it worth the risk as well as make it feel more safe to them when it still really isnt it also still gives pirates target but just not by camping gates all the time anyway i am ready to be cussed out by pirates so let the flaming begin other than that any real feedback is welcome
 in part this has already been done by the introduction of pirate faction epic arcs it sure would be a good idea to extend this to normal low sec pirate missions as well scaling could be done simply via the normal mission levels l1 you face frigs 
you got some pretty good ideas here and ones that ive been considering myself let me address each issue in turn1 agreed but there should be more levels 12 or 3 should be able to be done in a frigate similar to the new pirate arcs level 4 and maybe 3 should be done in a hac or something similar this way you have a better chance of surviving the gatecamps on your way to your mission special agents should be instituted so you get the new lowsec missions instead of the normal highsec missions2 i actually cant agree here the agents need unique items similar to what fw has but the bribery issue i really cant see maybe have items available in the lp shop that are illegal in highsec3 this could be done but it might be better to increase the damage dealt by the guns have guns on the periphery to highsec deal 2x damage and have it go down as you approach empire 00 this also makes roleplaying sense as the guns deeper in highsec would be maintained lessanother idea i had is to move all belts in lownull sec to grav sites ships like the barges and exhumers and perhaps the mining ships like the bantam and osprey would be able to find grav sites with their onboard scanneroverall i agree with most of your statements and lowsec definitely needs a boost this is imho much better than the outlaw concept as itll bring new players into lowsec supported
good ideaalso a good pvp mission objective is to kill someone with less than 01 sec status or something no security loss from that single kill
the bribery is necessary for this to work as its the main thing to bring people in just think about how many people spend countless hours fixing faction standings or trying to get high faction for pos placement if you gave people a faster alternative they would almost defiantly do it even if some risk was involved and making the missions so you fighting in a pvp fit actually give you a good chance to survive in low sec i have spent the better part of a year fixing my faction standings i use to be locked out of 3 of the 4 factions space after kill my standings doing level 5s being a pirate and not caring if i had a better way to fix my standing omg i and who else wouldnt pass that upalso for loyalty store items i was thinking things like what the pirate stores offer minus the best items such as low grade implants and maybe faction frigates leave the the high grade implants and cruiser and up faction ships still in null sec so theyre is still a point to run missions out there
1 will the effect apply to all current agents2 almost all of mission income comes from loot and salvage so dropping the rats to just 3 would nerf mission income to even less than lvl 3s not to mention cutting out ninja salvaging as a risk to high sec missions soon enough even more ppl will switch to macro mining creating more competition for the already oversupplied market of minerals3 how would having 3 npc uber tanking ships tanking your dps while keeping u pointed make the mission go faster and make it less likely to be probed out in this case u cant even escape if u wanted to4 how would u be able to survive a pirate fleets dps long enough to even kill one of them when ure already taking heavy dps from the nowuber rats and depending how uber the rats r to begin with 3 of those rats could easily kill u anyway since thats usually how it goes when its 3vs1 in pvp5 since they know ull be fitted for closerange encounters since ull be pointed mwd jammed webbed and have closerange guns they wont even need tacklers so no killable targets for the mission runner to take revenge onall they have to do is fit for midlong range dps and the same result of ez gank would occur once again6 what if the last of those rats had to drop a missioncritical item can u kill all the uber rats fast enough before the pirate fleet catches u kills u steals the item and tries ransoming it back to u7 of course not because the rats r uber now and u cant sacrifice any tank for the extra dps needed making missions less of a sandbox and more cookiecutter fit required and last time i checked mining doesnt have a lick of pvp in it so theres another balance issue8 and if this would require your own fleet to always do it goes back to splitting income to the point where its not even worth the trouble and once again its back to more macro mining as the alternative9 last but not least look at the populated low sec systems like amamake 99 of those ppl r there for pvp so theres almost no mission runners to easy gank yet on a regular basis it gets blobbed or even cyno blobbed why because there r plenty of targets all the time if u applied this to the rest of low sec yes there will be more easy targets to gankfor a little while anyway then when all of the above happens enough times to the mission runners from even the rats andor the roaming blobs that will increase in response to this they will go back to high sec and things remain the same as before10 if this was an option rather than a forced change to all missions then theres no problem otherwise this isnt gonna fly because it doubles as a stealth nerf to missions and another way to force ppl into low sec for more easy gankswhich will still fail in the end
you bring up a lot of points and i really dont know what ya want i mean it is low sec its not high sec you cant make it have no risk if you have spent time in low sec though you learn things to keep you alive such as pay attention to local keep you scanner active and take the time to do a little research on the area you into answer some of your questions1 you would be working for a pirate faction such as serpentis or sansha so that means new agents located in low sec2 i want to buff gate and station sentries in 4 and 3 systems to at least hamper camps of the mission runners3 the uber npc ships in the mission would have very high bounties on them and have good chance to drop meta level 2 to 4 equipment this can equal good payouts in the higher level missions4 for the missions you want a typical pvp setup you dont want to be all tank i dont want the mission being a tank fest and if you have ever tried to kill a very strong overseer in a complex you know if you dont have the dps you fail as they have a strong rep also these missions are kill only not retrieve x item5 i do exploration in high sec and low sec and i do my research on low sec systems before i start probing i check for activity levelswho lives therefrequency of roaming gangs and when they typically come through also gate campers who they are and when they camp i find most this info through killboards such as battleclinic or i search for their corp boards on the net after i spot them in system as i spy all cloaked up its amazing how much of a fingerprint alliances and such leave cuz they want to show off theyre kills6 i get probed out while doing plexes and radar sites and most times i have my scanner active and the second i see combat probes im gone this is what you should do in low sec missions and dont go flying back 15 minutes later thinking they are gone go do something else ive managed to get away while i got 15 bs shooting at me and leet frigs warp jamming me always drag your npc attackers away from warp in point of the acceleration gate so your attackers have a long trip if its an ambush situation on the warp in point well kill off the warp scam rats then drag the rest away7 i never said anything about helping miners low sec mining should be done in some worthless hole of a low sec system that no one ever really goes and you should have scouts on the gates in systems next door so if someone comes you run mining in a dead end system and camp that one gate to hell works well to also try putting 2 shield transfers on your orca and one gang link and you wont even have to worry about rats showing up if your hulk pilots have good combat drone abilities i always hear someone crying about needing combat ships with the miners to stop the rats and ships guarding the gates shield transfers will reduce the number of combat pilots needed thus less of a split low sec mining sucks anyway go find a wh lol only way to really make low sec mining safe is to turn low sec into high sec or make some sort of like mobile control tower that you can set up at belts and everyone can mine in the bubble but thats just lolremember this is low sec you will get blown up at some point i mean really what do you want low sec to turn into high sec i try and make the risk worth it though through bonus to faction standings and pirate faction loyalty point store i dunno if you really feel you need more of an isk incentive maybe have one of the rats drop an overseers tear that concord buys from you this way you not flooding the mark with anything from these missions
in principle i agree with making missions like pvp and adding pirate faction agents i dont think theres any benefit to be had by increasing damage from the sentries  criminals will just bring logistics ships with them or bigger ships with a better tankin addition to making missions more like pvp youll want to make sure that players can run them in cheaper ships its not really cost effective to attempt to run missions in expensive ships when youre likely to be ganked every third mission unless you can make up your loss twice over or somethingand as for pirate faction missions youll want to stipulate that its the lower level agents and not the level 4 agents lowsecurity space isnt the most dangerous space and shouldnt have the same rewards as nullsecin general lowsecurity space wont be more populated until its more populated  meaning theres a chicken and egg problem if you have more noncriminals in lowsec its going to be a little less dangerous  but you wont get more noncriminals into lowsec until its less dangerouslet criminals leave lowsec painlessly add more lowsec do whatever you can think of to dilute the concentration of criminals and youll have a better experience all around
i hate calling people stupid so ill just acknowledge that even smart people sometimes have stupid ideas and leave it at thatingame actions get ingame punishements up to and including exile banning thats it what happens in game stays in gamedo you really think that ccp are going to monetarily penalise people for being active in keeping the game alive and healthy it just doesnt make marketing or commercial sense in any way
your just another cynical old vet p
oh yeah well id just buy plex off the market and say fuuuuuuuuuyour move
tamber spams ingame chat trying to buy votes is there some sort of rules for running for csmi have offically abstained as there is too much fraud in the csm voting and i no longer trust csms and the entire voting process as ccp seems to endorse voting fraud
this is an eve election not a real election votebuying has a long and distinguished history in eve elections having cost many candidates tens of billions of isk absolutely none of whom has won let him spend his money it wont get him anywhere or better yet scam him
i dont vote as i have standards no she malesno americansno american she males 
sweet how much is heshe paying
and the part where you take their money and then vote the way you wanted to anyway slipped right past you did it
he failed at reading the actual post before making his comments and not once have i said in local that id buy someones vote  give me some credit im alot more creative than just buying votes everyone is welcome to use my politicssimulator regardless of who you vote for or whether you vote at allheres the link  read the postand on another note herschel finallyi just mentioned in the csm chat channel that i wasnt feeling legit yet cause you hadnt heckled me in my thread yet x and why you werent running this timetamber
 ankhesentapemkah  but no tailor shops hereand herecan petition some gms and explain before the court why they killed some innocents and pay reparations to the victims otherwise they can rot in lowsec where murderous vermin belongs i think its time for some real consequence for criminal behaviour jailtime statloss no insurance whatever it takes to stomp out this antisocial behaviour they can do what they want in 00 but dont expect us to pay for their bull in empire spacenone of all that instead most pod pilots are the filth of society irrational immoral andor unstable infantile s that just want their next dose of shortterm satisfaction on the expense of everyone elsei dont have any corpmates i play this game all by myself i guess im the typical player that sees eve as a singleplayer game with a nice integrated chat and i hardly even use that thing well its nice that all these other players are there so i can buy stuff i dont feel like grinding myself and sell all my trash to which i dont needto me watch digits on screen grow bigger is exactly what eve is to meof course but how could someone elses suffering be fun id say that people that enjoy that should be locked away in a mental institution for startersand so onhow it would work basically csm members will vote for working with ankh or not in case votes are over 51 or maybe a higher percent  they will discuss this with ccp making this a top prioritya good question is why csm members should vote aswell if the eve online community are already voted her in from my pov because the other csm member got a lot of votes to so they represent a big part from communityif their accumulated arbitrary numbers 30k votes dont want to work with 1k votes they should not and they should be able to do something about itside note that apply in this case when ankh has been already been proved to be a hater to eve online and eve spirit and a blunt stupid liarlet her improve puzzle pirate what is that crap anyway  and have a mark there not heresorry for my englishremoved trolling comments  adida
how rude
you think this is bad how about the other members of csm theyll have to listen to her and pretend they care beside whos gonna elect her isnt there more than 9 people running
you seem to be mad want a cookie what exactly are you trying to say democracy where only the majority is represented or do you want also to ban everyone who vote for her from eve you really are in need of a cookie
me  mad  for what or do you want also to ban everyone who vote for her from evei think that is on her agenda and many worst thingsdemocracy where only the majority is representedas long the votes for csm dont get over 51 of the numbers of active accounts this is not a democracyand you seems to be mad about somethingwant a cookie
other than the obvious fact the op is acting like a total idiot in smearing someone in a board meant for discussion on game mechanics and less on attacking people directly which is against the rules mind you the only thing ank is guilty of is forming the wholly and utterly ridiculous take care party which is utterly insulting in itself sorry but its truebut nothing tops larks breaking the nda and mazz starting a proposal which was quickly and overwhelming voted down only to get shoved down ccps throat and passed as evidenced by recent events even if ccp planned on making the changes its quite obvious a great deal of influence was passed over the majority population herefor the record i dont have a problem with csm getting longer termsunending terms however utterly ticks me off to no endseeing mazz and others openly state that the csm is just a quick way to get a free ticket to fanfest and so forthi even heard from one of my members that a former goonswarm member questioned naturally the member in question voiced the above and he agreed shocking isntthe csm has become a total comedy show its utterly ridiculous and the csm members at best mock its true natureim not saying they all do it but for all intents and purposes its reputation is utterly ruined if not severely tarnishedjust look at this ridiculous post this is proof enough next stop smear campaigns for things csms say at the drop of a pinits bad enough when you get someone from an alliance protest there own alliances actions and there own alliance members vote one big fat smelly trollyes yes break out the pitchforks bust out the torcheslynch mob here we goyou want my honest to goodness ideamake the application process a bloody hard battle to get intoo easy to bs your way into the csm there needs to be changes big changesme walks away shaking head
other than the obvious fact the op is acting like a total idiot in smearing someone in a board meant for discussion on game mechanics yeh im a idiot bored idiot at work prolly you will not believe me but im not an alt of the candidates nor get payed for this i found her topic some days ago when i was browsing candidates for my voteanyway about the bolded part from the sticky in this forum any eve player can raise an issue for debateyou say is only about game mechanismbut you think is ok not to say anything about someone who can put a lot of stupid things about game mechanism on the agenda  what is easier to frown on 10 issues every day or to cut the evil from the roots take a look hereand here and im sure you will find more non game mechanics topics related prolly just a few of them but they areabout the personal attacks she is a liar is provedshe is stupid forgot the chat logs exists probably and she keeps going with no answering to trolls policy and so on if someone can prove she is not a liarstupid i will happily apologies and retract my words
but she drives a mini a mini
the csm is merely a way to spend some subscription money what difference does it make who gets into it
im not sure what your getting at here there is no result of the csm voting out yet so until then we will have to wait and see if she at all will get into the csmi suspect that she will not reach the csm this time my main reasoning for this is that she ran a very good public campaign for her csm1 and csm2 no i didnt vote for her but i know good campaigning when i see it the votes she will get this time will either be from people who are unaware of her outings or just who vote for the lulzhowever i am not going to defend her or her outings because i think these comments should not belong to anyone who is supposed to represent what eve stands for and what the player community wants as i see it most of us play this game for just the things she despises and opposes which is risk vs rewardbut publicly smearing anyone is not the place for the forums and especially declaring somebody mentally unstable see other assembly hall thread is just plain against the eula and for a good reason too she has yet to comment on her outings in her own forum topic and this is not doing her any good i suggest you post there next time
if she gets enough votes to get in  then she represents some group of the eve community even if something that she wants that goes against the grain of what ccp wants for their game do you honestly believe that they would go along with it i mean seriously making the csm stakeholders is one thing  pooping in the nest of the goose that lays the ccp golden egg is just sillyagree with you that threads like this arent conducive to the goals of the op but then lynchings rarely are thumbsdown
well at least you got 1 person supporting youedit  i just noticed that its you supporting the thread ignore the above bit of good news
i dont like her as a candidate and i dont like the idea of her being chairwhich truth be told is quite possible but this idea is ludicrous she has some crazy ideas but she doesnt deserve to be booted off the csm for them if she gets elected what lark did was about the only valid reason for a kicking  if being crazy was against the rules we wouldnt be able to find 9 sane folks to build a csm out of
did it occur to you to check history too or are you too dense to figure that outevery time someone tries to raise an issue that is not about the game itself but about someone in the game it gets ignoredheavily trolled and shut downvery rarely does it ever succeed so captain ahab continue to entertain yourself and make the problem worsebecause in the end your just an another smelly trollyou want to do something about it shadup and run for officeotherwise walk away smear campaigns dont work never have never will not here anywaybecause youll never convince a population who as a majority dont vote to bother do anythingand did it occur to you that the only people who even vote on these ideas are csmtalk about contradiction of the worst formhave fun chasing that white whale because im getting off this ship better things to do with my timeps for the record i wouldnt vote for her either but thats not the point
the british national party has one seat in the london city council but that doesnt make london racist big deal if the carebears get one csm seat plus the devs will ignore these absurd supposed proposals of hers that youve posted anyway
ow and nobody else tells lies damn you must play another eve than the rest fo the communityright on the spot there csm members decide if they want to vote for or against proposals brought in by ank and not some random troll on the forumsif csm are that guillable to just respond to every troll that crossed their path they would only be doing csm duties and troll control and no way play the game which they are in for the major partif she is an eve hater she will get sidetracked by the rest of the csm and ccp but kicking someone from a csm while a part of the people voting got her in then you basicly say that those that voted for her dont count and thus we might aswel forget the whole csm since a democraticly voted csm seat means nothingyou are in the misunderstanding that democracy means that everyone votes what you want to get voted but in fact it means you also will have to listen to ideas and sugestions you actually dont approve of if voiced loud enough
very rarely does it ever succeed so captain ahab continue to entertain yourself and make the problem worseso sometimes it succeds thats good enoughand worse  what exactly is worse because in the end your just an another smelly trollcombat less my apearencesmell and more the ideea presented i dont see anything in your post about it and if you think is not worth your time just dont post problem solvedyou want to do something about it shadup and run for officeyep i want to do something about it i made this topic like it say in sticky i have all the rights to do itand did it occur to you that the only people who even vote on these ideas are csmtalk about contradiction of the worst format least have you read what i wrote  i propose the csm to votehave fun chasing that white whale because im getting off this ship better things to do with my timei kinda doubt if you had you would have not postedplus the devs will ignore these absurd supposed proposals of hers that youve posted anywaywhy to waste precious devs time to present the devs the stupid proposals  like i said is better to cut off the evil from the begining before wasting anyone time and nervesnot the ccp have a good records of doing things in time soon tmow and nobody else tells lies damn you must play another eve than the rest fo the communityfeel free to point some in the other candidates and make a topic about them or post in theirscsm members decide if they want to vote for or against proposals brought in by ank and not some random troll on the forumsright on the spot there csm members decide if they want to vote for or against proposals brought in by ank and not some random troll on the forumsif csm are that guillable to just respond to every troll that crossed their path they would only be doing csm duties and troll control and no way play the game which they are in for the major partwell i made a proposal like many others here good and badis csm choice to akwnoledge this one ignore it or discused i bet there are really more useless proposals around hereif she is an eve haterif  she will get sidetracked by the rest of the csm wasting everyone time and create lots of dramabut kicking someone from a csm while a part of the people voting got her in then you basicly say that those that voted for her dont count and thus we might aswel forget the whole csm since a democraticly voted csm seat means nothingi said earlier about democracy at least my view for the csm to be a trully a de mocracy at least 51 of the active people needs to vote but i see your point and that is indeed a problemyou are in the misunderstanding that democracy means that everyone votes what you want to get voted but in fact it means you also will have to listen to ideas and sugestions you actually dont approve of if voiced loud enoughbasically she hates eve and want to play puzzle piratesshe plays eve in single player modenot misunderstanding from me i never would have type  here vote for xxxis just a humble proposalcsm should focus on improving gameplay of eve online not hating the game and wishing to destroy it ccp team is very good at that
you have tapped into one of the two major downsides of democratic systemsfirst being the tendency to get bogged down in endless debate second being what you can not seem to cope with giving anyone and everyone a fair shake regardless of opinions once you start gagging people with opinions even the unsavoury ones you relinquish the title of democracy  all it takes is one really if you are unable to debate a person into submission  you are free to ignore them this however is neither here nor there
if you feel that way just vote for another candidate no one in their right mind who has the slightest experience of her arguments and her opinions would vote for her anyways
hivery often there is necessity to move on 2245 jumps thus without transporting any cargoes in this connection you couldnt consider reduction of time of preparation jump clone at least till 6 oclock and in ideal till 4 oclock instead of 24 hours it would solve many problems with settling or partial finding in zero regions of inhabitants of empireiss easy sorry to my englishbye
if anything jump clone timer should be longer not shorter no thanks
what about the times when one has to move 21 jumps btw i support this mainly because im a lazy bastard 15 minutes between jumps would be somewhat winny
skill to reduce to a maximum of 12 hours plz
please give me a single reason why any non cloacked ship should be impossible to scan down i can see neither any gameplaywise reason nor any logical sence in that if you want invisibility get a cloack
it is impossible to do anything with active cloak with eccm you can try that lowsec mission you can do your highsec missions without griefers going in for the completion triggerthe sacrifices you need to make to scan someone down are nothing compared to the sacrifices you need to make to nullify it as it stands stopping any mechanic other than cloaking to prevent it would make probing way too powerful
there are other means of running a mission safely making your ship unscannable and unvulnerable is not the way to go
it is not the only way to go but a viable one nonetheless the single highslot of a probe launcher is in my opinion powerful enough as is and a non cloak counter should exist i would love a module that reduces sig as well though that is another discussion for a change in eccm this thread is derailing i simply state that probing difficulty will be an issue and am assailed by those who claim that everyone should be probable that is not the content of the thread
grr after spending a frustrating 3 hours using directional scanner to locate a macro ratters loot can i propose to make cans probable  alongside wrecks for those pesky bin diversmo atm is to locate it on directional scanner then find a spot that is in line with said can and a warpable point then to make bookmarks either side of the can and keep bming in ever decreasing amounts until you have a spot that can be traveled in a small fast shipeven though it is possible using this method it is a total pita to do and when you are down to around 10000km as i am the last part is basically luck based if you have any deviation on your approach you lose the direction you ought to be headingas macro ratters are a huge problem at this time in the game i want a reliable method to be able to catch themhint most macro ratters safe spots are within a 100km range of their safe spot loot can
supporting my own idea
if this happens youll simply see people stop anchoring gscs in space and at yet another halfbaked proposal that willof courseonly be used to help defeat evil macros
we need at least one pink battleship  the hello kitty typethus bringing more female players into the game and making our vents server more sexy to listen toim going for csm and if you want to meet chicks with the same interest in eve online you have then  vote for me here 
i think you might mistake elementary school girls for the women that actually will enjoy this gamea lot of things can be improved that might irk women more then men but improve the game for all focusing on dumping an 8 year old girl from hello kitty online into the cold dark depths of 00 might not be the wisest of things

heyi dont know if anyone else finds this a problem but let me speak my piece gallente dont have a newbie friendly pvp frigatethe tristan it would seem by the slot layout is the current top tier frigate but the main problem is that you have to waste alot of sp as a newbie in missile launcher operation skills to make it any effective unlike other races missile skills are completely useless to gallente beyond this frigate beside this the frigate is extremely slow it doesnt help that unbonused blasters have a very tiny effective range and theyre the main source of damage when it comes down to the sp and training not just the ship bonuseswell what i would suggest is to make incursus the fotm frigate for gallente give it 433 like it should have from the beginning remove the drone bay to level the damage output and increse pg and cpu 2 low slots are not enough for a newbie pvppiracy ship you have to choose between repair or ehp it means drones raip you make tristan like other frigates with sb as their t2 variant give it 3 launcher slots perhaps remove the drone bay too bonus its thermal missile damage give it 422to be very honest here i hardly care what happens to the tristan im just really tired of having to pick my poison when it comes to starting as gallente atm its either waste your sp on a really slow frigate with little effective range or use a cheap substitude for an interceptormy second problem would be the fact that theres no first tier to medium pulse lasers low cpu and pg this is the reason you cant fit an omen and a maller properly these ships barely dont fit even with perfect fitting skills and what about newbie pilots maller is really gimmicky it doesnt do any damage and i can hardly find it fair that it cant fit a 1600mm plate and a set of guns even then itd barely hits and the ehpdps ratio would still be worse than on other ships but least it wouldnt be as terrible same for the omen could i perhaps fit an 800mm plate a mwd and 5 guns on it right now it requieres weird practics like fitting an ab or filling low slots with adaptive nano platings im not even bothering to mention its impossible to fit for newbie pilotsquad beams arent a substitute here they have serious tracking problems theres no range gain and their t2 crystal selection is just awfulso what you guys think theres more to this ofcourse like how the new lasers will affect the prophecy or the harbringer theres alot of balance going into the frigate changes too but i hope you find the idea reasonable
im not sure about lasers but the incursus already is the fotm for gallente pvp you can outfit it to do quite a bit of damage and have the ew necessary to take down other frigsnot supported on the gallente frigate issue not sure about lasers but i havent heard any problems from them i dont fly amarr
your problem is you want 1600mm plate  medium turrets the gallente boats got to downgrade to small turrets in that case aswell800mm platefocused medium pulse works on an omen
again its fotm for all the wrong reasons one of them is the tristanid like to see the 800mm omen fitting please or better yet show me a newbie friendly fitting for that a tier 1 combat cruiser rupture doesnt have problems fitting 1600mm the thorax pg discussino is for annother topic beside this maller has no bonuses to damage its dps to tank ratio is pathetic and fitting medium pulse lasers could fix this
cute but i have said the fittings you have posted arent good even before you did post them doesnt the fact that you absolutely require fitting rigs just to get your basic modules in bother you or that you have to put inefficient modules into the low slots just to fill them up i dont have to do it with other ships why do amarr have such hard time with thisagain why arent any of these ships newbie friendly theyre t1 cruisers and shouldnt require perfect fitting skills just to make them barely workbesides if i have problems reaching you with english then tell me ahead of time cause it seems theres a problem with understanding what i wrote
you need fitting rigs for the mwd version the links have a version with ab without any fitting rigsand about the good or bad  those are kind of the standard fits for them of course you see the 1600 plate bait maller more often
ccp already has a solution for docking games they like to call it incarna this yearonce wis comes out docking games will cease to exist station camped go play some intergalactic bingo in the cantina
i dunno this is just a off the shoulder idea but what if you increased the dock timer a bit and also add more undocking areas to station that you could chose when you leave the station right now you just get one spot to exit the station that is camped to hell maybe if theyre were 3 exits it would spread the campers more thin and give you more of a chance to run
really how complicated does this have to be base the  timer on the mass of the ship
i would like to propose a mid slot  the docking computer jammer it would prevent people from doing the station game people undocking carriers to remote repair during the station game would really commit the ship in question to the fightbut a docking jammer is quite a powerful device thats why it cant just be that the warp scrambler also prevents docking you need to sacrifice at least a slot to get thatalso it should reduce your sensor strength like the warp core stabilizers so you cant target undockers too fast and i think freighters and transport ships should get like a 2 or 3 bonus to counter docking computers strengthim going for csm right now so if u want this idea brought to the table vote for me 
after stations have windows
not supported another i win buttonthere has been far better suggestions of docking timers depending on the ships mass after aggression a module that prevents anyone docking is totally overpowered and would be abused all over eveput your weight behind the timer according to mass proposal that is far more balanced
not so keen on the covops cloak but having them buffed with a few more hp and able to go through a covert jump portal would be very nice indeedat present theyre just a little to easy to loseedit supported the thread
this is probably falling on deaf ears but i must support to keep the hope alive
so if i get this right you think the fact that this smack talker got suicide ganked by 10 ships is bad because he dropped roughly 420mil 434mil by bc standardsso420mil1042mileach ganker got and only because they were way lucky on the drop 42mil for thier efforts it would have been much less if the 300mil mod didnt dropif they bought the boats off sell orders they would already be in the whole by a couple mil according to the numbers i just saw in jita at least before fittings so they didnt even get the 42milif they bought the boats off buy orders and so they could profit from the ship going boom regardless of the drop then some stupid sod sold them the boats for less than the ier the likelyhood that they got more than 50mil totaldropinsurance is slim again if the atype booster had not dropped they would have been looking at 12mil each so if they buy boats from sell orders they make close to nothing if they bought it off buy orders then who knows what they would have madebut probably not more than 1718mil plus they have the sec loss which effects different people to varying degrees if you have access to safe 00 to rat in its negligable if you do not it can be much more of an issueeditspelling

this is officially the first thing ankhehiwefijhwiefiwe has said that i agree with ccp could learn a lot from dwarf fortress when it comes to pi imo its an awesome game and possibly has a steeper learning curve than eve
adam who
ccp always say they dont have time or that it is put in the backlog perhaps they should work less on rushed expansionsthe expansion model they use will not work in the long term yes they will likely attract or retain a lot of players because of the shiny trailers but ccp is damaging their reputation every time players become disappointed by the actual expansion contenteve has a rich backstory and there is plenty that can be done with it sure the two events that happened in fw were somewhat interesting even though the fw fundementals are broken players want to leave their mark on the game thats the purpose of a sandbox after all and it would be logical that the capsuleers will determine the outcome of eventsthats why i am sad that ccp makes static epic mission arcs prescripted quest stuff can never compare to actual live events instead of builing that engine to create epic arcs they shouldve created tools to facilitate live events npcs should also be a lot more dynamic and occasionally should stir up trouble for the players to deal with succeed and the threat is averted fail and something gets overrun its not like this is something impossible guild wars 2 will rely heavily on this and theyre starting to introduce this system to guild wars 1 as well as the outcome of gw1 live events will determine the backstory of gw2for those that think this is too much pve yes it relies on pve but in eve these events can be set up to be very competetive especially in a pirate faction or fw setting
i would say your campaign is going rather well keep running for csm the ammount of lulz i had from this thread was awesome  especially those logs
i say yet againi see you manage to totally ignore all the quotes from yourself how do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you dont even attempt to refute your own quotes not only do your own quotes make a liar out of you  you then simply ignore any posts that call attention to themsrsly quotes from you that directly contradict what youve been trying to say during this thread and you wont even acknowledge them gotta love those blinkersps yes  i plan to paste this after every single reply you make until you address them as to inform the people what kind of twofaced individual were dealing with
yes yes it is indeed
i second that youve almost surpased 10k reads which is great marketing regardless of what the content is tamber
forget it mate  she says she wont reply to trollsa troll being someone who would like to debate her issues andor doesnt 100 agree with her vision of how eve should beie hello kitty in space or something similar
well regardless what the trolls say ive read every single link provided and absorbed as much as i can ive only ever voted once for vuk and since then nver voted or gave any interest to the csm however after reading annks manifesto  ive given her my 2 votes as she seems to be someone i would like to represent myself with my varied and wide experiences of the gameankh 2 votes winging your way
lmaolying on your cv is bad ok
if youll notice ankhe wont even deny those quotes even a simple i have changed my mind since then and they no longer represent my opinion would be a start but as weve proven ankh is still a bitter carebear with an agenda to stop the parasites from ruining puzzle pirates in space unfortunately there are a lot of bitter carebears who will see this as a chance to lash out through voting
i actaully admire someone who has the backbone to let trolls spam their crap and just plain ignore them instead of going into a flame wari tip my hat for eva jobse that she can actually manage to just stay constructive in the replies towards the real questions and completely ignore the sthis is far better than i could have donethe thing i also like is that she looks at the whole game and not just at the narrow vieuw of the pvp crowdthey all call eve mainlt pvp focussed well in some way they are right but market pvp is a lot more work that a gatecamptrade is way bigger than pvp since as soon as someone sells or buys they actually partake in trading and to be fair not 100 does the pew pew thingy but 100 does to the trade thingy in one way or another
this thread confirms beyond doubt that people who drive new minis are bat crazy
i knew there was something off about this toad ever since i watched her engrish whining about fw in the fanfeast videos
yeah only were not trolling were making serious points and she continues to ignore them or cry troll the moment she sees a comment that isnt in agreement with her she backpeddles and has contradicted herself multiple times and has stated she doesnt even enjoy the gameedit  watch as she either completely ignores this post or calls me a troll
you guys do realize that with all your whining and ing and moaning about anks positionsstatementsstuff that youve pretty much whipped up any idiot that has ever been scammed ganked or suicided into voting for herim predicting that ank makes it onto the csm again  and that the trolls in this thread instead of hurting her chances are actually helping herif you really wanted her out  you should have just ignored her  now shes a celebrity carebear
uh huh no trolling here none whatsoever ive never seen a less trolled thread in all my days of eve its an outrage ppl are being demonised here
lolunder specific skills she has broad general knowledge and structured and logical thought
yeah but she was before too realistically theres no way we were ever going to keep her off the csm yeah theres been some trolling in this thread itd be hard to deny that but theres a lot less than ankh claims asking a serious question in a mean way isnt trolling its just being slightly jerkish but tossing up softballs is not the job of a critic this thread could stand to be more polite but the questions and concerns being raised are legitimate
yeah because asking someone to explain why they say one thing and yet their quotes show them saying something totally different is really trollingall ive seen so far is a candidate that ignores questions she doesnt like and pretends her old quotes dont exist when they come back to bite that and people supporting this behaviour
thanks a lot for voicing your supportlet me know if theres anything i can do after the elections and stay in touch
you cannot say i dont like raising the term limit and then immediately but im going to take advantage of it to run again apparently fighting in a video game is immoral but being an unashamed liar is not immoral ankhe contradicts herself in the same sentence ignores and refuses to confirmdeny her previous statements and has simply stopped replying with anything except youre all mean trolls even if you agree with her politics how can you put your faith in a csm candidate who will simply cower in the corner and call the other representatives trolls if they dont agree with her shes proven herself completely incapable of handling herself in a rational debate or justifying her statements she refuses to respond or disprove her detractors if you have ever done any kind of pvp ever its obvious why voting for her would be a terrible idea if you have not done any kind of pvp ever it would still be a wasted vote better spent on someone with the backbone to stand up for their own ideas rather than hiding and covering her eyes at the first sight of opposition even if youre the most bleeding heart carebear your vote is deserved by someone with the guts to actually push their ideas
first off i did not share ankhs views and did not vote for her but the amount of trolling and storming done in this very thread are kinda disturbing while some guys tried to stay mature and ask questions some others are running a omgcarebear campaign and just try to make her look miserable whenever they cancsm is playing democracy online and what is done here is just yellow press quality threadnaughting when you do not like ank do not vote herthis thread is so full of mudslinging that it gives the intention that if you would not go here and sling mud ank might get elected but instead of actually preventing that election by supporting your candidate you have created an propaganda campaign visuall for any carebear all time and have done so in most of the time rly not appropiate waysif all this would have been a pr stunt it would be just brilliantcongratulations you have just boosted the votes of your least favourite csm candidate
confirming direct quotes are mud slinging
that was a low blowalso sniped
wowjust wow
ankh im having difficulties accessing your current campaign videogood luck regardless
thing is she is on the carebear bandwaggon yet has no to little clue about the industrial side no pvp knowledge yet spouting crap on how she will sort out  low and null sec she is going to fix fw yet all she did was to exploit the bugs and use stabbed frigs with cloaks she  learned a great deal about life and war in 00  yet was not in the cva defense fleets or got involved in the running of the corp she very happy to jump on anything that sounds good and will be popular but there are balance issues that effect wider aspects of eve and she is clueless generally speaking these pvpers and pirates she hates so much have better all round knowledge of eve as they all have carebear alts or mains 
 it why should the rest of us stand by and wait for csm members to embarrass themselves and make a joke out of it when we can do it too voting for ankhesentapemkah for the lulz factor her being on the csm will be a nonstop troll to the rest of them you movie was utter  tbh you talk thru your teeth which is really annoying too all the same the amount of tears you are generating is too good to pass up
voting ankh just to see the drama unfold  this idiot has a year of hell ahead of her but i kinda lost interest to care because she has a thing of putting the point through that my own amusement  then her mental household
im inclined to agree the csm will need a good secretary to do all the womans work anyway ive already voted so you wont be seeing any from me though
focus group schedule update i had to change the time of the sunday 9 may blobs focus group to a few hours later due to a rl obligation that shifted sorry and hope this actually makes it possible for more folks to consider participating in that one i really appreciate all the support both in this thread and in the evemails ingame channels and other venues
would be down for the low sec focus group if you wanted mexwould sit in on the ecm panel but i can only speak to the use of ecm from an fcs pov and not from the boat itself
ill admit that i like the idea of quicker communication from ccp in terms to widespread player reactions how do you see the csm becoming more involved in this
you dont know me at least not under this character but you have both of my votes 
i was looking down the list flitting through pointless n33bcake candidacies wondering where id find the noir candidateyou have my vote carole mynxee if only for being one of the few competent women on the internetz a serious business
two votes flying over your way
vote for mynxee d
mynxee is cool your vote wont get wasted on her3 from me

you have my two votes and i hope you get in never mind all of the nay sayers there will always be someone out there to say why this good idea or that good idea will not work personally i think your issues are perfect good luck
thank you for your kind words but i really dont mind people disagreeing with me as long as they do it reasonably politely it helps refine my positions and arguments and occasionally i find out im wrong and so learn something newand if you think my candidacy is worthwhile consider evemailing your buddies and asking them to support me
you got my votes too bump
you got my vote
would a boost to the ew bonus on arazulachesis get yes or no from youwhy not give the skiff bonus for both mercoxit and gas cloud harvestingdo you consider high sec to be risk freeinsurance on t2 ships
for once someone running for csm has an idea about the whole game not just a small part of it and wants to fix just that cause its all that person doeselise your goals are legitimate and well thought out you have a great idea about game balance things you want to change arent xtreme and game breaking and ill be more than happy to vote for youeditthis is what i call reasonable thinking and making thought out arguments my idea about the problem is exactly the same but thats beside the point
i understand that ccp runs a business and shiny new ships sell subscriptions so theyd rather put resources into those than doing anything with the kind of useless ships out there of the six frigates per race out there maybe two of them are used for something other than lighting cynos so thats 16 ships that arent really used ideally id love to see them made useful im not talking about making them awesome just not useless im not going to hold my breath howeverim just going with the i died for sportsmanship smugbonused damps could definitely use some love i remember when damps so op every roaming ship had them and now heck i dont even put them on my lachesis because theyre that bad but the ships themselves are handy in select roles i mean id probably never turn a curse or a falconrook away from a gang and id definitely make people change out of we had two arazuslachs but does that mean they are bad i dont think soim definitely not of the view that every ship needs to be just as good as another ship of the same class but gallente and minmatar definitely got the shaft when it comes to ewar bonuses id have to do some more research but i think changing the arazulach bonus from 5 boost per level to 75 boost per level would make damps at least considered on those ships even if damps were to become viable i still think the most common setups for them would see them looking like the rapier that is to say a heavy tackler with a buffercould do if people really loved their skiffsbut the skiff is what 10 better than a hulk at mining mercoxit i dont think it would cause riots in the streets but not something id dismiss eitherin eve if you undock you better be expecting some sort of risk i dont care if its 10 or 00 you can pretty much mitigate risk with certain actions but you can never anticipate the people who are really bored suiciding exists i like that it exists and the only change id consider making to it is nerfing the insurance payouts ive done it before its tedious annoying and unless you get a space pinata its not even that profitable as far as t2 insurance and i know im not going to be popular by saying this but im fine with it as is what makes pvp in eve so great is that when you die you have a sense of loss i hear the argument that if ships were cheaper people would be more inclined to pvp but i think it would change pvp so much that it wouldnt be enjoyable maybe i have a warped view of the game im glad and thanks for your vote
bumping for a winnerwhat are your thoughts on people killing macros while not showing up in system
would you support putting the old warp sounds and some of the effects like turret recoil back in
i really wish i could promise the return of the old cyno effect and ship trails i think my victory would be assured realistically i cant promise anything but i know how strongly the community feels about restoring these classics and i can convey these sentiments as far as putting the old warp sounds in i think my response is eve has sound ill talk to some others and see what they think about warp sounds if its a big hit that i was just oblivious to ill add it to my ship trails and cyno effect topiccan you push to reactivate my sphere account my pvp numbers have dropped off hugely without it smith combine that with lack of gangmates flying in the fist formation and man
ty loli like being the only candidate whose sole desire is to improve the process lolx
uve got nice ideas get my voice gl
im interested in what you think to accomplish with this change not that i believe there is a chance in hell of ccp actually doing ithonest question i want to know your thoughts
i wish to stop inflation of isk i wish to see risk vs reward concept actually implemented not just ccp promises i wish that there were more incentives for people to leave highsec i wish to see more people in lowsec and nullsec
dont u think that if insurance will be removed pvp wont be so massive 
i do not think that itll influence quantity of pvp uninsurable t2 ships are very popular so are t3 cruisers and even faction battleships on the other hand with the removal of insurance we will see more diversity newbies will longer fly cruisers and battlecruisers in place of badly fitted battleships for example maller makes great pvp ship but its often overlooked because bleh its t1 cruiser
do you know that majority of the players lives in empire and runs missions there dont you
i feel the need to adddo you know that majority of the players lives in empire and runs missions there because they dont have time to play eve more than 2 hours per day if you want to play eve versus world of warcraft game eve its not about struggling your way to get a better ship its about the patience you got to learn that ship eve has ways to provide the money to get that ship inflation i dont think it was an issue for ccp when they introduced this system why should i learn a better ship if the devs give me a hard time buying that ship  why should i play the game if i find financial barriers in front of me  wow on the other hand it is about struggling your way to get a better gear you can have top mint gear without a single money spentsee the difference between eve and wow  both games have its ups and downs  where eve provides wow lacks and vice versa  but both games are made to attract more subscribersand if i move to low sec with a battlecruiser and get blown up how am i going to afford another battlecruiser full fitted  yes dont fly ships you cannot afford so im goint to low sec with enough cash to buy another fully fitted battlecruiser what happens if i lose this one too  how am i going to do some isk if i dont have the ship for it  in a rooky ship  yes you wont have enough isk from the both lost bcs cause theres no insurance so youre forced to mine roids in the rooky ship  no thank im not going to play this kind of game if you want for the game to be more unforgiving then the online population would drop significantly i think it would be really boring for your alliance to conquer space without people to fight back yes youd make tons and tons of modules from plexes and deds but who would buy your modules  the enemy if the population drops  which will happen with the changes you want  have you asked yourself about the impact on prices  again how are you going to sell a moduleship if theres none to buy it  and secondyou only provide some changes but no solution for what those implyits like saying i want a new furniture in my room but you dont calculate if that furniture fits in your room and how youre going to get that furniture in your roomand for your information the wow community dont care about eve they dont say go to eve nuuuub yes ive been a wow player and im now playing eve but thats because a real life friend told me about eve and i sometimes play with himedit for the blind folks i didnt say wow  eve or eve  wow i just analyzed the games from the mechanics point of view how both game are designededit added some air in the post so it wont appear as a block of text
its not wow in eve there are many ways of making money not only npc killing and if a person can think a bit he can earn money without any missions so if lvl 4 missions will be removed from empire it will be still ok thats my personal mind so corbeau good luck 
and whats you pointand you want to tell me that it is impossible to live in nullsec with such schedule you would be surprised how many freelancecasual corps there are in 00  this is only valid point in whole paragraph there are no epic or legendary ships in eve every ship is good one if you know when and where to use it think before you act why in the first place you need to do the same mistake twice if you got blown up then you did something wrong there is plenty of money to be made in nullsec or do you think that people there do not fly in the pimped t2faction battleships do not compare me to yourself i always think about consequences of my own decisions beforehand go back to wowwhat this game needs  it is less whiners and carebears but more people who are ready to stand up for own self and fight when needed you two just prove my point there is to many carebears who are afraid to leave highsec because its so comfortable and profit is almost as good as in less safe systems so why bother and thats why the game should be changed there should be incentives to bother to leave your precious motsu or dodixie if these changes will be implemented some people will leave thats for sure but it will also attract more pvpminded people who enjoy fighting and competing eve was designed as the pvporiented game and we want it to stay that way be ready to fight to think to learn to deceive or go play some other game
1do you think that bringing players into low sec will they also go to 00  more battles for 00 space

i just noticed your thread was in danger of slipping off the front page and didnt want that to happen so this is a blatant bumpyou have my full support
teadaze you have a solid outlook and impressive dedicationyou got my two votes just now 
your manifesto states you prefer to avoid nerfs the nerf t2 bpo thread has a clear majority against this nerf however vote match states you are strongly in favour of nerfing t2 bposhow do you justify this inconsistencyon what other issues would you ignore voter sentiment to pursue your own personal agenda
firstly i never said i wont support any nerfs just as i wont support every buff as i stated i prefer to buff other items instead of nerfs however in some instances ccp feel action has to be taken even if we as the players dislike iton the subject of t2 bpos i agree with a number of players that it is time they were changed into high run bpcs or remove the penalties on invented t2 bpcs instead the thread you mention makes a reasonable request and has more supports than many of the issues raised by csm so why should it be ignoredbut im not ignoring voter sentiment im choosing in this instance to support a group of people who you appear to disagree with on other issues the reverse may be true the wonderful thing about the csm is that all views are taken into consideration and because it is rare for 100 of players to agree on anything there will always be somebody who losesi dont have any personal agenda of pet projects to push through csm i am running as i did last time on the platform of ensuring the csm process is adhered to well documented and that everyone has the chance to have their views representedit is my belief that if an issue gets a good number of supports then it should be dealt with even if it ends up being raised and rejected which would block it being raised again for a while 
sometimes in leading it is necessary to ignore voter sentiment making empire safer than it is now is popular with some people for instance
to not go with the majority of the voters is not to ignore the voters it is to take a standi would not want to vote for a person who would only propose majority proposals such a windbag would be of no use to anyone
i cannot possibly vote for teadazeever since he was elected to csm4 he has spent so much of his time on it he seems to hardly ever have time to pvp with us anymoreon a serious note the amount of time and effort tea has put into csm this last term has been phenomenal  i know people who put less time and effort into their jobs tea is a really realiable guy hes got a solid understanding of eve and ive repeatedly been impressed by the way hes handled things in his last term especially with regards to building legitimacy for the csm processtake my admittedly biased view for what its worth but a vote for tea is a vote well placed
2x for teadaze
im worried vuk lau and elvenlord in csm will probably cause 00 to remain stale as it is now not suggesting anything related to 00 that doesnt benefit themselves or the nc or the expansion of this space empire they have
mr concerned there is no need to be worried majority of things proposed related to 00 both by elvenlord during csm 40 and myself during csm 20 and csm 30 was exactly opposite the main idea we promote is to ease access to both space and resources to smaller entities or even rather small groups of players who wants to venture to 00if you dont believe us i will quote one of the exdevs csm closely worked with
where do i go to vote
1 for elvenlord
one for each good luck
voted for both even though im mostly a lowsec guy since im ok with their stances on things at least on the important ones
worst thing in game imo apart from lag in big battle but this is issue with all mmo ive played is macro ratters do you think anything can be done about it i would like see all subbs rat scrambling and cant use cloak for 15mins after rat aggro just so there is at least a chance to catch macro ratter without hours of login trapping and attempting to bubble them at belteven make it so belt rat only spawn when the belts are being mined and move off the officerfaction spawns to anomalies

look at the planetary interaction system thats in the process of being added we have a bunch of planet types which have been automaticly generated thanks to some basic understanding of physics the planets have correct surface gravities escape velocities surface temperatures and other physical characteristics however the actual planet types that are core to the planetary interaction feature appear to be somewhat random with temperate planet types that have surface temperatures 200 degrees below the freezing point of water i know the icelandic climate can be quite chilly at times so maybe thats what passes for temperate weather up thereits probably too late to fix this as of may 18th people will start deploying planet specific installations and changing planet types about will upset the new economynow could we get the same distribution of planet types in the universe in a more sane manner absolutely would it make the gameplay any different not at all would it improve eve  sure for the people who notice this kind of thing the science geeks the role players and the fiction writers for everyone else it wouldnt detractunderstanding of science and science fiction wont have a direct bearing on gameplay decisions for gameplay sake but for the kind of background info that makes the universe more real for some players thats where it steps in it doesnt necessarily improve the game but it improves eve
thank you for the nice reply tamber and wow soo many pics you do really have a way with those though please nooo furry megathron the striped one is quite cool thoughbut please be nice to my fellow sebiestor chribba i am sure he also like badgers so no need to get too many corpses of his 
seems interesting what is it you want to accomplish or prove with your simulator resp your social experiment
got my vote
good luck tamber
although i am a competing candidate just wanted to say good luck in your campaign if we both get elected i look forward to working with you on csm5
i normally wouldnt like a goon but you come across as very friendly and honorable good luck in your campaign
hello avallocid like to thank you for your plex promotion it was the catalyst in spurring me to be more active in the csm process im not sure that id have actually posted questions of my own without that little nudgeas for my question for you i would appreciate it if you would discuss your position on the issue of transferable kill rights and the fixingcreation of a viable bounty hunter system my own personal feelings are that this would increase pvp in lowhisec and adds a very sandboxy game play element into eve that is weak if not missing currently thanks
and thank you for taking advantage of the promotion and helping the csm process growim for transferring kill rights it would add a new dimension to the pvp in empire it would promote a whole new occupation of players acting as vigilante
avalloc once pulled me from a burning building true story
bumping self for great justice
i can attest to dvs dedication to the game open mindedness and ability to performgood luck dv

to jump clones how do they need to be fixed
after talking to folks ingame they talk about how jump clone timer of 24hrs is really long for active pvprs theyd like to have the option to move about the galaxy a little faster or on a short notice like when their 00 corp has a call to arms or theyd like to switch between different combat clones when the different battles call for it etc that it removes their motivation to pvp high secrs say that they would like to decrease the barrier to entry into pvp for them ability to switch back into their 5 clones n such so after talking to these people about what theyd like to see my proposed idea is to introduce a skill rank 58 that would reduce the jump clone timer 10 decrease per level for 12hrs min  lvl5 rank  and min time can be worked out it wouldnt be an easy train itd be a toughy but people who value it would invest in it full read here
nice tool though i knew who i will vote for long before voting started actually it is the same person who i voted for last time he did pretty well im more then satisfied so he should be there for a 2nd termbut still ill repeat my opinion once againthere should be at least some questions about trading because i spend most of the time in jita and all that pvppve stuff isnt really interesting for me and manufacturingscience question arent directly connected to my profession and i dont care about scammers they arent getting in my way and they cannot possibly be in my way
ya i agree with dierdrathis isnt propaganda toward anyone one candidate so it wouldnt really be considered a park speech more like a voter education or citizens poll at the mostthe match site only helps uninformed voters align themselves with a candidate who is more in tune with their ideas about the game ccp  csms past have repeatedly said that voter turnout is the main issue with csm and theyd like to see more  of voters by moving it from the general forums youre removing the popularity from the subject you should put it back in general
deity forbids that ccp draw attention to the csm voting process
youll have my vote so dont shoot me ok lolz
you have my vote
you get my vote omber
wow someone bumped my thread thanks rattus so anyone got any questions for me song lyrics theyd like me to murder
thanks extreme consider this notification of 7 votes from last years totalgood luck
the campaign video did it for me
always respected ob you got my vote
same always had respect for ob and what they mean to the game all the details in your bullet points are things that have been needed to be sorted for a long time in this game and its about time they were tbh you also have my vote and lets hope the real things that are important to this game are finally fixed not just mindless blobs with no skill  knowlegde of ship fittings real pvp that sit there day after day to x up into a 800 man fleet become something of the past and the game brings out and shows the truely talented pvperspj
you have my vote
each candidate for the csm will hopefully have a thread posted in the jita park speakers corner forum and so each week until the election ends im going to be giving away one plex to two lucky players who took the time to engage a csm candidate not just me with a serious question the questions will be tracked by my web site at
week 3 entry acceptance ends in 15 hours
week 4 has begun
ankhesentapemkah 
sighi too would like to know how she is personally going to get all the griefers banned
im not surprised at this at all ankhs true colours are flying high and bright
which system is she saying this in
cripes
ankh is clearly greifing us
theres nobody better in eve at trolling nerds not even ididnt vote for her of course but i hope she gets in the csm just for the lulz
youre a better troll than i am i tip my fuzzy hat to you
oh goshyou sad little person
the sad mare had an alt spamming that crap in the amarr militia channel last night she thought it quite smart that she nore even have the basic scram skills done when asked to x up
also she has a fat face and a double chin
hey its not easy being deaf
worse being deaf and ugly
to continue my monologue im back and of course happy to answer any further questions im also delighted to see that i seem to be a good match for many people whove used the excellent vote match websitethat said i think it must be stressed having listened to what has been said by prospective and actual csm members that my preferences for the future direction of eve are relatively unimportant compared to the importance of being able to persuade ccp to implement what has already been agreed by all parties as being very sensible ideas i think that this is where the csm realistically needs to focus its attention and where i can particularly add value with my particular background i realise i could make things more interesting by promising to hold the developers at gunpoint until they created mission ai that passed the turing test and gave out free donuts for everyone but it would be neither realistic nor honest
guys i have to admit i havent paid enough attention to know who the candidates are in the real world we have political parties to make things a little simpler so can anybody save me some time and tell me whos the republican in the racejoe starbreaker owner of the fighting republicans
its a no party system but you can use vote match to help determine who most closely aligns with your viewpointis this a serious response to a troll
id rather pick somebody whos been vetted for their character and ideas not just their checklist of positions in a party primary since thats not possible ill vote for whichever candidate most convinces me of their support and admiration for sarah palin candidates you may reply in this thread as ceo on my alt of the fighting republicans i shall give thorough consideration to establishing a party platform primary and official slate of candidates the next time csm comes around sorry i didnt think of it before
well id definitely be described as a conservative but more in a barry goldwater sort of way so even if it costs me your vote i have to say not a fan of the palin unitissler dainzewanting to be your next csm representative but fighting an uphill battle
gasp
i think ankhesentapemkah is the most palinesque candidate out there i still like to think of myself as one of the most qualified candidates out there im very active in all areas of the game i have realistic expectations of what the csm can do and i am capable of compromise i remember you from my science and industry thread but if you are interested in my full campaign you can check it out here
isnt sarah palin a stepford wife
ive been playing eve for nearly two years brief history here for the most part im very happy with the game or i wouldnt be playing it but there is always room for improvement i feel im in a great position to take ideas from the player base to ccp as part of the csmi spend most of my time in lowsecurity space im happy there there is danger lurking around every corner but not the certain death an unaffiliated pilot might find in nullsecurity space i have opinions on just about every aspect of eve but i realize that my opinions arent the only thoughts that countif youd like to get a feel for some of my opinions feel free to browse my blog though ive only been writing for a couple of months now ive put out a fair number of my opinions i think my viewpoint is best summed up by saying id like the game to make sense intuitive without dropping the fun factorif you arent sure who to vote for i highly recommend vote match thanks again diedra vaal for your efforts on behalf of the csm process if youve already been there then you might be interested in why i gave the answers i did if thats the case go to this blog entry which will tell you just thatat the end of the day the csm is not really here to push their own agenda  they must look to the player base and make sure that what theyre bringing to ccp is what the player base as a whole wants but its still useful to know what my opinions are so you can find a general outline on my campaign pagei wont tell you to vote because if youre reading this forum then you already care enough to vote instead ill ask that you go tell all of your friends to vote
im intrigued by your thoughts on criminal sec status and free travel in high secespecially assuming that nothing changes about the fact that once aggroed a criminal can retaliate at will against a high sec aggressor definitely some great pvp opportunities there i wonder what ccps original thinking was wrt restricting travel based on sec statusnot your idea would reduce the use of alts though many alts have highly specialized skills so they can do one support job wellsuch as with my alt that flies a jump freighter seems it would be impractical most of the time to train the skills on ones main that are necessary to do stuff currently done by an alt for example id never deviate from a pvp based skill plan to invest in the skills needed to fly a jf missionrelated skills might be more compatible but then i dont run missions so i dont have a cluestillintriguing ideas from a more pvp perspective good luck with your campaign
i assumed that as well perhaps i should have stated it im not looking for easy kills against pirates and other miscreants in fact i think often it will be the other way around  a dogooder will engage thinking its a simple kill and lose his ship for his troublescompletely agreed there the intent is not to have criminals running around in jump freighters rather it was to have criminals thinking its only two jumps into highsec to pick up that shiny battleship and fittings i can survive that much like any other player might feel about lowsecurity space the biggest difference being that criminals fly around lowsecurity space all the time so theyre used to iti challenge anybody to explain how it is fun that criminals are chased through highsecurity space by faction navy spawns let players perform that function  itll be less of a certainty which i think makes the game more fun for all concernedthanks for the luck i think ill need it with so many other great choices
it seems ccp have now implemented this ironically it was you when i last visited the page
glad to see ccp was listening mazz did you call your iceland hookups 
yip looks like the whining got something changed maybe the csm has some sway after all
wownice mudslinging thread
i agree while youre here do you want to go and answer the questions that were posed to you about saying one thing and meaning another or are we just twisting your words
yay its fixednothing gets stuff done like a good old forum whine
i just noticed that csm candidates are now listed in random order different each time the candidates page is viewed rather than is the fixed sequence based on when they submitted their apps this is good thanks for addressing the concerns ccp
i feel your pain and it is even worse for me since i would fly scorpions rooks and falcons oh how i miss the days when my falcon could jam at over 200 km which meant i had time to warp out before they tackled me
let me just slip this onto your desklooks like someones full of it
somebody just wants free trips to icelandto be fair id do it too
is there anywhere i can look at a picture of the csm candidates
sure my web site has some of me 
cheers man anyone else got links
pics including csm 2  3 can be found here  here  here
just curious here ya go

what do you think of my proposal while i dont thik that mine will be the best solution ever to the problem i am pretty confident that my analysis is right and it consider the central problem of the current mechanicsi hope that you read iti think that in your proposal its not clear who can see who and which rules will decide the players i will see and the players that will see me i also consider it a bit strange this will limit the data that will be sent to the client but its not clear if this is the problem its a server side problem right if someone is interested i can make a better presentation of my sov proposal describing some possible scenarios
i agree that there is an engagement size epic limit  extra people over that size dont increase the epicness significantly if you can have fleets of that size with minimal lag everyone gets to eat epic cakei think the effect you want would actually be a consequence of game mechanic that put practical upper bounds on fleet size  the best use for manpower would be attacking multiple targets at oncewhether specific sovmechanic changes will also be needed to encourage this behavior is deeply unclear but the mechanic change that was suggested that i found most interesting was moving the sbus to the other side of the gates the whole point was that it is the concept of visibility limitation that needs to be explored the rule might be as simple as you can see the closest n ships whatever they might be or it might be significantly more subtle whatever the devs decide to try can be done as a filter in the clientas for lag being a serverside problem sure but consider that the server has to do two things it has to update the game state compute and then communicate that info to the players io both can get bogged down and reducing the amount of io means both more resources for compute and the potential for optimizations that reduce the overall compute loadand even if this turns out not to be the case the fact that you wont have thousands of players on the same node  or the same grid  can only help reduce the lagi for one would be interested go for it
i also live in lowsecurity space nearly fulltime me and my alt  in different areas of lowsecurity space i dont run highsec missions they bore me i imagine that they bore a lot of peoplepart of the problem with eve is that everybody wants to be a pirate yo ho ho its a pirates life for me thats all well and good but not everybody can be a predator or more accurately if everybody is a successful lowsec predator nobody will go to lowsecthe solution will be multifaceted i think several people have already hit at the core bits increase potential lowsec activities make those activities exclusive to lowsec and offer decent rewards for the risk of moving about in lowsecurity spacebut one bit nobody has mentioned is giving antipirates the tools necessary to accomplish their jobs one of these factors is to make criminals really criminals not parttime criminals with alts to do all their clean work im not proposing that we attempt to discourage the use of alts but i think there are definitely steps we could take to encourage the use of your main or more accurately remove some of the absolute discouragements i fly around in small ships and id gladly engage a criminal on the gate if i knew the gate guns werent going to smear my guts all over the floor along with my gloryive explained my view on this issue in my blog so i wont rehash it here but thrust is to make criminality piracy a choice with consequences and the two main points are 1 dont chase criminals around with faction navy spawns in highsec  let them go where they like and 2 make it much harder to regain lost security status  either by requiring payment of fines or some longterm commitment to goodness i think the end result will be more flashy reds flying around even in highsecurity space and more antipirates flying around looking for them thats going to lead to an increase in the sense of security for some and maybe a better lowsec populationmy platform is essentially the filtered opinions of eve players not only forum dwellers im here quite often myself but were the minority and we have to realize that but my opinions which will obviously have some direct relation to the filtering can be found on my campaign page
you might want to take a look at my thread1 fix the lag2 pirating need some love3 fix lowsec4 bountyhunting on pirates5 make lowsec more attracting for minersindustrialists to be in megacyte in small amounts6 to compensate the love for pirates the suicide ganking insurance payout will be reduced when concord is on the killmail
mynxee you have my votefirst i have lived in lowsec for the majority of my eve life and will only vote for people who have done the same with that said i agree with outlaw only fixes lowsec already has a well define role pvp training ground we need a reward system that will encourage lowsec pvp and give out massive rewards for doing so all lowsec pilots know that tanking that extra 400 dps needs to be worth a little bit more than just a broken killmail with 0 damage done some times ideas like bounty hunting missions from npc agents are excellent biomass reprocessing for reclaiming implants ideas such as these that encourage pvp need to be used to balance the risk to reward in lowsec and i believe that you feel the same way
a vote for me is a vote for my husband
isnt cat a dude irl
when i did the votematch as a player i was pleased to see that mynxee was my top match one would hope so but surprised at how close the next 6 or 7 candidates wereall within a couple  of each other i tend to agree that perhaps the question pool lacks sufficient opposite end of spectrum variance to clearly differentiate candidates however it is a fact that many of the candidates do care about similar thingslow sec revitalization pvp balance and ui fixes for example if you look at their position for the various questions and their important question its obvious there is more agreement than not regarding the answersperhaps this time well end up with a csm that is fairly well on the same page openminded and highly synergistic might be a very interesting situation in a csmasstakeholder situation
with 53 candidates and only 30 questions its hard to find a lot of differentiation but i think the vote match site is a great stepping stone on the way to determining who you want to vote for theres a link to each candidates page which will give more detailed information than any survey could give youalso if there are issues that you really care about you will probably find that one of the top candidates is a closer match in that area than the othersso many good candidates  so hard to choose well i have it easy i have to vote for myself
mmmmm cakeone more votedd
delete please
i can fly one but still havent bought one partly because of the fact that the ships statistics and bonuses are confused and not very relevant to the ships roles they just dont seem very good and they are so rarely used other than just bridging a cloaky gang
trained for it bought it and sold it as quick as hell
do not support covert ops cloaking on black ops its pretty obvious if ccp gives it covops cloak dps will but cut in half this ships needs other useful boosts with its role
signedtotally agree the new effect is weak and lacks the coolness the old one gave capital ships
1 stop shoving your nose where it doesnt belong2 stop acting like you have a valid opinion which you clearly dont3 4 profit
supported
supported this is simple common sense
privateer complaining about neutral rr alts oh the irony but nonetheless op is right supported
poor little privateers getting owned 5v1 cause a neutral repped then lone pilot who privs were trying to gank look at them bitter bitter tearsnot supported
if youre having problems tracking equivalent sized targets with blasters then you might want to stop fitting afterburners to your megathrons and orbiting at 200m it would probably helpgiving blasters more tracking doesnt really do much for them people who regularly experience tracking issues vs similar sized targets just need to learn how to play tbfh boosting tracking wouldnt do much to adress the part where blasters get owned by preety much all weapon systems when we discuss similarsized ships with realistic fitspreety much
oh that is why goumindong creates posts in blaster and rail threads saying that hybrid weapon is ok he protects lasers from hybrid boost it is smart
well assuming that ccp is damage phobic blasters should not get more rangefalloff keep them in a short range niche and weapon types varied blasters should not get a huge buff to tracking so we dont bbq frigates left right and centerhow about lowering the fitting requirements on blasters andor increasing the pg and cpu of blaster ships make blasters similar to autocannons  eg the thorax would be able to fit ion blasters with a 1600 plate  mwd much like the rupture can fit 220s  1600 plate  mwdthe above would  be a practical increase in dps to blasters fitting larger guns  more dps effectively increase the tank on the slow blasters ships as they get into range due to fitting room keep blasters with their current flavour and weapons in their current nichesall without increasing the paper dps of blaster ships beyond what they can do now keeping ccp happy with their numbers
someone actually understood what i said the problem with blasters lies in the speed to fire range ratio not in eft numbersim but a humble alt but can we please just ignore nightmarex and goumindong from now on i mean the first one only has a bare minimum of knowledge to fly her tempest in 00 bs fleets and the other only flies amarr in gangs im here cause id like to read about good ideas for fixing blaster problerms we could present to the csm and all i can find is this impotent eft bullsht and really weak theorycrafting it makes me want to slit my wrists
so i take it you would argue against increasing the speed agility and scan res while reducing the signature of gallente blaster boats
as long you cant counter attack or just counter on what i have said earlier then you cant say that you all can ignore me or goum because what we have said it the factand its absolutely a fact if no one can counter argument it to not be trueand also it doesnt take long time to fully understand how all of the weapons work ingame and not only that but when its about blasters then i know what im talking about because when you have used blasters and the other weapon types on sisi for about 45 years then i think i know how they workand you also say that i have minimum of knowledge to fly a tempest lol is that a joke orill just wait for the argument that i dont have many kills so i dont know much about the weapon types
at first glance i see that you did nothing to calculate or account for cap requirements  powergrid and cpu requirements  ammo usage  tracking and damage types and ships that use those types of weapons  therefor i cant see this viable statistics at all
well im not really the greatest mathematician around so i cant factor in everything that there is about guns in a simple ratio also i only really chose to create a dpsrange ratio because the rest of the attributes are simply irrelevant in mediumlarge fleet engagements feel free to come up with better numbers
honestly have not gotten a chance to freshen up on the entirety of the thread however i think this statement pretty much sums up the most reasonable solution to the issue as a wholei do not think that the issue lies in blasters inherently the issue lies in the usage of blasters not specificly their individual stats as a module compared to other weapon types of similar ranges i think that the entire line of blaster oriented ships needs to be reevaluated and have their sig speed and agility revamped to allow them to expand their engagement envelope wo overpowering their primary weapon system compared to other races comparable weapons some minor slot changesadditions may potentially be needed as well entirely another debate though
walls of text and lots of arguing on semantics itt but when i fly blasterships in game they seem perfectly fine as close range damage dealers which is their purpose so not supported
so to recappeople arent fond of the idea of increasing blaster tracking because that will result in little if any practical change in their performancea straight damage boost is desirable if only to give us a reason to fit and use them over pulse lasers however ccp are very leery about allowing fits to top the 1200 dps cap that seems to exist on most allgank bs configurationsa range increase would turn blasters into autocannons or pulsesa tracking bonus on all blaster hulls isnt desirable because it would result in all blaster boats having less flavor and secondly a tracking boost would not be helpfulreducing blaster fitting requirements is a neat idea but does ccp really want the kind of monstrous ehp coupled with a full rack of neutron blaster iis i doubt it despite that being the whole gallente combat ethos apparentlyadding special effects such as shieldarmor piercing attributes probably isnt doable because the game code isnt smart enough to handle it at this pointadding a third damage type or even giving them a fixed omnidamage spectrum well i havent actually heard anyone refute that ideagenerally speaking it seems to me like the whole combat doctrine ccp wrote for the gallente faction is a bad afterthought something they were grubbing around for late at night when theyd already worked out what all the other factions were going to be after they realized drones drones and more drones werent a realistic goal given the technical constraints they had to work within then they tried forcing this square peg into the round hole of the game mechanics and guess what it didnt work
well after carefully pondering this topic i cannot support an across the board buff to hybrid weapons in general and blasters specifically what is needed is a total rethink of the gallente race their speed is atrocious for the weapons they favor gallente are supposed to be the jason voorhes of eve instead we get star wars kid
why just gallente  blasters are as much caldari weapons as gallente
no blasters are not just as much a caldari weapon rails are a caldari weapon caldari are fine and before you go blubbering on about how rails need a boost and the rohks dps sucks consider this caldari fit their style of warfare they are optimized for sniping at long range and rails compliment their style gallente style is to bash you over the head with a big hammer you cant do that in ships that are the second slowest in the universe yet if you fit them for speed you basically are made of glass i can understand where ccp wanted to go with the concept of gallente their execution of it has fallen flat i dont know maybe a 5 bonus to abmwd speed boost per level instead of a rof bonus
wow 10 pages  have ccp even acknowledge that there is a problem with hybridgallente i have been watching this thred since it started and it seem like its just been ignored by ccp and the csm
gallente were supposed to be big drone boats with close range dps to compliment then drones were nerfed then they were nerfed again then blasters were nerfed now gallente suck because they were overnerfedthe problem with rails is specifically gallente rails on gallente ships dont have the range to account for the low dps the problem with blasters is specifically gallente they have a major range deficit for a small dps increase
about time they got fixed
lol sure  caldari for sniping is fine in your dreams maybeamarr does it much better there is hardly any reason to do less than acceptable dmg at longer ranges than the other races
fine if lasers are better then fit lasers on your rohk simple have fun burning out t2 laser crystals trying to shoot past 180km when a rohk with rails can get there with non t2 ammoseriously ccp has caved on issues of power creep by whines such as this for far to long as it stands now amarr and minmatar weapons are ballanced since hybrids are two races weapons simply buffing all hybrids will cause balance issues between two racesedit one buff with twice the headache balancing it all later
 and bringing the discussion back to fixing blasters which is a far easier discussion than how to fix rails blasters need1 easier fitting so the ships can fit more tank2 faster ships3 more damage4 more rangepick one or make some combination that brings them to balance with the other weapons in the game
that would be my pick
well 1 and 3 are out since that will buff blaster caldari ships too and 4 will just make it like auto cannonsand another stealth buff for caldari with their range bouni that leaves only faster ships as the buff for gallente according to your list
see this is why i think its so funny that i am attacked in that thing that i keep pointing you all towards this is what i have to say on the issuespecifically i think the thorax should be one of the fastest and most agile cruisers the brutix should be brought up to teir 2 quality the hyperion made one of the fastest and most agile battleships and the deimos be made into an even more specialized thorax2000ms 105 sig 75salign w mdwbut all that you folks see is boost their damage their damage and hit points really is not the problem i mean for goodness sakes right now you can make a 28k ehp thorax with 550 dps that is strictly better than a 220 gank rupture500 dps 27k ehp the only problem is that the damned thorax cant ever get in range of anything to kill it
wait who puts blasters on caldari ships and who worries about caldari blaster fits being over powered hybrid caldari ships get a range bonus and no tracking bonus and these amount to next to nothing when range starts at only a few km and tracking is an issue at that range even if you reduce the fitting requirements and increase the damage no one in their right mind would put blasters on a caldari ship if they can fly a gallente ship goum like i said you had some good ideas
awsome goumindong seems i see eye to eye with someone at last even if im opening myself into a flame targeti think we should diagnose the primary problem ships and attempt to propose some non radical ideas to get the ball rolling on the blatant issue now i dont agree with all the stat changes that were posted in your ship revamp however i think there are many good ideas presented in it none the lessso im going to try and propose some very simple changes let me know if you agree or disagreethorax speed mass  sig the thorax is in itself a great ship as goumindong pointed out when looking at raw stats however i do not think that it has the baseline ship stats needed to allow it to perform as intendeddeimos  cap  sig not even going to get started with this one we all know its broke time to fix asapbrutix sig  speed 100 grid 1 high slot change all active tanking bonuses to 10 now the brutix is not a bad ship dont get me wrong here guys the issue i have with the brutix is that its most effective fitting does not even take advantage of its repping bonus now the idea behind the added grid and high slot is im sure no surprise to anyone with half a brain lets get a gang mod  full rack of guns pleaseastarte sig speed high slot mirrior 10 rep bonus change from brutix just like the deimos im lost on how to make this an expensive low ehp ship good at close range combat however ive tried to at least make it viable in very small scale gangs reason for the high is the same as the brutix guns  gang mod pleasenow having far less bs fleet experiance im going to leave both the hyperion and the mega up to the more experianced posters i will say that i think that after minor speedagility tweaks and a 10 rep amount bonus the hyperion will be one hell of a small gang monsters mega is already pretty good in my personal experiences however im sure there is something wrong with itedit almost forgot oneenyo cpu now i know this is not designed as just a blaster boat however i think that it could use a small amount of cpu allowing it to fit dmg mods in certain setups
i support this product andor service
some nice ideas supported
wooh support
for sure signed it has essentially killed the use of a fair few ships
maybe someone should put a rocket up ccps arse on thisyou see what i did there
support on each point
qualified support subject to a few enhancements to mechanicspeople and places searching for charactername will match to current names and past aliasusing a locator agent matches present name and past aliasthe only strong argument against this is the clean slate for scammers argument at the moment there is bigger exposure to a clean slate a character is started with an offensive but obscure name a scam is carried out a name change is triggered by exposing the offence there is no name history to show the scamming aliashowever this proposal addresses the clean slate issue through the name historythe name history enhances game play by making due diligence more important a rl cost is a good deterrent against abusing this featureim inclined towards allowing one free name change during the newbie training period many newbies make a poor name choice before being exposed to the games lore of what is a good character name
what made you include numbers in your name in the first place
i cant support this idea since reputation is one of the key factors in the gameyou burn your bumm you have to sit on the blistersyou made yourself a crappy name your choice eve is a game where you have to live with your choices good or badif you buy a character with a bad reputation then that is your own doing you are not forced to buy that characterso a big no from me here
thisdo not support this idea
i support name changing since character trading is more op than changing a name at least with just a name change you standing to that character would stay the same but when you trade a character no one really has no clue who you are i dont see your logic in saying trading is ok but name change is wrong anywayi support name change if you can only change it once this way it dont get super confusing seeing new names on characters every few weeks
nocriminals and scammers must be punished for ever
do want
showin my supporti really wish i could see what my drones are actually doing to another player or to npcs during missions etc drones can deal a huge amount of damage to a someone
supporting the removal of the penalties not so sure on the damage boost still supported overall
t2 short range ammo is so crap i dont think i will every use it unless it is changed i can use 2 types of t2 guns and i think both arnt worth it faction ammo is better
yup t2 ammo is crap
i would have to say that i disagree with this not supported as a minmatar pilot who uses hail you guys are giving it a bad rap i do more damage with hail m then i do with most faction medium ammo and i just make up for the optimal and tracking penalties with a tracking computer and optimal projectile rig and am still able to fit a half decent tank and other damage modsi havent really noticed this big difference in t2 and faction except in the higher tiered faction ammos and even that doesnt really justify the price difference tell you honestly the only times i even use faction ammo is in pve never in pvp because the cost is too muchnot supported
youre doing it wrong the purpose of pve is to make money not waste it on expensive ammo in pvp there is a reason to use expensive ammo if it helps you kill the other guy faster than he can kill you by doing more damage or penalizing you lessim curious what range do you have with these hail ac guns im assuming you are flying a vaga to be able to keep targets in range
i dont use faction ammo all the time in pve just for the more difficult missions like angel extravaganza or worlds collide where i need the extra damage to kill stuff quick other then that t1 ammo sufficesas for what range i get with hail on a vaga i get 2 km optimal 13 km falloff give or take dependingedit  thats with 425mm t2 ac

ive read through the forums on macro  bot issues with several mmos and its a complicated problem protecting the software developers ip and preserving the balance of the economy is definitely a long term issue but inhibiting or changing the game mechanics to how players perform those tasks is not an easy pill for the player community to swallow its a huge balancing act offering suggestions of captchas or as another post said limiting the amount of time an account could mine and boy i laughed so hard i just decided it was better for me not to respond to that one or even a report function is ripe for abuse so when you break it all down a separate application that just scans for those programs that are specifically designed and marketed as mmo macro programs can be easily identified and added to an account ban list more importantly the application would be separate from the actual eve client remember the more stuff you build into a client app the more chances you have to break other stuff a separate application minimizes any chances of something falling thru the qa cracks and creating bugs that interfere with the overall eve gaming experiencei firmly believe that parties who are profiting off eve ip by selling macro programs will look for other mmos to target if they feel they are going to have to now fight an uphill battle those code writers are going to walk away in lieu of trying to beat ccp no one will keep buying apps that get accounts banned and the developers of the macro will start targeting other games instead if im ccp and i get with the csms and say ok were going to budget for some problem solving im going to be looking at other mmos who did solve the problem and doing a cost analysis on that solution why reinvent a wheel why not go for the option that guarantees the highest probability of success heres a different perspective youre contributing to ccp in terms of being a subscriber do you want them to waste your money on gimmick solutions or do you want them to spend the money on a best bet solution so in the future they arent trying for another gimmick fix with your money theyre spending it on improving the gaming experience java
i think a mining overhaul is in need not an intrusive scanning program
covert ops cloak on bombers is stupid how is anyone supposed to be able to get a gang of friends together if there is bombers all over the place and you dont know where they are coming fromremove the covert cloak and then bombers will be balanced less scared cloaky players make them fight the gang instead of hiding with an i win buttongiant text is not necessary when making a proposal navigator
giant letters hit you doing 00 troll damage
cov ops is their tank they are paper thin fight back with bombers or smartbomb lol or get fast locker ships
new proposal ban emo tj from spamming the assembly hall with his useless tripenow that would be something i can get behind
not every ship is supposed to fly all tank and gank like battleships do covertops ships have their place and its to make clustered gangs and lone operators feels unsafenormally im all for people presenting their opinions and such no matter how bad they might be however this is one of those rare exceptions where i will second this
ban the emo idiot please
yet there are still large fleets and gangs forming in the current sc nc war and yes from time to time they get bombed part of the game babyemo just another stupid proposal but i do fell its my fault
ohhh nooooes did a stealth bomber kill you again because of your stupididty lol bwaahahahahahahahaand also this forum section is not for idiots who just want to cry this is the assembly hall for christ sakeand do you know what assembly hall is used for its used for this a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar management i underlined and bolded the part what you dont seems to graspi think you rather should go to the features and ideas discussion section and try you luck there because assembly hall is totally wrong forum section for those kind of whiny and crying topics from youget it
seconding this  so far the ratio of useful to useless ideas was 0it seems my old posting got lost somehow
no go away
1 internets for failing to see a trollget it
failing to understand how to counter a threat does not equal a reason to nerf that threat
there are no ways to counter this unless you want to not form large groups of friends at all this game is supposed to be about massive multiplayer yet the bomber in its current form punishes those who have more friends that those losers who fly the bombersit is another case of those who dont have mad at those who do and have the attitude of well if i dont have insert whatever then no one can
wow i mean wow you must be really mad for loosing to some smart players that whooped yo assand not only that but your tears are really deliciouskeep crying in assembly hall it will make assembly hall looks like a good place
if you fail to form up in a way that bombers are not raping you you deserved to die but keep trying the more you post the more you look like a total idiot just waiting for 111i think i will donate a few bombers to the scadapt or die
suported111111111111111111
the initiative is the guys  alliance who deserves a few bombers thenthose guys needs way way more bombers so they can fuel their bombers with millions of tons with emo tears from the nc so the bombers have some extra fuel
malcanisi have some spare bombs kicking around in one my hangars  contact me in game and ill drop them off somewhere for you3
throw a sniper eagle or ferox into your fleet theyll make those bombers think twice
for a start it would help to wait inside the pos shield until the jb is fueled again 
i dont support thisbut would support allowing members of the same fleet to see where other cloaked assets are 
wow just wow i cant even fly these things and i know that they are the only thing to counter the blob since the removal of aoe doomsday weapons sbs are the only thing preventing super blobs well that and ccp breaking their game so that even fleets as low as 150 cant load system
so we are to be punished because we have more friends than they have yeah thats fair
rofl your being punished because you guys are dumb as helli could even train a monkey to be better in pvp than most of the guys in nc its that bad for you guys and since you are in the nc we can take you as for speaking for the whole nc because everytime you guys in nc lose to some bombers your off to this forum section to cry us a river with salty tearsand on top of that in assembly hallyou make nc looks worser than they are
i think i see what the problem isyoure assuming that all combat is the same this is not the case and not all ships are created the same likewise they dont all do the same thingfrom a tactical standpoint pvp is an endless game of rockpaperscissors some ships will be better suited for certain tasks and against certain ships as are othersif you have the intel on what kind of ships the enemy has you can counter by bringing in specialty ships in this case the stealth bomber against a large cluster of immobile battleships that will be highly effective against them no matter how high their numbers may befight smarter not harder just because the enemy outnumbers you it doesnt mean you cant fight back likewise just because you cant see an enemy it does not mean you are helpless against it ie dont sit in one place
except forming up inside the pos shield amirite
again only supported due to nightmarex being a complete idiot
and emo tj is not that herecan i ask why im a complete idiot here by the way is it because i wont support the most ed and stupid idea ever here in eves historyor maybe you shouldnt make you look as dumb as emo tj your self
because emo tj is an sc troll alt you moron
and he have to troll sc in assembly hall wow way to make assembly hall to look like a junk yardif it havent been assembly hall i wouldnt care but because assembly hall is a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar management then this is going waaaaay to far
she has been voted for so shes csmway to get rid of her dont vote for herand tell others not topersonally i would never have voted for herafter her campaign but well the downsideof democracy is the rule by the stupid masses

shes pretty harmless so just ignore the drivel she comes out with tbh not like anyone listens to the csm anyway
so pretty much all of eve players rightthis is the part where she gets damned to hell right but lets ignore the fact there is no evidence for god after all he must exist since nobody has proved he doesntkind of like pirates who whine about concord in highsec and how it is so easy to make iskies in highsec being carebears
removing t2 bpos wont affect the market for popular items where t2 bpos cant produce volumes matching the market demand however removal will broaden access to marketbased pvp for unpopular itemssupported
i understand both sides of this issue however i think that ultimately we have a problem where the game would be better off without them but that they dont play enough of a role in the game to justify destroying the absolutely massive incredible investments built around them people complain for example that they cant get into the t2 market because t2 bpos keep them out however i think its eminently clear that there is plenty of competition for t2 modules that actually have a market to speak of to start withimo htfu its a lot easier to say delete the other guys 650 billion isk than it is to say to delete your ownliang
many people apparently dont realize that buffing invention wont make invention more profitable it will only bring crash both market prices and cost prices so nothing will change margins wont be better those margins are already good enough to be honest
people need to stop quoting a hack whos dropped back to doing economic break down for a computer gamesaying 50 of t2 is made from bpos means nothing because its not in contexthow many modsshipsammo items are there firstthings like mining crystals take a ages to burn out so the demand for them is limited and bpos will dominate that market but if the bpo holders decided to charge 50mil a crystal the inventors would rush in and bring the price crashing down in secondsactual in context numbers are needed before you can call thissostop ing about something that a preschool level economist is talking abouti mean if he was good at his job then surely hed be getting paid alot more than a videogame company could pay himalso if he were doing both and had eve as a side project what do you think hed spend more time ona game or a job that pays x hundread k a yearout of context data is irelivant its like basing a car company aroundwe buy any carsoill buy any car too ill give you UFFFD500 for a perfectly working year old bentlyout of context data pay attention
oddly enough i took a bet with a friend of mine who owns a nice t2 bpo he would build from that one and i would do the same by invention with my alt and we would see who made better profit in the course of a monthi beat him because my volume way outperformed his volume he could build cheaper but i could mass produce due to having a lot more bpcsso i made my profit in volume instead of by trying to get mucho isk per sale
which bpo that makes rather a lot of difference
this or start reseeding t2 bpo either way is ok by me
id like to see specialized probes that can scan for cloaked ships requirements for operating these probes would be high maybe level 5 of all current scanning skillsi think something needs to be done about afk cloakers and this would be an easy and fair solution in my opinion cloakers that are actively seeking targets would not be affected as they are constantly moving scanning them down would be extremely difficult if not impossible altogether its not fair that one person can sit in a system 23 hours of the day without any way for the others in that system to chase him off or kill him
dont fix what aint broken
this is not a terrible idea but a better solution is something that we already have directional scanner dont let someone afk cloaked in system bother you just watch your dscan for anything that worries youif one or two people cloaked in system bothers you you might not need to be in that system to begin with
yes and once he doesnt just sit there you can kill him what is the problem thenhe either cant do anything or you can kill him seems fairif youre afraid to undock with anything nonblue in local that is your problem
not supportedcloakers who sit in system are used for intel so just because they arent talking in local doesnt mean theyre afk if youre doing a mining op mission op or hunting fir juicy targets in 00 having guys who can lag behind and provide intel in system is an asset and they can be popped as soon as they start moving around if theyre not somewhat carefulnot supported

useless my pos would disagree with you if it could speak
i dont see this as an entirely bad thing being able to mine moons in empire for low level moon materials would break some of the monopoly of the 00 corps maybe drop some prices for the manufactures jump bridges idea may not work but i am not against it eitherif you can have moon harvesting arrays then you would also need reactor arrays in empire but there would defiantly be a few issues around that but there maybe a way of working round that eg limiting types of reactioni dont see this as trying to bring 00 to empire just something that should have been in the game anyway pilotscorporations spend a lot of time and isk to earn the ability to deploy towers in empire should have some benefits to that than just being able to deploy labs and factories plus this might also mean there could be a reason to improve the moon mineral types in 00 and increase the amounts of the r32 and r64 moons
go play on the test server technically you wont be risking anything in unsafe space not that there is any such thing as safe space in eve in the first place

yes thats right another one of those threadswhat im gonna try and say tho is something i hope the majority will find beneficial rather than gamebreakingchanging basicly as it stands now ecm is the singly ewar that will render any ship any time completely harmless there is two ways around it assigning drones to someone with weaponry or having friedn or foe missiles in a missile boat both of which are valid workarounds and should honestly be utilize more however if youre in a pure turret ship as most bss are to name one type this is very seldom an optionwhat i would like the ecm modules to do instead of the 20 second cycle is to mess with your targeting computer in a very different way ecm bursts are what i am looking at having a target unable to activly defend itself alone or shut down x of any hostile fleets for a minimum of 20 seconds assuming you dont warpdie can be the changer of the battle in fact in most cases assuming youre on near equal grounds it will benow for the change i would like ecm should still be mesing with your targeting computer and it should still be chance based what i would like it to do instead of a 20 sec cycle would be to act as a focused ecm burst basicly you may or may not lose lock but thats all it does you will be forced to reacquire lock every time it gets a successful hit now the specifics behind this would of course be worked out with someone that knows how to make this happen the simple change i would would be as followseither a very short or no cycle time at all basicly just an on off switch or maybe a 5 sec cycle timeno longer be jammed but lose lock as an effect of the modulestill be chance based depending on module strenght relative to the target ship and falloffwhat the stated should then do is make it so that you may lose lock 3 times within a time period of 5 sec but you can always reacquire lock it may break your lock while locking and thus never be permajammed it can also go 10 minutes passed without losing lock a single time basicly the same with the jammers now but the consequence is of a less degree this will enable a ecm ship like the falcon to still be able to get away from a single and even multiple tacklers if lucky and it can still disrupt a hostile fleet and save other pilots it will however not make it so that a gang of a ecm shipone or two dps ship can kill anything in its path without getting shot backso in essence the ecm modules would be unchanged in the manner that they will still jam people but only to a certain extent this will also make it so that all ecm modules in the game currently does the same job ecm burst and lock breaker bombsi will specify that the effect of the ecm module would not be once per cycle but as long as the module is active basicly you target someones targeting computer and you continiously try to jam its signals and since the targeting computer is changing every once in a while you get a match and jam it this is why it should have either a very short cycle time or no cycle time at all this would enable you to activly try and disrupt a large number of people in a short ammount of time making it in effect a very long range ecm burst a skilled pilot could then jam a key portion of a fleet very fast and over and over again depending on the efficiency on the module one may also suggest that the jam should become stronger the more time passes having your ecm module sync with the target ships targeting computer so to say have enough time pass and you may get near the old 20 sec jammed cycle in the way your opponent will lose lock more often this is more complicated however and may not be possibleive spoken to several ecm pilots about this im falcon etc capable too and its only been well recieved so far in my eyes this would benefit more than harm thank you
agree
i support this in principle just dont remove them completelya goodb goodc half good  i like the pos management window idea but not complete removal of the mailsthey do serve a purpose and are useful but a little over the top right now
i herby call into question the voting for the cms 5 my application was submitted well in time and my credntials were sent as asked for yet my name in not included in the vote why not is it because the same ole same ole group of people dont want to share there were nymerous questions and statements from players in the forfum that there was no point in running since it was either a allready a done deal with the same people running things and or b it didnt matter anyway since ccp simply used the csm as a smoke screen and or ignored them totally is it because i rocked the boat by asking questions in the forum that no one would answer escpecially csm i asked repeatedly if application was accepted and was repeatedly ignored now without any preamble there is a vote with no debate no notice no nothing one little msg when you sign on that says vote but for what why should they when you have gone out of your way to make csm and the entire process hard to find and follow so once again the majority will be trampled by the minority and given no choice in how the game is played i wonder if anyone looked into the board of ccp if they would see  cheney and bush running the show this is their style of politics frankly i never even dreamed anyone but myself would vote for me in the first place but to not even have my name listed is the lowest form of censourship there is and after reading and particapating in the forums it ptoves the contemp the old school csm and ccp has for anything or anyone new and the players of eve in general their motto should be just give us your money to play the game and shut the hell up we could care less what you thinkfly safely fly freeelf lord
umyou did see that part where it said they rejected 9 applications right
so this would be like an aoe version of the new dd for blobbed titans cool
combine these two events togheter multiple and low signature res
so 30bs can go mwd to a group of caps with no weapons and suicide and effecivly kill them all or make them worthless for a bit yea
this idea is so horrifically mind numbingly heap of offal bad i just dont know where to begin
if stuff getting blown up counts as consumption then everything in the game can be consumed bpos data interfaces anythingin null sec exploration has become the equivalent of lvl 4s except they make more money than 4s not the incorrect estimate of 40m an hour lvl 4s but i have heard some absurd figures coming out of null about how much they were making in explorationnot wh i have only done it in high sec and it was fun but didnt pay as much as running through 4s with two vargurs as you can imagineone friend claimed over 100m an hour though i think that was exaggerating a lot a full time explorer i know does claim to make in excess of 40m an hour down there though and that i believe
supportedi really think they need to take a look at balancing the whole exploring subset now that the dust has settled
hello i have an idea for u ppl of eve well the server tranquility has been down far past its downtime it says its had an error well thats kind of messed up becuase there is no other servers i mean come on all games like this should have a backup serveri mean thats kinda pathectic not to be mean to the creatorsif it was possible i think it would be a good thing to copy tranquility and make a backup server a backup wouldent be badjust in case of this exended downtime and something else to only allow connections to it if the server tranquility is having an exteded downtime just so players like us are not waiting i dont mind if they raise the downtime a little just keep at least one of them working
first of all  nobody has a few hundred servers just sparefor the rest of the time
plus extended downtime means theyre fixing something if it was broken on one server it would be broken on the backup server as well plus mirroring would be silly hard to do ccp isnt run by magic pixies after all
you make me sad i mean come on get back to school before you start touching keyboard there may be still some hope leftyou probably think eve server is some desktop machine 
the nolocal thing i have heard of instawarp and warptocloakedship  those two i am not familiar with but they do sound quite interesting do they actually exist can anyone explain a little bit about them maybe one of the numerous pl pilots in this threadon topic  it doesnt really matter how many people support the idea of stripping pl of their championship title  ccp is not gonna do that it would be nice to see some bans but thats not gonna happen either it appears that the big banhammer is just a cool toy that devs like to swing around in their videos btw has there been any kind of official response from ccp about those exploitsthe thing i am really curious about is this  why do the best pvpers in eve the pilots who won the alliance tournament for 2 years in a row need to use exploits to fight their opponents anyone
support this i do
oh yessigned
i find it contradictory that a large ship with plenty of room for robust electronics such as a battleship takes longer to lock onto a target than a smaller ship such as a frigate i do understand that larger ships have substantially greater locking range but this trade off is a poor mimic of real world electronic targeting i think applying an inverse square law or dampened variant to the targeting game mechanics is worth consideration
imho it makes perfect sense from the game balance stand pointit gives smaller ships a role why would you bring any small ship if all big ships can lock just as fastnot supported
tracking speed
that doesnt matter for ewar of all kind killing at rangethink about insta locking bs with long range points and heavy neuts good luck in trying to outrun thatif you need fast locking fit your shipgang for itremote sensor boosting target painting from frigates helps your bigger ships to lock fasteryou are not very convincing on why we should give up that balance
what i mean by inverse square law is that range from a target influences targeting speed the math can be dampened to prevent instalocks at pointblank rangeneuts and ewar fits on a bs have drawbacks fitting a neut can impede overall firepower and fitting ewar or a point and web replaces cap boosters an mwd or ab sensor boosters and or tracking computers the cpu demand of the ewar can further inconvenience a battleships fityou didnt mention dronesa frigate or cruiser engaging a battleship should be at risk  its a battleship the current targeting mechanics are more imbalanced against the ship that can exceed 100 million isk as opposed to one that costs a few million or only a few hundred thousand also consider the skill requirements to fit and fly the relative shipsthe introduction of a flak cannon module would be an imbalance and drive the frigate into obsolescence
it would make sense but it will screw the game balance
tracks faster than this and sits on a bigger platform than the smaller gun and can fire much further as well video of it tracking a big vehicle is easier to find than a smaller vehicle hence real life example is similar to the ingame simulationremember were talking about a sensor locking and tracking a target 100m across traveling 5000 ms or 18000 kmh or 11000 mph at a range of 50249km in a vacuum the smaller and faster the object in space the harder it is to track with a sensor
it would make sense but it will screw the game balance dxyocwhat you say is a contradiction if it makes sense how can it screw the game balance i have made a few points why i think the current targeting mechanics are imbalanced and unduly favor smaller shipsyou didnt make an argument how would such a change influence game balance and how would those changes relate to some of my points i think on this issue game targeting mechanics the current game balance is an unfounded preconception
it does not contradict at allfrom a realisms perspective bigger ships should lock faster  but due to game ballance they lock slower than smaller shipsno reason to change that cause atm they work wellits not like i want to wait 2 years after they chage targeting speeds just to fix balanceand i cant see any point except the reaslism one
bagehi that bigger platform doesnt flyas for your point about tracking norad can track an object the size of a baseball in orbit and youre telling me that tracking a larger object 100m across a few hundred kilometers away with a spaceship of fantastically advanced technology 20000 years into the future is a challengei do understand your point about real world analogies not fitting with the simulation but i do think i am made my point from the perspective of the simulation and basic physics its such an artificially imposed tactical advantage that it bugs the  out of me  its really starting to hinder my suspension of disbelief
if you think this is bad contemplate how a target 500m2 is just as easy to hit at 0m as it is at 250kmits a balance mechanic and a  poor one at that but it is what it is i actually like what your concept is about the inverse targeting speed but fixing that and things like signature radius simply are not going to happen because it would fundamentally alter eve to its very core even though things like this would fix a hell of a lot of eves problems its not really an issue
itsits just a game manlots of stuff is unrealistic but good from a balance pov
youre trying to say a flying aircraft carrier would be harder to find than one floating in wateri think you misunderstand how they track orbiting junk because it is something small like a satellite or orbiting vehicle that identifies the stuff often by chance plots its course then tells a place on the planet where to find it to get exact readings on where it is going thereafter a computer simply crunches numbers and they will occasionally recheck to see if it is where it is projected to be if it isnt it is lost theres tons of stuff up there not being tracked in fact fairly large asteroids have near misses and hit our atmosphere without first being acquired again these are all things with predictable trajectoriesso here again something small is required to find something small in space if it changes course like a small spaceship would something far away would lose its lock in reality allowing large ships to keep locks on small things at extreme ranges despite course changes is letting them off easyradar doesnt work in space because there is no medium to transmit sound waves you have to find them through emissions andor reflectionsa more accurate simulation would increase the difficulty of locking and maintaining lock based on distance changes in velocity and distance from an emission source that would reflect off it however the more variables there are the more load there is on the servers i would prefer to be able to fight a bunch of ships than have a more accurate acquisition and tracking model that crashed the servers
bagehi i didnt know you wrote code for ccpradar doesnt work in space because there is no medium to transmit sound waves you have to find them through emissions andor reflections  bagehi no wonder its ed up radar and sound waves  that is pretty funnyall the variables that would be used to crunch targeting figures are already used in every other aspect involved in resolving combat whats one more calculation can i interest you in a wafer thin mint
radar  sound waves not radio detection and ranging whatbagehi uninstall eve nowand dont ever post here again
i believe that faction ships and items officer too should be able to be bought and sold on the open market for two main reasons1 this would give price averages and other valuable data to sellers and buyers2 it would help immensely to cut down contract and trade scamming the vast majority of scams you will see in jita local are people protending something is the faction version ie navy caracal is a caracal rigged navy raven being a regular raven covered in capacitor control circuits and modules however the market system cannot be fooled in this waythank you for taking the time to read my first proposal
supportedhell i think the entire trade system should be done under the open market
not supportedi rather like the ability to check prices in entire space with contracts we are talking about expensive and generally quite rare stuff plus i think theres nothing wrong with scamming given how silly you have to be to fall for a scam of that sort
nothing wrong with scamming but all items should be on the market signed
it allows people to check prices andor find the best place to buy them throughout eve for rare items regardless of whether or not this was intended this is an extremely good reason to not want faction ships on the normal market
if im reading your post right what you care most about is the ability to see price history and volumes of sold items i think this is important information  but im not sure that changing contract items to market items is the best ideathe market is good because you have a nice orderly way of finding everything most things are on the market and so generally you find what you want you also get the benefit of being able to see price history and volume of sales for predefined periodscontracts are great because you can see them no matter where in new eden your pilot happens to be you also have a handy history of what contracts youve been involved withyour proposal will suffer from a couple of issues one is that people will complain that it will be difficult to find rare items and get any kind of reasonable price comparison without visiting every region the second is that scammers feel they have a right to screw you over im not arguing the rightness or wrongness of these objections im suggesting that you change your proposalid rather see a price history and volume of sales for singleitem contracts i think singleitem contracts ought to be merged with the market window somehow so that you can find items using the efficient market view and see a price history and sales volume this would keep the benefits and dangers of contracts but allow contracts to benefit from the positive side of the market viewi like where you were going with this but at this point the cons outweigh pros
but at the same time allow players to freely join any npc corp they wishthe cost for wardeccing an npc corp should increase and you wont be allowed to go near that corps property stations etc or you will get attackedas for new players stick them in a concorde alliance which is immune to wardecs and just force a player to join another npc corp after 2 months
noprovide more and better game mechanics that facilitate more pvp insteadtradable kill rights vigilante forces formalizing mercenary contracts adding meaning to wardecs by adding victory conditions and demands
noeven from just a story perspective thats the equivalent of declaring war on one of the major factions and im sure they would have no problems with hunting you down or gathering the resources to grind what ever assets you have into dustand thats before you get into the game play sideso dont go there trust me
alts have for too long continued to evade death if people feel this to be an issue they should join a real corp and defend themselvesthis isnt about hunting people it is about equal pvp and it is exploiting game mechanics when a person leaves a corp to a noobie corp just to evade a wardec
bad idea it would end with multiple war decks against the starter npc corps and 2 day old players wondering why people can shoot them and concord does nothingnpc taxes were introduced to encourage alts out of npc corps id suggest looking at a means of extending this to include miners industrialists and traders if you really think there is a problempersonally i dont see a problem with people being immune to war decs i dont think much of the war dec mechanic perhaps we should look at alternatives
actually corps are allowed to join the militias that are at war with a major faction and they arent ground into dust so thats kind of a bad exampleto take care of npc pirates a bounty should  shared kill rights the bigger the bounty the more people have kill rights and if you have kill rights from being killed in an unprovoked attack you can place a bountyhowever my understanding is that most people who want to be able to war dec npc corps want to shoot mission runners and miners without consequences i dont think that will happen stick to flipping their cans in hopes that they will flip them back
i support this poor troll andor service
thisll happen
not supported
meh i was going to post a few points refuting some of the stupidity in this thread other peoples lol but i just cant be bothered anymore eve is never going to be developed in a direction im going to be happy playing
if it makes you any happier ccp themselves have said theyre not entirely content with local being used as an intel tool
thats not really what im talking about but ive heard them mention that on a few occasionseve is just going to continue down a path that makes the game softer and friendlier to stupid people who make mistakes and dont want to pay for them thats disappointing to me because i know that as each year passes the game isnt going to be more refined and made a sharper leaner more uncompromising more competitive game quite the opposite its going to become even more carebear oriented with all the toning down and hand holdingi wish i were wrong but sadly i know im not id like to see anyone prove it otherwise
coming from the one who want easy kills of targets who cant be expected to have a chance at actually surviving the fightyou are joking rightif i want to kill wh pveers i first need to find a wormhole that is actually occupied and being used at the moment that can be quite a long work especially not in prime time they are quite often deserted even the ones with a pos in them to find one you can go through a string of whs but you got decent chance it collapses somewhere behind you leaving your horribly lost contrary to what you claim have you ever been in one wh systems do not have belts you will have to probe everything down even if you manage to find a wormhole system with active pveers you wont be able to find it again tomorrow it is a completely random process that involves alot of luck of finding a wh system with active people in them this contrary to normal space if i want to go to find a ratter in normal space i look at the map development indices etc and i see i should set destination to hed the route there will stay always the same
outside of hisec where and how is this the case given that ccp only a year ago increased the map by 50 and made the whole of that extra space in to delayed local id say that you should have more grounds for optimism than pessimism
the irony of your posts is amusingthe only way eve will head down that path is if ccp started listening to lazy players such as yourself always wanting to buff your toys and handicap your targets have you noticed that all you do is whine about making things easier for you and then you have the galls to complain about people wanting this game on easy mode thats you you are the one wanting to play eve on easy mode bellumuntil you realize that you are the carebear begging ccp to make your profession easier than the rest this is all pointless seriously bellum you sound bitter you throw tantrums when people disagree with you you accuse ccp of going soft when they dont buffnerf the things you want you have to take a few steps back and look at the bigger picture realize that this game needs balance and that suggesting halfbaked ideas like removing local without keeping things balanced isnt the way to go and if ccp isnt listening to you that it might be because what you think is an awesome idea might not be that awesome the clues are there you just have to open your eyes to see themor you could just continue calling people wussies and carebears for not agreeing with your ideas which honestly i think is more likely p but the only one that ends up looking like a carebear is you
oh hai bellumfunny you propose same thing when i wrote this stuff up a while ago you flushed it down the toiletand i wrote up how exactly would those local removals workfirst of all local would display people only in scan range from stations and poss adapted to local scanning local in delayed mode we can go on about this yet it is so easy to do its just that ccp dont care about this just as they dont care about lagg while id just adore to go nuke those localscanwarpoffcloakravenbots my hopes are not highthumbsdown for the op thumbs up to the one that presents complete idea for local nerf for 00  tldr ttfn
its probably been brought up befor in this thread but im too lazy to read the backlog removing local even if scanning mechanisms where improved would still provide a major problem military 5 systems are visible on your map which means you now immidiatly know where your targets are as is already the case but atleast currently youd have an accurate idea of how safe it is to rat
yeah but again scanning fixes these1 you specifically say you use local to identify targets you can do the same with a single probe you may not get them 100 right off the bat but you can hit the entire system teon not included for obvious reasons thus you dont need to spend any more time on the hunt to find someone2 no roams dont have to worry but you got in that wormhole by scanning thus you prove that scanning is the solution with said arguement1 wait you mean this isnt a multiplayer game or at least a game where you bring an alt with you everywhere2 i dont fly them much but it may be a boost to any cloaky ship not just stealth bombers3 stront your pos or actually watch your systmes stop afking your empire and you dont have a problem as for spies they already exist ergo solution is already thereit is difficult to become 100 unscanable in anything larger than frigate and even then the person has to give up most if not all mid slots
obviously you have no idea  you can leave scanning alt in any wormhole system  and grief residents to death  until they leave  quit etcit is only slightly more difficult to do than to come through gatesi will always support removing of local 
unfortunatly i have to agree with you
and if there is lets say 500 enemies in one system that you dont really know is there but lets just say they are therewhat do you do then without localscan them all out and waste a whole day to later find out that theyre about to leave localyeah no local is going to work gooddo you guys even think for 5 secs before you even post that you support this idea as it is now
silly idea for lazy pvpers to get easier ganks
1 do you have any idea how many empty ships are sitting in poss in most 00 systems scanning would not fix this unless you could tell if the ship was being piloted or not2 so you scan for other whs in the system sadly today there was only one that remained that hadnt collapsed and you collapsed it when you entered try again tomorrow tomorrow you find whs some come out in high sec and some of your pilots cant fly there one comes out on the opposite side of eve from where you live no scanning doesnt solve this this is why people rarely take roams through whs weve done it a few times and have gotten some people stuck along the way1 please read my comment again my point is exactly that no local decreases the multiplayer aspect because people would have to spread out a lot more to find targets to kill2 stealth bomber gangs black ops gangs these would become the primary roaming gang few other pvp ships would be used as they would show up on scans and have to enter through gates that would have scouts watching3 you are missing the point because enemies can see your fleet moving towards them currently they have a chance to pull together a defense fleet so your fleet needs to be larger and more dedicated to actually wanting to flip sov or take a moon without local fleets could reinforce random fixed structures to keep an enemy running around managing sov is unpleasant enough without having to deal with thismy tengu can warp cloak fly through bubbles cant be scanned and easily can kill ratters and miners it is also more than capable ratting the same could be said of all t3 ships basically no local would make these ships 100x better than they already are noobs would hate 00 more than they already do because they wouldnt be able to find anything for pvp and would keep getting ganked by ships they have no way of defending against the idea is to try to get more people to enter 00 not turn it into a goodolboys club for making fat isk
leave arties alonenerf lasers xd
i am so supporting this finally assembly hall has some decent ideaswould love to see more emo tj ideas 3
your attempts at trolling are failing now go troll something with a lower entry level where you might actually succeed like omegle or chatroulette and go knock yourself out
lolnonot supported thumbsdown and all that jazz
i totally agree in fact i suggest we all go one further and just have the modules gun speed and tank so all ships are identicalwe mujst remove all skills and of course there should only be one ship called you guessed it spaceship then when everything is totally in balance the side with the most players insta wins meaning we all get more time to sleep
1 unlike what u may believe high sec does have risks theyre called ninja salvagers which is a consequence of missioning in high secthey get protected too and even if they steal from a wreck theyll have backup waiting to take down your expensive mission ship if u try anything stupid and it works just fine2 the directional scanner is absolute garbage especially when pirates can just use covert ops ships to bypass it3 pirates dont have to camp the gatesthey just have to camp the mission area and the agents and even with buffed sentry guns which doesnt apply to the agents in lowest sec systems anyway theyll just encourage bigger blobs in return4 severely halfassing both pve and pvp would lead to strict fit restrictions and leads to misconceptions towards pvp because a u cant use a buffer tank in missions as u would in pvp b u cant speed tank against the uber rats webs in missions as u would in pvp which means no small ships that can otherwise be used in pvp c ure always going pointblank since the uber rats dps at that range when there r ways to pvp just within warp disruptor range d ewar mods cant be fitted because theyre all used for the dps and tanking ull need against the uber rats not to mention the warp jammer ull have to fit when u get ambushed e cap stability which isnt a primary concern in pvp will still be an issue because depending on how uber these rats r all the cap boosters u can carry wont be enough to keep up the active tank ure gonna be forced to use when u get ambushed5 do u honestly think that ud know every single pilots behavior and habits simply by researching a few killboards of only a few of them cause all they have to do is find out where all the pirate faction agents r and camp their systems and with the many pirates its gonna attract its essentially 237 camping6 were talking about these new missions correct where its not tons of rats but 3 uber tackling tanking and dps rats that web u so ure not gonna get very far from the warpin point in the first place u know the ones u cant volley down unlike the previous frigate tackler rats because these r uber rats7 and i never said anything about helping miners either what i did say was that the game is already unbalanced in favor of miners because if anyones flooding the markets its the thousands of exhumers infesting high sec belts with all the minerals they macro mine not that hard to figure out8 in conclusion this wont work at all because ull be warp jammed and webbed by uber rats the entire mission so the blobs wont have to switch to tacklers because the gank is so much easier now since ure gimping yourself with the strict fit requirements needed to survive the rats and kill them quickly enough so ure not warp jammed by the time the pirates find u if thats even possible those strict fitting requirements r pretty much halfassing both pve and pvp because they r two very different aspects with different fitting requirements meaning if they find u in time u wont be able to put up a fight in the first place because a ull be susceptible to volleyblob dmg with the active tank for pve b the cap stability needed for the active tank to survive the rats long enough will hurt u in pvp c last but not least ure fitted with close range weapons meaning all the pirates have to do is fit for midlong range dps and ure gonna get ez ganked the same wayso go ahead and do all your research because its not gonna change anything against the tons of pirates that will camp the agents and nearby systems so ure never gonna get any mission done which means no faction standings here and if u try one in a ridiculously gimp halfassed fit hope u like padding your enemies killboards cause thats whats gonna happen when u have 3 uber tackler rats holding u in place while the pirates lolsnipe u down with impunity
hi there total carebare atm your idea is stupid go play hello kitty island adventures instead of eve piracymoarfun
you wouldnt happen to be an ankhesentapemkah alt would you
lol willnice trollwanna post a bit about your history in various pirate corps p
i too fully support this idea pirates are bad people and should have to pay more irl money to play this game but you didnt have to lie to us tough your girlfriend calling was actually your mother shouting to do the dishes internetspaceship pilots dont have girlfriends
tell you girlfriend to stfu while youre playing eve
not supported this is simply not enough to deter piracyi suggest ccp forms an international law authority for anything eve related killed a hauler well thats your call as a player but you made your choice a petition will be automatically made by the hauler and the ccp police will be knocking on your door in no less than 5 business days the police will take you to the top secret ccp prison inside the eyjafjallajUFFFDkull volcano and you will be put into special disciplinary clinics until you are deemed eligible to play
this you should make it a proposal i can think of at least 1 csm candidate who would definitely support this
that sounds rather kinky now where was my tempest
it would be nice to be able to add combat probes to an overview setting so that you can just scan for that item only currently you have scan for everything to see them in a direction scan
okay seriously you state under your employment history posting personal information is not allowedapplebabethis isnt a troll against your csm campaign and theres no spin here unless youve collected a paycheck from ccp or youre going to argue that csm  employment youve not been employed by them in any way
wow thats pretty goodalthough technically the free trip to iceland could be marked down as payment 1 to you seleene
im suprised at you seleene thought u had better things to do if im honest employment is a contract between two parties one being the employer and the other being the employee an employee may be defined as a person in the service of another under any contract of hire express or implied oral or written where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed blacks law dictionary page 471 5th ed 1979so technically in essence someone can be employed without renumeration or written contractpersonally i wouldnt call it employment but thats my own definition i dont believe there was any intention to decievebut i suppose when you get involved in politics even in a game more people want to stab you in the back bring you down and basically treat people like dirt but hey thats eve online
so if i am at a dinner with say the president and he asks me to pass the salt this means i can say on my resume that i served under the president of the united states awesome
lol im not suprised at that response by youi believe it means that if you are given a job to do with direction and clear goals ie the csm under the service of another ie ccp  eve online players contract being verbal or written i believe you guys sign some paperworkdisclaimerccp directs and controls the csm to a extent as they get you to iceland i would say also provide accom and food etcin the uk immigration can arrest a immigrant in work where their passport says they cant if they argue hey im not getting paid the counter arguement is  well u receive foodaccom thats payment ur gone byebyepassing salt to the president is a grosse example of misunderstanding and over simplfacation of what im trying to say and underlines to me what i hate about politics and the csm but this year ive decided to give it a chance and see what good may come from it
so i could seriously put the csm on my resume and an employer would take me seriously about it hmm
ankh you didnt answer to my question so why would i bother even look at your video ps you sound more ed than ever
actually all csm members sign an agreement that explicitly states that being on the csm does not imply having a job with ccp and that it does not imply that you will be hired in the futurewhile being on the csm is definitely something you could put on your resume you cant list it as work experience or phrase it in such a way that it seems ccp was your employer as that is simply not true in fact employees of ccp are not allowed to be on the csm it is a player council not a dev council csm members are not employees by definition
omfgim actually going to vote for this tard as i agree with the others here who are enjoying the lulz the delusional and contradictory ramblings that spew forth from this individual and the responses provoked provide endless entertainmentbesides ccp are hardly going to ruin the unique experience that is eve due to one persons uninformed opinions are they
absolutely here at work we had a nice laugh about the cv nonsense a few minutes ago
well if you cant laugh at yourself  who can you laugh at eh
ignorance is bliss
i can guarantee you that for someone wanting a job in the game industry listing volunteer positions under employment is very very bad form they should be separate and explicitly listed as such come to think of it its true in all industriesi believe there was intention to pad her resume which is totally in tune with the rest of her public persona  a fraud id expect it from an insecure 18 year old looking for a first job not a 26 year old graduate hint  no one with any realistic sense of self calls themselves an expert on anything less than a year after graduation or mentions working on two mmos without listing titles or shipping dates come on you know im right 
most rich elitist gaming companies have something called an nda
keep digging
i was genuinely curious about a response to the point sel was making lets face it it can easily be considered to be misrepresentation of your relationship with ccp which speaks to your character this in turn could speak to the quality of the community representation you will exhibit while on the csmnot trolling genuine questions in my opinion
nitpicking about technicalities she did all the things she mentioned who cares about her actually being a paid employee the things she did are relevant for her cv so calling her a liar because of this kinda looks like trolling to me d
consider for a moment whether it should go under employment history there are other parts to a cv and listing it at the top of the employment history when it has been clearly stated that csm members have signed an agreement not to represent themselves as being employed by ccp so she has essentially breached her contractis that someone you can trust
repeat modetechnicalitiesrepeat modenobody is caring about this mate mail it directly to ccp and say she essentially breached her contract
yes or mail it to my current employer email is on the website
whats one of those
you put the word liar in quotes as if you were quoting seleene saying ankh is a liar where is that quoted from specifically or are you just paraphrasingreinterpreting
i like this idea
lots of burn the witch idiots in here if you dont win a spot ankh at least you can put troll slayer on your cv
basicly ppl who  about this nonissue are calling her a deceiverliarwhatever but the quoted part is from this postthe same person who claims we are not trolling a few posts laterrepeat modewell nitpicking about a completely irrelevant technicality just to make ank look bad looks like trolling to me and yes it is irrelevant its all about the way you should write your resume do you put volunteernon paid jobs under employment history or not repeat mode
dont put it under employment history ank or youll be lynched1
fixed
she has the bright ones on her side i see
its not nitpicking its a serious issue over the eligibility of her even being able to run for csm and i hope someone brings it to ccps attention either a breach of contract took place or she was employed by ccp and either front makes her ineligible to run for csm
im not calling her anything and im not trolling any of her views about the game or whatever the fotm in this thread is but her saying that shes been employed by ccp or worked with them in any capacity outside of the csm is false thats all shrug
repeat modewhy dont you bring it to their attention as i suggested mail them repeat mode repeatas i said b4 it all comes down to how you think you should write a resume listing something as csm member under employment history doesnt sound that far fetched to me its completely relevant in this case repeat
edit nvm
z0r modeaktivatez0r
eve tribune interview is up
you had my only vote i was pretty desperate to find serious candidates that are actually interested in the game itself and not in petty details plus that i totally share your point of view on anything
ankhesentapemkah 
pointing out that somebody is bad has done something bad doesnt deserve a csm spot etc etc is trolling right no i dont put my volunteering which i do a lot of under my employment history because i wasnt bloody employed by them and writing a cv wrongly isnt an irrelevaant technicality people make serious decisions based on them and saying that she worked for a large multinational games company like ccp when she didnt is blatantly stretching the truth to make herself look better
in most companies falsifying employment history is grounds for termination
her time in the csm is relevant considering the work she does at least more relevant than here time at the vd and i dont see anyone complaining about that at most you can say she could make it clearer what the csm is or give it another name than employment history but honestly that is nitpicking not to mention the slight issue that this is just something that is on her site for the people hoping she gets fired because of this which makes you a pretty sad person you are deluded
you my voice
both here and on tweakers you are acting like her sockpuppet are you actually getting something out of this or are you just a alt and wether people would like to see her fired is beside the point this is just one more example of her lying and twisting facts and one more reason why people should not vote for hernot only is she totally out of tune with this game she also is a proven liarexploiter bad corp member and not mentally competent to fill this position as proven over time
damn dude was that diatribe  a response to my statement
as one who enjoys rping im interested to learn what motivated you to choose the name ankhesentapemkahthanks
who the hell knows i dont think anyones trying to make someone lose their job here the reason that particular topic caught my eye is that the character of the candidate means a lot in how i pick who to vote for or to use an analogy i wouldnt put a thief in charge of security for a bank it doesnt matter which candidate it is
i mightve voted for you again
voted all accounts
thanks for all the support and votes folks your posts here your evemails and convos all mean a lot the support is very gratifyingplease note that ive added another focus group to the schedule the topic for this one is the mercenary profession well discuss issues challenges where the profession is heading and what tools or game changes might be made to support that profession although the merc profession is not a specific issue on my campaign platform it is affected by some of the ones that are since im in the merc environment and there was interest from my colleagues i decided it would be fun to discuss as a group
you have my vote aswellalthough i dont actually do most of the stuff you support i do agree that it does need some attention and fine tuning to that end i will support you
generally speaking those that lark has supported were never a bad choice  him included in csm  whatever i do not agree fully with rring part because i use it part because i want to use it a bit more and part because you did not mention what will happen with the sec status penalty you get when you rr outlawshope you find more blob penalties there is someone else i would vote for but it is better to vote for a recent expirate than for a longtimeago expirate 
vote
by urgingif they dont already have onea ccp policy for responding quickly and with useful information to soothe nerves and put out fires in escalating rage threads about exploits or other similarly serious issues by encouraging ccp to work with the csm to aid in responding to the community and managing players expectationsalthough theyve gotten better about it lately ccp is still often slower to respond to volatile brokegame exploit cheating and other big issue threads than reasonable players would prefer even given nda and internal policy considerations that likely affect the timing and content of such responses im convinced there is room for improvement
mynxee i have followed your blog and your csm run so far i am impressed i was wondering in your quest to improve low sec if you would think about giving the ideas brought forth from the 09 vegas meet and concideration the overview can be found here
you got my vote 1also dont forget to defend your noble suicide ganking brethren in highsec we still want our insurance payouts  bomb launchers in lowsec would be fantasticand thwart ankh at every possible turn we dont take kindly to her damn super carebear
since youve changed the timex for blob tactics focus groupunx for lowsec focus group
sounds great but would love to attend the breathing life into lowsec but i have a prior engagement would love to hear how it all goes will it be recorded f
kelli ive added a link for the tth post to the op as well as links to the outlaw expansion proposal and lana torrins bounty system threadflashfresh it will be recorded but as stated i dont plan to release the recordings publicly this is mainly 
hi mynxee  id like to confirm my attendance at the ecm focus group if possible i would also like to attend the low sec focus group  but if you have more experienced low seccers i wouldnt mind listening in at least 
bump

i was attending this meeting about this very subject at fanfest last year the speaker said it very well so ill try to paraphrasekeeping the story straight and noncontradictory is very difficult even when its being written by a handful of ccp employees letting players get in on it just makes it too hard to keep the story consistentthis doesnt mean that players cant have any impact whatsoever but i really doubt ccp will allow players to write out the minor details only let them impact the major events i like whatever opportunity there is for the players to write the story and this doesnt even take into account the ongoing story of 00 politics which is entirely player driven
i reedited the original post to show my issues the first version is very old i will have a website coming up soonsooooonplease visit your user settings to reenable images
mazcan you expand on improve low sec its been a very long time since ive spent any meaningful time in low sec but im curious as to how you think this space should be used to add unique content did you have specific ideas or are you asking that ccp should begin looking at itmoss
it has been a while for me too since theres nothing worthwhile in there to killhere is my plan for lowsec it is subject to much change but the end goal is to increase the incomebut not lower the risk until it becomes worthwhile for carebears to live there after factoring in ship losseshow much income is the real question i dont know how receptive ccp will be to increasing it to be equal to or greater than 00 or even how high it ought to be raised to attract people there
mazz has my votes she manages to get things done and make the csm entertaining
all your issues are the exact ones needed to take the pirate votebut you are not pirate  you used to be one many seasons ago and your alliance was one of the biggest abusers of the nojoy aoe dd i do believe that you honestly wish to get rid of the robot army of 00 but your way of doing it serves the interests of your alliance as well  more targets is not a bad thing thoughwhile voting for you would serve my interests as a voter i feel that you would serve more the interests of your alliance not to mention those rumours i heard about your attendance to csm meetingsafter first looking through the candidates roster  thanks for only putting it in devblog form ccp i had to go to another site that had a link to your own site i have found just you mynxee omber zombie sok and helen as names i took an interest inyour thread is the first i am looking at so why do you think you should get my 5 votes over the others 
why in the world would i be in lowsec when i know theres more targets in 00and the same thing is true of my corp we left 00 because the targets kept going away we would camp a gate and eventually most of the carebears went extinct the ratters in 00 are all battleships unlike lowsec and everyone has much better loot than lowsec we had too many people for the number of people we were fighting carebear 00 alliances were much better because theyre awful at following fleet orders and we could fight way outnumberedwhy is there such a big deal about what security status youre in if youre some person greifing carebears every day does that not make you a pirate if lowsec had more targets we would spend more time there
you are clinging to a small section of my posti do not care why your corp left lowsec for 00 your reasons are your ownthat was just touched in passing in my posti said that the issues i saw being mentioned in the op were the ones that the pirates might look for the pirate vote is not exactly big but it is not small and right now i see just a few candidates ready to take it  you includedit is my impression upon reading the op but you are looking to get the pirate vote to boost your own alliance vote
i dont really see anything nefarious in trying to get votes or being in an alliance i dont really see any conflict of interest both groups like to kill lots and lots of stuff so for as long as theres no way i can pass a csm issue to give all alliances named pandemic legion free money theres not really any way this can be a bad thing for everyone not pandemic legion
no politician will ever see anything nefarious with trying to get votes but that doesnt meant that voter who got tricked into giving his vote will feel the same way as for the conflic of interests you take it a step too far i never mentioned a conflict of interest certainly it has never been before and will not be so with the usual 45 votes going to the major 00 powerblock backed characterssince youve avoided the issue for the 2nd time i have to ask you directly what about the rumours i heard about your attendance record to csm meetings le i just reread your op and you touch on 2 things that will affect the lowsec playerthat is the small gang improvement effort and the revitalizing of lowsec and 00 lowsec does offer some opportunities as isk making source that is superior to 00  yes  superior
that video is  tbh
oh so thats what you were asking about look at the csm meeting minutes i never missed a csm meeting except in cases where i notified them ahead of time due to rl issues and only then was rare i was late to some fanfest panel because i was pretty sick at the time
tbh it was kinda the question from my 1st post in this thread thanks for the answeri cant promise you all my votes but you will get some for sure 
i am sure that the issue has been brought a number of times before but i wonder about your comment over the issuei am talking about the amount of armor shield energy logistics have contributed to the battle if the amount is recorded into the kill mails somehow then many players would enjoy flying logistics and this would result in much longer lasting and satisfying battlesthis could basically be done by adding the player to the kill mail if he has repped a player who had aggro on the targetdamage dealers in the km same thing seems to work when repping someone in empire  then the repper gets aggro toohealing or armorshield rep as it is known in eve and buffing or warfare bonuses are very old and well known concept in most of the mmorpg worlda wise developer would make people comfortable playing healers since this makes the game much more deeper and interesting for everybodyplaying healing character is not that rewarding in most of the games compared to the damage dealers but in eve it is even worst virtually you get no record for your contribution to the battle
question whats your pricing this time roundpolitician for sale im selling my csm powersbored and servers are still down  sorry
nothin p it was a jokei think this would be hard for ccp to manage im not sure about this
vote
i was thinking about what the csm should do and it obviously needs to be the voice of players reminding ccp what the real problems are as experienced by the playershave the other candidates not been playing the same eve as i the real shortterm problem right now is lagno other candidate even mentions the word lag in their platformthis alone gets you my votethe other two problems are ugly ui thrown together haphazardly and hostility towards rookiesthe ui needs to be attractive enough that people taking screenshots keep it on the futuristic mockups we all saw go in the right direction we disagree on how to improve the ui you believe in addons i believe it would be far better if the ui that comes with the client wasnt so obviously unacceptably bad that no eve pilot recommends to rookies to just leave it alone and go with the defaults the default ui needs to present information we all want ship types local etc in a visually attractive mannerwhile we disagree on how to solve the problem at least you recognize that it exists thank youi wish you also saw the hostility towards rookies and understood how it affects game growth and particularly retention but youre already nailed two out of three problems and thats a pretty good platformplatformwise you simply have no competition i sincerely hope you win
you have my vote o7eveUFFFDs worst problem is the lag it will not be easily solved so we need the right person on the right place
well for me its all about making the business case to ccp that the cheapest way to refresh the ui in the longrun is to do it so that the playerbase can provide most of the bellsandwhistles for free the trick is addressing the legitimate concern that allowing player access to the ui will end up being destabilizingbut even if ccp decides not to permit addons on tq refactoring the ui using an addon model has significant benefits it makes porting to new platforms much easier and if ccp limited player addons just to singularity then the template for a lot of complaints goes from this is broken fix it to this is broken here is a patch  consider it which is much more likely to happenthis is an interesting topic that i havent thought about deeply in retrospect i was lucky in that within a few weeks of starting the game i was recruited by a small corp of extremely newbiefriendly players who then quickly joined a nascent alliance and ive been working with them ever sincewhat would you suggest be done to make the game more newbiefriendly other than the obvious things like make the npe better can you come up with a way to make mentoring a profession in the game for example
thats the main reason for me tooeveryone has lots of interessting ideas how they would like change things in eve but lag is the only problem eve has so this is where the csm should be activ that would help every eve player iam not 100 sure about your solution to handle lag but i think it goes in to the right direction improving the server performance will never be enough for 00 warfare without node crashs and gridload problemsccp have to find be a way to prevent lag
my and i corp will vote for the candidate who can bring these ideas up in meetingscorps like assassin corps who rely on being employed by other corps to make money have no way of advertising themselves if a corp wants to be found they have to have what they do in their name eg assassins 4 hire hoping theyll be found in the people search but there needs to be a better system i want to see in the meeting minutes there were discussions over making the billboards across eve rentable for advertisements or something similar this would give corps more purpase which at this point in time is becoming rare
done and you know i only get three of those per year so use it well
solo miners can make just as much money in highsec with no risk small mining groups can make tons more mining abc ores in wormhole space which frankly is safer than lowsec this what you think and you also want the miners go in to lowsec areashigh sec mining keeps eve running and messing with that would have potentially disastrous effects the best option as i see it is to remove the dense ores from high sec the massive scordite dense veldspar et cetera and increase their ratios in lowseci m not a miner but a member of a minining corp and i think that your ideas about to miners not good for their future
i think the problem goes beyond this if i am griefing someone a neutral char can rep me and the victim cannot attack the repairer without getting an aggression timer themselves this was a tactic that is being used in highsec and faction fightingthanks
see thats the difference between me and most lowsec candidates i dont want to say ok everyone in highsec youve had a good run but off to low sec you go but what about that corp that kind of wants to try out living on the risky side right now there is no reason for them to go to lowsec its riskier and about equally as profitable so it makes no sense and even if corps do decide to move there as they often do they just wind up moving out in a few weeks because they realize first hand that its just not worth the timethen id love to hear your concerns ive put a fair amount of thought into boosting lowsec but im always open to new ideas maybe its the fact that its 4am and im halfcoherent but im not sure i get what you take issue with i assume its a neutral char repping getting shot docking and switching to a combat ship however in the proposed change the neutral logistics will have to rep get shot wait a minute dock wait thirty seconds switch ships wait another thirty seconds and then undock giving two minutes total waiting time perhaps you can do me a solid and elaborate a bit
ok try this while i am ratting in empire you show up and engage me during the battle another char who is neutral warps in and starts to repair you if i engage this other char i get a sec hit for attacking the neutral if we are an highsec concord is coming after both of us but not the neutral char doing the repairing if we have a war dec between us and we engage in highsec i get the sec hit for attacking the neutral and concord comes after me delaying the neutrals docking and jumping only really helps in null sec space by preventing the neutral from running away to a station or another systemedit forgot to include that setting an aggression flag for repairing was in place previously fof missiles and drones would attack the repairer since the repairer had the aggression flag the other side used a tactic of not jamming the repairer but jamming the one being repairedthanks
what are your positions on the current state of rockets and assault frigates i am nothing if not single minded
giving you my voteshope youll really focus on lowsec mostly a lot of other issues youve mentioned are probably already getting their attention via all the othersalso ill try to bring you some more votes via my fellowsfollowersdisciples good luck
thump up for many of yours ideas and knowledge ur got my 3 votes however there are thump down ideas that i d like to bring out after long time discussed with other players the ecm system and eccm is working as fine as ever especially for ship with small drone bay it would be even more intersting if have the ecm let the jam  increase a litle bit but reduce jammed timer think about it it not only keep the smile of those small drone bay ship but also bring heart of those big ship with slow locking back to beating sooner it also give the inti or small ship with fast locking speed more invulnerable for ecm  force the use of small combat drones on them plus another way of defense against boring lowsec gate camp  draw ppl to low sec plus plusi d love to hear ur idea about the balance of caldari ship and fit  rail gun missile passive tank just as u r speaking for the largest population of eve citizen and have had the most number of newly joining players pilots how r ur understanding of so many complaining and disappointing of the caldarian with their ships in pvp  which force them sadly quit their race ship and train for something else or close up their mind and wait for the nerf which every time make it worse what was wrong  the pilot or the ship and how d u do to help  change the ship bonus or educating the pilots i recognize some reply brough it up for many many candicates but all r replies r hardly satisfied or ignored  as it still got brough up tks and sorry for typos as its 350 am here
my rook wingman is the coolest dude in game
unless something has drastically changed liketoday as soon as the neutral warps in to repair me he becomes flagged to you if the neutral is repping a pirate who isnt gcc the neutral repper becomes gcc i was actually aware of this last aspect myself until recently and im of the opinion that its unintentional and should be fixedi do think you may want to try this again or im totally missing what youre saying again if the neutral reps your war target he becomes flagged to you i mean concord doesnt come in guns blazing to smite the heretic but you can shoot him in his face without repercussion rockets are beyond useless they arent even viable enough to use ironically i dont even know why they got nerfed and forgotten rocket crows and maledictions were never really considered to be overpowered but they were viable and id like to return to thatabout afs its a tricky business there are some that i think are pretty good in a pvp environment namely the jaguar wolf and ishkur the enyo and hawk are decent pve platforms that can dabble in pvp i guess the harpy is funny when its sniping pods the vengeance is nothing short of terrible but i think that has to do more with the fact that rockets are bad than anything else the reribution has one freakin mid slot i mean i dont expect every single ship to be a pvp platform but cmon ive seen it used to run lowlevel complexes and up to level 3 missions but just because its barely functional doesnt mean its good when it comes down to it i wouldnt mind seeing a new bonus to afs but dont think the ships are totally useless as they are now except the amarr ones what i dont want to see is afs becoming better than interceptors at tackling would giving them an ab speed bonus make them too over powered probably at first glace if you gave them a web strength bonus so that they can work alongside interceptors at tackling it would seem pretty cool  but i think that would be a little bit overpowered  i mean i wouldnt want to fly an interceptor over an af if that change was made its one of those issues that requires a lot of consideration there is simply no clear answer i appreciate the support from a fellow lowsec brosef lowsec is my main focus and my main concern in my view its the area of the game that is most underrepresented and most in need of help
i think we have similar ideas for ecm drones that is make the smaller ones more effective against smaller ships and not totally crippling the larger ships who just sit in space mashing lockas far as caldari ships in a pvp environment i think they function as a pretty good transition race from pve to pvp obviously everyone knows how great caldari are in a pve setting but for those pve pilots who are trying to break into the pvp world the caldari have a lot to offer the blackbird for instance i dont think any gang will turn away a blackbird from their ranks the ferox a good blaster platform in pvp the drake im not joking when i say its a very good pvp platform as far as bcs go its right up there with the best of them with battleships the blaster rokh is good the torp raven has its place and the scorp can jam from crazy farbut you are right eventually people train out caldari for pvp i think most of it has to do with the fact that none of the ships are really sexy they are functional but not cool if that makes sense when i first started to pvp i started with caldari it went blackbird crow falcon  and i stayed there for awhile then i got seduced by the speed and allure of minmatar and i wont pull any punches here it was cooler ive come full circle and although i dabble in amarr and minmatar i always come back to the trusty drakei dont think its a huge drawback to be caldari in pvp support is vital if not flashy although the gallente or amarr can pvp and pve without having to cross train the caldari ships will always have an important place and i am satisfied with their role as it is every ship has their role when it comes down to it i think eve would be a far more boring place if all the races and all the ship classes were completely balanced
do you have any thoughts on introduction bounty missions run by concord agents against negative sec status players maybe it could give a chance for the hunted to become the hunter and vice versa thanks
confirming my vote
confirming my two accounts voted for cat just remember to think of the problems as piwates when you get elected ok signed
confirming my 16 votes to cat dont ask
confirming my vote for cat after killah bunnie offered chocolate hobnobs out in alliance chat
all of elysium alliance and our mains is voting for cat
the afk cloaking community supports the cat
i know who cat is unfortunately and most of the eve forums do that in itself is an unique ability it takes brains to become a well known trolland theres a huge slice of eve which isnt combat we dont need yet another major alliance player in the csm pushing for more alliance fleet warfare stuff i cant believe im saying it but cat gets my voteevery serious discussion needs a lighter side to it
1 vote for cat i hate him so maybe he will go away 1 or 2 weeks to iceland and i dont have to read his posts on the forum
i dont have a laptop so maybe lol maybe also the icelandics will make me eat rotten whale meat lol x
direct voting link for your convenience
really guys its a hardcore game so corbeau is right i hope ull become a csm mate gl
so you dont care about the majority and you call yourself candidate you are just griefer with real life issues i will vote for ankhesentapemkah i hope she will take care of you and the others like you
i care only for people who fit in this game obviously you are not one of them
vote for meif you are an industrialist or miner i will do my best to look out for your interests on the council
thanks for all the messages of support for those who havent yet decided another plug for vote match  though i urge you to support me so i can continue to spend many hours a week writing up your proposals and publishing meeting minutes etc
you say the ui will not be completely overhauled and i agree but noone can deny that its not perfect what would be your stance on an eve ui version of the recent one hundred papercuts approach that canonical used for ubuntuusers submitted tickets marked as one hundred papercuts detailing the small annoyances that existed and canonical worked on fixing them for the next release
x3 for teadaze
bump for one of the at7 comentators that knew his stuff did not see your app for csm untill now good chances ill end up voting for your mynxee  havent seen mynxees platform but how much can it suck  
i was going to squeeze you with some tricky questions like last election but thats not needed imo you did great during this csm3 for tea fake editwith stakeholder status which issues will you try to unburrow from the depths of the backlog the most
short term this could address the most pressing issues but at some point ccp will have to bite the bullet and commit to a full overhaul of the core ui if we are lucky they might be able to come up with a roadmap of building replacement ui elements in stages and effectively phase in a new ui over timeonly ccp can decide when to commit to this but until then i am willing to support and have already supported proposals related to ui improvementswhilst on the hot button issues i also support and csm4 already discussed it at length with ccp at the summit issues relating to lag reductionno candidate is going to deny that lag isnt an issue for many people however the fact is the csm cant fix lag the csm can keep pressure on ccp to investigate solutions but only they can deliver a working solution anyone outside of the ccp dev team doesnt have the knowledge to design a fix and whilst ideas seem obvious on paper they have likely been discussed alreadyi am restricted by what i can discuss on the subject because we had a detailed presentation before the lag discussion at the level of showing various performance numbers and im not going to risk leaking nda information of course this allows people to claim im ignoring the issue anyway thanks again to my supporters and i hope some of the potential supporters can see my commitment to the csm process

is there a  in soonme looks for the  in soon
having given it a lot of thought  you guys have my support hope to see you up there kicking butt
tnx aralis d
i herby call into question the voting for the cms 5 my application was submitted well in time and my credntials were sent as asked for yet my name in not included in the vote why not is it because the same ole same ole group of people dont want to share there were numrous questions and statements from players in the forum that there was no point in running since it was either a allready a done deal with the same people running things and or b it didnt matter anyway since ccp simply used the csm as a smoke screen and or ignored them totally is it because i rocked the boat by asking questions in the forum that no one would answer escpecially csm i asked repeatedly if application was accepted and was repeatedly ignored now without any preamble there is a vote with no debate no notice no nothing one little msg when you sign on that says vote but for what why should they when you have gone out of your way to make csm and the entire process hard to find and follow so once again the majority will be trampled by the minority and given no choice in how the game is played i wonder if anyone looked into the board of ccp if they would see  cheney and bush running the show this is their style of politics frankly i never even dreamed anyone but myself would vote for me in the first place but to not even have my name listed is the lowest form of censourship there is and after reading and particapating in the forums it ptoves the contemp the old school csm and ccp has for anything or anyone new and the players of eve in general their motto should be just give us your money to play the game and shut the hell up we could care less what you thinkfly safely fly freeelf lord
actualli i voted for you with all 5 of my accounts  wish you the best of luck t
just voted with both of my accountsgood luck tamber
to get some people voting that normally wouldnt tears and a balance to the alliance powerblock votingfunnily enough im pretty sure that most of the people that will vote for me would have anyway and i dont think there will be that many extra votes from this experiment which of course wouldnt matter because everyone will think my votes were all bought anyway hopefully though we get some people to vote who normally wouldnttamber
bah thats good enough for me ill be casting my vote and sending a single isk later today
shes not proving anything just buying votes
voting for a fellow kiwi and because i seriously 3 this mega linkage
avalloc saved my pregnant cat from a burning building when he had no unbroken limbs using nothing but his teethhe also gave me 5 dollarsit was a good day
i am sure that the issue has been brought a number of times before but i wonder about your comment over the issuei am talking about the amount of armor shield energy logistics have contributed to the battle if the amount is recorded into the kill mails somehow then many players would enjoy flying logistics and this would result in much longer lasting and satisfying battlesthis could basically be done by adding the player to the kill mail if he has repped a player who had aggro on the targetdamage dealers in the km same thing seems to work when repping someone in empire  then the repper gets aggro toohealing or armorshield rep as it is known in eve and buffing or warfare bonuses are very old and well known concept in most of the mmorpg worlda wise developer would make people comfortable playing healers since this makes the game much more deeper and interesting for everybodyplaying healing character is not that rewarding in most of the games compared to the damage dealers but in eve it is even worst virtually you get no record for your contribution to the battle
i would support any proposal to give healers in eve some recognition for their efforts however i cant think of a reasonable way of doing it which wouldnt or couldnt result in killmail whoring if you showed up on killmails for repping the guys who killed the target you would only have to pulse your reps once on the big damage dealers to show up and if you showed up on the lossmail itd be a welp situation since you obviously didnt heal the guy enoughagain i wouldnt reject either of these in hopes ccp could come up with a solution that works the key here is creating a proposal which states that the playerbase wishes for repping to have some static proof of participation in eve and let the devs sort out the howin nearly every mmo ive played i have personally played the healer role i have many fond memories of epic battles in everquest with my cleric and also in wow with my priest thank you for taking the time to ask this question xdiakonu
thanks guys 
edited the op with additional interviews and links check out the website its chock full of content
that is called using your brain they are better candidates so is mynxee
its because of people like this im still playing this gameyouve got my vote
thanks for the support guys
methinks you need a little more on your agenda to be more convincing ill probably vote for you though at least you sound somewhat realistic unlike the other guys
elorie liorden i understand what your saying ironically it is also the reason i do not have a lot of issues presented the point of the csm is to put forward the players problems and fixes to ccp the csm is not a place to promote the candidates personal vision and ignore everything else not that i dont have my own ax to grind i really really hate the font i will be a major thorn in the side of ccp about that issue if i do get elected that being said it is a topic that would benefit all players and not one grouptype unless there is someone out there that likes having a font that is illegible i could throw up a lot of fluff but it would serve no purpose perspective and attitude are the only thing that matters for those who have served on the csm before they get the added benefit of a record showing action as well all the chatter is mostly chaff so i just put the wheat up there to save everyone time me includedi do thank you for your vote though good luck and fly safe
bump and another vote

you got my 2 mate  now you owe me 4 beers
hiwhat is your take on ankhesentapemkahs policy of pushing ccp to increase the penalties associated to pvp in highsecare there not enough already sec status loss poor returns time etc etcis it not reasonable to think that if one pays attention and has a modicum of intelleigence one can avoid hisec suicide ganks and the likeis it not reasonable to also conclude that if one falls victim to something like this it is nearly always ones own fault ie stupidity laziness drunkenessganked afk autopiloted freighter carrying 50bill isk  natural selection imho
if you carry valuable stuff in empire you should never auto pilot through empire and if you do you accept the risk of being ganked by pirates theres no need to increase penalties in such way however i would like to see suicide ganking in hisec made less attractive by having insurance pay out be decreased in case concord is involvedbut pirates need to get something in return in a fair way and therefor lowsec should become more attractive to be in for miners missioners industrialists and piratescurrently 00 is more safe than empire

i highly doubt her physical appearance holds any bearing to her abilities as a csm candidate grow upanyone posting negative remarks to anyones appearance should have the courage and be obligated to provide a linked picture of themselves on their posts otherwise us more sensible people will likely think you are preaching in the wrong direction which is when wed direct you to turn around look straight into the mirror and repeatget it nowglad we had this talk
double standard they wouldnt be doing it if ankh was a guy not that i approve of anything ankh says or does here but acting that childish is just making the people with legitimate complaints look bad

i have not recieved any mail i would really like to have my interview includedissler
only two csms mentioned industry in their bio one was goon so i voted for the other candidatealso too many candidates especially without good description
if there are not enough people supporting an aspect of eve that you want supported like industry then you should have ran for csm yourself as for there being too many people running for csm you would still be complaining if there were only a few people running enlighten us with the magic number which is how many people should be running
100
yea because everyone wants to go to iceland
i think industry wasnt a big factor into csm all i saw was balanced candidates and that was to the notion of fighting despite what people may think you can not have war without indy guns are nice and fighting is awesome but tip your hat to the carebear who helps to supply you with them
moved from general discussion as this is a topic about the csm
i like 11but as they say the more the merriervote for wulfnor he has no bio description at all
i think that some believe that industry is getting a good boost with pi in tyrannis however you are correct that those ships and guns would not exist if someone hadnt built themi would encourage you to view my platform which is geared toward improving the little things in eve that affect everyone daily gameplay make it more efficientcheck out my website with full bio faq and forums with approved and suggested ideas as belowcinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom
no decent description or no website  laziness  no vote id say
good man
i dont do much industry then again i am currently sitting in a station in 00 with 150 ships in the hanger and all but 10 or so i built myself my industrial method is finding players that like industry giving them the tools and when they understand everything they tell me the best way to do things that being said if your industry candidate does not get elected that does not mean your issues will not get presented the job of the csm is to find issues and bring them to ccp that is all the issues not just from one area of the game use the assembly hall that is what it is there forfly safe

absolutely even basic things are not fixed such as the post limit which they would get rid of that and being logged out when you try to post and that sort of stuff
ccp reps have said that forum upgrade should be happening following the release of evegate
this is a good point and has been clamored about for literally years now however ccp is already on this trail and has been prodded in the past about it with limited success evegate is the next step in this evolution and as mentioned by avalloc the forums are already on the assembly line immediately thereafter nothing any csm delegate will do can improve this any further so dont be fooled with promises of things already in motionsame goes for fix teh lag and answer my petitions nowi invite you to check out my campaign faq in which these and other questions are answered at my website belowcinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom
the forum timer is a prime example of how serious you can take thisif you go and replace every other ccp promised to look into this with a ccp promised to continue to postpone this in the meeting minutes you are much closer to realityexpectation management on ccps side was an issue in the meeting minutes of the summit in iceland the csm should go ahead and demonstrate what they ask of ccp and clearly state that none of this more than sweet talk unless there is something that suggests ccp is actually working on the issue like assigning it to a specific releasefurthermore i find the lack of follow ups disturbinga recap and summary of the issues from the last meetings should be part of every meetingright now it mostly feels like a fireandforget approach which is not the most effective way imo it suggests a lack of consistency and gives the appearance of talking about issues that are interestingpressingcool now but not caring about them later even if thats not the case
do any of the candidates have any thoughts on anchoringunanchoring times on pos modules such as reactors silos and moon harvester 20 minutes a piece to unanchor is simply bogusi hear certain timers were already addressed by ccp recently and were still left with this lolmazzilliu plans to fix poss anyone know if these timers are part of this potential fix
pos unanchoring sucksjust as pos anchoring sucksthat is why lately i like simply blowing up pos mods of redssaves them the time saves us the timewin  winseems the simple answer no
lol yes simple indeed though if youre the ones anchoringhaving to modify your pos setupsits a huge annoyance poss arent involved in sov warfare anymore so i honestly dont see why completing such tasks should be so time consuming causing the player to enjoy the game much less during those hours spent
did the vote match thingy and fatmarrow came out on top for me since you also seem like a smart guy youll get my vote

i like your ideas  suicide ganking should really be suicidal no seventy virgins for the ganker just oblivionthe problem with these socalled intended gamemechanics is that all yall keep massively abusing them and then ccp has to nerf them lets make a mwd ccp thought and then folks began to fit multiple instances getting up to ridiculous speeds so ccp had to rein in your abusive behavior same with shieldmods bcus etc in general the whole stacking penalty system had to be introduced because people always seek to push the envelope of intended game mechanics i think its pretty sleasy but maybe its just human naturesame with suicide ganking ccp makes you pay a security penalty for doing so and instead of doing it less you find inventive ways around it like creating disposable destroyer pilots this is your nature so be it but fact also is that every time you abuse an intended gamemechanic ccp will have to nerf you because fair use to most constitutes finding the absolute limit of where abusing a mechanic become absolute illegal and then operating just 1 notch under that and yelling intended gamemechanicsso i say its time ccp finally bring down the hammer on suicide ganking not saying it should be disallowed but they should stop allowing you to be abuse the system to get past the imposed penalties which is to say at the very least 0 insurance payout when shot down by concord and banning people who use disposable accounts to avoid taking sec damage hits
fair enough  rl insurance doesnt pay out if you use your own car for a ramraid

i dont like the idea of a fast brutix or astartethe reason for this basically has to do with overlap into the realm of cruisers if you make the brutix fast then you can achieve cruiser speedagility with bc type hit points even if its low bc type hit points dont get me wrong you can already and that is a problem if the thorax isnt going to have a range advantage on the brutix then the brutix and astarte need to be slowthe core concern for a battlecuiser is being a heavy cruiser and so the speed of the astarte and brutix are only really necessary so long as they can catch bcs and they pretty much can already the problem with the brutix is that it is simply not hardy enough compared to the other bcs
support for sexyness
10 is too much 9 is a much better figure also the rep amount bonus needs to be changed to rep amount and remote rep recieved
agreed a brutix shouldnt have cruiser agilityspeedblaster boats have more lows than meds sounds fair but you need speed and agility to be efficient with blaster boats so its preferable to havea passive shield tank not enough meds considering scram  web is quite compulsoryan active armor tanking the rigs screw your speed and cap injector is neededcould we leave blasters in their current form and balance blasters ships slot layout  bonuses active armor bonus  armor rig downsides decreasing the mass of these ships would be nice too but might be too difficult to implement without creating nanooverpowered boats
yes balance the blaster boats themselves first they should be very fast maybe even the fastest ships in their class but only in a straight line give them a lot of inertia or something so they can charge at enemy ships at very high speed but cannot turn very tightly this will mean that minnie ships retain their racial feel of very high agility and speed
think on this buttercup caldari wont hasve to gimp their tank to put nanos and overdrives in the lows to get their speed up also still able to put mwdab tackling mods and a respectable tank in their large midslot layout as for tracking clicking aproach or keep at range virtually cancles out tracking issues therefore buffing blasters is a stealth buff for caldari not gallente
omg i havent read such stupidity in a long timecan put nanos and overdrives in to the lows realyo come on 12 lows just go to reactor controls and it have left with 23 for magstabs not nanooverdriveslarge midslot layouto where you need 1 mwd 2 tackler gear 1 cap booster and you left with 1 med slotany blaster boost wouldnt make caldari hybrid boats op with blaster fitsif you realy think caldari blaster ships are that awesome then bring out your blaster fitted eagle for a tripi bet you never have flown any caldari ships
except names are chosen before you even exist within the game world so that doesnt even fit within that contextalso why are people using the argument scammers must live with their actions with a name change based on those restrictions they are we know who they are and what theyve done because we can see their old name still one addition i can think of is that names cannot be changed for people with low security status or thos with high roles within a corporation as to how thatd work well ill leave that to professional designers or players with greater knowledge but itd be easy to create some lorebackstory to support this

tldr but kinda read some of itfirst off i think the argument that it makes the haves better and the have nots have less is completely pointless but also completely trueomg the older players do more damage then the younger players well now thats not fair seriously stfu if someone wants to train to t2 weapons it should give them an advantage just liked someone training recon to 5 not to 4 t2 and in tech 2 should be more advanced than tech 1 faction should be more advanced than tech 2 reasoning is pretty obvious tech one being basic tech should never equal tech 2 lets call that cutting edge and faction is what the military or navy would use assuming that they usually bankroll the big research companies and develop most of the tech you would assume their guns would be t2 more as they are advancing the cutting edge tech officerdeadspace stuff is would be prototype gear stuff that is rare and in small quantity compared to their faction and t2 counterpartswith that said ammo should stack up as such imo t1worst factiont2militart best factionconsidering t1 is then readily available to everyone and has limited experience required making shells in your garage worst faction would be more expensive and a lil bit better like last years model t2 would be cutting edge distributed ammo it costs you a pretty penny but its basically what the military uses military grade ammo would be slightly better than t2 assuming the military made slight modifications and changes to it for their use best faction would be spec ops style ammo made in special shops precise recipes with hard ingredients super costly but does the job better than anything else now consider t2 is the best cutting edge ammo released by the states for mass production if it was a  product that all in all punished the user noone would use it and someone would come out with something better and release it for mass distribution ok so back to the age argumentwhy shouldnt older players have the advantage lets reword thiswhy shouldnt players that choose to train certain skills further or more extensively not get rewarded when compared to players who didnt train those skills if someone wants to train to t2 guns and ammo and then fights someone who didnt want to train to those should he not have the advantage shouldnt the t2 ship be quiet superior to the t1 basic ship and slightly superior to the best named as well as being much more cost effective ship so we assume t2 ammo only works in t2 guns cause the guns are able to handle special ammos that might not be stable in t1 guns or might need special primers or firing triggers that arent in the t1 model wouldnt you then also assume that these modified slugsrounds must also have a decent added benefit to firing them if they are higher tech then similar lower tech rounds the description of hail ammo the hail is an attempt to combine the penetration of titanium sabot with the versatility of a depleted uranium shell it consists of a fairly large titanium sabot shell with a payload of depleted uranium submunitions it has tremendous damage potential but should not be used at long ranges any pilot using this ammunition should be prepared to trade optimal range and capacitor energy for increased tracking speed and a devastating amount of damageit is both tit sabot and depeleted uranium 2 tech 1 ammosshouldnt be fired at long range and drains capacitor assuming its to do something to the ammoin exchange should get increased tracking and devastating damagesounds fair but the tracking is a penalty in gamehail  50 optimal penalty 50 falloff penalty 50 tracking penalty 5 increased cap recharge
quake descriptiona large titanium sabot shell that delivers a shattering blow to the target it is however nearly twice as bulky as standard ammunition and has a somewhat slower rate of fire the tremendous recoil generated by this shell means that the ships velocity must be substantially curbed and a small portion of the ships capacitor energy redirected to manuvering thrusters for stabilityso in exchange for a heavy slug the pilotless shots in the gun slower fire rate slower speedin exchange more damage  with the description should be alot more damage also if the ship is slower and more stable tracking should be increased just a thoughtconflagthe conflagration is a supercharged xray crystal created by carthum conglomerate for the imperial navy has much greater damage potential than the standard version but needs considerably more capacitor and also has reduced effective rangebetter magnification on crystal means hotter stronger beam but pilot losestracking and optimal go out the window and it costs a bunch more power to fire through but you get lots more damage really dont see how tracking is effected by the crystal thogleamthe gleam overdrive crystal has tremendous damage capacity but needs substantially more energy than normal and its energy signature is very easy to lock onto it also requires the ships shields to be strengthened around the turret to prevent critical backlasheswell pilot losescapacitor and signatur is huge but more damage and shields should be strengthenedbut according to bonuss shields are weakened interesting so either shields are specifically strengthened around the turrets only at which point they could probably over heat for longer or the ships shields as a whole are increased at cost of capacitor javelinthe javelin charge consists of a cluster of iridium fletchets with a graviton pulse detonator this allows for much higher damage than can be achieved by a standard rail system however the inherent entropy of graviton pulses means that it is very hard to maintain accuracy at long rangeaccording to the description pilot loses accuracy optimal and tracking in exchange for much more damage but they get hammered with a speed penalty whyfinally voidthe void xenon charge is a highpowered blaster charge that delivers an extremely powerful blast of kinetic energy however it has several serious drawbacks most notably the fact that it requires considerably more capacitor energy than any other blaster charge it also needs to maintain a clean aim for a slightly longer time than normalpilot gets a lot of damage at the cost of rate of fire and more capacitor use what do i think bonuss should be according to description imot2 ammos should be as such imoclose range gun close range ammo reduced range damage bonus tracking bonuslong range ammo range bonus2 damage penaltyrof accuracy penaltylong range gunclose range ammo reduces range increases damage2 reduced speedlong range ammo  increased range reduced damage increased trackingessentially what you get is ammo that is meant for the guns purpose does it well while the other ammo that is opposite compensates for the lacking but doesnt do well to compete with its competitor in the other classclose range ammo for long range gun gets a bonus to damage at close range cause well makes sense a large bonus if its doing decent damage at long distance if you get hit by it at close range damn it should hurt but those guns turn slowlong range ammo  short range gun ammos designed to make up for the guns inherent flaws in distance fighting but in such sacrifices damage rofin the end the ammo types for the specific guns should be unparalleled in their niche close range to close range and long range to long range and make up for the slack in the weaknesses by sacrificing its strengths when it comes to long range to close range and vice versa

tell ur freinds and corpies to support its not a  major issue but it small fixes make a huge difference
this is my first post when i found out about this bein for consoles only i was shocked b4 i knew this i was so fired up to play this then all came crashing down  but i say what the hell let console and pc come together in the gaming world let us join as 1 and have a good time yes pc players will have the upper hand but wouldnt that mean console players would get better in time  anyway enuff of that i think it should be on pc would be a great shame if it wasnt pleaseeeee let the 2 worlds come together as one pleaseeeee
talking about aimbots and hacks in an fps mmo is ridiculous an aaa title will sort that out over time and ban those users its much less relevant than it is with games like mw2 so the fact that the pc is more accessible for hackers is irrelevant
supporting the op
i too would like to see this game on the pci currently does not own a console and is not planning on buying one unless they start supporting mouse and keyboard as an alternative way of interaction i fail to see why this has not happened already  simply let players choose between the two if original console players think mousekeyboard is an unfair advantage they may choose to switch as well any fancy ideas as to why this has not yet happened

youre missing it invention wasnt supposed to replace bpos it was supposed to turn ridiculously high profits into moderate ones it has succeeded in this beyond anyones greatest expectations and actually gone further turning ridiculously high profits into belowaverage ones in most casest2 bpos are about 5th or 6th on the list of things that make the most money in this game suggest you try the first fivethe lottery was unfair but those cheques have been cashed now you are left with people who paid good isk for items that removing would be fundamentally less fair than continuing to allow new players a goal to strive towards every inventor can easily replace the output of multiple bpos there are over 10000 t2 bpos there are tens of thousands of inventors inventors keep inventors out of the market by working to lower and lower margins as they continually become more efficient at italchemy didnt at all address rare moons in the way t2 bpos have already been addressed though invention alchemy moons can be attacked just like rare moons bpos can remain safe just like invention on the other hand any t2 bpo owner who needs to come close to making a return within a decade needs to use a pos array making them vulnerable to attack and also reducing the efficiency of their bpo to worse than the me1 possible with invention for a lower investmentthe market is already functioning properly its just that you do not want to pay what others have for the same thing you would rather kick over their sandcastle than spend time building onei have a hemorphite mining crystal ii bpo i bought it many years ago and have not built off it for several years as they currently sell for 75 of the bpo build cost and sadly do not refine to their component parts i would stand to gain heavily though removal of t2 bpos because i have quite a stock in fact i could solo supply the market for this item for many years and without other bpos out there i would make much more isk than owning the bpo or selling it would ever makeremoval of bpos wouldnt gain anything for people who do not have one not a single isk invention profit is the least amount of isk people are willing to accept and no more you see this when every time a new item is introduced the market floods with inventors and then dissipates as profits evaporate in increasingly small time framesthe problem is simply a psychological one someone else has something they worked hard for it you do not want to do the same so they shouldnt have it either even though you gain no benefit at all in the destruction of their hard work
i have one t2 bpo which actually never fills any slot because its not worth building off meanwhile i fill 5060 production slots at all times and could potentially fill 30 more if i honestly wanted to spend the rl timevery few people who have t2 bpos have enough to fill all their production slots there are more people with t2 bpos that make no isk at all than there are people with more than a handful of themmost t2 bpos are less profitable occupying a slot than occupying that same slot with invented bpcs or something t1 only the very few make reasonable profits and those sell for the profit they would otherwise make in the better part of a decadei have done this with my t2 bpo because you actually lose money to build off it selling a bpc for anything is better than thati dont know of any t2 bpos that are only going for 3 years profit most are 710 years of continuous building at a pos array honestly do you think there is any difference between retaining bpos and converting them into 10 years worth of bpcs your advantage is only going to come after 10 years if it was one really big bpc and you will shoot invention in the foot if you convert them into multiple bpcs which allow people to do their production in parallelthere actually isnt a limit at all as long as the profit you are making exceeds the cost of buying gtcs you can have infinite slots going this is why invention profits for casual inventors dont look super great theyre competing against people that only need to make about 13000 iskhr per slot to break even anything about that is profitno they wouldnt the effective level of t2 bpos is less than 1 me as they need to be built at rapid facilities to generate the amount of isk for even 510 year break even points invention which is low risk low investment would be better than the bpos not to mention there would be less profit in invention because it would be easier so what you are saying is that t2 bpos are overpriced and not worth how much people pay for them isnt that an argument for boosting them if theyre not worth it then surely the cant be overpowered given the disparity being argued is one of cost and not utility since the end product is the same
qft
less competition  higher prices no
t2 bpos should go in some way because they corner the markethow much they corner the market depends on the volume tradedfor products where t2 bpo owners can cover 5 invention will cover 95butif demand is at a point where t2 bpo owners can cover 95 of the market invention while dictating the price can only ever cover the remaining 5there is no way any non t2 bpo owner the inventor can push out a t2 owner not by doing it better not by making better deals with mineral suppliers not by investing more time its just not going to happenfor a dynamic market this is what you would want and t2 makes the market less dynamic hence a bad thingits long overdue that the market dinosaurs hit their extinction
nope works fine as it is a lot of t2 stuff is expensive enough already we dont need prices higher
if anything as mentioned before boost invention taking away t2 bpos would raise the price of t2 items and thats exactly what ccp tried to bring down after the moon exploit scandal with alchemy not supported
it may seem frustrating that afk cloakers can disrupt operations in a system just by being logged in but its another game mechanism that encourages cooperative play  a lone bomberrecon would struggle to take down 3 pilots who are running anomolies together before being popped themselves where one ship on their own would be a juicy targetnot supported
jita i will say that i dont support this the way that youve proposed i do share your sentiments here as a vast majority of 00 players do tbh btw most of these 00 players could care less about the forums so you wont see their voice so strongly here ive talked with dozens of players and honed down a multilevel set of suggestions to adjust this 23hr cloaky potentially afk phantomplease read it here
remove local firstthen probes against cloaked ships make sense
i find it sad that people keep suggesting a nerf to claked ships without suggesting any way they can be buffed in compensationall the suggestions on way to fix the afk cloaker problem hurt people that are not afk as well what the op suggests will hurt anyone in a cloaked ship that is probing themselves and negates the covops class of ships why train for cloaks at all if you can be probed down i find it silly to do because a few people are to afraid of someone that is not at their computerthere are only 2 ways i would support this1 make the prereqs for cloaked scanning be every skill in game trained to 52ships with cloaks are invulnerable to everythingboth sound silly but so does probing down ships designed to not be probed down people should fly a covops before making these types of posts
i have been looking at various threads dealing with gankinggriefingetc and possible solutionsimprovements some seemed promising some seemed like buckets of tears from people who got ganked others seemed to be just unworkable and unpopularlet me start by stating i dont have a horse in this race i havent been griefed ganked or abused i dont gank grief etc this is just an idea i had and wanted to see what would come from some informed discussion i make no claims to all the knowledge and experience required to know if this is workable that is why i am putting it up for inputproposal any hisec attack that does damage and triggers a concord response to a player will result in the attacking players pod being tractored into a concord ship and taken to the nearest station and thrown in eve jailthis is not a banthe players pod is in a hanger with limited access to player gui player may send and receive mail que any skills currently injected chat in all chatsplayer may not clone jump or access any items36 hours for 1st offense72 hours for 2nd offense within 30 days of first offense96 hours for 3rd and all subsequent offenses30 days with no offenses resets the clockany other characters in that account may be accessed during this periodpersonally i would give the inmate access to a way to write graphitti on the walls of his cell hanger for the next schlub that gets locked up to readtyrannis is fixing insurance so no need to void that for attacksbanning is just meh in my book unless it is an actual hacketccharging real moneyone proposal to griefers is just wayyy out therei can see why some like to go after macrominers and other afkers but the current system also allows large gangs to suicide gank mission runners as they undock along with other gang related suicides if every player in that gang got tossed in the brig then we may have the ganking go back to more 1v1 antimacro gankingthis idea changes no other mechanic it just makes for more of a decision on the part of the gankersdo the crime do the time is that ship full of bpcs worth it if yes then fire awaythe largest impact i can see on legal players is to the niche group that sits near known suiciders to kill their pods after concord kills their ships no more of that if the pod is in custody of the copsi would welcome informed and sane debate and discussion flames and replies like go play hello kitty will not impress anyone like i said i dont have a dog in this hunt its just an idea and i couldnt care less if it is implemented or not
wutgankinggriefingetc is working as intended as stated by ccpi could see no insurance working but anything limiting peoples ability to play the game is a bad idea all further gankingetc would be dependant on people having specialized alts and the time loss probly wouldnt mean much once people who already gank had time to compensate for the change
not supported thumbsdown
yea nothis would make suicide ganking a completely pointless thing which would mean removing something good form the game
which is why i wholeheartedly endorse his proposal 
not supported learn how to haul without dying
i think that suicide ganking is a very important game mechanic and should not be nerfed ive never suicide ganked but it would surely make hauling through high sec even more boringwhy do you think that it needs to be nerfed and punished with one of the hardest game mechanic punishments that you can think of there will be thousands of players hating this mechanic what is the gain for eve online remember that it is supposed to be a dark harsh universe
i am confused as to why you are trying to destroy a feature of the game in which the ccp devs put in by designwanting to ban players guess what a temporary ban is still a ban for doing something that the developers of eve encourage borders on lunacy
p this is a must to have btw those suice gankers should try to learn to play with risks tooyou want that loot you can get it but with consequenceswannabe pirates always want easy kills
not supported  the attacker already has to wait out the 15 minute gcc timerall that needs to change is that the attacker doesnt get any insurance payout
 this already in placei just vote that the aggression timer be extended per attack by 15 extra minutes or a multiple of their negative security status whichever is greater to keep them bottled up in a station for a little longer after each attack andor provide concord with remote logistics support to the stricken vessel boosting their shields by as much as theyre dpsing the criminaland perhaps an agesp limit on any attempt to suicide in highsec to lower the number of disposable alts used for such attacks
you must have gotten lost on your way to hello kitty online forumsill support it with the following for great realism concord takes about 10 minutes to respond on average concord can be killed concord can be tanked avoiding concord is no longer a bannable offense
this is stupid
supported with one addition which i think will work against macro if pilot who lost the ship reports incident during next 5 minutesit is logical to end up in jail if police got youi think developers support suicide ganking moslty as a tool against macrominers
i say yes if the victim elects to it within say 15 minutesthat and shave the times down severelymy suggestions just off the top of my head with little real thought this makes it an inconvenience but not a crippler like your original suggestions note of course that this wont happen unless the victim elects it so not being a dbag etc can prevent itthe players pod is in a hanger with full access to player gui player may not undock excepting pods special purpose ships like the zephyr newbie frigates etcplayer may clone jump or whatever but the undock restriction follows them note that they may enter a ship from a pod once undocked say ejected by a fiend but once docked the same restriction continues to apply10 minutes for 1st offense20 minutes for 2nd offense within 1 days of first offense30 minutes for 3rd and all subsequent offenses continued attacks beyond this begin to sap skill points think about it you are overstressing your clone by transferring out before concord can step in and do something of actual impact to you3 days with no offenses resets the clockany other characters in that account may be accessed as normal during this period

good idea do want
ecm change  good
so a larger ship will have less chance but more downsides to being jammed and a smaller ship will more often be jammed but reaquire lock fasteri like it
sounds good to me
stupid idea another matar boost as those have the fastest lock  sensor booster gets even better that 1 module would be too good vs both damping and ecm alpha strike ships would be less effected thats another matar arty boost againthis could only work if you remove raciality of ecmschange sensor strenght according to scan resolutionslike lower matars sensor strenghth by 3040and still little frigs would be too resistant vs ecm
sensor booster is already good vs both damps and jams in the manner that the faster you can lock people after a jam cycle the more rrdps can you lay down its just to a lesser extent some people even now fit sensor boosters instead of eccm because of this since once you get jammed you cant do anything so you want to lock people back up asapthe fact that matari has good lock times has nothing to do with this theyre also more vulnerable to jamming since they tend to have a lower sensor strenght thus would be more affected by this and would have to gain lock more often id say that would be pretty balancedfrigs will be able to lock faster as they already do however this would mean that frigs have to be on toe and actually focus on the tackling bit if they dont theyll not be able to make use of their native high scan resolution also since frigs generally has very low sensor strength whos to say they will keep lock for more than 510 sec at any given time all you need is for them to lose lock once it would also mean they can do their job of getting initial tackle then let it go when a bigger more powerful ship take over then it can move on to the next target and work on holding that downall this should balance itself out quite nicely as is ecm is a bit too strong as it locks you down for an extended period of time as a sidenote mixing damps with jams would be more appropriate since the effect of a damp would more often come into place this because the process of locking would occur more often this in turn might give someone a reason to field the beloved eos okok i know the eos sucks i was just making a joke im biased obviously but i really believe this is a system that would make a more challenging and better ecm combat experience both from the people doing the jamming and the people walking out to buy a new keyboard after sitting jammed until they can out of cap boosters and died edit regarding artillery boostif youre fighting artillery ships and youre inside jamming range you better be moving really really fast or hug them in any case artillery already have a cycle time of roughly 20 sec so if anything youre doing them a favour by jamming them keeps them fresh on toe as they have to work every time they fire guns instead of letting them go num and bored tripping while waiting for the long word for a part of your body you sit on cycle time and yes i fly artillery ships wouldnt buff them in any way due to the nature of the long cycle times in the first place
just look at sniper hurricanes 9001000 scan res 82sec rof even if it gets jammed each 5 sec it would still be able to fire its gunsthis change would completly make those invulnerable vs ecmssee it would be another matar boostanyway currently ecm ships only jamms tacklers if they want to disengage which happens when they are outblobbedthis change would only help the blobsi realy cant see how this change would be any good
its not a boost to matari alone all cruiser sized guns have a short rof this would enable everyone to get more shots off when youre talking bss its actually more of a buff to everyone else as they have much shorter rof than matari has matari remains more or less unchangedeverything you do will to some degree favor the blob theres really nothing you can do against greater numbers other than outplay them by being smart or fitting better look at it this way you have ten people the blob has thirty amongst those thirty are there 3 falcons 2 blackbirds and 2 scorpions this is not totally unrealistic now with the combined jams they have as the game stands currently they can shut your entire gang down completely and kill every single last one of you without you getting off one shot this means itll have to be a worst case scenario but it can happenmaking it so jams dont shut your targeting system off for an extended period of time will in most cases favor the side with the least numbers of pilots now if you say that jams are changed and you can get lock again lets say your gang of 10 has 6 hacs 2 logis and 2 recons the hostile gang has the mentioned ewar add 6 bs 6 bcs and some mixed tackle now you actually stand a chance of fighting them by getting lock on their tackle and kill them your logis can regain lock they have high scan res too you know and save you when youre primary with the tackle down you can safely move off and start picking them off one by one or leave at willif you think a little instead of just automaticly saying that blobs win because of this youll come to see that its not always the blob that benefits from changes
i think you are understating the effect it has against few targets but then that prevents it from sounding like a whine i should know i do quite a lot of whining on this topic  so i guess that is a good thingi do need some clarificationdo you want the sensorstrength ratio to remain the same ie one jammer knocking out a frigate hull almost permanentlyone module can jam one ship at a time or multiple the section comparing it to ecm burst is not cleardo you want it to keep its chance based naturewhat do you want to do with eccm if this is done sebos will be just as good on bshave you thought about what to do with ecm dronesi would propose a change to eccm to go with this lockbreaker mechaniceach eccm allows you to designate one autotarget similar to tagging on overview when jam is lifted the ship immediately begins reacquiring said targetsprovides a tangible benefit to fitting eccm by giving you a head start and reduces the clickfest that lockbreaking brings to the table would also address my own pet peeve that of light ships being jammed by practically anything with an ecm modulenaomi the threat of the alpha will always be present it is what it does alpha specialised ships will lock faster than an ecm boat anyway so the first volley will land regardless of a successful jamwhat i see it means is that ecm will no longer be the ultimate ewar in a conflict as it adds tremendous value to dampening and tds  the artillery hurricane for instance for all its power has a very narrow lockrangeweaponrange envelope to work with reducing either will make it just another ship waiting to be disposed ofthat said changing ecm system to include scan resolution for relock does warrant a look at the various ships statistics and tweaking the ones that might breakthesystem
good ideaallso boost eccm and take the ecm drones into line there so overpowered 
it shouldnt disrupt a frigate permanently no however it should make it hard for the frig to keep a lock at all times if you manage to disrupt it once every 5 second or so it should be fine just make the frigate work for it then again its still chance based so you might miss for 60 seconds just like todayas said i want to keep the chance based nature with the formula of sensor strength ratiosfor the eccm i believe it should still be just sensor strenght if you change the ratio in the formula to calculate it it may be much harder to get a jam so that the eccm is more beneficial to fit than a sensor booster alternativly they can stay as they are and an eccm makes more sense on a smaller ship like a cruiserfrigate hull while a senosr booster is better on something like a battleship this should already balance itself out quite nicely as is i see sensor boosters fitted on interceptors very often when in fact it does very little to nothing for the ship an eccm would benefit it more if ecm would work like proposed edit basicly ships with native high sensor strength can rely on sensor boosters while ships with nativly high scan resolution can rely on eccm the entire eccm issue is hard to address however one might also add a third option of a module that does a slight of both one could even make scripts for it and have a joint module if so the cycle time would need to be rather long to prevent scripting all the time you needed it say 30 sec cycle time this is just theorycrafting however the eccm issue is a bit harder to give a proper workaround to but i believe that keeping them just as they are today would actually be best this would encourage the use of eccm on smaller ships and sensor boosters on bigger ships this in turn would reduce the instalockingalphawtfpwn fits some are afriad of to a certain degree one would need eccm over scan resolution on gatecamping artycanes just in case or a mix of both this is a matter that needs more discussing however for a last theorycrafting what the hell idea an eccm module could work as a buffer on your targeting system so to speak it would store the targeting information you have in a backup sensor and youll only lose lock on a certain amount of your locked targets say if you have 6 targets locked you lose lock on 4 of them this can be random so that you can lose lock on the one youre agressing everyone but the person youre agressing or all targets all together basicly if youre flying without an eccm and the ecm boats get a successful hit you lose lock regardless if you fly with an eccm you stand a chance of keeping lock on onemultiple of your locked targets this again would be chance based but the chance would be there to remain lock one at least one target this is completely theory and i expect nothing postive from it just throwing it out there regarding ecm drones i think they should have either the same effect or a very much shortened effect of that wich we have today say a 5 sec cycle per jam this can be validated saying that the drones have a more powerful jamming mechanism since its short range based or something along those lines just as long as they dont stay as powerful as they are todaythe ecm modules itself would work exactly like they do today with one targetmodule sorry if that wasnt clear enough
easy enough to for the extremes but what of all the hulls in between frigates and bs  there are numerous cruisers and some bcs where it is a tossup which will result in sebos being the answer in 100 of cases due to overall usefulness you risk ending up with a system where eccm only has value on frigates with everything else being better off using sebos  that is why i think there has to be a noticeable but limited benefit to fitting eccmwould need to exclude ecm ship itself from the list of potential kept locks or it will be too harsh on them  but then the benefit becomes as intangible as as that of tps worse even if chance basedps pardon me for nagging like i said it is a pet peeve of mine so i have spent a lot of time going through all the permutations  just trying to help you polish a good idea
np i fully admit that making eccm viable in any form is a huge task in its own i agree that the ecm boat needs to get unlocked regardless in case of a successful hit as to the entire eccm module im really unsure what would be best i do believe making them more or less unchanged would end up being best make it so that they are more effective adn theyll see a role lots of work on that part tho
i support this something needs to be done about ecm
i cant support this it would just make ecm useless as it is right now it can indeed turn a battle if you fail to counter it 1 single ship in range will quickly take one down but that is the point that is what its supposed to be able to do ecm does not need a nerf  the other ewar need a boost so that they can be as effective as ecm is now what does need to be changed though is the total shut down effect of ecm getting jammed should not mean sitting there for 20 seconds not being ableto do anything but move id like ecm to be changed to be chance based in an another way it should have x chance still decided by your jam strength vs target sensor strength to jam each individual module that need to be activated on a target that should mean that you are pretty much guaranteed to shut off some of the other guys gunstackleewarrr but at the same time the other guy will almost always have atleast some of his modules still working so he can continue fightingthat change should not change the efficency of ecm much but it allows for adding a stacking penalty to ecm like with other ewar each additional jammer on a target has a lower  chance to jam the remaining unjammed mods and instead of sitting there being bored ecm becomes a fun challenge in the same way that damps and tracking disruptors are you will have to find a way to keep fighting and stay effective with a limited amount of offensive modules remaining and it adds an interesting balance it fitting choices like dedicated tackle ships maybe fitting extra points or something in order to still have backups in case 1 gets jammed
i made this exact proposal a few months back and i still think its a good idea
nice
epic win sir i fully support this proposal
you realize a shorter jam cycle makes an ecm ship more effective the timer being set to 20 secs was considered a nerf to ecm when it was changed from 5 secstheres potential to take many more ships targeting offline in the same time period fit some signal amps to your falcon for more locked targets instead of taking  3  5 ships out of the fight you can cyclejam 9 or more this could bring the scorp back to popularity as weaker jam strength would mean less if you have 4 times more opportunity i always did like the scorp supported
the current way that local chat works as instant intel is destroying pvp especially in 00 as soon as you enter system rattersplexers etc will just run to a ss and cloak upproposalmake the constellation channel instant delay local chat to recent speakers just like in wh space this will stop having to need scouts everywhere constantly scanning looking for blobs etc massive spikes will be seen in the constellation channel carebear pilots will be able to see whos around neighbouring systems but have no idea if their in the same system
its already done in wh and its fine there as it is i wouldnt mind if its only in null sec regions only thoughdepending on how the solar system is built and where the asteroid belts and moons are placed both sides could be at a disadvantage or even advantage here its also been said and writing countless times too
i support this ideaespecially for null sec in low sec it can be good alsoim dr lov3 and im running for csm  vote for me 
local is fine
supporting my own idea
local allows me to solo pvp  aggressed a target and you see local spiking gtfolocal is one of the few ways you can lull the enemy forces into a sense of security to get a small gang fightit seems like the pvp you want to get just involves ganking rattersplexers getting that is not worth nerfing pvp between entities who are looking for actual fights
it is evident that developers trying to find a way to make nulsec more accessible your proposal might work in oposite directionsome ppl avoiding whspace for the way local works intherenot supported
basically
ill assume that ccp rejected your application because your incoherent rantings on the forums indicate that you dont understand this mmowhy would they accept you as a csm candidate if you cant form a coherent argument format your posts into separate paragraphs argue objectively and argue from facts instead of opinions try working on those skills for the next csm electionsjust because your application as a candidate for csm was rejected doesnt mean the election is rigged
ya i saw that but they didnt even have the curtisy to tell me why they rejected my application nor did they allow me to fix what ever problems there were in the application not very democratic is itbut since you are one of the normally chosen few why am i not suprised at your atrtitude good luck in the electionfly freeelf lord
maybe because you have used a character with a name very similar to elvenlord created after he was elected to the csm so giving the impression that it was created only to siphon some vote away from him in the next election
there might have been something wrong with your passport or something bad in your history that required moderation thus disqualifiedalso lrn2paragraph not supported
maybe if you learned to type properly they would have been able to read your application
waitdoes that mean im an eve alister crap that means ill have to sign up for that arrogant ramblings class
its simple because they dont have to tell you plus this rant would have far more content if they had told you
support
ok  it doesnt even work in hangars where it would be reaaaaaally helpful and you expect it to work on killmails
ghm could that mean that in needs to be fixed no way
i fully support this little thing to distinguish bpo  bpc in general more clearly and more especially in killmails as theres definitely a serious difference valuewiseif you value giving priority to little fixes like this vote for cinori aluben my priority is that ccp make these little things a priority as such small items wouldnt require heavy coding time devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization which the csm will have an active part in nowcinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom
as a full time inventor i would not be averse to a slow degradation of decryptors as profit calculations could be taken into account on the invention process i also agree that more uses should be found for the plethora of items recovered from all exploration sites outside of wspace currently they just pile up and collect dust i long ago stopped bothering with anything other than complexes and gravisi am not willing to accept any proposed changes to t2 bpos without some manner of remuneration to those who have gone to the trouble of purchasing them
make a lot of sense when u think about it lets say 100 new players join daily and continue eve past trial and wish to inventnow when over 200 data interface things are created and gotten daily price dropseventually they will be worthless as they are almost never lost
youre being disingenuous when do interfaces ever need to leave stationsexploration is possibly the only area where profit actually does go upwards with decreasing sec like its supposed to for everything so if someones risking lowsec or 00 why not reward them for it im guessing the superhigh prices come from highend faction loot drops from complexes that need multiple people to run plus the disruption of having to safecloak whenever probes show up
the ships that go boom are normally pvp or in worst cases pve fit i dont know about you but i do not go to fight people in an indie full of datacores and decryptors neither do i carry them around in my ishtars cargohold if i have free cargo i put in quafe and exottic dancers but not datacores
this the amounts of isk form 00 exploration come from highend combat plexes and sweet sweet deadspace loot radar sites have nothing to do with those values
supportedanother ccp fail that needs to be fixed
heres an idea id like to put forward for possible examination the ability for users to run active testing while in regular game play for ccp to use when looking for bottlenecks in the systemby activating the test command the following monitoring capabilities would activatea snapshot of active threads andor services loadedsystem output hardware audio  video number of video cards  their ram number of monitors in use and number of clients activecpu capacity  loadram capacity  loadpacket propagationlocations  system number of pilots in the system docked  undocked client input idle time and any other relevant location data ccp would deem useful information of hops to server from client  average latencythis data would be stored entirely client side in an encrypted data file until the endtest command was entered it would then send the compiled file to a ccp storage server for examinationwith as many datapoints as players could provide it would increase the amount of information ccp would have available when looking for bugs or other issues that affect client efficiency
you mean like this
yes but something far less complicated to initialize and that can be turned on or off by the user from within the client easily
this is a good idea that would make ccp more money winwin sometimes i dont log into an account for a few weeks once they expire paying via isk becomes irritating thus getting a heads up is very helpful
yes yesand yessuggestions have been made to have an automated email sent to you an automated evemail sent and a popup in game 48  24hrs before sub ends seriously this is such a little thing and would avoid so much aggravation on the players parts it would also save a lot of gms time giving temp reactivations therefore allowing them to focus on other petitions itd also avoid having peoples subs lapse for a few days at a time figure just 1000 instances of this per month out of the 300k players for just one day  1000days unpaid game time  33 subs  500 us so ccp would actually gain money off this idea tooif you value giving priority to little fixes like this vote for cinori aluben my priority is that ccp make these little things a priority as such small items wouldnt require heavy coding time devoting dev time to them is solely a matter of prioritization which the csm will have an active part in nowcinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom
this aint your im sick of wardec thread if you want it look elsewhereso ever get the feeling of lazyness when you wardec a corp with over 50 people you just want a list of all its members somewhere on your screen  well maybe its too exagerated for a feature but im pretty this would be usefulif you think its too ridiculous cause you have the advantage to know whos in corp well your already in corp anyway with some roaming around checking the killboards google the corp name or some things like that will get you on a beacon somewhere so why not cut that work with 1 easy featurewhen you wardec someone there should be a tab in people  places which would be named wardec and you see all your corporation wardec members would cut lots of intel work for people i know and concentrate on killing them instead
as you said  it is already possible  so if you want that kind of intel work for itit shouldnt be freenot supported
you arte getting that in eve gate you can see members of a corp you can check what corp a pilot is in now logically it should work other way too what pilots are in a corp
damn straight
it will be optional in evegate and i would guess any decent ceo will switch it off
if what people say here about evegate then your screwed time to get your whining lvl 5 active in the forum bud lolbut i was just thinking on how to make neuts spy useless and i was thinking about a fit for my domi so i went on battleclinic for some info and i saw this domi with artiesseems like a good fit but only problem is the bonuses to the shipits not with arties so if ccp could allow players to change bonuses to some extent not any bonus of course then neutral player would become useless in a waythink about it your on a field with all your ships domis megas drakes and all those ships but the bonuses are so different that even if you spy tells you what ship is there on the field your fleet could get own ed in no time probably cause the bonuses can make a huge difference
last i checked eve is dozens or hundreds of real servers  not crappy dell desktops connected to create one universe
do you know what a server is do you have the slightest clue how tranquility is set up
the eve server consists of tens of millions of dollars worth of hardware you do not leave spares of those lying around
name one game that has a 100 redundant server infrastructure for several thousand playersthen explain me how a failing database script has anything to do with a backup server and how redundancy would have solved that
mass persecution noi liked the tournament i liked pls performance and i will not allow some crying er to mouth off and discredit a good performancedeal with cheaters on the side it is just a game and get a ing life
i agree 1in reality though people already wont look at their title the same any more as beforeultimately really ccp is to blame they dont seem to care at all cheating macromining as long as the involved parties are large enough to show up on their revenueradar they turn a blind eye
simple geniusalso it would be nice to know at a glance what meta level an item is maybe make a column in the detailed view for it
im sure there are csm5 applicants that support this other than me but it was okayd already by ccp and so this maybe why its not listed in their agendastamber
yes
i approve of this idea though i suspect it would need to be very carefully planned to maintain balance it could prove especially tricky in that regard
so being a part of the csm is therefore not being employed in a capacity by ccphere is a definition of an employee a person who is hired to provide services to a company on a regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these services as part of an independent business1did ccp create the roles of the csmanswer yes2 did ccp define the roles and requirements that a csm must abide byanswer yes3 did ccp conduct an interview processanswer yes they did they did it through the process of an election to nominate the candidates for the position3 does ccp expect that a csm representative provide them with services on a regular basisanswer yes whilst you are a csm ccp expects that you uphold to your commitments as a csm representative4 does the csm receive compensation for the services that they provideanswer yes what part of free flight hotel stay and free access to the fan fest equals5does the csm provide services as part of an independent businessanswer no as the csm is a designated role created by and organized by ccpalso i would not be surprised if the csm are covered under the iceland equivalent of the ohs act and probably workers compensation if they are injured whilst they attend the fan fest therefore i do not see any problem with any individual putting there role as csm as part of there employment historybrechan
burn the witch
oh please give me proof she is an exploiter and please dont come with a screenie where she has a cloaking device fitted that isnt an exploitand looking at your posts you arent really in any position to talk about anyones mental competencei just agree with most of her points try to deal with it also she isnt lying and twisting facts in case you didnt notice she has been in the csm
try to use your common sense instead of playing semanticsthis topic in the cv tells i have been working for two years for a gaming company as a some kind of junior game designer whateverwhereas it is i was elected along with other players to raise issues from the game i play to developers they offered me a free trip to iceland and they paid me an hotel room oh and i was elected twicewould have been appropriate to put this under pasttimes  associative work lacks honesty and modesty
omg quick call the police no wait get on the bat phone  no no no no hang on  its such a major crime against humanity the world police will get involved oh the humanity  teamamerica will obviously get involved in this one
well put personally im more concerned with the honesty part than the modesty thing cvs are your sales pitch to other companies most everyone will take what they have and make themselves into rocket scientists in some capacity however usually staying within the realm of realityits also worth adding emphasis to the previous guys definition of the word employeea person who is hired to provide services to a company on a regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these services as part of an independent businesseverything after that is just a further description
voted for you with 9 accounts good luck we need more csm members that is willing to look at the game from a different perspective
yes it is and its not wrong to begin with employment history just shows who you worked for paid or unpaid nobody cares
at the risk of annoying potential voters for me i feel i must correct this misunderstanding you have that csm can be classed as employees of ccp6 did the employee of ccp sign an employment contract or receive regular pay chequesanswer no csm delegates only sign a nondisclosure agreement and no payments were made im not sure about icelandic law but over here if you havent signed an employment contract then the only other way you can be classed as being employed by a company is if you have accepted regular payments from that company7 have you seen the nda which the csm are obliged to sign when they take up the role which specifically states they are not employees of ccpanswer apparently not then again i have only seen the contact from csm4 which may be different to those issued for earlier csmwhilst at the csm summit ccp supplied food lodging and paid for flights and transfers however they also afaik did the same for the journalist from pc gamer magazine who was writing an article about the csm are you trying to imply that he must have also been classed as an employee of ccp i certainly wouldnt put my time on csm4 under the employment history section of my cv but it would be totally relevant under the other skills section
obviously what ive stated before hasnt been read or understoodemployment is a contract between two parties one being the employer and the other being the employee an employee may be defined as a person in the service of another under any contract of hire express or implied oral or written where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed blacks law dictionary page 471 5th ed 1979so point 6 is irrelevant and so is point 7  and tbh all this is political desperation in trying to smear someone that is only volunteering her time to help pass players comments and concerns to ccp is getting tiresomei can understand rl politicians conducting a constant smear campaign as they get paid untold fortunes in costs and guarrenteed future income etc but not game players  all the potential csms are trying to do is make a differance
which jurisdiction is that definition taken from because as i stated where i am from you are not classed as an employee unless you have either a signed an employment contract or b have been accepting regular payment for work donei have no axe to grind with ankh i am stating that the idea that csm can be classed as employees of ccp simply for accepting a volunteer role is ludicrous in addition if it were treated as employment then it would be classed as a second job and thus my tax rate would go up i am simply stating that as far as my jurisdiction is concerned it is not classed as employmentas to a smear campaign i dislike it in rl politics and i dislike it here i havent stated an opinion on ankhs use of her csm volenteer work as part of her employment history i have just stated that it is not employment in the strict sense of the term where i am fromi would state how i was involved in a player elected council debating issues and producing minutes those are the types of transferable skills that many employers look for and lastly iirc the nda contained a clause that we waive any claim to being employees of ccp
the fact that you dont get why people are doing this just shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the issue at hand read all of her quotes and campaign messages without the fanboi rosetinted glasses you appear to be sporting and you will see that she has made it her mission to try to negatively change the preferred playstyle for a lot of people if you still dont get it then you really are playing the wrong game
if i was playing the wrong game then i would have discovered that approx 6 years ago
now youre getting somewhere it is verymuch possible to play eve for 6 years and still dont have a clue what its aboutofc you need to be a bit dim for that but statisticly you really arent a special case 
if anything that made me smile
somehow i think it didnt

in order for this to get serious consideration you would have to make a substantial case that it would be helpful not just to your corp but to many other corps as well it is not enough for csm to say this is a cool idea in order to get something done it has to be able to argue this is one of the best possible uses of devtimein your case you are having a marketing problem in order for me to bring this up assuming i get on csm you would have to persuasively argue that this is a problem affecting a significant population of the users there are no decent outofgame solutions of the universe of ingame solutions this one maximizes usershelped  usefulness  implementationdifficultyof course all of the above means i probably wont get your votes but on the other hand if i told you want you wanted to hear i wouldnt deserve your votes
what lowsecs realy need is to boost nono not boost complitely revising or even will dare to say that finaly give a birth to piracy in eveatm there is millions of ways in eve for go griefing but almost none for actual piracyno hostage capturing no ships capturing ransom works poorly mostly in didnt work at alland ofcourse there is another side of lowsec problem  to few targets as smart guys and gals wouldnt come to lowsec for carebearing unless heshe also do there both pve and pvp even then it is mostly better to pveing in highsecs for betetr income and the go to lowces for pvping atmlowsecs does not give as much profit as it give more risk you need fit differently in lowsecs which is already slowdown alot of you isk making it require more of your time to lower risk of been caught as often using directs can aligning almost constantly for instawarp and so on  which is as well slow down your effective isktime ratting and of course it requere to sit alot in docks if you are already been picked as a targetthere is ofcourse now a way to go on missioning in unscanable fit but itll again requere to sacrefice alot of your dps and as so your effective isktime and you still can be caught at gate exclude of using not named here exploitin return it give ou a bit its realy very low boost more lps per missions it have prety much dead exploration exclude searching for wh so its wh exploration anyway and low profit miningas a fact even many 00 player have an alts who doing mission in highsecs for making money for pvp although dominion gives good boost to 00 pve yet i can tell you how to do more money in highsec on missions then in 00 on anomalies simply because its both easier and more profitable provide you know where exactly and how to make good money in highsecand as a fact lowsecs pirates are one of the poorest guys in eve yeahyeah i know some times it comes to an jackpot for few billions worth loot alot of adrenaline and short time hapiness but let not fool ourself average isktime for pirates who not also doing some pveing are very low none can claim unless heshe is a liar that heshe venture on weekend from home 00 to nearby lowsecs spend few hours by pirating and gain by it enough isk to pass next week in usual 00 pvp unless its always a very cheap fited drakes of course  
confirming cat is enclave alliances choice of candidate for csm
i was asked that do i think about current state of capital ships do i think faction capitals is a good idea does insurance is needed for the capitals so i will answer those herei do not have anything against faction capitals but i wont hurry ccp to implement those either yes they would make interesting addition and good money sink but i think for the start we need t2 capital mods its long past since capitals and capital modules were introduced many of us have perfect capital skills its time to introduce something new yes some new pilots would whine that this widens gap between old players and new players but this could be said about any new t2 stuff introduced in the game its natural state of the game live with itas for the insurance i think it should be entirely removed from the game capitals are no special case yes losing capital will cost more but thats fine capitals are meant to be costly

ure the best corbeau 
this deserves repeating so many of the csm candidates seem to make promises that sounds almost like regular politicians promising fair weather on sundays and wind always on your back when biking up hillteadaze you are refreshingly honest
voted for you because your meeting minutes pdf are awesome work if u could eventually have a look on this proposal
got my vote good luck
this would be a nice addition however for me to raise it at the next csm meeting it needs to be posted as a proposal in the assembly hall forum id suggest putting a link to the proposal in your ideas thread so people can support it i prefer players to post their ideas directly so i dont take the credit once it is in the assembly hall forum i can get things moving
vote elvenlord
i vite for elvenlord
there are legitimate reasons a candidate could be refused failure to provide a passport being underage not abiding by the rules whatever as a rule any time you think its a conspiracy its more likely to be a sign that youre just dumb
send an email to xhagen with questions its not like we can help you
the question i ask myself is do we want to vote on a candidate who dont even know who to contact when his candidacy for csm gets rejected
the application has probably been bounced by the ccp muppetfilter tm
im proving im a marketing genius not only do i get more people to vote for me balance the power of the alliance block vote but i also increase the sales and interest on soe5 and my free events and get people to vote that normally wouldnt i believe in my agenda and myself and i would like a seat tamber
i personally would have voted for him anyway i did last election and bought votes from around 30 people as well you may also see me running around space spamming vote tamber for csm5 from time to time as well i believe in tamber and his platform and i think he would be an excellent addition to the csm oh and in case you missed itclick here to vote tamber for csm 5
even if hed buy voteswhich of the candidates whos seriously running for candidacy to make a change doesnt i dont know whether people are trying to say that these kinds of actions are immoral well if that is the case then all presidents senators governors etc politicians in general all around the world im talking about the real life now are representing a bought position that being said this campaign rather looks paradox lolits kinda funny to accuse somebody of buying votes where the voters are the ones donating the money well its only a single isk though anyways in this case this would be a false accusation id say its not rly profitable to get 15000 isk from edit potentially 15000 voters  woohoo im a maths genius and ye compared to these numbers id say theres a little bit of a difference between 15000 isk and 15000000000 isk which is the prize for a free lottery you can be part of without voting for himto be honest i just voted for tamber because it seemed different than the other candidates campaigns who claim i have experience i did this and that im the best which is getting boring after the zillionth timeand i like his slogan all your vote are belong to me it even made me laughtyshan
all my votes are belong to you
friendly corp bump here but i also think he can really improve things by asking for smaller more nagging issues that never get the time they deserve some things that stick out are afk clokers removeing the billions of inactive poss in high sec and all other sec for that matter jump clone reduction timer lets face it when u wana defend ur own turff u dont wana do it in ur 5sthis guy is really easy to talk too and if any 1 has any suggestions im sure he would jump on it he spent a lot of time on his site and has a good form to add suggestions too of u have any i am also glad to see him working on constructive things rather than paying peeps to rename stations after him or badgering us in the chat unlike some of his compitition gl m8
would like to add my support to cinori i think he is a great candidate and wish him the best of luck in getting elected to the csm i think he truly deserves it
would you say it may be beneficial to increase the amount of 00spaceregions as well as change jump range in order to further increase a more regional approach
the large portion of this thread is a waste of time and for the first time im actually disgusted with someones behavior on the eveo forumsshow some restraint and dont post this craptamber
crikey
t dont be a hypocrite or are you telling us you have a fat face and a double chin as well
thanks for your vote
aye if they cannot be bothered to write up a description and link to a platform not neccesarily a dedicated website as in my case i wouldnt consider them worthy of a vote
suicide gank all u want that said there are all kinds of griefer tactics i dont like and dont use i think pay outs for concord kills and selfdestructs is silly and stopping it wont stop suicide ganking but needs to be done just for consistencies sake criminal behavior should not be insurablesome one mentioned jail in an earlier post  i like that idea but i was thinking more like community service after your ship is concorded they send u to a prison and u have to mine a volume of trit in a newb ship before u can be released repeat offenders would have to mine larger volumes before release
much like rl life insurance policies are generally voided on suicide

for a laugh im gunna open this up againtagami a flat damage boost to rails just wont work you are right though failguns need something but that something has to be new different and excitinggoum you are also right but wrong at the same time the dps from rails appears to be good when coupled with ehp but railguns are still failguns they need a boostso how would we boost them well ive been thinking about what someone said ealier in this post but im sorry im not gonna search through this threadnaught to find your post the suggestion was to look at how railguns were thought to have been originally designed with the ability to penetrate shieldsarmour this is a very interesting concept which appears to be very difficult to balance because the big question is how do you decide how the penetration attribute works without giving you the situation of the targets tank being unfairly ignoredwell i think i may have the answer although a little complicatedfirst penetration will be a chance based system the chance to penetrate will be based on the current state of the targets shieldarmour maybe even both example target has 100 shield there is a 0 chance of penetration into armourtarget has 50 shield there is a 50 chance of penetration into armour target has 87 armour there is a 13 chance of penetration into structure etc etcsecond how much damage will spill over into the next level of defence well i had the idea of a ratio dependent on the targets fit a simple example would be this target is shield tanked target has 500hp in shield capacity and 100hp in armour capacity the ratio between the two is 51 damage would be spread between shield and armour in that ratio so result would be if attacker scored 12 points of damage the damage to the target would  10 damage to shield  2 damage to armournow we could go even deeper into this mechanic and spread the damage across all three which to be honest we would have to as a ships shield is almost never  0suppose the attacker has been successful at penetrating a targets shields and has caused damage to armour the target has 50 shield 85 armour and 100 structure we could use an accumulative probability of penetrating both shield and armour and causing some damage to structureso attacker has a 50 chance of penetrating the shield and a 15 chance of penetrating the armour but this a cumulative probability so the chance of penetrating the armour  05 x 015  0075if the attacker gets very lucky and penetrates both shield and armour the damage will still be spread across the in a ratio so a shield tanker with 500 hp shield capacity 100 hp armour capacity and 100 hp structure capacity would damage distribution would be 511would this mechanic work
no for a variety of reasons the most obvious would be that it wouldnt fix rails in the situations everyones ing about them sucking the next most obvious would be that they would become what the  overpowered in other situationsimo a flat damage boost is what both rails and hybrids needliang
flat damage bonus will only put us in a situation where weapons are becoming homogenised yes i agree that most of the arguments in this thread are based around fleet combat well i mean large fleet combat where i believe there is a larger problem with game play than a weapon system that doesnt offer the same volley damage as other weapons for just a little bit more range which appears to be the whine ie my failgun only does x amount of dps where as everyone else can do xy dps at the range we all engage at boo hoo fix it please by making my failgun like a laser but with kinetic and thermal damage pretty pleaseive made a proposal that would make railguns unique railguns can still be easily countered through their complete lack of tracking their cap dependence and their pathetic dps being able to cause damage to the vulnerable parts of ships with small amounts of dps wont make them super overpowered remember that they are still dealing the same dps only with this mechanic they would have the chance to spread that volley across the targets ehp yes there would need to be very in depth testing and probably slight adjustments made to a failguns damage this mechanic also takes into account a targets preferred tank and most of the damage from the volley would be applied to that part of the ships ehp if the attacker got luckyexampleferox fires a volley with a rack of 200mm fails and volleys for 750 damage say the target is a prophecy an armour tanked bc of the same class an example buffered fit has 4274 hp in shield 13275 hp in armour and 5494 hp in structure not ehp lets forget resists for nowlets say that the ferox scores 3 perfect volleys in a row of 750 dmg eachvolley 1 hits the prophecys shields only as its shields are at 100 and there is 0 chance of penetratingvolley 2 hits prophecys shields are at approx 82 there is an 18 chance less than 1 in 5 that the volley will penetrate for poops and giggles sake lets say the ferox gets lucky now then the ratio of sast  130approx because st is ignored when armour  100because the prophecy is an armour tank for every 1 dmg point caused to shield in the volley 3 will be applied to armour to a total of the volleylets apply that180 damage to shield and 570 damage to armourvolley 3 hits shields  78 22 chance to penetrate armour  96 chance to penetrate  022 x 004  0088 less than 1 but lets say the ferox gets lucky again  out of the 750 volley 150 hits shields 450 hits armour and 150 hits structure although very unlikelyas you can see its going to take a long time before the prophecys shields are so low that he can expect to always hit armour and have a good chance of scoring structure hits before armour  0 also you can see that most of the damage is applied to the prophecys primary tank armour and not structure you can also see just how lucky the ferox pilot needs to get to hit structure before shields and armour are lowdoes this not make rails a much more interesting weapon system that has a certain niche thats not just tickling your target at extreme rangeby the way if my maths is really off or something can you point it out i dont care if you make me look like a maths biffedit bad england
you say that like its some sort of curse word  and furthermore you use it ignorantly even with a fairly substantial damage boost the weapons would have extremely different flavorsno you made a proposal that makes them overpoweredlol do you have any idea what youre talking about here worst case scenario  nobody in eve has them trained 3 months everyone has them trained i think we can all agree that effective dps is all that matters  and railguns that bypass resisted layers are extremely overpoweredmore than just ehp you can completely bypass their tank you say 321 or some ratio eventually but the reality would be 3255  which would cascade to a 310 pretty damn fast i completely agree that active tanks need nerfed more liang
1 explain the extreme differences between beams and rails if they do similar damage i must be missing something2 can you fire a railgun with no capacitor3 i never said that they would bypass resisted layers i said lets ignore resists and i meant just for that post resists would still apply to damage dealt4 the ratio would always be the same as its based on shieldarmourstructure capacity not actual im sure i mentioned that too but im sorry if i didnt
surebeams do emthm damage to kinthm from hybridsbeams have more dps than hybridsbeams have much larger volley than hybridsbeams have less range than hybridsbeams require crystals instead of individual ammo like hybridsbeams are problematic to reload when youve broken a crystal unlike hybridsbeams are are actually heavy on the capacitorbeams take 1 second to reloadbeams have contracting issues if you use factiont2 crystalsyep sure sounds like exactly the same ing weapons system to mesome hybrid using wimp complaining about capacitor usage makes me laugh  reallyyou misunderstand  if your damage is bleeding through then you are bypassing that resist layeryou contradict yourselfliang
beams and rails have fixed damage typesbeams do more dpsvolley than rails but if the proposal of a flat damage boost goes through they will deal very similar amounts of damagebeams have less range than hybrids but the damage proposal also proposes a range reduction to spikehybrids require capacitor to fire not as much as beams but they still need itcrystals are the only major difference but thats what gives beams a quirkplease liang be adult and dont use profanity ill admit the weapon systems are different but the differences are not majoron point 2 making a personal attack is unnecessary i use all weapon systems so i know the problems with cap on lasers however hybrids suffer similar problems not as extensive but its still a problemon point 3 damage would bleed through but most of the damage would be applied to the tank as i said the damage dealt ratio is shield capacity  armour capacity struture capacity which leads us into point4 which is the probability to penetrate not the amount of damage bleed through as this is fixed
assuming the 15 damage proposal goes through i suppose that 8 less dps 369 vs 401 50 less volley 1900 vs 2800 crystals vs ammo significantly higher capacitor usage less rangei havent seen said proposal seriously consideredtbh what youre doing is ignoring many differences and trivializing the ones that remain on the scale that things in eve are different hybrids and lasers even with the proposed 15 damage boost would be very different i mean unless you want to complain that omg it does damage therefore its exactly the same oh noesone sentence above you just got finished talking about how there are major differences that even you admit are major i stand by what i said  hybrids use capacitor lasers mother ing guzzle itbam the underlined part is unacceptable and ridiculously overpoweredwhich is still unacceptableliang
for further proof that this is utter madness lets take a myrmidon fit something as followsmyrmidonirrelevant2x med cap booster irrelevant3x centum atype mar 3x cormacks eanm2x aux nano pump ii nanobot accel istrong exilefor reference it tanks well over 2k dps4883  4542  5371 hp layoutlets suppose for a moment that 2 rail hypes 1400 dps are shooting this thing and fast forward to the point where the shields are gone0  4542 21339  5371 5371 hphype 1 fires for 77532 real damage making for a 17 probability that the second hype bleeds through almost 60 of its damage into hull even though the myrm can tank the hypes trivially it will die in short order because you are 100 bypassing its tanklianged thank you for your valuable suggestion to nerf active tanking it really really needs it it also breaks for a large variety of other reasons

this topic was definitely in the wrong page 
my vengeance actually fires more defenders than rockets from its rliis as things are now and thats a sad state of affairs
how is that any different to people just deleting their characters after doing something badpeople dont seem to understand that at the most this is a lateral direction to current scamming methods this doesnt offer any new avenues for scammers with a name history they arent escaping well all know mr x is now mr y and hes the person who undermined his recent corporation in his corporation historymost people wont check show info thats pretty weak thats the equivalent that most people wont know this person is a scammer because they dont bother to research someones history
i like this idea but would only want it if the toon is sold and ccp can see that from the forums etc so only once per time the toon is moved account so if scammers are doing it to scam they ahve to move it account all the time and i would assume ccp could track that easly from server info and from forums
definitely would like to see this feature implemented
no
it simply adds an extra layer of obfuscation for oneand mr x is now mr y only works if you already know that or happen to look up mr ys info sheet in channel for scams but what if youre ingame looking for mr x via a locator agent or something the sleasebag wont be found as he changed names and what if you had kill rights on mr x for the next month nice houdini trick i just foresee yet another system that will be abused as an alleged game mechanicits different because a new toon has to be trained from scratch scammer wont mind but for a pirate not allowing the name change closes off an important avenue of evasion

do not see a reason why it can not be made available for pc as well if only for a reason of boosting console market supported
i didnt bother reading all twelve pages console exclusivity is the right business decision consoles have a huge shooter market share pcs have a tiny one im sorry if youre a hardcore pc shooter gamer but you are screwed no matter what i told the same thing to all the people i knew who were ing about the crappy pc port of mw2 if they have ability to easily port it great if not i would rather them work on improving dust then porting it to a platform that represents a minuscule portion of the shooter market
perhaps the op needs to be edited to be macro use rather than macro mining as there seems to be plenty of confusion that were only talking about miningthe fact is that macros are also used for 00 ratting and local spamming usually scams in jita so many of the proposed countersolutions and discussions only address one small part of the issue
first of all i do fly a covops and i still think its ridiculous that someone can sit in a system 23 hours a day having a red in system puts people on edge especially when you know theres nothing you can do about it go live in 00 for a while if you dont know what im talking aboutsecond i already suggested very high skill requirements for probing down cloakers its the second sentence in the first paragraph maybe people should read more than the title of a thread before postingthird ccp could make it so you only get a 100 signal on stationary targets probers would not be affected as long as theyre smart enough to align to something before they cloak up
what will happen then is people will sit with a prober 300km off a gate sees a transport ship jump in it spots the gang cloaks prober pops scan with probes already in place and warps to the hit just an unintended side effect i can think oftrying to suggest any sort of movement defeats this would take special coding as well as insure that all afk cloakers simply set a speed completely defeating your ideathere are plenty of already ingame alternatives to dealing with this issue that we dont need to waste devtime with adding useless content like this
isnt the point of covops to go behind enemy lines and make them feel a bit on edge and gather intel seems to be working as it should imoi read about the training requirements i just stated what i though the requirements should be was it over the top sure but then again it is a bit over the top to suggest being able to train something that will totally destroy the workings of several classes of ships what would the downside be to being able to probe them down i know how easily my sb can be popped if caught in the open thats part of the trade off i take to have a cloaky shipyour third point make no sence at all whats to keep someone from just flying towards empty space cloaking up and going afkthe thing is your suggestion does nothing about afk cloakers all it looks like to me is a cloak nerf the only suggestions i have seen that make sence to fix this issue is removing local or making an auto logout im not even sure the auto log out is a good ideabtw when was the last time an afk cloaker hurt anyone i find it funny that people are so scared of someone not at keyboard popping their ship i just think that some people have been caught off guard by a cloaky ship and popped but thats what those ships are for
this does not encourage cooperative play it encourages people to hop on cloaker ships solo and pick off their targets there is absolutely no risk to cloaking in a system full of hostiles and choosing what targets you wish to engage and when you wish to engage it allows for pure consensual pvp where the cloaker has 100 control of the situation dont like the odds dont uncloak and engage odds in your favor go for the kill a miner in the same system cannot mitigate the nonconsensual pvp that a cloaker brings to the table the most a miner can do is park a blob next to him to discourage a cloaker from engaging thats it but its still the cloakers choice on how things go down
i feel that the present mechanics behind starbase batteries are broken how it works confirmed with testing is that each gun gauges its tracking and ranges using the starbase tower as the origin instead of the battery itself while this does prevent pilots from orbiting a given battery at 0 in order to outtrack it and empty it while taking no damage it both severely hampers some shortrange turrets especially blasters and negates the usefulness of tactical placement it is also confusing as the batteries will display the batterytarget distance when being manned while the accuracy is actually being calculated using the towertarget distance insteadi propose that the batteries use themselves as the range and tracking origin increasing the importance of tactical placement and increasing their effective firing coverage area as it is blasters are incapable of achieving optimalrange status on targets except in very rare circumstances a large blaster on a small tower autocannons and pulse lasers get saved somewhat by range bonuses on their racial towers but blasters suffer the most due to the lack of such a bonusproof  four small blasters placed adjacently at a small tower at the top one small secure can placed approximately 10km up from the blasters approx 15km from forcefield and a second can placed 5km from the bottom of the tower forcefield the can at the top received less than half of the hits that the bottom one did furthermore training one blaster on another blaster produced a relatively high rate of misses something that should not happen if the batteries calculated range from themselves instead of the tower just to drive the point home even further i trained the blasters on the tower itself and achieved a 100 hit rate despite being 20km from the tower

whatever as long as the ganker has as much damage as he caused  in particular time damage ganking hulks ie should be fined with average hulk price devided by an average mining income in highsec per day in 3 hrs which are needed for a normal player without alts to refinance a lost hulk ie 1421 daysloosing insurance doesnt make a big difference as long the gankbear has not to pay an equal price for it
such policy is called dumbing down the game it is protection for the stupid those not smart enough to figure out how to use game mechanics to their advantageas a result less stupid people will quit the game average iq of the player base will go down more trash posts on the forums more smack talk in local more mouths shouting at ccp for additional stupid game changesthis game originally aimed to be hardcore it should stay that way
qftalso the idea of a jail is ed
i think people who suggest such idiocy in assembly hall should simply be summarily banned from the forum

counterproposal concord stop rescuing people for free its unrealistic as hell amirite and it is hugely unfair that the player merc corps should have their livelihoods wrecked by unfair npc competition how could miners make a living if npcs gave a million units of free minerals to anyone who asked thats how unfair it isi propose that people should have to buy their protection from concord like everything else if you dont pay they wont lift a finger to help fees should be roughly equivalent to what player mercs charge with corp and alliance contracts available 100 mill a week for an individual or 500m for a corp or 25 bill for an alliance sounds about right  perhaps someone from repo or noir could comment hereof course there would be no obvious way to tell if someone was protected or not but what the hey sometimes you have to take risks and hugely increasing the costs and penalties of playstyles we dont like are what whinethreads in the assembly are all about right
i suggest that concord should be removed from the game entirely thus allowing mercenaries to truly become important in eve if the general trend with npc goods is to try and remove them from the game should we not try and replace npc services with player services as well players could choose their protection racket of choice and pay them weekly this allows them to wear a tag with the ticker of the protection force should the player get shot the protection force gains killrights on the aggressor and should pursue them for great vengeance eve should become freeforall with players ensuring safety and not some stupid in game rules and automatic nofee ultra powerful protection force
this is a fantastic idea and a good example of critical thinking unlike the opliang
yes i do realize that a shorter cycle kinda boosts it but a shorter cycle time should make up for so to speak the nerf of the actual module having it so that you can mess with more people but with a lesser consequence makes sense in my mind although lesser consequence is totally situational in some scenarios like a falcon one friend ganking a lone target it will be less effective while vs an rr fleet it might be more effective depending on the scenario surrounding itall in all i feel that this would balance the module more towards a right way of doing things and make it more enjoyable both to fight with and against and yes i do hope it brings the scorpion back to a full glory fleet bs
this has got to be the single most inane idea ive had the displeasure to read on these forums in quite awhilegrats dude it takes imagination attention to detail and dedication to failpost this hard
i guess you dont understand the change proposed then nothing i can do about that
first off i thought you were suppose to post a nurf tracking disruptors thread second no to thisbreaking the lock is not so bad but the cycle time is too short if your in a larger ship it would be even more annoying then the current situation there are ships out there that take longer then 5 seconds to lock those ships would have 2 chances to fail at avoiding the jam they most likely would end up jammed the entire fightwith smaller ships it would be a pta jammed relock attack jammed relock attack jammed small ships will always have their locks broken i am also confused as to why a small ship would ever fit eccm eccm does not work on small ships forgive the math it is probably not right i do not have all the information needed to get everything correct atm and am at work so cant just ask someone in game for the correct info it should be close enough to prove the pointan ares has a base magnetometric sensor strength of 10 points a mag eccm ii fitting in the mid slot would boost that to 196a falcon l5 recon skill using a t2 mag jammer would have a jam strength of 1944 just with the falcons jamming bonus so your looking at something along the lines of a 96 chance with eccm that the falcon will break the ares lock nearly every time your screwed with or without eccm it can only get worseas mentioned above this post there is another issue this change completely removes the need to ever fit eccm a sensor booster would always be better since it helps you relock after a jam before you can get jammed again and it helps you lock faster in every situation eccm would merely reduce the number of times you get jammed if someone is bothering to jam you no jamemrs on the field eccm is a wasted slot kinda like it is nowbefore you can adjust ecm you need to fix eccm why can i rig a ship to counter damps but there is no rig to counter ecmwhy is eccm the only electronic warfare counter that provides no benefit in fitting unless your being someone is using ecm against youone thing that would help everyone in the debate is an active jamming failed indicator adding a sound that means someone failed to jam you would be good anything that would tell the person who is being targeted that a jam attempt was made right know all you have is the negative i can know how may times my eccm failed but never when it succeeds if a falcon puts takes 5 attempts to get a jam on me i am happy he is not able to jam a lot of my gang mates now but all i see is that i am jammed again

around 12 years ago now not one but two changes to t1 frigates mostly have increased the use of rifters merlins punishers etc i dont think anyone would say this is a bad thing personally im with the opinion that the more ships as alternatives are available the more interesting it gets  both for choosing and fighting themthere are however still a large number of ships that are hardly used if ever and that for years now i find this quite surprising because this is one thing that seems easy to fix if compared to planetary interaction or wormholes  but for me atleast has the same potential in adding game contentlets start with the whole tier system which in some shiplcasses is still intact and just obsoletes several ships at once an extreme example would be the small barge but there are also the breacher tier1 haulers etcwithout going into details if one has the choice between either a good or a bad hauler or between a fast hauler a tankier or roomy one  what do you think will keep more players interestedalso important imo is balancing ships from a pvp viewpoint without making them ineffective at their current roles or pve roles take the heron as example its used by players for exploration but a new player fitting a 220 cpu combat probelauncher on it with a point and abmwd is impossible if the ship however gets boosted to a point where it is still far behind the buzzard but has its use as a scout and prober more new players can get into probing in pvp which to me is a great part in evetheres plenty ships in eve that can do with an overhaul new and longtime players will benefit greatly from it  just look at how many players enjoy the 45 worthwhile t1 frigs
meant to post with this char 
yesterdays downtimes strangely never bothered me at all i actually found it to be quite pleasant chilled on the forums had some nice non eve related stuff going on ts which is rare and some pretty neat plans  fits getting created on evemon  eftso i think in addition to normal dt and patch dt i think every month we should have a 8  12 hour unscheduled downtime
it needs a little rebalancing but other that that i fully support 1 lets get ccp to downgrade there already crap equipment even more to get more of these relaxing downtimes
make it a 12 hour downtime on the night before the 1st of each month or some other time needs to be planned not unscheduled and ill be more then happy to support the idea all the way up to taking a full 24 hours off each month if it would have a positive impact on eve and see fixesetc come about faster
this is the dumbest idea ever
i believe if we combined our skill and knowledge we would make this into a fantastic ideahook me up princess

look assembly hall  at least i thought was meant to be serious serious suggestions and comments to possibly improve the gamerecently at least that i have noticed a few noobs have been spamming assembly hall im not talking about occasional bad ideas like remove wardecs but the obvious idiots that post on assembly hallassembly hall usually has 1 troll post on the first page its stupid and somthing needs to be done

not supported also i think youre trolling
two choices 1 flame them into oblivion 2 dont feed the trolls and instead let the threads die 1 is more satisfying but 2 is the only one with a decent chance of working
supported in concept but not in ops implementationassembly hall needs to be limited to charactersplayers that actually care about whats going on in eve not just for lolposts and terrible trolling like caod
thisis what im getting at and love how musical troll doesnt support now emo obvious troll should also not support
trolls are people too hate speech against trollism is classed as discrimination and could get you banned i would advise against this bigotry especially on a forum with great diversity
no you cant be a person and a troll you are one of the other
not sure if srsin any case this is almost a non issue trolling in assembly hall when compared to the other forums is pretty rare not to mention you yourself may be attempting a cunning metatroll with this thread not supported sorry
your sentiments are shared with amany in the csm world my friend supported this and additionally a friend suggested having csmblogs where csm members could write blogs that would be approved by ccp for official publishing on the eveo site along the lines of previous comments here these blogs could be oriented to changes that were initiated by csm interaction and on the progress csm is making while its true that each member could have their own blog that they update without the approval of every word from ccp they would not get as much read from the playerbase as an official blog on ccps sitecinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom
the amount of questions going through the ingame help channel means many questions and just as likely answers arent being seen in time before they disappear out of the window which is pretty much always expandingi propose the creation of multiple help channels based on categories probably numbering eight or less the names of which ill walk away from so as to gain more support for the general idea rather than the detail which the csm electorate can hash out when or if it gets to the icelandic meeting
if this is technically feasible id like to see it happen however i suspect that its not i do support raising it to ccp just in case its doable but frankly you shouldnt expect much
supportedwhile this is technically infeasible now since ccp has no way of telling via itemid whether somethings a bpo or not theres an easy solutionhave a bpc and a bpo be a different type of object ie two itemids that way we can have our inventories shock horror actually color bpos and bpcs differentlyand we can have killmails act sanely
anything that will make it easier to manage blueprints is ace in my bookplease whoever gets voted in push this to the top of the we want this fixed now que right above destroyer utility
it is the same issue of differentiating them in the hangar so it will require a major overhaul of the database and all the parts of eve that rely on the database practically it will require redoing one of the founding structures of the gameso doing it for the killmails or the ease of industrialists is not worth it especially as industrialists have some workaround it would be a good idea for ccp to do that as part of a huge modernization of the game but it would be part of a very big patch aimed only at rewriting legacy code
i really cant see why it wouldnt be technically possible look if there is a max runs remaining if that is the case add copy behind blueprint

now for clarification this only applies to howitzers and artillery and repeating artillery autocannons are awesome with that sick hail of bullets look before i begin here is a sad diagram to help explain the partsturretprojectile effecttargetx o  o xfiringimpacteffecteffectwhat i feel that is lacking are the impact effects of both artillery standard and repeating and howitzers and the projectile effects of howitzers especially with the higherdamage rounds and the larger guns the impact effects should ideally be more like a missile explosion what is being fired is a large shell that should explode on impact the explosions should not be nearly as big those of missiles but large enough to convey the impression that it is doing some serious damagealso the projectile effects of the howitzers used to be and still should be what is essentially a rocketpropelled shell complete with glowing rocket trail that hurdled across space rapidly before hitting its target this further conveys a general aura of awesomeness as multiple howitzer shells rocket at high speed toward a target before explodingedit diagram updated for lack of sucking
im not sure what kind of problem the session timer is meant to be working around but there has to be a better way around it than just putting 30 seconds on transactions such as changing ships in the hangerapply some of your incredible programming talent to actually fixing whatever the problem is rather than just saying it takes 30 seconds to enter and leave ships for no reason also to join a fleet also anything else we randomly decide fits the criteria for triggering a session timer

a quote from the evelopedia  the data interface is never destroyed in a job and is spit back out as soon as the invention job is installed thus only one is needed even if you want to run multiple invention jobs at the same timenow data cores and decryptors are at least used up how can you realistically make enough isk from interfaces and the items from which they are produced if almost all interfaces are never destroyednot enough inventors from new players will join to buy them coupled with the fact that some veteran inventors stop inventing how many inventors create their own indestructible interfaces i know i did

so youve played for 6 years and still fail to see how her proposed changes would negatively impact the game wow just wow
could you please confirm this last point regarding claims of employment by ccp from former csm members being a breach of nda i find this very interesting
white knighting wont get you any mkay 
at first i thought ankh was bad but then i got a lobotomy and suddenly she seems to have good ideas
great movie got my vote truly represents the players instead of personal agenda and has nice track record
have you actually read any of her opinions like a single one of them
i dont think the stuff posted about her is true it comes from her direct competitors and if you read her track record documents they do not show strong bias towards a carebear agenda i see 00 pvp and fw issues amongst them that proves that the accusations are false i think ankh can seperate her personal views and her csm role that and i want someone that knows how fw works on the csm her fw issues prove that she knows what shes talking about
evesearch doesnt lie hell you have screenshots of her evil egg throwers need to get banned crap in local
be rational ankh has been on the csm twice she hasnt raised any issues to ban pvp or people that gank the suicide gank issue she raised is balanced it asks for pvp means to deal with it all pve means have this listed as con
just a reminder that my blob issues focus group is scheduled for 1500 eve time today yesterday focus groups on low sec and ecm balance were conducted both sessions were excellent with indepth discussion about real and perceived problems potential solutions and in the case of the low sec discussion an exciting proposal idea the proposal idea fits exactly with my vision for how low sec should be addressed suffice to say that it involves boosters within a couple of days i will have the discussions summarized and make the raw audio available because participants said they do not object to that the draft of our proposal is in the works as soon as the focus group participants have had a chance to vet it one of us will publish it on assembly hall watch this thread  ill post when stuff is published also would like to thank the following folks among others for endorsing me for csm on their blogs nashh kadavr larz smith myhrial arkenath ahnog yriellevandis aiden mourn cirocke and flashfresh

what is your personal opinion of the followingpiratespiracyscammersscammingsuicide gankersgankinghow would that impact your judgment on the csm
they all have a legitimate place in eve the verse is a harsh place i think pirating is key to life in eve it should however be a balanced challenge for the agressors and the targets if its unbalanced you either wont have pirates because it isnt a rewarding experience or you wont have pirates because there are no targets pirates have to remain part of the riskreward that eve offersscamming is also a part of eve however there have been some bad game mechanics that made some of it too easy for example the complexities for the contract system cost folks some isks but again eve is harsh so i think scamming is a part of the experience if i can talk someone into giving me a ton of isk to get get into the goons and it turns out to be a scam well welcome to evesuicide ganking is also a part of eve i want it to again be balanced weve seen some steps in the right direction with adjustments of insurance suicide ganking should never be a simple isk source with no downside i wouldnt mind seeing self destruct produce a little more extreme effect around the folks in the vicinity though so how this impacts my judgement i respect the value of those aspects of eve although i am more inclined myself to do things folks might describe as carebearish i would never want eve to be made child safe and tamperproof eve has to remain a place with a clear progression of risks and rewards the best risks are those that players themselves can create and expose other players tooi hope that helps you pick a csm candidate to supportissler dainzeexcited about this exciting csm election
with regards to suicide ganking are you familiar with the risks that already confront the ganker as someone who ganks on occasion i can tell you that it is not as simple or riskfree a process as many make it out to be

i agree with everything you said so im voting for you my biggest issue with eve at the moment is people being too scared to fight and having too many ways to avoid it i want more risk and more violence warp to zero and standings in local chat made it possible to completely avoid a fight delayed local in lowsec maybe 1 minute and wormhole style local in 00 invisible til you talk would put the danger back into itive been playing eve for 5 years and i have more isk and ships than i know what to do with and all i want to do when i log in is pvp i dont care about taking a loss i just want to fight everyone
there is actually a few killboards i have come across when scouts and logistics are listed separately on the operation im not sure how this is implemented though
yes i agree so much almost all the fights that are had nowadays are people who were intending to go out to fight in the first place sources of income are increasingly distanced from nonconsentual pvp and ganking people in belts gets harder and harder i know a lot of people wont like what i say and that i only want free kills well yes yes i do if people are rarely dying then there is not much risk involved and all youre doing is just farming isk there should be enough income there to make it worthwhile after the deaths since you cant force people to live in the belts against their will but there should still be real risk to being therelink i think you could only do that if you manually edited the people in or maybe fit 1 gun on the logi so it appears on some km
ultimately csm is an intel gathering tool for ccp a way for them to get a good handle on the issuesimprovements players are most interested in overall i think its an excellent idea and one page i would like to see other mmos take out of ccps booki dont expect a whole lot more from csm candidates other than to be active players read the proposals in ah and to bring those issues before ccp they arent ccp employees theyre players who represent the playerbaseim glad youre having fun mazzilliu it is only a game after all something which some candidates cough ankhesentapemkah cough seem to have forgotten
exactly when they take you to iceland they are going to keep you at their office for about 8 hours each day there actually isnt much time to see the sights over there and when ccps time with you is up theyll still pay for your return flight but if you want to stay longer you have to pay the rest of your waythe only problem csm candidates ive seen  heard of are the ones who are really dumb and keep bringing up issues that dont take into account other peoples play styles or just dont work well with other people when you get to iceland there is a lot more that goes on other than simply raising the issues the link someone brought up earlier gives you an idea about how things are likely to be next iceland summit as well here it is again
max skilled warrior iis which is by the way about 34m sp compared to drones 5  the ew skill to 4  electronic drone operation i spit out a bit less then 100 dps max skilled hobgoblin iis spit out somewhere in the region of 130ish dps dont have eft on atm which is about 1015 the dps of a bs taking 1k dps as base which can  naturally  be exceeded also a bs will often have things like heavy neutralizers points rr and so on and so forth which also get inactivated theyre also far cheaper that definitely does not seem on parwhile im more or less ok with how ecm works read i dont like it but we i doubt itll change although it is much more powerful then other ew the cheap disposable and trivial to skill into ecm drones truly are out of whack with t2 damage drones the lights in particular need a nerf  not the make them useless type of nerf but they are a bit too good as things are and could use with reducing their effectiveness by 2030the major problem of other ew drones is that no effect is as powerful as ecm is and given dronebay is very limited so no spares on most ships at all the contest between situationally useful stuff vs always useful stuff can only end in one way second major problem is the fact that the effects of them are stacking penalized leading to very low overall effectivenessyou got gcc for repping pirates for the last two years afaik definitely way preqr therefore i guess its a feature by now
you and almost every other candidate are running on a platform that consists largely of trying to get ccp to adjustrebalancefix existing content i think this is in line with the desires of the playerbase for ccp to focus on such issues for at least one expansion ccps preference is to introduce significant new content with each expansion they reportedly feel that this is important to continue bringing in new subscribers that being the case in order to persuade ccp to devote more resources to balance issuesexisting content youre going to have to make the case that doing so would be good for their bottom line for example by reducing the rate at which existing subscribers burn out on the game do you agree if not why if you do what qualifies you to make and present such a caseim loosely paraphrasing anklsadsfsfsgf here but its one thing i think she has right
i must say ive been very impressed with your thoughtful responses eliseyou can count my vote
lowsec carebears reporting in
i definitely agree and it is something ive touched on before that ccp is a business above all else the introduction of the csm was even a business decision with that said i have a fair amount of experience in the corporate world and have a firm understanding of how businesses think heck i can even throw around the buzzwords with the best of them i do believe that i can make a good case for a contentfix patch while i do not have access to the raw data i think it is safe to say that there are a huge number of unsubscribed players right now no marketing resources are required to draw these players in obviously and if they see that ccp is inclined to keep them happy they will invariably hang around for longer

do you think this makes you look any smarter as a csm candidate sokratesz still on your very personal crusade versus ankhi know why i will not vote for you sokrateszno serious csm should behave and act like you do if you dont agree with ankh thats fine but your childish behaviour discredits youno vote for 22 year old punkkids who answer a customers question with a solid noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo in a thread on this very official forum here and who smacktalk on the boards to those users who have requests questions inquiries etc just because they promote different opions and suggestions than you do epic fail on that dude
no serious csm should behave and act like ankh does either if anything ankh is more annoying because of the im a serious candidate which wants a more balanced eve for everyone and am not antipvp in her csm thread while there are heaploads of pvpers are antisocial bastards and need to get rl therapy statements which you can find on evesearch and she spews such garbage in local if she honestly said im the carebear candidate well ok i guess carebears want representation too what is not fine is the utter dishonesty in pretending to be anything else but a carebear candidate
give or take shes as dishonest as the pvpcsms and most of the csm are only catering towards pvp and piracy because it is what they do and what they want eve to look like who are then talking about some mission running tweaks ahhh thats so duplicitousat least she is trying to balance eve other csms including sokratesz are only advocating for one side of the game and would like to kill all carebearing at once because they lack targets in their lowsec spaceeditit is really oustanding that you feeled the urge to make a thread about her just to mock on her wow just wow do you think you are any better than her in fact she fights for soemthing and you well you only try to flame and mock someone here now youve opened the thread now live with people who do not agree in this very thread with your opinion and your attitude towards her
pvp csms dont try to hide the fact pvp is what there interested in she is trying to hide the fact shes a carebear candidate that is the problemwhile there are csms of the i want to boost lowsec by spawning a carebear in officer fitted golem in every lowsec belt variety theyre preety obvious a carebear can easily see they are propvp nerf carebearing candidates and go vote for someone who has their best interests at heartankh is in no way trying to balance the game and her level of knowledge about pvp mechanics is the same as my knowledge about level 4 missions since ive never ever ran one unless ganking lowsec mission runner countsthat said lowsec is largely fine and if it wasnt for the blight of fw turning a good sized portion of it into horrible bloblands itd be lovely
i totally agreeoh and brankoi see a lot of pvpcsms trying to hide the fact  that they only want to abuser their candidature to erase all carebearing from the gameher pvp knowledge is pretty solid much more solid and profund than the industrytradingmission running knowledge of all the pirate and griefingcsms isand my question remains why did you even start this thread whats the purpose of it to mock on someone who you dont agree with man you are cheap
youre saying zero is somehow greater then zero that does not work out very wellbecause of the im not antipvp blah blah crap in her csm thread trying to suggest she is not in fact a carebear candidate calling someone out on a lie is more informational then mocking
woohoo look what unsolicited spam arrives into my inbox
it does ankhs pvp knowledge is greater than the so called knowledge of carebear issues of the pvpcsms and on top of that ankh is trying to balance the eve gaming experience for everyone not only for one group of players as opposed to the gazillion of pvpcsms out thereit is my firm belief that there are mor peacefull and empireenjoying players around than pvp players since those pirates allways cry for targets and more targets and more targets and to nerf carebearing and to nerf it and to nerf it some more the lack of targets gets to them ruins their day if they cant ruin someone elses daybecause of that i am pretty sure that ankh will get enough votes she stands up for all of the eve population not only a small fraction of pirating scumbags who only look to ruin someone else eve expeirence by suicid ganking etcin what regard is that different from what other csm cadidates are doing they call the few industrial and carebear csms liars they spit on them because they dont agree with them they pretend to argue for all of the players but hell if some cvarebear is going to suggest something they are flamed by those very same csms on the boards for asking something that is not in favor of pvpyour thread is fail and what you are trying to achieve is easy to see through guess what your attempt backfired
you dont have to altpost to repeat lies ankh has pvp knowledge ankh stands up for all of eve population pirating scumbags only look to ruin someone else eve experience by suicide ganking you knowthere is no problem with people voting for a carebear candidate however the stands up for all of the eve population is laughable
sorry to bust your bubble but a i am not an alt of her you might want to check ingame andb she does indeed try to sort it out for everyone not only for some players like the majority of the other candidates i never ever heard something of substance regarding an improvement of the empire game aspects from the so called pvpadvocatesin fact you prove my point you are scare of losing your ganktargets when the game improves for empire players thats why you started this thread you do not want a reasonable voice in the csm programm taking care for carebears and pvp players
edit drunken posting from cellphone rolling eyes should be at bottom of post damn this beer
dont forget voiding insurance everywhere else tooafter all what kind of insurance company reimburses u for getting your vehicle blown up in a war zone
so if cc dont like the idea of a t1 bs doing more than 1200 dps  they could always make it easier for gallente to reach than other races one of our biggest problems is we have to be a glass cannon to get the little dps advantage on paper over other races so let say they change our damage mods so we get the same dps from 2 damage mods as we get from 3 now thats one lows slot saved for extra plate  resis  nano we and adjust the penalty so that stacking 3 is like stacking 4 now so unless your not planning on taking any damage there is no real point stacking a third damage mod over a plateresis just an idea
caldari hybrid ships have an i win button thats why almost no one flies them
i notice some people discuss improving speed agility and weapon trackingi believe those attributes should be for ac ships blaster ships should still be slow and cumbersome they just need to have high damage as the main advantage over all other weaponscause if you improve blaster ships in those other ways then the next thing well see is acminmatar 10 page threads calling for fixeswe should never lose focus of the relationships between 3 close range gun types each have advantages and disadvantages which need to be emphasized not made more similar
well lets see a ferox can probably go 1387 ms with 3 overdrive ii and a dc ii in the lows while fitting 6 heavy neutron ii and a lol standard launcher ii a cyclone can outrun it at 1750 ms with the same low slot fitting ok lets look at the armor tankers the king of the blaster boats the brutix is the slowest of the bunch at 982 ms that is with thermal kinetic and explosive hardener iis a dc ii and 3 medium trimark iis oh and you have to fit a rcu in the last low since you cant fit 7 heavy neutron iis and a yt8 mwd the prophecy barely breaks 1000 ms with thermal kinetic explosive hardener iis two eanm iis an anp ii and 3 medium trimark iis btw im trying to keep this all tier i so all you apples and oranges guys can shut up everyone got the same midslot fittings with yt8 mwd web and scram the ferox and cyclone got 2 invulnerability iis with em ii thermal ii and cdfe ii rigs the brutix added a cap recharger ii while the prophecy had no spare midslot to fit anything else of course the prophecy tops them all with 74k ehp then surprisingly the ferox with 54k brutix with 52k and cyclone with 42k the ferox is able to dictate the engagement with its speed and can run in and blast away run out and recharge a bit of its shields and run back in again the only tier one bc able to do that better is the cyclone
this is a very valid observation but ultimately shows that the biggest problems with blasters isnt their raw damage output its their ability to apply that damage effectively this is why we see shield tanked brutixes and hypes  because they actually have a prayer of getting into range to deal some damage so i think that if you dont increase blaster damage agility and speed then you must dramatically increase their raw damage output and maybe trackingand to whoever above said that blasters arent a caldari weapon i laugh at you good sirliang
speaking from personal preference as long time battleship user id say a 20 raw dps increase for blaster will make me want to fly megathrons again even tho ill still hate how hard it is to fit onelikewise if blaster damage was increased 10 i may try mega and hyperion once but would stick to my preferred dominix and typhoon ability to fit heavy energy neutralizer  extra dps
i was wondering how long it would take for you to notice this hole in my idea i was thinking about this earlier it punishes active tanking as active tankers rely on heavy resists and rep amount rather than a buffer so i thought if the ratio of damage bleed included an effective hp vs the thermal and kinetic damage profile instead of just basic hp would this help push the damage distribution ratio back towards hitting the targets tank rather than its structure
about 15 seconds after it was suggested actually i even referenced it specifically in post 714 my second on this topicno any weapon that does bleed through as you described it is ridiculously overpowered full stopliang
liang if this was balanced correctly how would it by overpowered
liang youre right the suggestion in its crude form is overpowered but this is why we post these things to be critised to refine the idea ive changed a couple of things like adding a modifier to the ammount of damage causedi have another way of doing this but i need to work it all out again to see which is better i havent looked at the effect on an armour buffer or active tanks yet though i am trying to find a solution to that problem if it still existshere is what ive worked on for you to peruse overformula 1 even damage spread accross the ratio with damage modifiereffect on shield buffer tankferox rail buffer fit vs drake ham fit with mwd16157  4883  4883 3  105  1025450  75  375472563  17624  15effect on ship 1st volley of 750 shield only as shield  100 750375375 apply resists volley375021375028 7875105 18375shield1615718375 1597325 or 992nd volley of 750 has 1 chance to penetrate shields and 0 chance to penetrate armourvolley sucessfully penetrates shields so3  105  005 damage distribution5625  1875  0apply modifier and resists135  52  0shield1597325135 15838 or 98armour488352 4831 or 993rd volley of 750 has 2 chance to penetrate shields and 002 chance to penetrate armour but only if shield penetration is successfulllets say the ferox pilot is the luckiest pilot in the world and not only has scored 3 perfect volleys in a row has also scored 3 penetration rolls in a rowsodamage distribution ratio would be damage modifiers are there too3  105  1025450  15005  150025450  75  375apply resists110  416  15shield 15838110 15728 or 97armour 4831416 47894 or 98structure488315 4868 or 997or if no penetration mechanic for comparison2250 damage to drakes shieldapply resists23625315  55125effect on shield1615755125  1560575 or 966ive traded 04 shield damage for a slim chance to score 2 armour and 03 structure damage i dont think this is game breaking also the chance to penetrate a layer doesnt get probable until below 40 said layers capacity and then not likely until below say 25so in 3 volleys in 84 seconds with a total of 2250 damage before modifiers and resists the ferox has caused 3 shield damage 2 armour damage and 03 structure damagethe drake has managed to get 2 volleys off in this period and is using kineticvolley1654 perfect hit to be fairafter resists volley46312 so 2 volleys  92624 damage to feroxs shieldsferox shield985492624 892776 or 906ferox is not omgwtfbbq overpowered pwning the drake however as this is a chance based system a practical test over and over again would be required to prove balanceill look into active tanks later but id like your feedback on this before i consider posting in the stupid ideas and useless suggestions forumplease dont just say no its rubbish and belongs in that crazy forum please id like some real constructive feedback from you cause i know you are good at that
honestly one of the biggest fixes would be to simply redistribute base resists npcs have different resists but all player ships are homogeneous in that em is always the weakness of shields and explosive is always the weakness of armor
imo thats exactly where it belongs  because the mere suggestion is crazy talk however using this latest round of explanation it looks like buffer shield tanks are the best case scenario and quite possibly the only scenario it works in if killing the shield tank with up to half armor left is working armor buffer tanks tend to fold with 2040 armor left and active tanking as a whole is massively nerfedfurthermore i dont think theres any way to fix these problem areas because theyre intrinsic to the idea of penetrating someones tank i mean unless you stop suggesting real penetration at all in which case you should just sign on to the bandwagon of fixing current game mechanics instead of introducing new ones afterall 1 point of bleed through isnt new or exciting or different merely something useless that someone will justify for keeping rails less useful than they really should beliang
spugg it an interesting idea i kinda like the premise but it would need some ie alot of work to prevent it from being overpowered either a reduction in the percentage chance or and this would be ironic a reduction in rail dpsin any case keep at it would certainly make rails unique and drastically change how people fit and fight perhaps bulkhead reinforcement would be the new in thing
its pretty much not possible to balance something that penetrates tanks like this suggests its an altogether harder problem than balancing dots  which have themselves tend to go from meh totally ing useless to what the  omg ridiculous blizzard fix this right ing now what the  bbq in incredibly tiny spacesits simply intrinsic to the idea of damage penetration that you will be ignoring some percentage of someones primary tank or you cant possibly justify the reduced damage and as long as thats true youll end up with several types of tanking that are pretty much totally marginalized i think the game will have gone downhill in a pretty massive way if we are all hull tanking because theres no other good tanks out therereally the idea of tank penetration isnt feasible for a lot of reasons but keep brainstorming by all meansliang
supported because no other race has a damage type specific bonus this cripples caldari for pvp if they were 100 free to chose damage type would balance the already not pvp effective missile boats
tossing out the hull bonuses because you need to swap damage types isnt good and makes no sense
good stuff youve put a lot of thought and sense into the improvements and not been unreasonable with your requestsyou have my full backing

sounds alright  only problem i have with this is when a corp or alliance claims space and someone else tries to take said space the defenders usually do everything in their power to protect it so they bring as many ships as they can as well as the attackers turning into a war turning into blob warfare also whats to stop giant 00 alliances from stepping in and becoming overlords in lowsec so not only do you have to compete with other small corps trying to grab space your competing with a alliance with over 600 members i do believe lowsec could use something to freshen it up but i dont think this sort of sov would help
thank you everyone for the contributions so far both those who support and do not supportcan you please post constructive feedback okay that makes sense as i hadnt considered that someone did post above though that when using the old name in a search it should still present the new name for for example if i search mr x itll show mr x if someone has taken the name recently and mr y who used to be mr xperhaps a security rating minimum could be implimented to prevent low security pirates from abusing this
how would pirates benefit from it and since when are pirates less trust worthy than the rest of the eve populationanyway reputation is too important in eve this is not a cheap generic mmo
who said they were or werent the security rating was just a suggestion and a direct response to someones consideration its probably even redundant given the other suggestions to prevent abusewho said it was thats twice youve drawn conclusions from out of nowhereif i was suggesting eve was a generic mmo id have just said paid name change no restrictions or conditions

current situation fleets can use broadcasts to share information in a compact form ranging from shoot this guy to warp to that planet to oh crap i need reps these are awesome tools and they work pretty well however watching the broadcast history window has one severe drawback its a real pain to actually pick out the targets that have been called and actually make use of that info in order to target the person who the broadcast is about you have to rightclick the broadcast and select lock target proposed change at minimum ctrlclick should target lock the subject of the broadcast  the person calling for reps on a rr broadcast or the item being targeted on a kill broadcast ideally have the rightclick menu treat the broadcast as if it were the topic of the broadcsast  ie you could get a target broadcast rightclick target rightclick orbit and then work with it as a target without ever having to pick it out of a cluttered overview obviously the overview will still work better  it wont scroll as fast for example  but working out of broadcast history will be an option of note  this would only apply to broadcasts about a target positionbased broadcastsneed backup broadcast location etc work this way asis benefits the simple version will make logistics pilots click about a billion fewer times in big combats the complex version will also improve everyones ability to coordinate fleets and improved ease of use for everyone as well as making it slightly easier to be a newtopvp pilot in a big fight drawbacks the only thing i can think of is that its possible that this will cause some extra lag for some weird reason the ctrlclick version certainly wont but im not sure about the rightclick menu version
seems reasonable to me
sounds decent and should make fcing or logistics a heck of a lot easier as well as normal members warp to member etcsupported

as we know the fleet window causes a bit of lag allready they will have to change it anyway so they might as well add this while there at it as long as it doesnt take too much performance ofc fleet bonus information would be good so yeah u got my support
blueprint management is a mess whether its distinguishing between originals and copies lockdown votes for 100s of bpos at a time or hoping that new guy who wants to build ammo doesnt cancel your chimera build i think its time to take a second look at how players interact with blueprintsi propose a library system where blueprints are essentially given their own distinct hangarsit would look something like thisin this example there are seven blueprint libraries that can have their roles controlled independently like corp hangars can today players can choose to interact with blueprints through the library or si tab but they can also add specific blueprints to their quickbar so they dont have to wade through the morass of rig bpos to find the couple they find the most profitable additionally lock and unlock votes can be initiated for an entire library greatly streamlining the security processeach library is divided into four sections two of these store the actual blueprints one for originals and one for copies never the two shall meet except when in the cargohold of a ship this negates the need for any fancyschmancy db overhaul to solve a major organizational headache as the game can still treat bpos and bpcs as the same object and only needs to look closer at them when they are being manipulated the third section is for jobs launched by blueprints in that library if a character does not have permission to access a library they will not be able to affect its associated jobstasks fleet finder for industrialistsin the tasks tab players can create a formal todo list specifying blueprints that need research copying or manufacturing in the future within a corporation the ability to do this is defined by an additional role however any player with access to the library will be able to initiate a job from that task provided the necessary materials are on handall tasks need three things specified the blueprint to be used the type of job to be done and the number of runs performed specifying a location without a specific slot is optional in the case of invention mandatory as is specifying the inputoutput hangarsadditionally to make this more useful to individual players a shopping list can be automatically compiled from the tasks list it can either be setup to buy all materials off market minus that in a specified hangar or to include materials that will be produced from other tasks in the list for instance capital ship components when building a cap shipsome additional features can be looked at for inclusion in this task system it might be possible for someone setting a task to freeze the blueprint until the specified task is completed disallowing any other jobs to be done on it additionally tasks may be set to repeat if for instance there was a blueprint that should be in nonstop copyingperhaps more controversially when executing a task the game might not check the role of the player executing it but the player who set it up thus a corp member need not have access to the hangar with all the materials can still build that marauder as the person who set up the task and specified the inputoutput hangars did have accessin summation this system would greatly improve ease of use security and productivity as well as providing a base that can be expanded upon in the future ifwhen the need arises
this feels like weapon grouping felt when i first heard about it  an idea that takes away the entire we want usabilityitll cause lag fight between players and ccp and replaces it with an idea that works well for everyone your idea is a bit rough around the edges i think but the core of the idea is just awesome 120 supported
i dont know how much lift a change like this would offer the casual industrialist that said i like the idea i can see folks who do a lot of manufacturingresearch and handle lots of blueprints loving this ideasupporting for further discussion if nothing else
supportedthis seems just to fit how ive always imagined industry working in eve im just surprised that ccp hasnt put it in yet
i like this idea i think with a little work on the task idea such as getting payed for doing tasks and you might just get corps that work a little bit more like corps shouldand the library system looks like an elegant solution to common problems i think both of these should be included in any discussion on a much needed overhaul to the corp interfaces which btw suck
yes
possibly one of the best ideas ive seen in a while
this is awesome you are awesome f yeahi like this idea
im very sorry but what you are proposing is beyond sillyi have macro express installed on my machine i have been using macro express for many years now what you are saying is that because this software could be used for macro mining that i would have to choose to either stop using a piece of software that i have paid for and used for many years or continue to use this software and not be allowed to play eveanother major flaw in your plan you do realise that you can create a macro to macro mine using nothing but microsoft wordif anybody has any programming language visual studio for example installed will you ban them as well from playing evei can appreciated that it is very hard to distinguish between a macro miner and somebody who is just mining afk when i mine i am afk for most of the time and if you sat there and watched me you would probably suspect i was a macro miner but im not i imagine that can be said for many other peoplehowever what your suggesting is just plain silly im very sorry
kara  i wouldnt call it silly as all im trying to pass along here is what someone else did to solve the problem you just dont agree with a possible fix and you are very much entitled to that opinion furthermore if you read thru additional posts probably something ive tried to emphasis here is targeting the macro programs that are made commercially available specifically for the purpose of evemacro playing not the the commonly used business applications also it would stand bear additional reading as you would notice that ive already said that people who have programming skills can beat an application like this maybe you have the requisite skill sets but really you assume that everyone does and that is very much not the case
it makes no difference whether the majority of people have the skills are not you only need 1 person who has that skill and its game over because they will just release the information on the webif any thing you could make the situation worse as if you limit macro mining to those few they will just money out of it i know i wouldeither way once the information is out there its out therei understand targeting applications that have been written for the sole purpose of macro playing eve but that still leaves the 100s of other applications that you havent targeted you have to target all of them otherwise it is a waste of time and resources because will just use those applications that you havent targetedthe only real way to discourage macro mining is to make more of a risk going afk more rats more often and more powerful but because of the way the game is designed ie high sec belts having no rats this is not an optioni apologise to you for calling it silly that was out of line and remiss of me i hope you accept my apologises as they are sincere if anything you should be congratulated for at least trying to come up with a solution
i like the idea of combating macromining but instead of taking an offensive measure against everyones comp how about taking a proper defensive measure in the software i would propose something along the lines that has been used for 5 years now to keep bots away on many a website picture test many forms could be used from requiring to type a word from a picture to being directed to press a certain button real easy as the pop up has already in the software it just needs to be modified for when you target and are about to mine an asteroid it would create a popup that says something like you are about to mine an asteroid please type code xxxx in picture and something that cant be easily read by a machine but desernable by the human eye or have it come up with like 3 buttons and ask to press the right one please press the square to many failures could alert concord or something like that my thoughts is if your too incapable of pressing the right button or a simple type this you probably shouldnt be playing this game
in my exp over the past 1 12 years doing invention i have made 70  80 profit margin continually thats covering my cost and 7080 more some things to consider in t2 production 1 who can use what your making is it a mainstream item or is this a small market item that requires tons of skill points  this is going to effect how much you sell and in the end your profit margin as items that dont sell fast get flooded on the market and there prices drop horribly2 knowing your market and where to sell if you sell your stuff in jita you better be a volume seller as the profit margins in that area are the sux 3 i think the biggest mistake people make here is they train up the relevant skills with out doing any research for the demand of a product or where to sell it to maximize profit and when they get the news flash that its already a flooded item on the market with nearly no profit margin they get angry you should watch the market in the region you want to sell pick the item in question figure out the costs involved and how much you will make and then research how much dose the sell price fluctuate in a 23 month period generally you need to create a excel spread sheet to properly calculate this complex equation invention is not for everyone some people are more suited to role of miner its alot simpler in the end i think this has little to do with bpo and more to do with supply and demand and the lack of research of those getting into invention and item creation
im still a bit of a newbiebut would it make sense that the insurance paid out is a bit more smarterif you are the instigator and your ship blows up in high sec then you do not get your insurance so for exmapleif i go ninja someone and they blow me up they should not get insurancehowever if i go ninja someone and start stealing their loot then i am the instigator i do not get insurance when my ship blows upjust a thought
your reasoning is wrong because the loot of the npc you killed is not yours until it is in your cargoholdthe ninja gets flagged to you but he did not do anything wrong it is you by shooting first that is instigating the fight giving him the right to shoot backalso i dont understand what it has to do with insurance at all those ninjas are just poor little scavengers defending themselves against evil mission runners in uber faction fitted battleshipsnot supported
reasoning was was that i was just taking salvage and the guy shot at meso he should not get insurance by being blown up by ccphoweverif i stole the cargoloot within his wrecks  so i am agressor then i should not get insurance when i get blown uphe stated after the fact that his insurance was worth the shot to try to shoot at me b4 ccp shows upmiro
if you are right i am supporting this
this i havent tested this but if youre right ye gods is that silly can someone confirmdeny ops allegations
if true this should be fixededit recent experience shows this to be truesupporting
thats messed up fix it
an excellent idea the medal system is another one off those things ccp created and then abandoned far to soon

conceivably concord could also offer a 30day free trial of their protection service to every new pod pilot to drum up businessand of course there could be refinements like paying moreless for fasterslower response by morefewer shipsthe gameplay possibilities are interesting
ccp dont have to concede anything as they determine the nature of the gameindustrial content and harsh consequences hardcore are not mutually exclusivepvp is not exclusive to combat so an industrial expansion shows nothingeve was never meant to be pure pvp merely nonconsensual pvpim sure i could find some more wrong with this if i actually thought about italso supporting this or i would if it had its own thread hint hint
there are broker fees transaction fees lab rent fees  so on presume that taxes go to empire  the to local police

lol those two posts made me laugh and thanks for making it easier to quote them both lol anyway i have ganked and ive been ganked both are equally amusing lol however i like the idea of being able to spray graffiti on the walls in a jail cell not so sure about your time frames though i saw someone who had better times which were in minutes that way it wont really effect player game play also restricted them to newbie shipsshuttlesspecial ships thus allowing them the ability to still play but limited though ive heard of people ganking in a newbie ship still yet to see it lol also thought i saw an idea about the person who got ganked would have the ability to press charges love the idea but that one should cost isk being that you would have to hire a lawyer etc yahdahyahdahnice counter by the way im still laughing in fact i think i screwed up a couple words above lol concord are police meaning the taxes from npc corpsfactions covers the cost in empire space just like your property and state income taxes if your in the united states covers city county and state police as well as your federal taxes covering federal police forces such as the fbi and us marshals when you create a player corp you are essenially still paying those taxes with office rentals every month what you purposed would be an awesome idea for sov space where a sov space holder could contract npcs to police theyre space concord and highsec exist for the new players if it was nothing but a free for all your new players wouldnt play long being they would constantly be getting destroyed you would end up with a group of veterans that would slowly diminish and leave the game for other games thus destroying eveanyway should give the pod the ability to avoid concord and the longer they avoid concord the higher theyre bounty goes up if they are caught the bounty vanishes but they also spend longer in jail this would increase the number of bounty hunters something in this game i believe is seriously lacking also need a formal merc contracting system for mercs to really have a good job but then again i guess you could just call that player funded missions
im not sure if its come through well enough what ive been meaning to say the ecm should have a less efficiency than it has now so as you wont find yourself constantly jammed being a chance based module this may happen once every cycle for a period of time being chance based but you may also never get a jam off even on a frigthe cycle time is simply to allow it to hit more targets as the consequence is less when jammed if youre up against a single target i would personally prefer losing lock 5 times in 10 sec than being unable to do anything at allthe correct number on a falcon is more about 11 with just the falcon skill with upgrades and rigs however you can push 14 points so if you take the scenario of a 14 point ecm and a 19 point eccm on the ares the correct answer is a 73 jam chance with 1 racial jammer this is indeed very often compared to an eccmd bs the number is 325 chance in the case of a domi cause i love them all this is high but if you half the effect of the jam module with the mentioned effect or whatever seems appropriate its honestly not badthe eccm module is indeed a bit useless atm it can be used for two things atm making yourself unprobable or reducing the chance of getting jammed this without no actual positive effect on the ship like a sebo has this module should indeed be looked into ive kinda semisuggested above that the sebo and eccm could be thrown together in a single module and be scripted this would mean the cycle time needed to be very long tho so as to not allow instascripting something like 3060 secondsi very much like the idea of an indicator for the jam this could be usefull for all the ewar mods tbh as is you only get the ewar module on the ov if successful same with the small timebar on your hud id like another effect like a sound indeed
decreased effectiveness in successfully jamming did not come across at least to me in the original postif i am jammed i know i am out of the action for 20 seconds i can use that time to gather intel on the fight check my scanner look for new targets on the field make calls on numb nutz that do stupid things both friendly as well as enemy i would rather do that then be constantly spamming to lock targets because my lock is being brokeni wont quote the other paragraphs but responding in ordermath bleagh i dont have a good idea on what to do about eccms gimpyness combining sensor boosters and eccm does not work since sb reduce lock times and extend lock ranges you would end up with a 3rd script or have to drop one of the current scripts making the sb decrease lock time and put range and better vs jamming scripts on eccm has logic on its side then again there is not a single fit i use where increasing lock range though the eccm fitting would be of use to me its not like i am gonna give up a tracking disruptor on my arbi to fit the new eccm even though it is the one ship i would find it useful onthe fail indicator is a really good idea just came up with it while thinking about your post it would provide validation that your commitment to using eccm is paying off or not i might have to make a separate proposal just for that idea
doing missions as a none caldari i find it unfair that i cant change my damage type caldari already have the best tanking ships out and best docking games ships too with shield rechargeable tooi think with scripts we can change damage type take angels for example lazers do bad damage on them but as caldari i can just change my missiles add some painters and do max damagehere are some ideaslazers script  your em  thermal damage will do 100 more damage to structures and 50 more damage to shield however your tracking is reduced by 50 and your total armor hitpoints reduced by 25missiles script  you now deal 50 more damage to targets within 30 of your optimal range capped at 30km of you however your capacitor will be reduced by 50hybrid script  your hits will set off a smartbomb like effect which do 50 of the actual damage dealt however ew modules will have a 50 reduced range and cost 100 more cap to activateprojectile script  50 of your projectile damage will pierce through shield ignoring it and doing armor damage only if armor is  0 hull will not be affected however your optimal range is reduced by 50 and you no longer benefit from propulsion modules eg mwdthis wont be changing the damage but it makes things a little interesting
worst proposal in a long timethink of the big picture this would affect a lot more than your carebear world two pointers1 eve is not fair a all learn to live with it2 cross train to caldari

wow dude just for this i am not voting for cat
this
both the rapier and the huginn have a useless bonus tp bonus replace the tp bonus with a 5 web strength bonus per level
minmatar recons are fine quit whining
web  tp  minmatar recon  5 torp launcher phoon  winnot supported
tp bonus is far from useless its just people dont know when or how to use it
thisbut the panther should get torps then to pair with the rapier
learn to play the game and stop whining
first lets agree that the interesting bonuses of the recons are the bonuses that dont come from the t1 hull as such the lacharazu is only interesting because of the scram bonus and the pilgrimcurse because of the neut bonus etc in this light the rapier is a total failure the truth of the matter is that if the painter bonus means so much to you youre almost certainly better off bringing a vigil or bellicose the vigil even boasts better survivabilitysimply put the huginn and rapier were too crushed by the nano nerf but then im sure we could get the same crowd as above to tell us that the arazu is already overpowered because of its scram range bonuslianged in case it wasnt obvious id rather have functional usable bonuses on all my ships bonuses that are usually ignored rep bonuses on the brutix damp bonuses on the arazu etc are a strong sign that something is drastically wrong fortunately we arent quite to the point that people are like lolwebswhywouldufitthat but we arent terribly far off if a bunch of major forum personalities are raving about a painter bonus
if the heavy assault missile bonus was changed to a web strength bonus the huginn would be a happy ship webtp and ships die in a dramatic fashion
you dont use tds on your curse
the neut bonus is far and away the more interesting bonus tds arent totally useless neither are rsds for that matter  but if all you were interested in was tding youd probably be in an arbitrator even still the td is a much better damage mitigator than webs with the ever decreasing amount of blasters and increasing turret range pretty much everyone else can still reach you through web rangeliang
there is nothing weak about having 40km 60 webs the omfg i hit a brick wall effect is gone for everyone as for arazu taking its role well idk the last few arazu pilots tackling me ended up with a 150m wreck because 18km range is not so awesome fortunately so few arazu pilots fit damps ever so theyre quite easy to killsure the ships got nerfed with the nanonerf but honestly a ton of ships got hit preety hard in the nanonerf and the rapier and huginn if you dont need the cloak is still reasonably often seen and a fundamentally useful reconits not a murdering machine like the curse which is btw still far from unkillable also it does not sport a covops cloak like the rapier but its still a very useful recon
the reason that arazu pilots dont fit damps is because they almost certainly wont keep you out of lock range you can reasonably expect to be locked at 1520km even if they arent sporting a sensor booster or have a high natural lock range recons really damps are worth fitting maybe 10 of the time and 90 of the time the massive ehptank liability will get you killed small wonder nobody fits them also faction scrams are nice and actually worthwhile as opposed to webs outside fed navycomments first those 40km webs arent as useful when you cant tackle someone at that range anything over 2428km is kinda yay but really pretty meh 60 webs are less of a speed hit than a scramneut  which makes the arazu and curse flat better at brick walling someone that relies on speed in any real sense all these nano ships have pretty awesome range these days  which makes 40km webs look a little meh either they warp away or youre close enough that theyre going to tear you a new anyway i have no intention of flying rapiers when i have arazus and curses at my fingertipsliang
you make it sound that the rapier is only flown solo how about arazu points the ship and rapier holds it within range of the arazujust a thought
proposal active eccm module decreases jam cycle time to zero or so if jam was successful  u simply lose lock on target instead of increasing sensor strengthwhyeccm modules takes 1 med slot but gives almost nothing even if u are a recon with eccm like 60 sensor points u can still be jammed by 5 small ecm drones sic and even for few jam cycles in successionand 20 seconds of jam is pretty enough to take overwhelming advantage over your target whatever it isresult1 u still can escape from the enemy using ecm drones or dualbox falcon but u dont have guarantees of easy kill more 2 jam will still counter logistics and rr battleships but u cannot disable eccmed logistics with just a bunch of small ecm drones more3 more variety in cruisersized and bc ships fitting necessity of a choice between eccm and web now choice is obvious because eccm is totally useless for this shipsps i have made many tests before posting this and also i am experienced solosmall gang pvper so please abstain from posts like whine more n00bediting in progress
not supported ecm has gone from guaranteed jam to chance basethe falcon from 200km to 70kmusing your examplethe arazu has a sensor strength of 26 with a singlt eccm iiit rises to 5096a falcon with t2 fit has a jamming strength of between 1113 for each racialthis give you less than 25ecm has been nerfed enough
boost eccmcounterproposal  eccm should half the effects of any ewar on you if its some  effect like tdpainterwebdampener and make onoff effects like ecm and scrambler fail 50 of the time
some things you need to include for it to be workablewhat reason is there to use more than one eccm no other counter has the power to completely eliminate its opposed ewarwhat happens to eccm arrays lowslots less time reduction if so then why not make it a general reduction in jammedtime and forego the lockbreakinghow will the ecm boats survive against fast lockers frigs sebo cruisers etc if they fit eccm without a huge decrease in ecm cycle time the level of twitch clicking to get away from an interceptor will be insane so ecm needs to be included in fixas you can probably see there is no easy way to solve the issue without a major rethink of the whole shebang once that is the case we might as well start reimagining the whole ewar concept to give meaning to damps and tps as well  he mentions ecm drones jamming the eccm toting recon which they do regularly  they are very very brokenas for the nerfed enough  define nerf so far all the changes except the one that made it chance based have worked towards balancing ecm when compared to alternatives  less rangemore powermore offence less strengthmore bonusesi think that even the most hardcore ecm lovers saw the problem with having 150200km jamming so not really a nerf
ecm is fine as it is i might want a couple tweaks around the margins  ecm drones need a slight nerf for example  but the core mechanics work well as it is dont change them
ecm drones have already a really low jamming strength how do you want to nerf them more
1 need nerf ecm  hate ecm drones
in practice its not that low ive run tests of identical ship fits fighting each other on sisi one with ecm drones one with dps the ecm fit wins a big majority of the time on ships with no drone bonus even before you consider that ecm breaks scrams and dps drones dont i consider an ecm drone nerf to be much less important than a webtddamppaint drone buff but its at least something sane to propose
an ecm drone nerf would really be unnecessary if the other drones were boosted furthermore i would argue that dedicated ecm ships have been nerfed enough i have two very good ecm pilots and neither one has been in an ecm ship since the nerf just bring moar deeps makes the battlefield seem very two dimensional deeps vs eehpsliang
if theyre going to garuntee faction mods you will very soon find all your favorite hunting spots camped 237 by people who will delight in taking your faction mods as well as the one dropped by the shipssorry i dont think i can support this
cant support thisnot even when asked in chinese or korean
you havent done much 00 ratting have you lol faction spawns dont spawn in one place all the time lolpeople are not going to be waiting for you lol thats just a ridiculous notionand wholly supporting my ideaif you dont support then at least come up with good tangible reasons for it because i will fully scrutinise you on it
you havent done much 00 ratting have you lolif every faction spawn dropped mods the mods would be a fraction of their current value and you wouldnt be as excited when you see one it is a roll of the dice mostly youll get ammo but there is a chance you can make big bank thats what gets people all excited
fine point however my concern is that the drop rate seems to be getting worse i would say out of 10 faction rats i have had only 1 has dropped something and it was still not muchif your talking about market prices fine make faction spawns more spawnable and then keep the drop low you cant have it both ways it defeats the purpose of finding a faction spawn why make it rare if at the end theres naff all in it
faction mods are expensive partly because they are nice but mostly because they are rarely dropped from rarely spawned npcs if you want every faction rat dropping a mod but maintain the same drop rate youll end up almost no one ever seeing a faction spawn i have heard the likelihood of getting a drop goes down as you get further from the time the server booted up im not sure the validity of that but i think all the faction loot ive found was not too long after the server booted up
dont touch them  you will have several side effects on the market faction mods will get cheaper  everyone will fit them  regular t2 mods no one wants them anymore etcno no everything fine with it
the commanderinchief seems to have changed his mind locking this thread now as it no longer has any content
hmm lemme think about this you want me and many others like me to bring our expencive hulks and orcas into 00 for what exactly if its to mine well pretty much i can mine everything i need either in high sec or in whs and the risks are marginal even in a wh compared to oh i dont know having a carrier or two dropped on me for fun nahh you want us in 00 then start giving us t2 and t3 ships and capital ships untill then have fun in empty space we will be thinking about you while hiding in empire space p
so what youre saying is that you dont like racial outposts and want them all to be the same

prior to this latest csm council getting minutes at all was a hitormiss event that left the playerbase more in the dark than knowledgeable about what was brought up and what got tossed in the round fileteadaze has done a very very good job of keeping the minutes up to date and relatively clear cut in an understandable format something should be done to maintain that level of care taken with the minutes to be quite sure

yup supported maybe evegate will offer csm more tools for creating their own official news stream one can hope
they are called npc corp channels
it could be feasible by checking the number of runs left on a blueprint if that number is null then its an original if not then its a copy even if the server had to do this for every single item on killmails involving blueprints it wouldnt take much processing power since it would only happen when ships die carrying a blueprintbasically adding this to whatever program spits out killmails should be easycheck if theres a blueprintif yes check the blueprints runsif null bpo otherwise bpcthe main problem is that the server might no longer know if a blueprint has any runs or not after its destroyed but ccp should still look at it its possible that theyd have to store the blueprints data differently or add null blueprint data productivity runs etc to every single item the former would require a lot of reprogramming and the later would take up a lot of cpu
wow dude just ing quit simple game over dude game over
potentially the worst candidate possible if your vote here you should just install wow and be done with it
i am curious what rock you have lived under and what ankhhblablabla actually paid you to write the above sentence when her statements and public message is the exact opposite to rational thought and logic
your suggestion that you work for a rich elitist gaming company is offensive to the actual rich elitist gaming companies of the world
so since apparently everyone has been living under a rock according to you which attempts did she make during her time in the csm to ban pvp
the suicide gank issue was only balanced because csm1 would only support it if she changed her original over the top proposal to something more balanced her original proposal wouldve essentially made it impossible for suicide ganking to existso the issue isnt balanced because of her  its balanced because of the other csm members in csm1its fine if you want to vote for ank  people have different ideas about the game and just because i dont agree with them does not make them inherently invalid but do make sure youre informed properly
inappropriate content removedapplebabethe issue document as stands has not been changed in any shape or form none of the other csm contributed to it in any way it is balanced because i made it balanced the rest of the csm had no part in it and i always wanted suicide ganking to remain a possibility it should just have harsher consequences which all csm agreed with and ccp agreed with too or else concord would not have had the buffs it had eh and the fun thing is that i didnt request concord to be buffed i asked for tradeable killrights overhauling the bounty system booting gankers from npc corps and more ways to prevent known criminals hiding behind concordremember my very first campaign video im saying we need more consequences for these scumbags not we need to make suicide ganking impossiblei thought you were a honest candidate but seeing you fling mud and sprout false accusations here and on tweakers really changed my opinion of you
it is impossible to inform myself properly with all the disinformation in this topic many accusations have been made against ankh and when i look into them half of them are clearly false and the other half are dubious at best when i look at ankhs campaign message her videos and her explanations i do not see a whiny carebear i see an intelligent highly motivated woman that participates in these elections due to an inner drive to contribute to the eve community i see someone willing to represent me and does not hesistate to voice criticism to ccp when their policies and decissions are not in the interest of the players i see a strong personality that goes against all odds i greatly respect ankh for being willing to keep up with it despite the negativity thrown at her ankh just said your claim about the proposal is false do you have anything to back up your claim
ha ha listening to a politicians propaganda
id believe that sooner than the rambling of other politicians flinging mud in a campaign thread that isnt their own
if you had any sense you wouldnt listen to either
well i verified the chatlogs of that meeting and it turns out the issue itself wasnt adjusted by the csm as i originally thought it was over 2 years ago so i apologise for that however what did happen was during the discussion with ccp when we talked about this issue that ank did suggest some measures that would make it very difficult or impractical almost immediate concord response much harder sec status hits etc other csm members did argue against such harsh measures this was done as part of the discussion with ccp eventually we reached an agreement on slightly improving the sec status hit on the short term i guess i got the meetings mixed up in my memories p
and where did i say everyone in my response to stevakis hm i hear with a bit of social engineering you can make anyone believe pretty much anything as there is no patch for human stupidity
i find that very hard to believe because the meeting minutes mention nothing of this and because the meeting minutes make it sound as if ccp already had made up their mind that being that the ganking was too much in favor of the aggressor and needed fixing before the meeting i also find this hard to believe because ankh just posted details that contradict your accusations and your other accusation have just turned out to be false that and if you look at ankhs first video and her posts from earlier elections you dont see her calling for concord buffs but for playerdriven means of dealing with criminal players sorry i believe ankhs story here
ah got it just repeat some lies and slander over and over in someones campaign thread and hope people believe that
fixed it for you and pretty much
candidate claims to be independant but is in a large alliancecandidate claims to support fair play but willingly abused standings against caldari fwerscandidate claimed to have a uo pvp server when in fact she turned off the pvp because of the sort of player pvp games attract tranquility is a pvp servercandidate has in the past openly supported the vandalism and defacement of other peoples property just because of their playstylecandidate claims to have been in ccps employment when she was notcandidate prefers solo play and not participating with others eve is an mmocandidate is unable to make the distinction between actions in a video game and actions in real life eve encourages and allows players to be badcandidate was previously caught using alts in other csm elections to slander other candidates and bump her own threadthere is a very good chance that this candidate will not be taken seriously by other csm members and possibly ccp stafflies and slander
all of it in fact
well this only proves one thing you are completely incapable of arguing with anyone or in thinking through other opinions and being rational about them ccp market this game as a harsh and dark game of pvp where you are never ever safeeven if docked thanks to your friendly neighbourhood scammers and this person appears to be completely against pvp in general unless its a certain type i will continue ganking people thank you very much as will my friends we are literally gankers in arms and get to plan roams the next day whilst doing rl stuff
you left outcandidate thinks puzzle pirates a kiddies game for christsakes i mean really is vastly superior to eve
the meetings took two days the minutes are what 20 pages or so condensation and loss of side debates are virtually inevitable funny because some are literal truth and most are at least reasonable you are in a large alliance talking about how youre an independent candidate you did admit to altbumping your csm1 thread you do have ccp as an employer on your cv you do primarily play solo and eve is an mmo whether those are meaningful or good reasons to vote against you is a matter of opinion but they are simple facts and hardly lies
this ok done ireadyerblogmay you spill about the blood of your enemies
you have my vote if only for being the only candidate that i know of that actually answers questions instead of criticizingmind you i only know of 3 candidates but still
2 for sokjoin the cool kids vote for sok
hes so cool he has to bump his own thread ho well guess he has enough puppets voting for him tell me does aaa order its members to vote for their candidate
no we dont we let people make up their own minds and at least im not ordering my supporters to bump my thread with useless replies 
all i can say about suicide ganking is from the person being sploded side of the experience i know a lot of my corp mates avoid a variety of systems with their hulks because of the high number of folks that seem to be suiciding their hulks as i said i think it needs to remain a part of eve that said it needs to be properly balanced as any action of riskreward is the insurance adjustments looks to be on target to tweak that balanceso my official position on suicide ganking1 valid part of eve2 should be balanced like any riskreward experience in eve is3 me hopes i dont get sploded again but if i do well just another day in space issler dainzetrying not to be suicide ganked but if i am i know its just the sort of thing you can expect to face if you undock
yeah tbh most people who gank hulks just do so for s and gigglesnerfing that would be hard hauler ganking on the other hand one runs the risk of the loot popping or another player swiping it before your hauler arrives something which has happened to me multiple times so while i agree that nerfing insurance may be a good idea it seems that suicide ganking is not on the whole terribly unbalancedone last question iirc you said some very harsh things about pirates in the wake of larkonisgate do you stand by those
i am really glad you brought this up i was not critical of pirates i was critical of lark who was just a really bad pirate in the context of the scandal a really good pirate would not have been so obvious and would have made a fortunewhat i thought was the biggest saddness in the lark scandal is he represtned a very important segment of eve and in a moment of drunken weakness he managed to have a pro pirate csm get replaced by me a pretty much care bearish csm he did his support base a big diservicei think lark is an interesting person and had some great ideas for eve i understand stupid drunken decision making and i can tell you if there was ever a place to be drunk and make bad choices it is iceland i was sad what he did was so amaturish and resulted in him not being able to continue to drive his good ideas forward i expect more from a good pirateyou should also realize the general grumpiness i exhibited when i replaced lark was as much at ccp as lark i found out almost a week later third hand as ccp didnt bother to let me know i was being upgraded to part of the official csm i also found less than a warm welcome in the csm i was thrust into and i was also expected to be effective after the one time in the csm term when you really could make a difference the face to face iceland meetingso dont confuse my comments when i was asked to replace lark as antipirate i just wanted lark as maybe the first real pirate in the csm to have been better at it i expect if lark was honest he would agree in a perfect world i would have prefered he had either been way more clever about his use of inside information which would have been epic eve pirate or that he would have had a couple less of the horrible icelandic liquor shots and had not tried to make a small profit because honestly he was doing a great job supporting the player base that voted him in i was not able to do much for the folks i represent in the remainder of his term and certainly did nothing for his player baseso in summary i am not antipirate or antilark i am anti excess icelandic brennivin abuse in the csm lark is an epic eve pirate that deserved to do better by eve and the csm and i blame brennivin i am sure my support for pirates might confuse some folks that see me as a care bear please realize i love the riskreward part of eve and all care bears should embrace that in eve danger should  huge isk that is what i want for every care beari hope that make senseissler dainzea csm candidate that is a care bear that also likes pirates because they will create the risk that makes me rich

im voting mazz cuz she is an internet girl with the perky asian thing going on and she doesnt make a complete idiot of her self go mazz etc
thats very unfortunate because over time eve will lose players to more modern games that have uis that dont suck assthis market niche is begging for a competitor and you can bet that when one comes along it will have a ui that supports addons even ultima online supports them these days for petes sake and you can get much older than that
what is your position on easyinstant travel or logistics like static jump bridges jump freighters carriers and warptozero
several votes coming your way good work
youre on lolx
ive voted twice for and fully support cat for csm
cripes this guy looks like an inverted ankh im honestly not sure which of them is the more revolting
ill take it as a compliment
so you are all about risk vs rewardright what is you position on the existence of over extensive blue listswhile 00 does provide risk for the individual pilot and his income the political landscape in 00 has evolved to a point where for most alliances only internal strife or getting harrgothed pose any significant risksure if you want to introduce more risk in lvl 4s how about balancing this by limiting the numbers of blues a supposedly bad ass alliance can have to keep them on their feet as welllimit in number limit in pilots numbers something not obviously subvertable maybe limited in distance from their core spacegoal removal of game mechanics that allow half of 00 to blue up
eve needs more pvp so i voited for u gl mate 
this is one tough question i havent got an decisive answer fori dont want to have ingame limit on the blue list it will be pointless because players will just arrange coalitions outofgame even now it happens when we are told not to shoot neutrals but if ccp will introduce some mechanic to limit blue list such nrds will become more common and the objective wont be achieved anyway also powerblocs lead to epic fights with epic fun i enjoy this and i dont want them gone from the gameon the other hand the landscape in 00 is too stale for my taste but its downside of dominion mechanics ccp wanted to give a chance for the smaller alliances to hold their space and devs were successful now its completely possible for a smaller alliances to have corner of their own to call home but it also means that its almost impossible to capture space of the stronger entity if ccp will listen to whose who advocate smaller gang objectives the smaller entities wont be able to compete once more because its easier for a large alliance to have their fleets in various parts of the region also the epic fights will be gone so i dont like this solution at allits even possible that solution do not exist at all its in human nature to group to blob strength in numbers but in real life the downside of big army is the logistical nightmare that comes with it its hard to supply and feed large group of people in eve with the introduction of jump freighters logistic is not as difficult as it was maybe if it was really difficult to supply large blobs we would see less of them  i think that the introduction of jump freighters was big mistake ccp hasnt weighted all possible consequences and there are plenty1 space became smaller because its easy now with a little amount of work to get supplies from jita to any corner of 00 the feeling that you live in the outskirts is gone2 freighter convoys are almost nonexistent they were really nice feature in the game convoys made pirates life amusing and the alliances who wanted to strike the enemy where it hurts most could lay down the trap for their convoy 3 as a stated above it also made formation of blobs easier now you dont need to think how to supply your massive army few players with jump freighters will make it happen even if i would like to see jfs removed from the game i understand that its impossible now if their jump range would be nerfed it should help a little but im not entirely sure how it would affect the game in the long run only thing that is obvious  the logistic should not be as easy as it is now ps thank you for the question it is good one and it allowed me to ponder a problem from the different perspective
i took the liberty to adjust a quote of yours a tad to be more correctbasicly your saying here youre not csm candidate for all eve players but only for those who fit in your playstyleyou say that risk versus reward should be more in balance now i look back at hulkageddonhowmany hulks in that campaign were destroyed in null sec and low sec and howmany were ganked in high secdoesnt that mean that a miners ship in high sec is more at risk than in null secas for smaller alliances getting their foothold in null sec i can only say thisthey can get a foothold if the big boys around dont mind if they dont want you there you have null chanceits easy to say to remove insurance as a whole when you have an alliance pulling in billions per day from null sec mining plexing and ratting so the whole concept of it all hurting a lot in null sec is voidsuicide ganking in high sec when done propperly the risk versus reward is also not really present you can get a lot out of itow and i live in null sec and then in empire again and then again in null sec so i do know both sides of the pictureempire is in game for a reason and by just shoving that aside its pretty clear that you only play a narrow part in the game and as such only have a narrow vision about the gamethis is all my personal opinion and has nothing to do with my corporation alliance
do not twist my words i am candidate for the people who enjoy pvp and i havent claimed anything else but bear in mind that eve is a pvp game are you really so clueless hulks in nullsec are more careful andor they are guarded by the corp mates gankers know this and only few would dare to try to hunt for hulks in 00  on the other side miners in highsec for whatever reason feel perfectly safe and because of their carelessness they died and will die its perfectly reasonable dont you think so rl politics look just the same  smaller countries listen to what more powerful say insurance removal will hurt everyone in case of 00 mostly the alliance wallets will suffer but they will suffer nonetheless it needs lots of work and preparation or just stupidity of the victim to be profitable anyway its fine it should be so
how do you feel about certain people in your corp somehow ratting 237 in mjxwp and rcivl in delve behave almost as if not controlled by player
your exact words were may i ask who appointed you god and the one being to say who is and who isnt fit for this game are you really so clueless hulks in nullsec are more careful andor they are guarded by the corp mates gankers know this and only few would dare to try to hunt for hulks in 00  on the other side miners in highsec for whatever reason feel perfectly safe and because of their carelessness they died and will dieyou try to rebottle by pointing out that mining in null sec is way more dangerous due to the fact that there are no concord and other penaties against those who attack hulks however you do forget to mention the fact that every null sec alliance has at the very least 1 intell channel anyone approaching a miningop can be detected many jumps out alreadyheck back in 2004 we even managed to provide intell on enemy ship movements towards mining ops ok given its not 100 failsafe but stillsuicide gankers who want to blow up your hulk in empire high sec arent that easy detected there is no blue  red  grey list in high sec because that would cripple high sec operations as a wholethe mining ops i have seen in 00 were a lost of time taking place in scanned out belts and a lot of times in systems where there are pos to hop to when trouble heads their wayso once again what makes mining in null sec more dangerous than mining in high sec its perfectly reasonable dont you think so rl politics look just the same  smaller countries listen to what more powerful saywhy are you so eager to pull real life politics and all into a game if you want to pull in reality then under what category would you place the expansion and warlust of the socalled powerblocksthe need to urge everyone to go shoot and kill just for the sake of more territorail gainyou make it sound like the wild west but on that note even the wild west grew up at some point insurance removal will hurt everyone in case of 00 mostly the alliance wallets will suffer but they will suffer nonethelessow i think a few trillion isk gathered over time can withstand some replacing which once again makes the grip that powerblocks have on certain spots in eve more solidthe real big battles would evaporate if there wasnt a fat alliance wallet in the back and as a result the movement in the political and social structure in 00 would eventually grow stale it needs lots of work and preparation or just stupidity of the victim to be profitable anyway its fine it should be soquote
i think you dont have to look further than the meeting minutes to see the valuable contribution teadaze has made to the csm the improved communication has been noticed many thanks and votes for that
i voted for teadaze for the simple reason that he apparently does his job well seems to work well with others and didnt come across as an arrogant condescending douchebag like elise

another person in the forums that has something meaningfull to say we are up to 2 well 3 counting myself but tht would just be bragging but to answer you yes i know but where would the fun be in that besides they only give you a couple thousand characters to use when typing here and when you have a lot to say then you have to bag the paragraphs and punctuation or you end up running over into the next window and if someone gets a word in sidewise it just messes up the continuity of the whole thoughts and people get confused etc realy take old hershal and nicky starstumbler here i dont think they could actuall keep the whole idea straight in their heads without taking notes and reading what i typed out loud i hopes this here explanation is oks wit you and that you will notice that i done added a couple of them para whatevers and a couple puntures like you axed fur

just like armstrong custer but how do you tell the fanilies of all the people killed fighting for something nobody wanted it was just the us diplomats and war mongers against the chinese diplomats and their war mongers going to toe toe and using everyone caught in the middle as pawns some say jane fonda was either the greatest patirot or the greatest traiter since benidict arnold but i will tell you here and now that westmoreland was the biggest toy solider in the known world for all time we fought and a lot died so that you and people like you can get online or write or protest your narrow minded little heads off and if i had to i would still do it again i can spent most of my life working disaters either nature or man made one way or another i have done everything i could to protect and help the injured and hungry and the lost and i will continue to do so till either i cant or i die who have you helped lately anyone at all and i am not talking about dropping money in somebodies hat i mean help help like take a first responders course learn cpr stop to help someone thats fallen down or hurt dont worry i dont expect an answer from you or anyone else bet i get some santimonious twit that does though anyway my point if you havent figured it out is yes i am a loud mouth yes i am a buthole yes i have things to say yes yes yes i am all of that and more but at least i stand up and shout it to the world and try to fix what is wrong have you ever tried to fix anything little man may you all live in intresting times and remember for evile to take over it only requires that good menwoman do nothing i allways get that quote a little wrong everytime but its still the truth
u mad cuz thats a whole lot of words that dont seem to have much of a point or much in the way of formatting seriouslets be clear here im not the one whos been throwing around homophobic and transphobic remarks in this thread you were as much as many eve players are wont to do it attempting to insult someone by questioning their sexuality is not only bigoted but idiotic as well it is immature juvenile and frankly repellent i could lecture you further but i rather suspect i would be wasting my breathoh and for the record im not herschels alt despite our names tangential similarities sadly im just not that cool seriousedit wow that post was so long you needed two parts for itto be quite honest i fail to see how youre doing anything in this thread except crying about how ccp declined to allow you to stand for the csm venting your spleen against asians gays and general westmoreland and providing us with a fascinating example of stream of consciousness gone horribly wrong judging by everything youve posted here they made the right decision
this thread is awesome
after reading this thread in its entirety its been quite a rollercoaster  i would tend to agree with the above
elf lord will provail
did i not say at the end somone would miss the point and object to something seriously mayo did you ever ever use any derogative words did i say  got queer fruit fudge packer or anything else i have no idea where you are actually from but in new orleans and most of my gay friends around the world think the term screaming when refering to some gays is totally acceptable and taken in the same manner that coonass is for cajuns from la that would be the state of louisianna in the southern united states i am a coonass and damn proud of it at no point in what i said before was in any way offensive in fact i defended pretty much everyone rights to be and do the things they are and want to be i gave examples of good and bad of both kinds and considering how many people use the term thats gay and yet that ok but not when i use the term seems somewhat narrow minded on your part its ok for some folks but not others and those people arent homo phobes or the other thing you called me and seriously hershel a japanese male actually called hershael not in the real world and if it was their ansesters would disown them and to make a mockery of yamamotos honored name is way beyond offencsive anf makes you by your definations for myself even worse a bigot

well back in csm3 we managed to get ccp to agree to dedicate at least 1 team to industry related projects for each expansion while that is a fairly broad agreement ccp did ask for us to provide a list of issuesideas for them to work from as well as their own backlog after asking what the players thought were the most pressing issues here  here a lot of people focussed on the ui area of the game as well as expanding on how production  science could evolve more from the looks of planetary interaction this seems to be the road that ccp is taking allowing player creation of previously npc seeded goods one of the major points was that a massive  of minerals were being supplied by loot and that has prompted ccp to look at reducing that mineral source in tyrannisfollowing on from that id like to see lowlevel production and production chains fleshed out a little more possibly having 00 and lowsec being used as areas to create specific items such as implants or datacores or at least the building blocks for them to give players a few more reasons to populate those areas rather than staying in empireim also intending to raise the t2 bpo issue should i make it on to the csm  at this point im neither for nor against removing t2 bpos but i would like ccp to research their effects on the markets of eve and draw their own conclusions from it preferably with consultation from the playerbase via the csmsorry no lyrics this time
i have been watching the csm closely and i have noticed that the csm arent any better than real politiciansit starts with the candidates introducing themselves and their ideas and such this is before the voting is openthen just barely before the votings open the real politics come into playits not about the politicians strongpoints anymore its about throwing as much mud as possible on other politicians so much easier to blacken others than highlighting your own strongpointsoffcourse in the meanwhile in their following they scream and shout to make their blackballing more vocal and hence the puppets pop up and pick up the slack to slander even more et voila a real campaign is bornthing that actually worries me most is the real chance we get some little berlusconi in the csm for a long long time because we have enough voters who have a hard time looking further than their own personal playstyle and even more voters who wont even vote
its pretty disgusting i think that all this mudthrowing makes the csm lose credit from a lot of players it is more and more about egos and less about actually serving the people that elected them the csm must work together with all this insulting and mud being thrown between candidates i fear that cooperation will be thrown out of the window at some point and the csm just turns in a bunch of whiners flailing at eachother is the mudthrowing just election drama and will the csm just laugh about it and get to work after the elections csm1 was horribly ineffective due to all the drama and infighting and i dont want to see a repeat of this whenether you agree with another candidate or not deal with it and treat eachother with respect
when does questioning candidates statements suddenly turn into mud slinging or trollingwhen the candidate cant wriggle out of it i guess
questioning is one thing but the slander and smearing that goes on in several threads just clearly shows we have more to do with emoqueens than people who actually want to help better the game for everyonepeople more busy with obtaining the seat and at all cost stay in it rather than doing what they are supposed to do
when you arent interested in the answer and just ask the question to put the candidate in bad light
i dont understand why people hate negative campaigning so much yeah it can go too far but there is a valid role for it informed voters are a good thing and its not like a politician is going to inform you of their weaknesses the only people who have any reason to do that are opponents of that candidate not all attacks are accurate but then again not all selfpromotion is accurate either just look at ankhs thread for many examples of both
negative campainging usually happens when people run short of pressing their strong points forwardits a clear showing of weakness if your only validation is by distracting away from them by pushing forward other peoples weaknessessomeone representing others should win on own merits and not in smearing oppositions i know its a utopia to think so specially nowadays where the loudmouth attract more following than the one who tries to get ahead on his own meritsdiscussions on real life politics are not allowedapplebabemight there be hope for mankind afterallmankind perhaps evekind i am less hopefull for
i do absolutely no mud throwing but i will pay 250m per vote
or perhaps it just shows that youre running against someone who has flaws perhaps even flaws that voters ought to know about but i suppose its more important to act nice in a competitive election than it is to have an informed voter pool
anyone who doesnt have the points to win on merits but only by pointing to other peoples flaws doesnt have much of an agenda then
fit out a tempest with some meta 3 guns four pieces of rf emp l per gun some sentry drones just in case a rack of sensor booster iis with scan res scripts a cargo scanner and an even mix of tracking enhancer iis and gyrostabilizer iis in your lows then go sit outside of a station undock in a decent trade hub wait check undocking haulers when that guy undocks with 500m in loot shoot him and scoop his wreck with your alt hopefully the good stuff didnt diei generally get at least one idiot an hour undocking with a cargo hold full of loot and no tank
why would one not tank his hulk ah i see morons pilots of untanked ships should not receive insurance either the same way as in rl you need to take basic protection in order to claim anything insurance wanting fire detection approved locks etc reimbursing the pilot of an untanked bargehauler is as stupid as reimbursing the killersor we could get rid of insurance altogether its a pretty stupid mechanic
how about stop flying with 500mil plus in your hauler on auto pilot  less ganking if your gonna do it expect to be ganked dont blame the gankers when it happens as for insurance if you pay for it you get it deal with it p
confirming this is the most important issue
yes please
its not really just that i mean just try to fit a brutix with any sort of armor tank and decent guns like a neutronion mix or full rack of neutrons which you need a grid mod for even with a shield tank its just not going to happen because of the horrible fitting plus you need some speed to actually catch anything and the shield brutix and myrmidon have itoh about shield tanking stuff with the advent of the scram short range meshes with shield tank really well for instance im one of the people who has both a hg slaveset and a lg snakeset yet when fitting a eg short range ac hurricane ill very often just go with a shield tank with a scrambler suck up getting half the ehp in order to be able to catch various speedy trash and hold it there look at myrm fits you can get a quite fast particularly with snakes ship which has very solid ehp and does 850 dps on top to the point where despite having a hg slaveset enabling you to have 100k ehp on it if i wanted to go with blasters and stuff id go with snaked shieldfit
ive said this before on the same issue skirmish ships can still be skirmish ships even if blaster ships are faster and more agile than them the key part about being a skirmish ship is not just speed and agility its speed agility and the ability to run when things turn against youminmitar ships with their large number of free high slotsneuts range that allows them to effectively combat ships outside of web2pt range and med slotsshield tank allows more mobility will still have that advantage even if they are not the fastest ships on the fieldblaster ships can never benefit as much as minmatar ships because if things do go bad they dont have the neuts to get rid of tacklers and theyre certainly not outside of web2 pt range even if they run shield tanks and light tackle in order to maximize their speed advantage which they arent as good as due to having fewer med slots generally this means that even if you make blaster ships fast and agile or faster and more agile than minmatar ships the minmatar ships will still be the skirmish race and the blaster ships will still be the balls to the wall racebut if you go the other way and you have the short range ships slower than the longer range ships then there is no reason to ever choose that short range ship in actual combat when things are fighting back no one will ever be in range except other short range ships everyone else will be using their higher speed to kite since no one is in range except short range ships the advantage is to choose the longer range ships and kite like them its the same strategic choice set that has spawned nanofits each and every time they have been viable for each and every iteration it is not a coincidence that they always choose to use long range optionsand tracking free options when available rather than short range with the trichotomy that we have consisting of short rangehigh damagefull tackle med rangedisengable long rangeunagile if the short rangefull tackle range ships are not the fastest they never become a viable choice compared to the med rangedisengagable ships

more faster and agile than minmatar not supportedhigh dps better drone bays speed how the hell do you disengage from that will you have time for iti understand that blastersacs need to dictate range and that really should not be trivial for both it is trivial for minmatar now but with this it really looks youre just turning the table 180UFFFD nothing moresorry but you can make better than that youve done it before pplay with drones perhapsobs stupid stuff but speed changes always hurt a bit inside only reason why i choose minmatar when i created my 1st char
youve got to be very careful when proposing ships that are both fast and agile as unless that ship has serious weaknesses in dps or tank then its going to be very powerful the combination of good speed and good agility produces good acceleration  definable as 075  max speed with mwd on  align time with mwd on good acceleration and high speed means that you accelerate more quickly to a higher top speed than other ships making such a ship very powerful the dramiel is a case in pointin general ships should be fast or agile take caldari ships which tend to be agile but slow this gives them good acceleration but a low top speed which means that they can pull away from another ship briefly but then get overhauled in the long run this is well balanced but how should the other races beminmatar should be the fastest but if minmatar is faster more agile and has weapons with longer range than gallente then there is very little reason to fly gallente assuming fairly similar tanks and dps  as is broadly the case this suggests that minmatar should not be an agile race and that gallente ships should have an advantage in acceleration but a disadvantage in top speed
this is an interesting comment but i think falls short a bit minmatar is the smallfastagile race and i hope they stay that way you cite the dramiel as proof that something shouldnt have good dps and be both fast and agile but the jaguar and vagabond while good are nothing approaching overpowered  while embodying all of the core concepts of being minmatar even with all that it wasnt minmatar that kept people from flying blaster ships  it was lasers which projectiles have been balanced against recentlyimo i think it depends what role youre trying to go for and with blaster and laser ships thats the damage dealer role minmatar ships as a rule dont really fill this role as i said theres only a few options make blaster ships able to get to their targets in a timely manner and without expending 23 cap booster 800s to do it read make them faster andor more agile make blaster ships have nuts high dps to offset the time it takes to get into range extend blaster range so that they come into range sooner make lasers and therefore projectiles and torps and pretty much everything else do less damageliang
i want to point out why that would be a horrible idea in case someone may accidentally take it seriouslynot only that is unrealistic request due to overwhelming protest it would cause from entire community but you need to understand that tanking has been continuously boosted for last several years while weapon damage seen much smaller increases the latest boost was to make 15 buffer rigs for cruisers bc frigates very affordable  essentially giving everyone who wants another free full grade slave set or equivalent shield tank set something that normally would cost at least 1500 million now costs 9 mil and thats just one of the many tanking boostsand in case its not clear to some people excessive tanking ability leads to blobbing  as it both requires more people to efficiently kill the target and gives victim more time to call in friendly blob from nearby i was under impression we didnt like the blobbing trends
this is entirely untrue some people might have thought it was true but it assumes that gallente should be gang damage dealers they should not be the problem has always been ships with longer ranges that cannot be caught by the blaster ships bull if you consider blaster ships as a damage dealer role then you must also consider minnie in that role you have to define the roles more closely to properly understand what is happening here each of the ships discussed does deal damage as their primary function each just does so optimally in different situationsthose different situations are the keythese are pretty much right out falloff means that blaster ship dps increases necessarily nullify nonte autocannon rangeadding range is also right out this negates the role of blasters as solosmall gang damage dealers and moves them right into skirmish optionsditto number three since it has the same effect as number onethat means that the only proper response is to make them faster and more agile
once again im reminded how messed up in the head goumindong is i havent forgotten the nano nerf fiasco the sad part is that ccp game designer seem to be just as messed up as this guyhe simply cannot be reasoned with cause his logic obeys the rules of some parallel universe not quite like ourstheres really no point arguing with him but if the devs are messed up in similar ways and they follow this bad advice i can assure you that the next big threads are going to be cries of the minmatar the game will shift one more notch toward boredom as the differences between ships are erased balance through sameness is achieved
i dont think the vaga is overpowered either but i do think that the deimos is underpowered given that both of these ships are best utilised in solo or smallgang combat how should they be balanced against each other i dont think a deimos fix will come via fiddling with its dps  the deimos would have to have an immense dps advantage to be rated alongside the vaga given the vagas mobility and dpsprojection advantages to me this suggests that the answer to balancing these ships is something to do with their mobilities now its obvious that the vaga should be faster than the deimos so just leaves acceleration as the advantage that deimos could have with reasonable fits currently they compare like thisdualpoly vaga speed 2750 ms average acceleration 298 mss800 mm dualpoly deimos speed 1712 ms acceleration 157 mssshield nanodeimos speed 1961 ms acceleration 226 mssthe problem is  what numbers would a fasteraccelerating deimos have lets assume that speeds remain the same if we give the shield deimos an acceleration of 350 mss then it requires a align time with mwd on of 42 s which is probably silly alternatively if we nerf the vagas acceleration to 175 mss then it gets a mwdon align time of 118 s which would probably give a mwdoff align time of 82 s ish unfortunately this too is probably silly
gypsio iii i believe that a 20 damage increase a free damage mod would go a long way to helping deimos without making that ship overpowered due to its other shortcomingstheres an alternative solution tho  changing mwd bonus to 90 web bonus it would make deimos highly desirable in small gang pvp but then it takes away from vigilant advantage
well if the rails with this penetration idea were balanced to the point where it took the same amount of time on average to kill a target as other long range weapon systems how would it matter sure maybe a ship dies with xx of its primary tank left but if it takes the same amount of time to die to for example longrange lazors its the same for all intensive purposes some tank types would probably last longer than others but thats the same for every weaponhow would you go about getting that perfect balance not sure how would it turn out with mass rails firing probably badly but then fleet arties on a target usually turns out badly toowould probably be the first response when a titan died with some of its primary tank left
the complaint here is that eve is too homogeneous  that theres no variation but fleets arent homogeneous and ehp isnt all that matters you might be able to balance this around one single form of combat  unfortunately this would enforce even more of that homogeneity by virtue of introducing mechanics which obsolete most types of combatfirst its intents and purposes second you cannot possibly take the same amount of time when you bypass the primary tank except in very specific types of combat i already covered this complete with mathematical proofby not introducing mechanics that are guaranteed to be overpowered its a good start anyway much more likely to be the response the first time someone dies with an active tank or in a rr gang with virtually full armor and no hull and you cant even avoid this fate because thats the whole point of the mechanic there may be ways to balance rails with different effects but bypassing a layer isnt one of them give it upliang
no liang thats not what it is at all thats what you are reading into it it wasnt a complaint it was a question which you didnt answer i happen to think eve is anything but homogeneous and thats what makes it a good game but rails do need some help and this idea does seem interestingummm thanks never realized you were such a grammar national socialist and yeah you certainly proved that spuggs figures wouldnt work as he originally posted them kinda think he already agreed that the figures would need to be tweaked if dps was dropped andor the odds of penetration were lowered you could possibly have it take the same amount of time if you change the numbers going in you can get we result you like coming out for an active tank  once again if they died in the same amount of time as they would from lasers arties or cruise missiles would it make a difference yes or no and after you answer that liang lets go one further how about if it took longerfor rr gangs  well it would make a nice change from the only options being massive ecm massive neuting or massive blobbing personally not a huge fan of how rr gangs work atm
this was something that really interested me rails would still be a poor weapon to beat your enemy in a straight fire power fight which seems to becoming more and more the way people play the game penetrating damage will not allow you to kill the target quicker i t will probably take longer but its a tactical weapon in this form example being the rr gang instead of bringing an even bigger gang or massive ecm you have the tactical choice of breaking the tank with a tactical weapon it will probably take a long time too as the chance to penetrate is quite small say a shield tank has 40 shield and is at 75 armour chance to penetrate shields is 60 and chance to penetrate armour with the same volley is 15 it would take a while to get to this situation too and the damage to bleed through gets modified to be quite low tickling your target to death or the death of a thousand cutsalso if you think that everyone in the fleet will just fit rails then they will be pwned by a fleet of beams and arties as they will just get under the 20km and use their tracking advantage to counter
stop posting youre embarrassing yourself
 you were doing ok until this paragraph a beams  arties also suck for tracking b sniper fleets that get caught at 20km are doing something horribly horribly wrong
i know this i was just using it as an extreme way to counter a fleet of rail platformsits annoying how quickly people are at smacking people down without thinking about the context that something was said alot of people rush to the im right youre wrong phrase or smacking without thinking about whats actually been saidgoum i have a lot of respect to your views and knowledge of the game all im asking is that people broaden their views and think a little laterallythanks for your previous feed back too vladive been trying to simulate the chance based system of this mechanic and so ive found that an active armour tank can keep the chances of sustaining hull damage very very low from what i can tell the mechanic ive described doesnt appear to punish a buffer tank over an active tank or vice versa though i havent looked at an active shield fit yet
no that was exactly his complaint with boosting damage  because somehow rails become exactly like lasers and artillery despite the very significant differencesim not im educating you i admit the place i linked to was a bit brusque but it was just the first hit in the goog which illustrated the difference youre welcomefirst its not a yes or no question and im answering it for the second time you see i didnt just show with those numbers that it was flawed i showed that it was flawed no matter what numbers you throw into it you will by necessity always come up with one of these two results rails are ridiculously overpowered and virtually eliminate the usefulness of active tanking rr both large and small passive recharge tanking and most forms of buffer tanking we all fit hull tanks yay diversity and pray we have a friend with a capital hull rep handy  rails dont do enough damage penetration to matter and now were left with flavor without effect people are still whining that rails suck and rightfully so good joband just to be sure that you dont miss it as long as there is damage penetration and any sort of repair you cant possibly have just the same amount of time to kill someone you can rig it to work against pure ehp systems which is what hes trying to do but eve isnt about just pure ehpim glad to know that youre willing to sacrifice all logistics anywhere including from the specialized ships operated solo to kill this how about we just remove local remote and passive repair from the game just so this hairbrained idea can work like i said  continue brainstorming but this idea cannot possibly be balanced
more properlyyou could possibly balance it against any one of the following1 pure ehp tanks2 any single repair tank with specific amounts of ehp repairedso you could balance it against ehp tanks but then it would be out of whack against all repair tanks or you could balance it against a 100 effective hit point repair tank but it would not be balanced against a 200 effective hit point repair tank or a 300 ehp repair tank or a 400balance against any of them necessitates imbalance against the rest ergo it cannot be balanced
which perfectly explains why you quoted me or you were using your normal tactics when trying to shut somebody up your grammar is wrong ergo your entire argument isactually it is its a hypothetical question you can certainly tack on a reasoning to supplement your answer but the question is simple and straightforward ummm no actually liang in this rather crude form it would drastically favor buffer tanks over active tanking youre either resorting to hyperbole or forgot to have your coffee this morning cuz your math is normally much better considering the number of times you have mentioned active tanking im beginning to think youre doing some white knighting here does active tanking need to be kicked in the gonads yet again probably not and admittedly that is an issue with the idea doesnt make the idea unbalanced would just make active tanking suck even more example  lasers really do a number on shield tanks and yet lasers are not overpoweredso our two options are overpowered or suck forgive me if i dont subscribe to your rather extreme world view theres a freebie for another petty barb its a numbers game liang anything can be balanced probably wouldnt be easy to do in this case though much simpler solution is the one you are apparently favoring  just boost damage works yes likely solution yes only possible solution noyup youre white knighting active tanks not quite but please dont let me stop your exaggerated comments youd probably do better leaving this to goumsuccinct to the point and devoid of snarky comments i disagree that it necessitates imbalance though it just favors one form of tanking over another is it really necessary to favor buffer tanks even more in this day and age probably not but still an interesting idea
i support your thread i do however have some other ideas to help buff field command ships ill post them after the csm5 elections with some anti blob weapons bonusesand although i have command ship to v on my other main this has in no way influenced my decision tamber
definitely support this field command ships are fairly overshadowed by the bcs
hmm it seems to me that with planetary interaction lowsec could become more interesting and would also open it up to more ideas like those mentionedjust on its own its going to cause people to come out and pick up the goods they are producing

nice ideabut if ccp will ever decide to implend this for individual players it will be almost as usless as fittings which are only useful on testserver where you just keep all your junk in hangar and not in containerswhile all massinteraction with stuff ideas are nice ccp will first need to adress players ability to stort out junk without use of containers or apply that massinteraction stuff to containers contents for it to work for individual players

hacked accounts a threat that looms over even the most careful of individuals the worst thing possible that can happen to anyone on eveonline or the internet in general is your account information being compromised and someone else gaining access to your hard work for free there are numerous ways this can happen some even skilled and experienced computer users can still be caught bywhat i propose is a device used by some businesses for their employees to log in remotely to their systems as well as a device similar to the one implemented for world of warcraft via activision blizzard an authentication devicethis is by no means a required addition to anyones account rather is it an optional layer of security that can be added if the user so chooses currently the methods available are either a small keychain like device that generates a number or a download for your cellphone either way the overall outcome is the same an added layer of security for accounts for those who choose it to help protect their investment from security breechesnaturally many people will feel that their own measures are enough but players like me wouldnt mind spending a few extra dollars to purchase such a device to ensure the safety of my account afterall weve all put numerous years into these characters of ours and unlike other games we cant just level to 80 within a week or two and pick up where we left off these characters require our dedication and deserve as much protection for them as we can get
since it doesnt let me support my topic initiallytheres also been some confusion from what ive heard with how these work ill give activision blizzard as an easy example for how this functionsfirst you purchase an authenticator either the physical device of the program for a smart phone you are then given a serial number which you attach to whichever accounts you desire the authenticator to attach to now when you log in to that account you must use the authenticator to generate a number and enter the number to get access to your accountto some this adds another step that might be frustrating due to quickly swapping characters and having to generate a new number constantly but on the other hand it adds a physical layer of protection that requires the device in your hand too log in to your account there is no software involved its all handled via your account settings all you would need is eveonline installed and the authenticator to log on

captcha has been one of the worst technologies to be thrust apon the world98 of captcha are machine readablethe 2 which machines cant read are the same ones that people cant readsmart companies have stopped using captcha as its a horrible solution that doesnt work
first of all dont state statistics without proof also show me a machine that can read press the square and find the button that looks like a square among 3 other buttons if you can make one mit needs you badly now lets randomize it asking a different question now press the circle now write goody lets leave both the buttons and the text box up now before someone goes no way i dont want to do that every time i target an asteroid it doesnt have to be everytime just every 30 mins or so now i know some one could sit and find out every possible scenario and write an answer but that would take a lot of time and effort on the person writing the macro and if the format of the questions are changed say on a 1 a week basis simple just change the questions this causes the publisher to constantly rewrite his macro which takes a lot more time than the ten minutes it make take for ccp to change up the questions again if the machine gets asked a question that is not accounted for in the macro the macro does not have an answer i can think of about a couple thousand differant very simple questions that normal 2 year old could answerand if capcha is such a level of fail your pointing out why do so many websites still use it and for some reason there forums and such are not littered with bots
good idea its something that i would have no problem with
beside being fairly horrible in practice most rmt macro miners have an humam supervisor managing several accounts they only need to add a warning sound to alert him that there is a pop up and he will go and solve it problem not resolved human miners annoyed net result less human miners more rmt miners it is the common problem people suggesting solutions dont consider people getting real money to work eve have a higher annoyance tolerance than people that pay for playing evebeside that this solution do nothing for macro ratting macro missioning and macro spam bots
i doubt theyll be as annoyed you think well maybe you will be because you keep coming up with why any solution will not work instead of offering anything that will almost making me think your a macro miner yourself see the issue i mostly have is the ones that do it for isk farmingselling who will want to set 3 or 4 comps to go mine for 237 and walk away from there computers for some reason your under the impression that a macro miner wants to have to sit and watch his comp for a box that comes up randomly and your right maybe those that play on alts and macro mine with another but now comes the question your in a heated pvp battle where every second of your attention counts now that box comes up that if you dont reply in time your mining account is booted or other possible consequences for not paying attention to your mining
captcha ai has to come from a university for you to accept its effective
to the opnoand noand again noi am not going to pay a company for making a scan of my computer ever periodand yes it is an invasion of privacy no matter if you have something to hide or not that the majority of wow players got used to the bull that blizzard included with their game is typical herd behaviourwhy dont you just allow the police to make an unscheduled monthly visit and look through your stuff thats different how comesome people are really stupid
im curious on how much isk reward is given and perhaps ships if they are given as rewards are like in low sec for lvl 5 missions im currently doing 3 million per mission lvl 4 missions and if missions in low sec pay out around 10 million then im willing to risk myself for that kind of isk d but i dont have any pvp experience
mission roam to providencewhat damage will you take what should you shoot them with what ships are gonna shoot you
not supportedthere should be some risk for the reward apart from the difficulty of the missions and as is they promote more elements of gameplay where they are this is also one of the only fun things for carebears to do in lowsec and if you get rid of them who are the piwates going to shoot although im all for sleeper ai in missions xmy sec status may be 10 but im definately no pirate there was this accident in dodixie a couple of weeks ago you seei do however agree with your statements on the staleness of hisec but i think theres a different way we could go about that  and i have many many ideas regarding this and is infact what i spend most of my time doing ingame entertaining people in hisec but this topic belongs in a different posttamber

i think low sec needs cleaned out i am all for more things to do in high sec that are pve oriented actually i think those that have positive security status should be able to join up with the concord and the 4 empires and clean out low sec free podding and killing of all with negitive status give the care bears teeth without sec status loss and let us clean up the waste of space pirates
when a person receives a bounty they can easily claim the bounty reward through an alti propose these bounties to remain on a pilot and can only be claimed through a bounty hunter also we should have a new way of bounty huntingusing a rank system to prevent exploiters have certain people marked to certain playersfor example 5 pilots have bounties nothing will happen to these guys but say a pilot contacts the bounty office he  she will be assigned several missions to take out these peoplethe time depended to take out these people will be from 24hrs to 1 week depending on sec status like if a pilot has 10 he will have a 1 week hit on himonce again depending on the sec status depends how many people are assigned to the hitthe chance of getting a bounty hunt on you depends on how much bounty is on you so people who like putting 10k comical bounties on themselves wont see a hit often but people who have say 50 million will excessively high bounties like 5 billion will only be assigned to high ranking bounty hunterswhen a person gets a hit on them they will receive a mail explaining the hit and kill rights pop up i am not sure what grace period would be adequate for this but i dont want it same as wardecs atm lets say a player gets a 12hour grace periodthe rank you receive will be based on the sec status  amount of isk on that bounty and to prevent exploiting  laming 10 of the bounty received will go directly to ded npcsranks will also decay over time putting some competition in this higher ranks will mean better bounty missions or more assigned to you and to have access to items where you can buy for iskif a pilot fails to complete a bounty most likely because the bounty is perma docked  no penalty will be givenwhen the grace period is over both the bounty hunter and bounty can attack each other careless of who gets the first shotin addition to this i think people with high concord standings should be allowed bounties on them however these bounties can only be placed by high ranking bounty hunters and will only be assigned to high ranking bounty hunters the timers to kill the bounty will be significantly reduced thoughoh and for the sake of pvp bounty hunters for a price can mark other similar ranking bounty hunters this will allow them to compete for rank through a more familiar way and i guess welcomes back a new 1v1 pvp feelall of these features  add ons can only be requested  inquired in a station with a bounty hunter service a pilot may decline the mission he has received but this will result in a ranking loss no loss will be given to failed missions thanks to docking
few more things to change to make this workalternatives to make this work1st the bounty should be bound to the clone to whitch the bounty is given so that a person can end up with 6 different bountysums reason to this is to prevent the usage of an alt to pop the main even thuru bountyhunting system2nd bountyhunters should be granted to usage of somekind of warpdisrupt bubble to actually be able to get the pod 00 dwellers not many of them have any bountys and in lowsec the ones who has good bountys newer loose the pod so give the hunters a bubble that will affect only the hunteeuglyedit typos
uuuuh tbh i dont see where one wouldnt be able to use an altthe only thing you did was making the system so complex that the majority of players wouldnt bother bounty anymore intended
i think the op solution is overly complicated but has a few good ideas1 a system of bounty mission assignments all pilots with bounties currently online so that collection of bounty by alt is not possible except through extraordinary luck2 kill rights in any system that are transferrable to bounty hunters gang3 concord significantly pad all bounties to make even comical bounties worthwhile4 a bounty hunter interface that provides current locations of all current targets5 a special assassin module you can activate on a station that has a docked pilot in it with bounty in it that pods them in station after 30 minutes if they dont undock supporting some kind of change to the bounty system since it is completely dysfunctionl currently
oh this is actually called suicide gankingtheres already been plenty of huge threads about it and suicide ganking is a valid game mechanicthey may however remove insurance from ships killed by concord but it could also never happen
i hate to say it but if it requires any changes to the pos ccp will never fix it they have abandoned anything to do with the pos
confirming the ops proof the small blaster could hit the control tower perfectly but could not hit the large battery that was close to it seems rather odd to me
bring back
lock this thread
if your caps lock is broken get a new keybored or stop typing in caps also maybe theres frigs in fleet that will really help them wont it
that would be a really nice option definitely beats figuring out who xd for being aligned and who hasnt and ya the whole caps lock thing is really not helping getting your opinion across
yeah yeah yeah and maybe an option for the fc to fire all the fleets guns launch drones scoop loot dock and ship spin in station then all your fleet members need to do is log in and the fc plays the game for them
these features are already available regroup and velocity column on the overview can also look at the ship models themselves there is also a feature to broadcast an align point
not exactly the functionality he proposes with regard to the actual proposal sounds nice supported though it might be too heavy to run for what it adds
this sounds rather good a well performed fleet warp is awesome but hard to do this would make it easierthough i do feel bad about supporting a suggestion typed in bold caps
actually this idea aint bad at all imo
lock this thread
were you ganked by an itty 5
edit since op has edited out his first post im going to copy it off eve search for teh lulz we now return you to your snarky response in progress editbadger actually worse yet marlonas badger id be butthurt too tbh

dude battle badger fleets are an eve classic taking that away would ruin a part of the culturethats like removing beethoven from musicweird some empty post in this thread
1 for a awesome thread
loldramiels
marlona is officially my new hero
so the other day we were discussing how dramiels were pretty much unbeatable because they would either kill you or run away and you would be almost powerless to stop them with just 12 shipsand then all of a sudden this falls out of the skies and proves us all n00bs obviously even industrials  dramiels so we bow our heads in n00bshameor did we say a dramiel expertly piloted i forget
i think i just ed my pants tbhon a serious note i once lost a stealth bomber 4 years ago to a iteron 5and i laughed my ass off for an hour htfu and get out of the nuub corp hows that for a proposal
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahayou can have my battle badger when you pry it from my unsubscribed account
even i cant compete with this threadwell done supported
the fc position is available for the next badgerrun if youre interested mmore info heretamber
thread needs more support of these shenanigans
this is an outragesupporting to stop the abuse
oh wowhahahahahaha
3 marlona d
ooooooohhhhhhsick burn
i support this thread badgers are the most imbalanced overpowered ship in the gamemy fav part of chatemo tj  haha nice try i am not stupid it will take more bain sic power than you have to trick me into giving up my mainwonder if he pilots his l33t main any better than his alting idiot in gameedit supporting awesomethread idea
marlona is probably emo tj tbh eitherway still funny
omg that is amazing signed
3 rol good luck in at8edit forgot to support dis thread op is correct in every facet of his argument
dead hookers would look great in killmailss too
ecm is wayyyyyy over powered i cant stand how many good fights have been completely ruined to a jamming ship its really just a fail safe that most rookies sport when they arent confident in their abilitiesbut this whole just breaking the lock type of deal couldnt that in term just lead to the same thing as you said it could break your lock during lockingand if it keep hitting isnt that perma jammedi always just think ecm should do what it does technicallyjam it would be kind of cool that it would jam your turrets so instead of your grouped modules of 7 shooting seven times 4 of the guns gets jamed which keeps you sending off some ammo and only 3 of your guns shoot that cycle but thats just what i think would be cool dont really think it should ever be implemented
i hate ecm its the biggest turn off in small gang pvp so any change to nerf it some more is good in my book
ecm is still far too strong this proposal looks good but there are some details that need to be tested as a 5 second cycle time sounds way too fast
the way ecm works seems out of place given the mechanics of the other types of ewar i think this would help bring it more in line with the restalso kudos on the nicely done up proposal its refreshing to see on this board
i say remove ecm from the game completely but wtv this will do
there are a lot of problems in eve that people complain about but i believe ive come up with a solution which will help solve a few of them problems1 low and even null sec need a bit more activity2 high sec level 4 missions need a risk vs reward rebalance3 miners really get screwed by the mineral dump from high sec lvl 4sthese 3 problems could easily be solved by simply removing all positive quality level 4 agents from high sec and placing them in low secthis would effectively rebalance the high sec risk vs reward income levels if a mission runner wanted to run lvl4s in the safety of high sec he still could but he would earn less isk and lp points per hourif the mission runner was willing to deal with extra risk he could in turn run level 4s from higher quality agents in low sec this would rebalance the risk vs reward that is needed in regard to high sec level 4sdoing this you would also help rebalance other areas in eve miners and manufactures would get a much needed income boost because there would be much less reprocessed minerals and meta 1 items on the market this in turn would be a much needed income buff for both miners  manufactures new low sec mission hubs would be created which would open up new opportunity for less risk adverse marketers allowing low sec to finally support working markets due to enough populationmission runners could finally fight back against ninja salvagers whom steal there space debriswith the advent of t3 cruisers with the ability to fit unprobable set ups there is no real reason that this should not be considered as there is still a reasonable amount of safety to be had for the mission runners if they fit proper ships while in low secthis in return would effectively rebalance level 4 mission income placing by added the much needed risk vs reward this would also help push high sec care bears into 00 by giving them a reason to leave the safety of highit would also be the much needed boon for piracy in low sec and give people a reason to do something besides gate camp 247overall a simple readjustment such as this would provide a stimulus package for many professions in eve as well as low sec
1 you earn already more from lvl4s in lowsec2 minerals issue is already getting nerfedmaybe do your homework before posting
perhaps you should also read before posting yes there is a slight increase for doing missions in low sec this would be a rebalance by moving all positive quality level 4 agents to low secthis would not just increase the amount in earned in low sec but it would decrease the amount made in high sec effectively giving a real risk vs reward optionas of right now there is no worthwhile reward to leave high sec to run level 4s this would create a reason
i have read your proposal but unlike ran khanon you dont understand that it doesnt solve the real problem why people dont run missions in lowsecif you want to buff lowsec think about ways that dont nerf other peoples play style to feed yours
the funny thing here is that agent quality is relatively minor in relation to how much iskhr you make the far more overriding factor is the security status of the space youre in what i would propose in your shoes is actually a bit more sweeping instead of suggesting nerfing high sec i think you should instead look to the problems with low sec space low sec space as a whole is dangerous and even lawless however the reward differences vary quite dramatically and for no reason between a 01 and a 04this affects missions rats exploration mining etc ccp has made an effort to make all regions of 00 equally attractive with the new sov mechanics and i think that this effort should be applied to low sec i would say that the rewards from living in 01 space are sufficient  simultaneously being distinctly less profitable than even the worst 00 space and distinctly better than 05 space thus i would suggest making all of low sec  regardless of system security  use the same game mechanics as 01 spaceyou can read more about this idea here
im not going to argue with you all day if you dont support the proposal then dont support it and be on your way the idea behind my proposal is to create a reason for people to run low sec level 4s right now as ive already mention there is no reason to run them do to high sec being more profitable due to easier accesseveryone knows high sec mission income is unbalance leaving little reason for many to ever venture to low or null sec this would be a step in the right direction of giving them a reasonas for making low sec easier to navigate yes i do agree with this as ive also made the similar suggestions you can read it here in another post i made on needed changes to low sec
well i would of course like to see more sweeping changes with in low sec and eve in general this is just a simple solution which can work within the current game mechanics with out a lot of extra changes on ccps partit is also a change that can be made over time by not moving all agents at once this means it would not have drastic effects on the economy by one major sweeping change
there are activities in hi sec that generate far more income than lvl 4 missions already
there is a problem with levi bonus actuallyis bonus of 375 of shield for the gang is in fact a great part of his tankbut you have only this bonus when are in gang an erebus get full armor directly when it go in gang but levi not and need 24h of wait to get full hp or use a shield booster that make a weaker tank instead of get a invuli want ccp change this the leviathan has less ehp than a mothership because of thisan aeon t2 fited is about 50m mine leviathan is 21m  wtf im just asking for the bonus applyed in gang or not in gang to the ship that make not the player recharge his ship each jump or something eslei think its a good idea hope you found it too
think of it this wayerebus gets a short term bonusleviathan gets a long term bonusafter all armor plates dont recharge themselves like shields once theyre damaged theyre damaged
bastard
i know this was discussed a while back not sure if csm picked it up though basically after some discussion the conclusion people came to was that there should be a grace periodmaybe 30s for changing systems whereby your shield doesnt drop that way you can move the fleet without losing your hp buffer once you have it fully recharged such a solution i would support
all titans are maxed for ehpmost titans use mwd in med slot for levi its a tank slot that can be used also all titans fit a sensor booster for lock faster targets erebus can fit two easily  avatar its same buisness  without sacrifice of tanka erebus when i lost 10 or armor when it get its fleet bonus the armor that it get it on right not on left in red he never need to recharge his armor before a fighta levi need so you must have a capital shield booster with sacrifice the tanktank on a levi cost a lot officier invul are very high priced xtype hardener on armor are very cheapan erebus t2 fited is 50m ehp easy deadspace  near 100m ehp yeah you slaves tooa normal fit on leviathan is 21ehpyou have 1m of shield from bonus that you cant usea total about 4m of shield with lower resist on a levi and aroung 8m of armor on a erebus thats not normal
dane bought me a nightmare so i vehemently support this also if people dont see that there is a 10 character in system they may be less likely to run instantly
did you really just insinuate that killing ratters is pvp technically it is i know but challenge wise you might as well be shooting rats yourself has to be combined it with a non carpal tunnel syndrome inducing ship scanner or no dice
every local should be delayed local and scanning both dscan and scanner probe should be improved with ability to hail ship found by probing etc
currently mission running brings in an insane no risk amount of isk i myself make about 80 mil an hour i think to balance the money making mechanics we move all lvl 4 agents in local lowsecthis will also making mining profitable again macros rejoice and will also increase low sec populationi understand carebears will feel upset and angry by this but as i said i mission run and know how much risk free isk is produced i for one would love to see lowsec populated and this suggestion will solve 2 of my problems
oh yes ccp is there to solve your problems
lvl 5 agents are already in low sec for example but no one actually runs them there they wait for one that comes up in high sec not everyone is here fir the pvp so leave them where they are
i bet it will
considering the best lvl 4 agents are already in low secand theyre nerfing loot in missionsgo try to run some level 5s in low sec and see how long you last until you have to replace your ship and implants
currently we can see alliances trying to build as many supercapitals as possible the increased difficulty of killing a supercapital means that one day we may see all titansupercarrier fleets they will be the new battleship which is ridiculous considering ccp didnt think many would be built shame ccp doesnt prove to have much foresight in their designs this in turn will decrease the importance of carriers and dreadnoughts if everyone and their dog has a supercarrier andor titani would like to know what ccp intends to do about it if they intend to do anything at all that is how can the new alliance compete with the old one
do not expect anything from ccp to actually make 00 funinstead adapt and build more supercaps then your opponents
thats the problem indeed extend my complaint to all capital ships
with the buff of supercaps people are more willing to use them and stay on the field that means you get more chances to kill themno need to nerf them artificially again
you mean you get more chances to kill them if you have your own supercapital fleet to counter their supercapital fleet and what about those folks who cannot afford supercapital fleets and any supercapitals are bought by alliances who can build themwhat role are battleships relegated to
destroyers
battleships will become the new drones
if node dont crash yeah its a party in hw 1600 guys and 400 guys wanted to come inside bs are new heavy brained drones 
simple bounties are crap loot is crap and i believe drone ai is an item with no use whatsover
simple you dont know what you are talking about
darius it really helps to have a ing clue what youre talking about lets go over it drone missions have no bounties drone missions dont increase or decrease standings normal missions deliver enough minerals that normal mission bounty  normal mission loot  drone mission loot drone missions require a marauder to make even half way reasonable iskhrand to top it all off drone missions are getting hammered by the nerf bat in a few days liang
yes yes  everything has to be the samejust because of the tractor beam bonus a decent salvager ship fit makes it obsolete think salvager canethats the only issue but before we see the new final numbers of drops from drone missions we cant really judge it no
i guess where i was coming from is this most missions have rewards that are at least somewhat proportional to the difficulty or relative length of time to complete the recipe consists of bounties loot and salvage basically the more things i kill and the harder they were to kill the more isk i get that formula is inconsistent in drone missions and since most of them dont have an easy way to blitz you almost have no choice but to decline and potentially take a hit to standings thats all
no it doesnt have to be the same but itd help not to outright suck congratulations you just went from 75m iskhr to 25m iskhr if youre coming back to a mission for any reason you are doing it wrong go run the next mission and youll make more iskhr can you please learn a bit of how to play the game efficiently before you spout offconsidering theyre only getting worse liang
shameless selfbumpi do think this is a pretty important issue that the game would benefit greatly from if worked onyou will see ships that i listed that you have used for great effect and might think theres absolutely no need for it to be boosted  but please try to remember what actually made the ship and setup you used work the ships design and role or good skills both ingame and piloting which wouldve worked with any other ship int he same weightclasstake the deimos as example it works and sure is good fun to fly many good players have gotten alot of kills with it the problem with the deimos however is that its role is skewed its playing in a leagure that closerange battlecruiser and even battleships fill the deimos has little chance to perform other then being a trophy  and as such is rarely seenwhen debating about t1 frigates and cruisers its important to keep in mind that they are for a large part the only choice for new players that dont have electronic and engineering lvl5 a new player can hardly make a t1 scanfrigate work for pvp if the combat probelauncher with its 220 cpu alone uses up all the cpu on top of that to cater to new players that have been in the game for a month or three it would go a long way if they can engage in interesting mini professions like probingscouting with simple bonuses like negating the cloakspeednerf and lockingnerf on the heron etc you would create a role that despite these ships being ingame for so long is not viable yetthe goal should be to give t1 frigates and cruisers roles like their t2 counterparts while still being vastly outperformed by themships that are simply due for some changes in no particular order hel magnate heron imicus probe crucifier inquisitor condor atron maulus slasher breacher keres hyena mwd sig radius reduction for all eas plz retribution enyo hawk retri would be fine with a rocket fix coercer eris flycatcher augoror omen celestis bellicose lachesis huginn deimos sacrilege prophecy eos nighthawk badgermki iteron13 wreathe  procurer cruor succubus
 hel well im not a super cap pilot but look at the lowsec powerhouse alliances it would seem to them tham moms work just fine magnate heron imicus probe these ships are not ment for pvp they are support frigs you scan down ur enemy and warp the
you want to redo your researchretribution rocketsyou see plenty of the t1 prober hulls in empire for lowsec00 you really want to see the covops cloak
they do its just the hel needs proper bonuscoming from someone who has used the buzzard in gangs and fleets for years there is just no way i could use the heron for even a minimum of the buzzards pvp miniprofession its not just that the buzzard probes better has more room for tackle propulsion mods tackle and tank  the problem is the heron and the other races counterparts for that matter just cant do it at allthe result is that new players are told to train for rifters merlins etc the idea to suggest a new member to try probing and scouting which does require much individual skill rather then ingame sp seems to be herecy for most aside from the griffin putting a pilot into a ew t1 frig is a wasted pilot  he is far more useful in rifter etc same btw for the other frigs  the vigil and rifter outperform the breacher so far its not even funny its impossible to run an mwd and warp disruptor ont he condor with maxed cap skills for over 40seconds if youre using warp scramblers why not use a merlin with 10 the ehp and not much less speedi could go on about each ship but ask yourself  how many of the ones listed do you actually see usedthey are incredibly rare in fleets they die instantly because they are easy to hit compared to ceptors and have little tank compared to assault frigs both bonuses are meh but theyd be used if they werent such deathtrapsagain just look at killbaords very few ppl fly them  for a reasonto be fair im not familiar with how effective destroyers are in fw fleets  what i find when playing with these is that fits looking effective to me require a very good pgcpu skill lvlindeed they are problem is that the eris and flycatcher are hilariously bad compared to the sabre the heretic doesnt compare either however its a good compromise and can be fitted for both large fleets dual bubble shield extenders mwd and speed or small gangs now youre somewhat right they do work in their role to entrap other ships but sabre pilots get to actually have fun shooting things and zippin around because their ship is properly designed  the other dictors are not
the osprey and exequror are the logi ships the augoror gets a cap transfer bonus that is never used because its impossible to fit cpu and pg wise the celestis and bellicose are ew ships while the celestis just needs a boost to keep up with the blackbird the bellicose is just a waste of bandwiththe thorax fitted with lazers does everything better then the omen just sayingthe lachesis and hugin both have split weapon systems and it shows both are outperformed by their cloaking brothersits a tough one i think they both could do with a signature radious reduction  especially the deimos both are playing against battlecruisers and bs  a boost to their cruiser attributes would helpit does nothing better then the harbinger the proph gets a resistant bonus but has one less lowslot then the harbinger instead of having two almost similar ships giving the proph an heavy assault missile bonus would make things far more interesting dont you thinknighthawk works nicely in pve but a commandship with bonuses to kill frigsgimme a caldari absolution pleasethe sigil and bestower are the right approach  one fast and one big hauler pilots can choose fromwhy have 5 hauler models that become useless after a few hours of trainingmy bad i meant the vengeance 
some people kill dramiels with bellicosescant comment on the diemost but the sacri can withstand quite some punishment in smallgangsolo work its sigradius is just 10m larger than the t1 hull and it gave up the laser cap usage bonus for its missile bonuses what kind of bonus from the t1 hull do you missthe missile bonus has been discussed before  only t2 amarr ships use missiles except or the inquisitor but the prophecy follows the punishermallerprophecyabaddon lineso either you make all those ships or leave the prophecy there was some discussion around switching the cap usage bonus of the prophecymallerpunisher into the dmg bonus of the abaddon but the balancing there might be tricky as you would need to increase the base cap of those 3 ships without unbalancing them compared to the other races they could become strong cap war boats that waysarcasmyes the nighthawk sucks in pvptotally suckssarcasm

im reporting you one day you will learn that just like the phrase beauty is in the eye of the beholder so is dumb people are in the eye of the viewerso that just goes to say it can go the other way around i have a lot of support for my ideas so that just means you are the minority

care to list the allowed topicsi think it will be a shorter list than your prohibited one
emo tj for csmcaps for all
delete walls of text as well
what exactly would this forum be for if were not allowed to discuss something that is frequently discussed also you forgot dust whines
you seem v upset this proposal was not directed at you though i find it terribly interesting that you think it was a little selfdoubt perhaps
by macro whines does that include the lolwhine u made about macro missioners then add antisuicide ganking whines and antimission whines to the list and ill support it
and then the entire assembly hall shut down
im not sure which is more sadthat you actually want to discuss any of the topics that i listedor that you cant think of more things to talk about then what i listed
so far rockets are not particularily worth very muchso how about this to turn them into a more fun if not effective toola mini bombwhat im suggesting is a mini area of effect weapon very rapid firing short but fast duration of flight nontargetted in direction that ship is goingobviously smaller aoe than bombintention to be fitted to interceptors going in on full burn straffing runs on a ship or group of shipdont want to go into to too many details as this is just a conceptual proposalgive me some thumbs up 
you want thumbs up on an idea that is not fully developedwouldnt features  ideas a better place for it
ammo  scripts
if i thought there was the slightest chance that this was your main id pod you down to an alpha clone
sigh
i can see 00 being entirely empty if this would be implemented because of 100k players doing ragequit lol
add in ammo scripts too and i support because i like scripting and if you put scripts in my scripts i can script while i scriptlaser  taste the rainbow  ammo changes type continuallyhybrid  point blank  100 dps increase must be in physical contact with enemy to usemissiles  blue on blue  200 dps increase but missles fly off and hit random targetsprojectiles  one shot one kill  300 dps increase but destroys the gun that fires it
rofl i want that
simple as adding wormholes under operations and wormholes under location as options in the in game recruitment adverts
why it would appear you got your first major downtime already on the 7th otherwise no of course besides if you need ccp to shut off the game for you because you apparently lack the selfcontrol to abstain then you really need help
i have a better idealets all put the servers to an infinite downtime do something else all the time and just send ccp our money for nothing
i too appreciate using my recon to support another recon support support is the best role in the game i suppose youre also going to suggest that we fit lock time rsds on our arazus to support rooks imo the question is whether youd rather bring an arazu or a rapier when going after a nano ship and i would always choose the arazu this is a problem when you consider that the minmatar recons have always been the traditional nano counter  and that they have lost that role due to their primary ewar being usurpedliang
yes eve was never a game that favored teamwork
id rather have two arazus than one arazu and one rapier except in very specific circumstances sometimes teamwork involves bring something else so you actually contribute lianged and in reality i would much prefer to have a curse and an arazu yay the rapier is so awesome at stopping nano ships
combining the tp and web bonuses on my rapier allows my dread to hit an orbiting bs for almost full damagethe tp is a very situational tool on the rapier but in the cases where its useful its very usefulthey are when you combine them with a small frigate class ship that can stay close under the guns and tackle or an arazu that can disrupt from even further outyes scrams slow it down more  but you cant stack scrams if you add more scrams to an already scrammed ship nothing happens if you add more webs to an already webbed or abing ship it slows down more arazu scrams have half the range of a rapier web and neuts are countered if the opponent has a cap booster or nos or any other way to quickly replenish cap and reactivate his speed mod additionally a neutedscrammed ship is slower but a still mwding dual webbed ship has a huge sig and will be much easier to hitrecons are not really intended to be solo ships  they have ew bonuses and ew is supposed to be a force multiplier combine it with any kind of td damp or ecm and it will be pretty safe at that rangeid take the rapier with it i can slow it down to make it easier to catch up from 40km and then properly tackle at 24k with an arazu i cant slow it don until i get in to 18ki do agree that rapiers and huginns could use a role bonus of 25 web strength making them 75 though but theyre still very good and very valueable ships right now 1 rapier and 1 arazu to lock down a ship from their maximum ranges so a gang can come in and finish it is perfectly reasonable imo
they only take a few volleys to pop oh wait
supported because this would mean that i would have a chance to tackle even if my target has multiple wcs

greetingsim rather new to the csm process and politics so pardon me if i have not done full research on all the csm candidates and their past views and achievements or separated all the facts from the multitude of opinions my opinion below is based on my observations and it is entirely possible that these may be disputed by factsankh has applied to join the ammatar free corps out of what i believe is her own desire to live the full range of corporation and alliance social experiences and to make herself a more complete capsuleer in spite of her numerous achievements in past csms she has impressed me with her humility and dedication to our corp by dutifully fulfilling the tedious maintenance of our poses for a long time as she had been what is effectively our version of the general secretary of the united nations it is a very humbling experience to see that she can carry out her tasks without ever complaining oncethroughout her stay in the afccva ankh has been closely observing the situation postdominion with the issues concerning nrds alliances sovereignty mechanics and even roleplaying styles and motivations she has sought valuable feedback from fellow alliance members and i believe this will be taken into account in her feedback to the council and ccp in her replies to our alliance members i have not detected any strong procva stance merely her desire to listen to all perspectives and to make herself a true representative for all capsuleersand although i am now ankhs ceo ingame she is a giant in her own right she has done more for the eve community than most of us can ever imagine ourselves doing for someone who has the passion and concern to improve the game that we all love or love to hate and has the determination and will to run for the council again she has my votei hope you will give her your support good luck to all the candidates
nice propaganda piece but theres evidence in this thread that directly contradicts a lot of what youve said
indeed on my main  cant post on these forums because of lolrp restrictions  i know a few of the members from this corp and they all say shes done fall for corp until term limits were done away with and she realised she could stand again and wanted support
sorry but that socalled evidence has already been proven false most of the time i rather believe a statement from her direct ceo than some professional mudflingers and trolls her ceo has a credible reputation
truth is marlakhs sudden involvement and statement with the classic examples of nepotism here and there sounds more like a crusade that is getting more and more desperate to keep her campaign on life support after going from vegetative state to persistent vegetative state when it only begs for a painless death without any sufferingand as for you it is apparent you would believe anything any one tells you to believe because it is so much simpler that way for you isnt it
if i look at the past times she and the other take care people ran for csm we saw the same smear on the campaign thread all these people won the elections regardless when on the csm ankh erik and z0d performed well and time and again the whines and accusations from the griefingganking00 crowd were proven false
bolded the pertinent part so you agree that in places she has misrepresented herself andor the facts yet you still think shes a great canditate astounding
to all who hate ankh go vote for someone else if you dont want her in the csm and stfu kthx
time for some more corp chat quotes i suppose seriously marlakh youre a great guy but you know fine well that what youre saying is far from the truth where was she when g5 was in need
omg  facepalm
for those that whine about it id like a copy of all their eve chat logs in my mailinappropriate content removedapplebabe with enough digging enough can be found about everyoneanyway i dont feel the need to comment about the particular accusations this time either because they are irrelevant and meaningless
094309 ankhesentapemkah  maybe your son inherited your genes huhblaming a parent for making their child autistic classyand this is someone who has the presumption to make moral judgements on others amazing
none of you trolls ever had a dispute in corp chat and never insulted anyone of course care to make your logs public
i dont think he meant them to be accusations my dear simple facts about you and nothing else
i keep in game arguments in game i dont abuse mentally disabled children or their parents in them id cheerfully call someone an idiot for losing a ship as ankh seems to have done and id definitely tell them to stfu if they ed about losing it and tried to blame anyone but themselves actually i do this quite often but i would leave the kid out of itmind you i very rarely have disputes in corp chat because i actually contribute to my corp and also i dont think that im too awesome to need to log in to intel or even check local while claiming that i know just plenty about pvp tyvm
for added comedy value head to the uk killboard and look up the loss she was emoraging about its the domi lost on 20100128 i believeclearly someone who would lose a ship fit like that under those circumstances is in an excellent position to be advising ccp
exactly hell you should see our corp chat from time to time youd wonder why the hell any of us are still playing eve judging by all the ing we do the ones with multiple accounts including moi do the most ing in general even
how many of the trolls are running for a public position with social responsibilities most people know where to draw the line when having a disagreement with someone and what was said in that corp chat goes far and beyond anything that any rational human being would consider decent regardless of how mad you are what happens in csm meetings if she doesnt like whats being saidand it doesnt matter how many times you use the emoticon what she has done is still indefensible
a if you say theyve been snipped post the full logs everyone gets a copyb you should never be personally attacking anyones family members and actually be meaning it especially if your highlighting a disability that one hasc the fact you do not need to comment on the evidence here due to them being irrelevant and meaningless strengthens my impression that they are true as thats a very poor defencei hope your votes now circle the toilet and your never even considered for csm after this
if such ill mannered pessimistic carebears can be elected to csm then whats the point of the csm at least get people who can play the game to speak for the players
let me guess  irrelevant and meaningless translates to anything that attacks me
your statement is obviously irrelevant and meaningless and hence doesnt deserve a responsemaybe you are a troll too
oh dear
worried about the context of log due to snipped partswell fret no more here it is in full
i like how you vehemently deny most things but not this also that is a nice assumption to make about the entire player base not everyone is as bitter pathetic and hateful as you appear to bevery dissappointed knowing this csm will be representing all players
posting to say that neither i nor any of my alts voted for ankhthat is allcarry on
there is so much drama and fighting over who did what and all i dont even care i just want to say
ummm im guessing wrong logs whether this was intentional or not who knows but the timestamps on whats been accused and any timestamp in that full log dont match up eg accused timelapse 092418094256 full log timelapse 152328022956
the future of eve as designed by ankletrhrttwemka
this is turning into something truely uglywe got to learn a bit about ank in this thread it is quite clear she is a very confused personbut because we all feel so passionte about this game and maybe even unhealthily identify ourselfs with itwe are unable to see past her shortcommings and feel personally attacked by her strong voiced misassumptionsthis is not good guise cleary she does not belong in this game but she doesnUFFFDt need to be crusified for itank to you please go play other games you donUFFFDt understand eve and it wonUFFFDt help you in the rest of your lifeher attackers to you no matter how harsh a response we provoke from her remember she is a person and means wellhowever clumsilyto her followers lol
the logs are from two separate days that long one linked there is from before new year whereas the other is from during the battles for dgtmi after the jump bridge pos fell but before the spatial anomalies ate cvas fleet 
hi mynxeethis guy hydrostatic capsule has some interesting ideas about both the ui and perhaps more importantly the way in which pilots should be given warnings when a certain number of jumps happen through a certain gate at a time i think as does he that this would make larger blobs less effective due to the warning that pilots would have before they were attacked the blog explains it far better than i could but i was wondering what you think of the idea
if you support a revamping of the drugs system then il give you 3 votes

hay issler glad to see that you are running again you represent a fairly large population of people in eve that dont say much for them selves and need a voice in what ever government that is active i have been through your corp a few times and have met you in rl and know that you are well centered and have a good idea of how you feel things should be im glad that you are not agianst pvp it is what eve is all about and for some its they only way they feel powerful you know how you are but its not the only thing to do in the verse and thats why i am yet agian voting for you would do so with all my sisters but cant afford to bring them all out of stasis at this time good luck to you and hope you make it agian this termtalleria lange

you have stated a mostly negative stance to ccps dev team in regards to their implementation of game play mechanicswhat is your view on tyrannis that is scheduled to be released on the 18th do you feel that this will add more to the proposed balance issues or help to alleviate them
im really glad they made some changes with minerals and insurance something that will affect a lot of issues and i hope will make the game better in time we had a very constructive discussion about it with ccp in winter and i see a good results as for the planetary interaction i cant judge it yet before i see the final result not the unfinished singularity version of it i really liked to play settlers back in 90th and settlers like games after that i hope we will get something similar and exciting at the end the idea is great all we need is a polished expansiondont get me wrong im not saying that everything ccp had ever made was bad the eve is great but my program is focused on the issues we have not the achievements we are happy with

voted for mazz because she generates internet erage and is a girl
with tyrannis on the dawn of release how will the new features effect your campaign promises would you think the expansion of game mechanics will change your stance on any of these things you have listedspecifically you say fix old content before adding new features does this mean you oppose the new expansion with its planetary interface pi
and from a purely business perspective anything you can do to make a potential competitors business case a bit harder to make eg taking away their we can do a better interface bullet point is a good idea thanks for pointing that out
well i managed to read through all the csm crap on the vote page then came back to trebor i like your ui and lag agenda i have mailed my corp and will hopefully get it forwarded to alliance mail as i do not have the rights lol i stated my character votes for you and linked the vote page and this post i also do not hold the fact you are currently in initiative mercenaries against you i know how hard it is to eak out a living with them now i am rambling again2 votes and good luck trebor
you got my vote for wizardry that was my first roleplaying game i ever knew back when i was a young lad watching my father play it on the apple 
i like where you stand on lowsec and exploration needs a big boost imogot mah vote brah
the hell with the party line mazz cant even seeelise 10
im pretty much ok with all that with wtz anyone doing anything substantial roaming hauling missioning what have you will already have bookmarks made so that awesome freighter youre trying to gank is still going to hit the gate and jump throughjump freighters i know the common sentiment is that eve was much cooler when there were freighter conga lines errrverywhere but ultimately this would be a bad thing in that it would just promote a blob mentality even further not to mention that it would make nomadic living so much more difficult and completely curbstomp the hopes of a robust lowsec marketso while they are sometimes frustrating the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks i would like to remind everyone that voting is still open and i can still use your help if you know anyone who is undecided or has yet to vote or too cynical to vote send them my way
confirming i do know the true identity of cats main will share this infomation for 500m isk transfer through chribbas third party servicemail me
if you were elected to csm what would be your primary goals or objectives other canidates have complained of game balancing issues do you agree that there are problems in game mechanics that need addressing if so what is your view on the new expansion coming out this month do you feel that adding new features will detract from issues or help resolve them
if you have suspicions  petition them let the gms decide im fighting in tribute at the moment and have no idea what other corp members are doing in delve if i would see a player who acts like a bot  i would petition it corp member or not so you are comparing miners who took all possible precautions to mine in safety with some carefree noobs who think that highsec is completely safe dont you see that there is something wrong in such comparisonimperialism even alliance wallets have tendency to deplete and a difference between fat wallet and the thin one is the difference between victory and defeat
last week i provided the interview for evetribunecom you can read it here
how do u think corbeau if lvl 4 missions will be moved to lowsec how many highsec ranners will leave eve and how many will join pvp  but there is no doubt it should be nerfed
do i look like fortuneteller some will leave others will adapt and some will become pvpers anyway its for the best overall
bump awesomevote wulfnor
hi teadazeis it possible to elaborate on the wormhole points in your manifestoi represent a block of votes that can be persuaded to vote for issues that pertain to wormhole space if said stuff currently irritate usyou seem to be one of the candidates that are taking the csm very seriously an not as some popularity contest
vuk lau 1
great candidates you have my vote
voting for you now
wtf why am i the bad guy here i asked and asked for clarification and i started out nicely if ccp had answered in a prompt manner none of this would have happened all ccp had to do was answer one simple question in a timely manner now i have my answer hershel is still a freaky deeky no clue what the hell the muppet thing iswas about jack i was messing with you i knew you were a guy since you are running for a spot on the csm to bad you arent really female the whole pain is pleasure thing is fun but i perfer boy with girl still great name though and lumy what does the op stand for adingo i wasnt trolling i was trying to get a straight answer for a simple question why am i the bad guy because a buch of small minded players attacked me for asking and i defended myself on a level the attacks started on and i figured the na sayers would understandi even thanked him for finally answering and wished everyone the best of luck in the election how is that a bad thing first you  about my questionsposts as rude and now you are ing because i conceded that i was at fault well not really lets just call it a drawand wished everyone luck are you people that completly barking mad that you cant accept that i accepted ccps statement at face value and i quit my quest geeze you folks are unreal damned if i do damned if i dont
i believe you are being hounded because of your continually terrible post style the one paragraph and poor punctuation thing though you have improved since the start really thats the only thing that bugs me it tends to be difficult to read and people seem to care less if they have to work to understand a postof course theres also that gay comment which may or may not have offended peopleand then there was your criticism of others posting grammar when yours hasnt been much betterbut these are just possibilities i wouldnt know about anyones personal feelings
oh theres no may or may not have about itit did newsflash queer people play eve and rather than apologizing when called on it the op proceeded to start ranting about general westmoreland and doing the standard im not a bigot but here let me say something bigoted routine now what westmoreland has to do with any of this is beyond me but regardless of right now the op still has not stopped diggingallow me to give the op a modest piece of advice you are not making friends and you look like an idiot your best bet right now is to disappear quietly off the forums and not come back until youve learned how to post without looking like a total moron hope this helpsps if ccp censors the word queer then theyre as dumb as the opedit confirming that ccp is as dumb as the op the censored word is a synonym for strange that is frequently used by sexual minorities as a way to avoid the crisis of the everexpanding acronym thus typically one hears about the queer community as opposed to the lgbt community and my undergraduate college did not have an lgbt resource center but a queer resource center granted it is also used and indeed originated as a slur but i would say that today its primary meaning is more neutral
unintentionally hilarious
elf lord can it be my havent you come a long way from being that noob i killed in arnon with rail guns on his punisher lmaoeven if this post is a little fail im glad to see your still at itback on topic my freind applied aswell and they never got his aplication either so yeah it was prob a glitch on ccps end but hey theres always next year dont fly safe fly deadly
best troll ever
sup so sensationalsomething definitely needs to be done to and for lowsec both for the residents already there and to help stimulate some new arrivals i personally have yet to come up with any concrete ideas however rico minalis outlaw expansion idea comes straight to mind his idea would enable players to create manipulate and run the criminal underground with access to a lowsec only blackmarkets and manufacturing opportunities and although i dont agree with everything that has been written i wholeheartedly support the outlaw expansions continuing development and hopefully its future implementationon another note i am completely against moving all missions to lowsec and although i think there should be some small quanities of 00sec ore in lowsec id not condone any substantial amount being made accesable therethe following idea is not on my agenda but something that has been floating in my imagination for the last couple of dayssome of my less concrete ideas involving lowsec would be to buff the lowsec npc ai to be more inline with wormhole npcs with rats dropping lowsec only commodities required for some function in hisec along with the ability of the rats to call in a support fleet which would be of a size relevant to the gang attacking it if these commodities sale could be restricted to 04 sec and below although not illegal to have on your person anywhere else some profit could be restricted to these areas and it would force people to come to these areas to pick them up this change would be aimed at bringing more hisec gangs into lowsec and industrial types which of course would also increase the risk of pirating oppurtunitiestamber
can you try to get ccp to release more info on dust if you are elected regular updates for that would be a welcome addition
im behind this guy and you should be too
voted for and friendly bump
hi ozwith the increase in suicide ganking of miners that comes in cycles nowhulkageddon etc ive been watching with interest as other csms have discussed the topic ideas have been bandied about including removing insurance if concord kills youim wondering what your thoughts on the issue arepersonallyim all for finding ways to get rid of afk script miners so those of us who are actually piloting our hulks and orcas can turn a better profit on our hours and hours of floating in space chatting in alliance unfortunately most hulkageddon participants dont ever seem to do the work of finding out if their targets are actually afk they just find an expensive target and blow it up and walk away laughing with the insurance check and maybe some carebear tearsthere are only so many things we pilots can do to tank a hulkorca and still make it profitable to fly the things the more you tank the less money you make but even with a balanced fit your no match for 46 destroyerscruisersbcs jumping on top of you ready to be concorddookendif you remove insurance on all concord kills that doesnt help the noobie player who accidentally targets another players wreck and shoots it in some complex somewhere even with the are you sure you want to do this you idiot warning ive personally been that idiot and yes it would have sucked not to have had insurance pay out for my idiocy so i dont know what the solution is which is where your thoughts as our maybe future rep come in
one vote for you you can thank to vote match
then vote for the person that doesnt smear its not so much an issue with politics its with the voters noise and smear is what most people respond to thats why politicians use it to get elected if voters didnt lap it up then politics wouldnt use it cure the cause not the symptom good luck curing the inherent stupidity of people thoughdiscussion on real life politics are not allowedapplebabe
i find it funny that most of the mudslinging is not by the candidates well unless they each have hundreds of alts
theres what 53 candidates so lets say you run a really awesome smear campaign and mudsling 43 of them completely out of the race leaving 10 behind well the other 9 have been campaigning and youve just been smearing so youll still lose negative campaigning is effective but its not enough of course you need to stand for something of course you need to promote yourself even in the us with a strongly twoparty systemaka one where reducing an opponents votes is just as good as increasing your own theres still plenty of positive campaigning but people like complaining about attack ads anyways
not all candidates have been mudslingingother than that what herschel saidtamber
i havent been doing any mud slinging i do pay one kitten per vote fresh or roasted your choice
congratulations and welcome the world beyond your screen you finally understood the concept of politics politicians votes voters mudslingers and so on everywhere youre telling things that are known and discussed for decades since democracy was inventedwant a medal now
you manage that part just fine missbanallpiratesandletsmakeeveacarebeargame
what about when youre posting interactions directly with the candidate that show them as unstable unsuitable and downright unsociable i mean surely people ought to know who it is that wants to represent themdiscussions on real life politics are not allowedapplebabe
i atleast see the difference between you and me thenother than you i dont feel the need to accept politics and politicians needeng to be like thatand no keep the medal i wouldnt want you to part with one of yours they dont suit me anyways
doesnt matter whether you accept it or not its theresome people dont accept the concept of gravity doesnt change anything
gravity isnt something you can change by acceptance or rejectingthe way people respond towards eachother is merely a matter of choicemaybe you will see the difference one day
a turd in a punch bowl is still a turd in th epunch bowl no matter how big the bowl or how samll the turd
i know the difference but expecting people to change their choice without a reason is just like expecting gravity to go away foolishnessuntil there is a reason for the mudslinging in politics to go away such as fines or somesuch it will remain as a popular method of trying to win  make opponent lose
bumpage
while adding new space might seem the right way it does not tackle the issue but only delays it one year down the line you will have the same problems we have now 00 isnt crowded as it is currently and large alliances wont grow fast enough to make use of their vast space
hey guysover at massivelycom weve put together a great big community resource to help voters make their minds up its been linked on the eve facebook and the eve news on the main pagemassivelys eve online csm candidate roundupthe article begins by explaining the importance of the csm and picking the right candidate in what i consider to be very clear terms it then has a full listing of all 49 candidates in the running with a short paragraph on each of their goals in the csm next to each candidate is their picture and links to their campaign pages forum threads interviews and videos all the info on them is there all in one place so you dont have to hunt around for details candidates are divided into those that have participated in previous csm editions new candidates that are running campaigns and the few relatively unknown pilots that didnt make much of an effort to run a campaignthis is intended to be a community resource for the voting season and i fully encourage you to point out any mistakes additional information or relevant links such as new interviews you find as long as you guys supply any new info that comes to light ill keep the article up to date as a comprehensive resource leading up to the votings closing on may 19th feel free also to submit new information links and corrections via this thread if you know someone that isnt motivated to vote doesnt know who to vote for or thinks the csm is a waste of time perhaps this article might change their mindcheers 
read it great summaries of the candidates thanks for the 3rd party synopses and for doing the research to compile all the links and such valuable resource for voting and nice touch with encouraging ones to votecinori aluben csm5 2010fix the little things firstwwwlittlethingsfirstcom
anyone or anything that brings more exposure to the csm process is a good thingtm d
thank you for you effort its quite nice summary but i would like to point out that im not only about reforms in highlow security space im also about making eve more harsh and fixing various stuff as i explained in my csm topicby the way here is an interview with me
nice summaries well done
thanks for the help
i saw the articleit was good to see it posted in the headline news on the front page of this web sitei did see a few issuesthe article heavily weights the csm members that have served in past csm past experience is a great bonus but the article also places them first information fatigue can set in by the time you get to the end of that list people will naturally lean to the people with past experience and the placement of them fisrt in the article reinforces that not that i have a better organizational method to suggest several of the people in the new active campaigners are not so new they have been candidates in previous elections leading the article with the candidates that held a csm seat previously and dropping past campaigners in a new category is a bit dismissivemost of the information can be seen just by looking at the official candidate list that being said the article distills the candidates positions rather then subjecting the readervoter to information overload i just wish ccp did not have a region named genesis the the original name i had for the incubator systems labeling the concept genesis systems makes for a better name but would conflict with the genesis region in game it would be like making new content and using a name like eve gate which is already prat of the game and the back story who would do such a silly thing in any case thanks for the effort any exposure is good exposure and letting more people know about the csm and its candidates is a good thing
in what context is my blurb meant lol also i decided to type some words into my campaign webpage x
i thought it was in order of good looks xnice work massivetamber
this thread is nothing but inspiration next year i am totally going to run for csmmay the best troll win
amen lolfor the first time really you dont read a lot here do you

i filled mine out yesterday just didnt get round to posting it lol will send tonight better late than never maybex
bring back the flashy woooosh

do you have any argument other than nuh uh or its goumindong anything other than your unsupported claim that balance will be the way you sayany change you make is going to have people whine if you have fast and agile blaster boats people will whine if you have slow and more damaging blaster boats people will whinethe question is rather where do you have balance and you only have balance with the trichotomous system that we have where the blaster boats are able to catch targets they will still be suboptimal in a skirmish gang since they cant run away they will still be suboptimal in a big gang because they cant get dps on target instantly but they will also not be obsolete solosmall gang where the ability to full tackle and get dps on a target is a valuable addition
look leave the high agility and good speed to minmatar ships give the gal blaster ships a higher speed and greater inertialower agility so blaster ships can out run anything but a nano but they have a turning circle of a moon making piloting skill key rather than just clicking keep at range or orbit ati really think straight line speed is key and looks like the balls to the wall full frontal naked assault gal war fighting ideology seems to beedit terribad england
high speed with low agility ie high align times isnt high speedthe advantage to minnie ships will still be that they are typically going to be shield tanked rather than armor tanked and that going into full tackle range necessitates a significantly higher amount of risk than a pilot that does notin a comparison of a skirmish ship solo vs the blaster solo the blaster indeed will have the advantageprovided the minnie ship isnt using its utility highs wisely they should but once numbers start to increase the ability to get tackles at close range starts to significantly diminish compared to the ability to focus fire either the blaster ships have to tackle 1 by 1 in order to focus fire or they have to target ships one by one the first means that they have to reclose to damage range on each target since the rest of the skirmish gang which is not tackled will be keeping range giving up the ability to focus fire is the other option and certainly not the stronger of the twotime and time again it has been shown that the burn towards a target is a recipe for disaster against longer ranged gangs that are able to take a majority of their gang outside of the range of the opponent fast and agile blaster ships do not change that scenario nor do they effectively change the scenario against a heavy gang of longer ranged ships that is sitting still since the first mover advantage will still outweigh the raw damage advantage there are also gang homogeneity issues tears them upit only changes the game when its a very small gang where targets can be isolated and a follower will not be slaughtered before it can do effective damage this is especially true since the only time that blaster ships can field an effective tankto make them a heavy tackle that might have a chance of surviving in a gang scenario where they have to chase a skirmish gangthey will have to be running armornot really enough slots for shield for the cruisers and that means eating up low slots with plates and modules that arent speed modules eating away at any speed advantage they are given
i support this ccp needs to at least let us know if they agree there is a problem so we can have an end to this ever recurring subject
i see what you did thereanyone thought of charge mode we have triage module should we have charge module that would make your speed go though the roof but have a big reactivation delay
it is an interesting idea but it would mess up pvp dynamics badlypeople would us it to get past gate camps usually charging back toward the gate for jump out that tactic is already powerful with mwd but at least mwd can be turned off by scramble the webs are too weak to stop anything such a module would become a musthave for all pvpit may also lead to new bumping tactics with unexpected results
and this is the issue these threads keep reachingblasters cant get a increase in damage because then they are op when they land on ships in a gankblaster ships cant have more speedagility because then minmatar ships dont have a speedagility nicheblasters cant have more range because then ac and pulse would lose their nicherailguns cant have more damage because then caldari railboats become op at long range and gallente become op at medium rangerailguns cant have more range because even though this would fix gallente it would render the bonuses on caldari ships worthlesshybrids in general cannot have more tracking because that would allow op fits  blaster bs that kill tacklers and midrange rail bshacs that can kill tacklershybrids railguns cannot have penetration as this would make even low damage guns op in certain situationsso currently hybrids remain without a functional niche because there are so many different problems with them that blanket changes will not fix the problem without making something op a proper fix would be tldr but csm isnt willing to go to ccp with a general suggestion for ccp to fix hybridsdoes assembly hall have to debate balancing changes for each hybrid shipgunammo there was already a consensus that hybrids need to be reviewed and balanced isnt the actual job of balancing the responsibility of ccp not assembly hall or csm cant csm simply tell ccp that hybrids need to be reviewed for balance and leave it in the hands of ccp with oversight and input  usually given when things hit sisi
this is what i wrote pages ago  hybrid shipsweapons need to be redesigned and csm only needs to push the issue to ccp  it is ccp job to fix this
i fail to see this as a valid point anyone care to enlighten mei have seen many gank squads in my time and i have not noticed any emphasis on blasters even if you ignore all the practical hurdles of getting perfect blaster damage its still only marginally better than acs and lasers after ship bonuses and a damage mod makes more difference in ship dps than weapon typevery few practical gallente ships utilize 3 damage mods for short range because that would leave them with very weak tanks but likewise all other factions can achieve same type of dps with 3 damage mods on short range weapons and actual dps of theirs will match that of blasters when you factor in fall off and trackingso no i just dont see any significant differences in practical or theoretical damage output of blasters relative to other ships
you are talking about the current situation the statement is referring to blasters that did more damage than they currently do already when a blaster boat warps to you at 0 or near 0 they melt your face if ccp boosted their damage output there would be giant emo tears and op outrage even a 1 boost to damage would cause this because people talk hypothetical situations on here while disregarding the normal state of affairs look at all the not support posts in this threadagain i think the case has been made repeatedly that ccp needs to address hybrid guns and make adjustments to fix the imbalance
yes the assembly hall is not where you go to whine to ccp with no suggestions its a place where you can articulate exactly what is wrong and exactly how it can be fixed and exactly why this is sowhy whines waste ccps time without clear articulation on what is wrong why its wrong how it can be fixed and why ccp has to justify all of the missing points before they can act if they end up doing it in a way that was contrary to the point of the thread well then its back to square one with more whinesspeed and agility are not niches minmatar are the skirmish race and that niche is maintained even if blaster boats are faster and more agile than the skirmish ships for all the reasons already outlinedif you have two ships one that has long range and is slow and one that has medium range and higher damage but is fast a third ship that is short range must be faster than the medium range ship or it will be obsolete the medium range ships can kill the longer ranged ships in small gangs the long range ships can kill the medium and short in larger gangs the short range ships can kill the long range ships in small gangsexcept that if you have the option of flying a ship that can destroy the long range ships in small gangs and loses to the medium range ships in small gangs or a ship that can destroy the long range ships in small gangs and ties the medium range ships in small gangs youre always going to choose the medium range shipsno they cant get a damage increase because a damage increase is both a range increaseeffective dps  range goes up over falloff increasing the distance required by minmatar before they have a damage advantage which is a nono and wont do anything to alleviate the problem of minnie ships obsoleting them in combat except as a function of the range increase
disagree all you want it wont change the fact that it cannot be balanced also the way it would be balanced would always favor buffer tanks since balanced against repair tanks would make it too weak against bufferand too strong against stronger repair tanks
ive been messing around with this idea trying to simulate a fight a 1 vs 1 fight mind with this mechanic ive chosen a brutix with a dual medium armour repair fit as my targetstrangely because it is a dynamic chance based system dependent on the current state of the tank shieldarmour the active tanker prevents a lot of the penetrating hits by keeping their tank as close to 100 as possible which vs railguns of a ship in the same class isnt difficult my simulation could be completly wrong but ive tried my bestest may bad england a bit there to create a fair simulation ill do a couple other simulations too but from what i can see the most vulnerable to a penetration mechanic appears to be the passive shield tanker seems as peak recharge rates dont occur until shield  25ill keep working on it alone mostly cause im bored whilst being called an idiot on the forums until i can see a really big problem with it
everything else aside what the f are players and csm the balance team for ccp is csm really suppoused to do all the balancing and ccp decides if they go with it or not what where why how i dont get it
all the cool kids would be hull tanking dont forget that the difference between someone with a dcu and someone without is huge for damaging hullalsothis does anyone here disagree with the statement that railguns are not well balanced with the other long range guns i mean everyone here seems to have offered a suggested fix so far
railguns are balanced with the other long range guns
no they are not
no they are not beams have dps artillery has alfa caldari rails have range  gallente rails have no advantage
i already showed you how to have this problem show up you have two options to maximize your chances of damage penetration ungroup your railguns each gun then has a progressively higher chance of penetration use more than one rail ship even two will have a much higher chance of penetration than any otheri agree with your analysis that passive recharge tanking would be the most vulnerable  especially considering that your tank barely even start working at 50 shieldsliang
i agree with basically everything said as i have experienced that these ships need a little loving so a t1 version doesnt do the same or better
yes please supported
 i live in wh space and this is a big issue and all it does is cause everybody to need multiple t3 ships to do anything with them so i fully support this fix or anything that allows assembly and refitting of sub systems in space
supported ccp please give this some priority we under stand that things are bussey there but this isue has been on going for a while now and it seems that nothing is being done about it i also would like to see scroling out having no effect on sounds where it pertains to my ship hearing guns going off or other sounds is part of the experience dont make proximity to your ship in the view a perameter for sounds maybe a few more options also one i can think of is the shield armor and hull warnings i like those but can they be put on a seperate slider each or at least combine all three on there own slider turn them down so there not blaring then you barly here some other stuff as there part of the world sound level slider least i think thats the one put them on there own slider so come on ccp its time to give us working sound dont ya think

best idea ever i would be happy to pay a little extra to have another layer of protection
signedgreat idea
assuming it will be done better than the blizzard one approvedif it is just a copy of a defective and poorly thought out security token that has the potential to lock you out of your account for which reactivation requires a wealth of paperwork not supported
yes as long as it is a mature and reliable implementation id even pay for the option
would be awesome
i would gladly pay extra for it
if the safety can be compared to that of banks who use those number generator devices ill gladly pay money for it but it really has to add some extra protection not easy to bypasshack
yes please ffs11111111 this drives me crazy since the day i started probing i have to fip the plane each time i shrink the probes if you could make the probe moving cubes and arrows highlight in bright greenyelloworange thatd be great cause now its gray box with grayblue highlight and its really hard to see most of the time

hey alli apologise if this has already been put forward however i would love the training skill time to be increased from 24 hours to 48 hours or maybe even 60 hoursmy thinking behind this is as you progress your skills the training time increases to the point where you can only stack 1 skill at a timethis becomes a pain when you are away for a few days and have no access to eve so you have wasted training timei am sure people who travel a lot or who do not have access to eve for days at a time often can find this frustrating as you can occur weeks of wasted training timeif this idea has been put forward before and shot down then once again i apologise
why not a week for many players the ability to stack more than 1 skill at a time would require a month plus of training queueit is all about scheduling your training queue 24 hours is plenty as the rational complaint was in regards to having to wake up at 4am to change skill training there are always plenty of good skills to train to tide you over for a few days if you plan your training right
the extra 24 hours would be enough to prevent morning wakeups for skill training anything more would allow people to skill up without ever opening the client for days on end which is not righteditreply and support youre own thread too so i agree with this ignore the guy above he trolls every thread probably has his fiveminute response delay timer up 99 of the timedont apologize to trolls either in your original proposal
oh look he doesnt agree with my super duper proposal he must be trolling because everyone with the right mind would just hit support on my ideadont want to burst your bubble but not everyone who disagrees with you is trolling youon the topic of this threadthe skill queue should solve exactly one problem no more alarm clocking for changing skill training it does that pretty well and gives you room to shuffle skills around so you get over the night we dont need longer queues if you had invested a bit time in searching you would have found out that this is the general answer you get on this suggestion
telling you that you are wrong is not trolling i dignified your post with a response and explanation which i probably shouldnt have i did not say anything outrageous try to derail the topic or degrade you unlike you have just doneas to having an extra 24 hours to prevent morning wakeups  this would only be the case if you sleep more than 24 hours at a time
so you only wake up once every 48 hours imo 24 hours is more then enough cause otherwise i want a 1 month que cause i sometimes almost forget that my 30 day skill is ending and im missing training time cause of that
electronic attack frigates cost 15x20x times more then a usual t1 frig they need special skill training and they are very nice to fly if is locking range was not reduced to crazy distanceshyena 35ksentinel 365kkeres 392kkitsune 42kthese are ships that are paper thin and the only tank they have is distance and speed when some of their t1 mates do almost the same thing costing 20x less and having the double of locking range why fly themgive some loving to eaf and increase their locking range pleaseedit kitsune lock range error thanks darius mclever
they dont call you naga for nothing ehbut still good point
this is the general problem of ewar ships they have no tank can easily be op with the wrong boosts and cost too much for people to buy them for niche they are supposed to fill as they are currentlydecreasing the cost or fixing insurance might be the correct fix though not increasing the range
i dont want to nitpick  but your numbers are a bit off the kitsune has 42km base locking range 525 with lvl5 skills
that almost is pretty damn significant as it adds a ton of power in the form of the secondary bonusesprovided all t2 frigates get the insurance bump that has been promised for interceptors price of flying them should drop to fittings and not much else lets just hope that ccp includes them op does have a point regarding the range though rather silly that they are so inferior to the t1 versions in the lockrange department  not as if they will be using the secondary at those ranges so one might as well use t1 hulls which is exactly what is happening in my experience
lol idk if i believe it though 
atleast his name emo tj is accurate
haha i just saw why hes raging like this on battleclinic epicand no i dont support your idea if you are fail enough to get blown up by a badger you should be blown up anyway
well all i can say ispwnt
this is quite possibly the best thread on the doubleu doubleu doubleu atm
you my good sir made my day or at least miss sky did i wont support your case though that is silly
can you see how stupid it looks when you type like that noalso no there are enough other devices which need a turret and are not for pewpew but useful on a hauler if you are afraid of haulers ganking you go back to the sandbox and play with your little sister ok
to the op this is what i think
forgot to support my own balancing suggestion need more thumbs up for this change people
right so i think you are completely ed for losing a dramiel to a hauler in the first place but now you are making yourself look worse by saying that haulers should be balanced out seriously and having actually read some of the replies and the chatlog from the incident i have no choice but to join the crowd and laugh in your face
the way i type is my trademark a lot of posters have different trademarks and this is mine it distinguishes me from the casual posters and allows my readers to easily recognize it is me kind of like when you read a poem or hear some music you can tell who the author or artist is just by the way things are written or how you hear it
the only thing you can tell from the way you type is that you are not the brightest crayon in the box also illustrated by your unbelievable performance against the badger of doom

bountyhunting is a pretty important aspect of this genre and one of the features touted to reel in new players im not sure if its just omitted now by ccp but i keep seeing newbs in rookie help asking how the bounty system works the heartbreak that follows is pretty formulaic  bounties are useless now theyre only really used as trophies people just get their buddies to collectsplit them im proposing a change that requires little development but a bit of planning to implement properly the basic tenets are1 only npcs can collect bounties by placing a bounty on another players head its an isk sink meant only to aggravate that player2 npcs are randomly generated to attack the bountied target the frequency of bountyhunters generated as well as the intensity of their attack one frigate numerous frigates cruiserbcbs are based on the system security level and the amount of the bounty lets work some theoretical examples here i place a very small bounty on a guy that keeps canflipping me in a 03 system but who i cant be bothered to attack in lowsec space there is less risk for an npc bounty hunter so the odds of him being attacked are higher since i placed a small bounty when npcs are generated theyll likely just be annoying frigs if i pay more money we might see bigger ships or more frequent attacks when the target moves to high secnow thats a radical idea we need to consider the details  how often are we generating npcs whenwhere would players be vulnerable to these attacks in belts at gates while dockingundocking from stationswe also need to consider the implications first it makes space less safe in general i rarely autopilot but id never want to do it even in highsec if i knew an npc could come suicide me for bounty second it may encourage further carebearing rather than fighting your own battles youre just hiring an npc finally it acts as an isk sinkwhich i think we can all agree is necessarythoughts
i know there is already a ton of discussion on hybrid weapon balances and although i do not necessarily have many complaints about blasters i do think railguns and consequently rail boats need some lovin i also apologize if this has already been proposed i did run a light search and didnt find anything specific to the deimoswithout going into too much detail i think the 10 per hac level to falloff range is just ridiculous change it to something more appropriate for its roles a bonus to tracking speed like the megathron would be nice and would help it compete with the other hacs better blasterfit deimos dont need the extra falloff and sniperfit deimos get an additional 15km or so they can play with whoopdeedoo i would gladly trade 15km of falloff for the ability to actually hit something as a sniper and it would help blasterfits in close quarters to be able to hit targets in tight orbits like you should be able to do as a blasterboat it doesnt even have to be a straight across 10 bonus to tracking even scaled down to say 75 per level would be appropriate i thinkzealot  good overall sniper good dps good tracking good rangecerb  good dps once it gets there amazing range possibilities selectable damage type although kinetic has a bonusmuninn  alpha is amazing selectable damage typecurrent deimos  uh it does everything that the above do except the dps is crap and the target either has to be flying directly at you or be motionlessproposed deimos  it may not have the best dps or range possibly changed with railgun buffs but by golly it can hit just about anything except really fast ships reliablyideas thoughts
yes everyone knows the deimost needs looking at i like the proposed tracking boost its true to its the short range nature and sets it apart from the other hacs except maybe the muninn but then i still think it could additionally use a slight boost to survivability
even if blasters get fixed more tracking more damage the deimos still needs something to set it apart from the brutix and your idea does it i dont think its enough but its a good start
i like your idea i think ccp wanted deimos to be an excellent close range face melter just like its little brother thorax except much better this is why the current bonus to falloff range is pretty uselessi think tracking or dpsrate of fire bonus would make deimos a nicer hac and put it in line with the other hacs
edit this thread was initially titled abnormal neutrino field dispersion analyzer probes the original text now appears at the bottom in quotes the thread was initially anticloaking however i have renounced support of my own thread by reading the arguments provided to me by a previous thread on the subject in fact since i am a covertops pilot i am now in support of enhancing one aspect of covertop ships this proposal will aid in traveling through impassable gatescovertop ships improvement covertop cloaking device script will now appear an additional 75 kilometers from the center of the gate after jumping and reduces alignment time by 33 also allows you to use a gate within 75km but takes 4 seconds for the gate to transport you can be reduced with skills to 25 secondssecond script appear 45km from gate but reduces alignment time by 66 allows you to use a gate within 45km but takes 125 seconds to transport you can be reduced with skills to 75 secondsboth scripts will always place you at least 5km outside any bubble both will allow you to use any gate within 5km of any bubble this would obsolete mass bubbling
remove local
by the wayi put the ingame effects of my proposal so late in the text to repel the trolls with little attention span plus it draws you in
how would removing local increasedecrease the effectiveness of the scan either that or you replied to the wrong thread given theres a 3 in 4 chance of clicking on a removal local thread
dont fix what aint broken
given that this method wouldnt be truly effective until you hit the 2829 minute timer that 27 minutes should be more than enough time to collect all the information you need if that isnt enough time you suck and shouldnt be flying covert ops anyway everything needs a counter in this game the method i proposed is a weak counter
and that helps how much with sustained engagements like we see them in the north atmwhere covops basically have to monitor a system all day to give intel to the fc
if you read the full description if the covertop ship leaves the system and comes back the scanner is resetthus as long as you leave the system and come back every 2025 minutes this counter will not work although it provides the smallest chance of catching you at the gateits also a twoway road not only are your intel gathering abilities slightly hindered but so are the enemies everything needs a counter even if the counter is weak again this is a weak counterthis would carve a special place for intelligent covertops pilots as well maybe youd even get a salarypayout from your corp
rofl 2 things1 you know how badly bubbled those systems are up there2 every probable cloak is not a weak nerf it is a strong nerfif you had searched the forums a bit you would have found all the discussions about itjust to give you an example i have my cloak detection probes above the gate you jump into our 10 large bubbles try to cloak i hit scan and burn into your direction drone swarm around me decloaks you deadyou won eve
apparently you didnt read that the scan requires 3 minutes before it even takes effect you did however bring an important issue to date so ill state it herecloaking improvement ship is no longer revealed upon enemy ship coming close to youthis would require smartbomb usage to decloak you again this is only a nerf for the stupid pilots you are however showing the strong bias of being a covert ops pilot stop being so blind all nerfs appear equally damaging to certain people in all areas this one happens to affect youive also read my threads on this topic all of the past counters proposed so far are too powerful did i mention im a covert ops pilot
1month old covert ops pilot
i will give you credit for presenting your idea is a well worded proposal that shows you obviously spent at least some time thinking about the matterthe issue is that cloaking really isnt a problem and therefore doesnt require a solution no matter how well worded it might be
you do realise that the changes to the neutrino flux resulting from measuring these abnormalities will completely disrupt the neutrinobased communication systems that produce the local channel right
now since you flamed me politely ill address the local as wellget rid of local in nullsecallow sovereign systems owners to keep gate logs up to 12 hours recording what type of ship came through the gate and at what time if the ship is from a friendly let the pilots name be displayed in the log if a neutralenemy ship passed through the gate let the log simply show unidentified next to pilot namei love these removing local would create 10000 more problems than it removes arguments name those problems pleaselets pretend local never existed and ccp said hey guys were going to make a chat channel that instantly provides you with the info of who is in your system at all times there would have been outrage if you want info go collect it in the ship it is made for covert removing local would be a buff to covert pilots which i support by the way the first people to show outrage would have been covertop pilotson top of that i wouldnt mind a cat and mouse game to find covert ships except the smart mouse could never be caught even with the proposal i gave aboverisk vs rewardsun tzu said that information is the most valuable commodity thus the reward for collecting intel is very high thus the risk should at least be moderate to collect itin short both local and covertops without risk is for carebears oh you dont like to hear thatalso did you ever stop to think that a rotation of two to three covert op ships would be able to evade to this counter completelyfly safeo
i want to address this a second time in the reply above i said a rotation of two to three covertop ships would be enough to evade this proposal if you read the description it says scan is reset against enemy ship when it leaves the system perhaps you should have thought why i put that therewhat i need to see now is an identifiable problem with my proposal if you have a complaint articulate what the problem is not just i dont like it yeah of course covertop pilots dont like it
i chuckled
i love this idea i have no objections yet has a good story behind it too that immobilization effect might be too overpowered though maybe it should target jam the enemy ship instead
uhm  you clearly havent been in any larger fight in 00jumping inout with a covops is suicide  i think we would end up with covops alts being cycled with relogging exactly what you want
then lets add the following fix for both of thesecovertop ships improvement covertop cloaking device script will now appear an additional 75 kilometers from the center of the gate after jumping and reduces alignment time by 33 also allows you to use a gate within 75km but takes 4 seconds for the gate to transport you can be reduced with skills to 25 secondssecond script appear 45km from gate but reduces alignment time by 66 allows you to use a gate within 45km but takes 125 seconds to transport you can be reduced with skills to 75 secondsboth scripts will always place you at least 5km outside any bubble both will allow you to use any gate within 5km of any bubble this would severely reduce the effect of mass bubbling in fact it would make a single large bubble the most effective and efficientfor handling alt logging rotation make the scan become stronger on the location of the ship even if logged outi invite you you to keep poking problems in the idea though well keep making it better as a team ive been in plenty of large fights and it angers me that terriblecarebear pilots can be the most effective and instrumental pilots in the game because there is no risk
you do a pretty good job fixing the imbalances when theyre mentionedthe idea of cloaking device scripts covert ops only is superbthis thread has evolved to benefit covert ops pilots more than it harms themthumbs up
lets rewind and start the problem analysis over again you skipped to the solution assuming everyone agrees with your absent problem analysis you have to start with what the problem is if not the symptoms of the problem most people seem to disagree with you that a problem exists that needs a solution
starting from the probleminformation is 99 of the battle and you obtain it 100 riskfreethis proposal is a weak counter and as the guy said above me this proposal with the covert op scripts now makes it easier to enter and leave hostile system thus this proposal is now more advantageous to covert op pilotsgood day
as opposed to a t3 bubble ignoring ship or a 10 kms dramiel or sitting at a pos near a gate with a scanner or shuttle alts or local chat or or orif the problem is near riskfree information because cloaks are not riskfree there are a ton of different things that need to be changed
thank you for putting your foot in your mouth since you recognize that there are lots of riskfree activities you should start making some proposals to fix themand of the four people that responded two of them support two of them do not count me vote and its 32 in favor of the proposal so far
make it 42 supportsounds funedit forgot to support lol
risk mitigation is a major part of the game any game in fact that boasts unique play styles it is why people put tanks on their ships it is why warp stabs exist it is why eccm exists it is why most people fit mwds on their bs in fact it is a huge part of the reason why people like cynosbridgescap ships without risk mitigation of various kinds all ships and tactics would end up being pretty uniformwithout risk mitigation bigger is always better and more numbers will always win risk mitigation is integral to breaking up blob warfare to a certain degree and to the game in generalwhat damage is done by a cloaked ship that cant be countered alreadyas to the idea that 5 people responding in your thread is an accurate poll of the sentiments of the player population at large it is a fallacy assembly hall usually is not an accurate poll of the player population let alone a thread few people have bothered to respond in most people read the title of a thread asking for a nerf to cloaks and ignore it in hopes that it will drop off the first page and the poster will get the hint
the assembly hall is where changes come from read the description provided by ccpi know that most people read the title hence why i cloaked my titleas much as this game is about riskmitigation it is not about riskimmunity especially for gathering the most precious resourcecommodity which is informationthe next time i will not respond to you unless you point out a specific error in this proposal as it currently stands also youd notice that i made it easier for cloaked ships to enterleave systems with the lastest change to my proposal covert op scriptsstop running form thread to thread without giving significant input
cloaked ships are all but immune when they want to do anything harmful to you they are usually pretty weak tank wise and can be killed easily when the opponent is preparedsad fact is  most people in the game are not preparedbut i am not going to repeat all the discussions again the nerf cloaks topic comes up like every week your idea is neither new nor original eitherso instead of trying to nerf working game mechanics  try to think of a way to use current game mechanics to counter them there are plenty ways to handle cloaker then we wont need an even more complex mechanic and all your exceptions for covops make it more complex everytime you iterate over to adapt your proposal last but not least  as bagehi said  presenting a solution starts with discussing the issue and the implications but i guess you left that out as you would have been proven wrong pretty quicklyi suggest you start reading this thread it discussed many many possible nerfs to cloaks and why they would break cloaks to uselessness
not supported the pirate ships are enough balanced and lots of work was put down to balance themthe dramiel are one of my favourite frigates and it need quite some brains to know how to use it itUFFFDs made out of thin foil and dies pretty easy you need to know what to engage and what to avoid
i think your comment made him upset and pull back the proposal d
i think the dram is just fine the way it is 
wow again sir worst pilot in history
this just seems to make eve more twitchy you said you would rather have to keep relocking all your targets 5 times in ten seconds than the current ecm of just knowing your jammed personally i cant imagine more annoying game play than what you describeim assuming you would lose all your locks and not just the current one  or this module would really be useless if you intend to simply weaken ecm why disguise it behind this it seems that most people who are in favor of this just really dislike ecm but if you nerf ecm you ruin any chance that caldari can be effective in pvp other than the drake and merlin you know people dont train caldari cruiser 5 so that they can fly a mean moa or eagle so if your intent is to nerf ecm you should also start thinking about how you might buff caldari or nerf every other race in eve the races are decently balanced right now minmatar is the fotm though interestingly they generally are weakest agains ecm and the caldaris best thing to bring to the table is ecm
poor falconsrooks nothing quite like owning a 150m isk ship that is primary target has no tank has no insurance and everyone wants nerfed to uselessness
i am intrigued by this it would still make ecm effective it would level the ewar playing field it would not make the person with the jam on them feel left out of the fighti think it would have to be expanded to cover high slot modules in general neuts would not be effected nor would logisticss if it only weapons i see a major coding problem here on the flip side it would balance ecm much better then any other alternative i have seen so farnice one java
no i dont support your proposal i do agree with you that low sec does need some carenow what do you think a level 4 mission runner would do if this really did happen i will tell you right now that he would frown and think to himself damn im going to have to spend longer running missions todaythat is all you would accomplish i would like to continue on this theme and remind you that running level 4s in high sec is an income source for both low sec and high sec pvp if you increased the rewards for high sec mission runners you might actually help promote activity in low and null sec since many pvpers use their high sec income to fund their activities
nerfing or granting entitlements is a flawed approach you just spend most of your time fighting some fixed social belief system that drugs therapy or the witnessing of the economic collapse of an entitlement state they invented everything cannot cure fundamental problem is the attempt to try and change players social mind set that do not want to become any part of the social environment of eve they came to this game with some sort of assumption that being a sandbox type of game they can establish some solitary island and have no compunction of engaging in activities that is described on the box cool they created their own niche and make great pinatascreating opportunity for players is what promotes activity this draws the players who want to go into losec  null sec and take that risk what might be a solution for lo sec would to allow some sort of ownership this can be something they can build and fight for this will bring out the players who accept the game for what it is and entice them to carve out something for themselves and their mates tldrquit trying to change and goat the players that have no inclination of ever playing a game that will require some sort of effort and or risk improve lo sec  null sec for the population that will take that chance
your proposal wont bring mission runners to lowsec it will just make some of them rage and quit eve the other ones will just keep running missions even if they make slightly less moneyrisk averse people cant be fixedlowsec needs something unique profitable and attractiveread elise randolphs thread in crime  punishment for a list of great ideas
maybe you need to do a bit more thinking instead1 00 has been buffed in most of eve expansions and the percentage of people there has been constant for years 2 there are already great level 4 and all level 5 agents in low sec but running mission in a ship build to survive pirate attacks is so much slower that there is no interest in running missions there so long asa npc continue to attack only the mission runner leaving the pirate aloneb there are tons of npc so missions are longc scanning is easy and probes can used in a way that allow the prober to have the within directional scan range of the mission runners for only a few secondsrunning missions in low sec will be a stupid thing to doit is better to run missions in npc 003 lp reward in low sec are almost x2 the lp reward of high sec for an equivalent agent that is about a 2030 pay increase much more for fw your idea will not change much there4 the only reason why running missions in low sec will reduce mineral production is because very few people will be looting and salvaging them so to do a short version your idea will  off a few players but it will have no other effect not even getting someone to ragequit
well  thats a pretty decent assumption to make ie that all lvl 4 mission runners are antisocial  but when you consider that very many of them are alts of 00 or lowsec dwellers andor members of hisec corporations your assumption is patently falseas for effort some people play this as a game and arent really interested in too much effort in their gamepvpsovereignty warspiracy  those are the things that draw people now to lowsec  00 there are other draws but those imho are the main draws those activities have nothing in common with mission running and so have no appeal to those whose sole activity in eve is mission runningyou could move all lvl 4 missions to lowsec and you wont get a sudden surge of people to lowsec  all you will get is people setting up bcs to speed run lvl 3sccp is taking steps to reduce reprocessed mission goo read meta 0 items in an effort to buff miners utility so thats a nonissuetldrmissioners who dont do anything but mission wont go where the gameplay isnt attractive to them  pvp isnt attractive to the average risk averse missionerthumbs down again
if you want more activity in low sec make a way for anyone in high sec to join some organization that they can group up and clean out anyone with a neg security status with no security loss themselves like a zero tolerance on piracy initiative additionally it would be something you could join like a mission rather than having to leave your current corp that would allow some more activity in low sec especially if after so many kills the security of the system were to slowly raise or go down based upon which side of the equation had more kills or  of kills that weekmonth
this will not provide you with the piles of marauders and ravens to kill that you are probably hoping for low sec mission hubs would not exist in the way you are thinking what you would get is the 00 alliances would control lvl 4 low sec mission hubs and low sec pirates would be wtfpwned if they tried to mess with the alts that are grinding through missions to fuel warsit would create an even larger barrier for income potential between the little guys and the big alliances than already exists it would also move the blob warfare of 00 into low sec somehow i dont think you want to do thatlow sec needs a revision that boosts the current play style of low sec without nerfing other peoples play style benefits to having 10 for instance
nope i never eluded to lvl 4 mission runners nor did i call them antisocial you read into my post and came to your own conclusion i basically said that they just do not want to be involved with the current social events in eve and to do that would mean expending effort and they would rather just do whatever it is they do and keep to themselvesi am just pointing out that trying to coax these guys out of high sec is a waste of time but making losec appealing to the ones that would like a little more reason to venture out might be something to look at
truth
problemseve needs more isk sinks001 isk warring is inappropriate content removedapplebabe proposalwhen changing any market order you are taxed a sum equivalent to 5 of the new selling price reducible with skillsfor examplei am selling 10x mods at 10 000 001 isk each i change them to be sold at 10 000 000 each the total value of the new selling price is 1010000000 or 100 mil isk so i would be taxed 5 mil for making this change instead of 100 isk this would have the added benefit of making macro trading far less profitable
people would just put up orders of very small quantities so they can calcel and put them back instead of playing 001 games trade rewards thsoe that play so whats the issue theremacro traders are a plague but 001 wars cant be removed and dont need toalso why does eve need more isk sinks proof or stop posting 00 has one giant isk sink called sovereignty payments and before you pretend that moon minerals compensate for it no it doesn they dont add isk to the system just items isk comes from mission rewards bounties and insurance that one is being reduced in tyrannistldr001 wars cant be removed and dont need toproof or stop posting
they can and should
proof by assertion is a wonderful thing nestce pas we have no need for additional isk sinks and 001 wars are fineand i say that as someone who does a lot of trade ive also largely come to the conclusion that macro traders are a myth so no not supported
untruewell exactly you have the most to lose here no wonder you dislike this ideaproof by assertion is a wonderful thing nestce pas
lol also the people who get angry about someone undercutting them by 01 isk are usually the people who initiated the price war if you undercut the current sell prices but not by enough for others to worry about matching your price you shouldnt be mad when someone else undercuts your sell price
wowyoure dumb
umtaxes are bad
i think that this should be modified as to not allow anyone other than a fleet to be able to jump in on you while you are doing a mission at some point in the future you will have eve pilots with 8 or 9 years piloting experience camping mission complexes newer players entering these plexes wont stand a chance against pve much less the experience needed to handle pvp as well this discourages newer players from sticking around in eve being jumped enroute to the mission is one thing however being jumped on a difficult mission is simply put a huge let down
no
no arent they already bring more friends andor revise your tacticsoptionsim sorry welcome to eve nonconsensual pvp is our specialty were you expecting something differenttdlr not supported next
thats not evenot supported
no cant support your idea as it stands you have however shown us one of the risks for high sec mission runners
ive several times run into the situation of a new corpie asking for a loan but have not felt secure enough to give them that the loan contract currently allows to loan money but only accepts money as a collateral making the point kinda moot this could be dealt with by creating something that would allow the collateral to be items like with rl loans also the possibility to have interest on loaned money would be appreciated
loan contracts wont see a lot of use either way but at least this will make it possible for someone sane to use them in theory and it does make sense supported
that and make the ability to cosign to a corp alliance or other player p
not supported again ccp already considered and decided not to go with this idea for gatelinked systems
atm powerblocs like to cram as many insects in one hole this ofc makes the hole have lots of problemsthis usually affects 00 and low sec low sec being worse since it barely handles a fraction of what 00 cani propose the node to have a failsafeupon a node crash or extreme lag everything within that system will be immune to all damage all timers will pause meaning even if an enemy sits with 5000 people in a system they will just stop timersthis will cause people to think more strategically and will kill blob warfare for good
this idea is original zzazzt was talking about this  ff06
nopeid say take the gallente storyline missions and seed them with only l4 agents for all factions though
well you can put all level 4s in low sec if you want but noone will ever run them and since most people run level 4 missions from time to time i dont think the entire eve community would be very happy with that decision there are level 4  5 missions in low sec that do get use but there is still not enough benefit to warrant the majority of players to bother running missions in these areasif you want to help low sec then please come up with a constructive suggestion for doing so
no thanks
leave level 4s in high sec but change missions so that they are fun exciting and challenging rather than tedious utterly predictable dpsbased isk grinds make them about gameplay rather than goldfarmingput some new resource exclusively in losec so that there is a good reason to go there the black market suggestion in the boost losec thread was a good one
if you move all lvl4s to low sec all the carebears will farm lvl3s move those to low sec and theyll do lvl2s no amount of reward will change the carebears mind the absolute max single clienting income from missioning in high sec is under 50m an hour as is yes im contradicting you you dont make 80m an hour missioning there with 1 toon that would require you to solo blockade in under 30minutes and get it twice in a row alternatively you would need to solo unauthorized military presence about 20 times in an hour so yeah not happening im valuing lp at around 1k isklplow sec needs a pr boost not an actual rewards boost relative to high sec a few errandboy storylines that take you to low sec and only require a shuttle is whats needed i think
lies highsec missions single account bring in nowhere near that muchif you want to buff lowsec dont do it in a way that nerfs other peoples preferred playstyle its a sandbox its not your sandbox
op obviously knows nothing about 00 warfare or he would know that no fleet in their right mind would field even a single supercapital in a fleet battle without quite a few smaller ships to back it up
i think blast nicely illustrated that with their titan loss

in the uk volunteer work is considered employment by law and has its own set of legal rights not only is it commonplace for cvs to have volunteer work listed in your previous employment history it is also encouragedeva jobse is from the netherlands and they have their own legal description of what constitutes as employment
same in the netherlands volunteer work  unpaid employment by the company or organisation legally speaking however to add to the confusion for work to be considered volunteer work it does not require a contract of employment according to the dutch lawin the netherlands eva is thus perfectly entitled to list her volunteer work for ccp as part of her employment history while eva had to waive any claims to be a regular ccp employee because all regular employees are entitled to claim minium wages etc she was an unpaid ccp employee according to dutch definitions and law whenether ccp likes it or notthat and its perfectly normal and even encouraged in the netherlands to list all volunteer work as part of the employment history to avoid gaps in the cv although the employment history section is called werkervaring literally work experience on the dutch cv im sure that eva didnt feel like rearranging her cv when translating it
ah yes she clearly forgot to mention the fact that she was not a ccp employee boy howdy would it be convenient for me to just put whatever suits me on my resume and claim innocent oversights also who cares about dutch laws ccp is an icelandic company by that standard she was not an employee whether dutch law likes it or notnevermind the fact that never did she perform one iota of game design or wiki development on behalf of ccp the csm job is not even remotely resembling game design the wiki she made of her own free will was certainly not a work product for ccp in short your statements are as ridiculously far fetched as the idea that she ever worked for ccp in the first place im dutch therefore i get to claim anyplace i ever had any slight association with as work experience globally really not here
i think its clear to most people that this girl is unfit for anything inbox spam channel spams rude comments hate for large part of the playersshe makes isk spammers look good
the dutch revenue service might take exception to your explanationwat is een dienstbetrekkingregardless this was clearly padding of the cv as a employer i would applaud people keeping themselves busy and gaining experience by volunteeringtrying to pass it of as actually being employed by the company just means i will bin your cv especially if you are listing things you were not even involved in
waarop de werknemer tegen betaling werk verrichtthe thing youre quoting is for paid employment and like i said you dont need an employment contract for unpaid employmentand how did she not do those things she did build a wiki if not for her wiki then the evelopedia would never have those old csm issues in there as the whole thing is copied directly out of hers she set up the wiki she structured it so she did wikiimplementationyoure just a bunch of crybabies
no the thing i am quoting for is the definition of employmentno contract no pay means a fictive form of employment as far as the revenue service is concerned or none from a legal point of view
 ankhesentapemkah  industrial sabotage is too harsh of a word but you get the ideathis relevant to this thread
false logs i dont use the shot at the pie expression nor do i use the  smiley like that try harder when trying to slander
so this you deny but you dont dispute the logs where you are essentially taking the  out of someones autistic child brilliant
pity id vote for someone campainging for the  smiley
i just felt like sharing this153337 ankhesentapemkah  funny i spoke with a law student and slandering me on the forums is actually a violation of dutch law and punishable with a maximum of 6 months of jailtime153346 ankhesentapemkah  despite the forums not being dutch153446 ankhesentapemkah  lets see if i can sue some peopleserious business
people are slandering your ideas and giving opinions this is perfectly legal
i have personally seen her spit on a baby irl also she cheats on her taxes
well apart from the highly unlikely jail term being wrong under dutch law if you ever decide to try and get people to court you might be in for small problemsfirst step if you had any case would be to sue ccp to provide you with the users details then find out the acccused is from say peru and go from therethat offcourse is just the start and higly simplifiedjurisdiction in any case would be highly unclear due to differing geographical locationsif at all possible i would like the name of this lawstudent so that when and if he graduates i can be safe from ever retaining his servicesi might add that the guy whose handicapped son you seem to have insulted has a case however
someone rename this thread to internet space lawyer chat
i have looked at the products from your current employer now not to say they are horrible but they all seem rather lacking in almost all aspects what i mean is they all seem rather simple minded nothing very complex or compelling about them the entire reason people play eve is everything opposite of the games you work on judging by everything you have made from suggestions in the forums it sounds like you want to make eve more for the easy going and simple minded game play less entertaining and less compellingi for one shiver at the idea of the best mmo out there face it it is rage on the forums all you want it is turned into the equivalent of some flash game on facebook farmville in space that has no real meaning please stay and enjoy eve for being eve and not wishing it was one of the games you work onspeaking of that company i did not think of it until it was brought up but i am not sure you being involved in the csm and working for another online game company is a good idea conflict of interest comes to mind false logs or not it is just a bad ideaeveryone always jokes that eve is about internet spaceships and internet spaceships is serious business they say this jokingly but everyone know they are serious business the games you work on are not serious businesslike i said before feel free to play eve if you like but the csm council is not for you you did it before and it was shall we say less than stellar maybe one day you will realize that eve is supposed to be serious business and enjoy it like the rest of us after all no other game out there can be plagued with lag issues and still keep growing and growingin closing i really dont mean this in a mean way but you are simply not ready for csmtake caremarlona sky
removed trolling comment
real life has prevented me from reviewing the 3 focus groups conducted so far to write up a summary of the ideas and issues discussed in each i dont want to delay sharing the discussions any longer so mp3s thanks niraia of the raw audio are posted on evefiles thanks chribba links below note that some folks were limited to participation by chat chatlogs will help fill in the gaps and ill try to post links tonitebreathing life into low sec whats wrong with it now how can it be fixed whats the best approach and moreincluding a discussion about criminal production components that could be added to the game over several expansions all tying into a holistic whole raw audio hereecm balanceneeds more or not does ecm deserve its rep for being overpowered has it been too nerfed are other counters better than what we have should other ewar be examined in balance with ecm and more raw audio hereblobs canshould they be discouraged what is a blob are blobs a problem are they avoidable are they undesirable do we need new tools for remote detection of blogs and more raw audio herecailais presents an interesting idea based on a common sense expectation we discussed something similar in the blob issues focus group there was definitely interest in having the capability to for example show movement of large fleets on some kind of tracking view in the map the strategic impact of such a capability would be interestingfunny you mention thiswe brainstormed in the low sec focus group about turning low sec into a haven and sole source for production of criminal items like boosters and other exiting and new illegal or pirate items one of the most exciting things about such an idea is that there is something for all play styles to participate in somewhere in the supply chainfrom production through consumption tell me your ideas hakanta for revamping the drug system id love to discuss them with you and yes if an idea was proposed that made sense i would likely support it
mynxee certainly seems to know about all the issues in eve though i do not agree on a stacking penalty for fleets it is after all the so called eve endgame she seems to know all the mechanics well and have first hand experience in it i have full confidence she will be an excellent spokes person for the player community and will do her best to make sure this doesnt become a hello kitty online in space unlike ankeleeolfkoeonwneiweniew whatever her name is all my votes for her
mp3sbreathing life into low sec mp3ecm balance mp3blobs mp3
niraia  for the mp3 conversions bisba thank you for your support just to clarify im not pushing for fleet stacking penalties per se despite the slightly inaccurately worded campaign info that massively attributed to me i just think theyre wort
are you planning on releasing the chat logs  i had to switch to text only contributions part way through after i got some family aggro
yeah i will try to get to that tonitei hope i was logging chats i did turn logging on before the sessions started
well i have my logs for the lowsec session i was going to elaborate on my pirate software suggestion in a blog post when i get some spare time
this is a collaborative process so feel free to post a link to your log file and related blog posts you might write here sharing the info and ideas is more important than who links it and the pirate software idea was very cool

this very upcoming expansion no im not going to tell ccp to postpone their planetary stuff nor do i expect them to even take me seriously if i make that suggestionwhat i am trying to do is get ccp to devote more programmer time designer time etc to getting old features fixed in the long term for example almost every csm proposal submitted in the last two years about poses have been turned down to either technical issues or effort issues i think ccp should put serious effort and coding time etc to fixing these old bears that are commonly used by players and cause them so much greif if the csm could push ccp to do an entire miniexpension to release a better pos system that would be awesome and possibly something that could happen if the csm gets actual powerthe mission loot mineral nerf change is going to affect my lowsec proposal in that the details will eventually need to be changed around when the full effects of that change are feltalso the planetary interaction is going to affect my lowsec proposal i would try to get ccp to give lowsec some sort of exclusive planet resources for examplebut i dont know if that can be done in time due to scheduling well see
dear mazzilliu i very much enjoyed voting for you and the facebook page and youtube video were really helpful and informative i would just like to ask you some more questions for people who are as yet undecided1 if i am a member of a hostile alliance how can i know you will represent my interests and would you be willing to cooperate with elected csm members from those alliances2 it seems that there is a noticeable disparity between the number of female and male players on eve online how will you as a member of the csm work to improve the ratio of male to female players in eve3 if you become trapped in iceland due to volcanic eruptions how would you ideally spend the additional time4 if live events once again become part of eve online content what form would you suggest that content take and how would you ensure it is accessable to both casual and hardcore players given the current lag issuesthank you
thanks for going the extra mile it is greatly appreciated and needless to say i encourage everyone to tell their friendsnebula glad you enjoyed wizardry it was great fun to write did you or your dad ever discover the identify 9 exploit
got my vote or twoi hope you do win i have the same concerns with lag and poscorp management the ui certainly can use some improvement as well but it is much better then some of the other mmos of similar age
i like your style and i certainly hope you get a csm spot i wanted to thank you too for wizardry  first pc rpg game i played saw a character called gilgamesh in another game a while ago and brought back some memories
youre ideas are positive and you have listed many of the issues i have with eve at this point i hope you will look to actively boosting low sec which would be great since it would be fun to see low sec populated i do hope you would go about boosting low sec in such a way that it doesnt nerf high sec at all i would like to see better agents and more reward in low sec so high sec dwellers may be tempted to move out there this can be done in a way that doesnt take anything away from players who may be happy in high sec high sec players should be tempted to low sec and not pushed there
who did you get to write your initial post its littered with far too much correct spelling and punctuation
dont u think that its better to make lvl4s in highsec less profitable and just boost lowsec and 00 missions instead of removing it from highsec at all
this could work too there is obviously problem with current level 4 high security space missions solutions to this problem can vary but anything is fine as long as goal would be reached and goal is simple introduce risk vs reward concept to highsec missionrunners
once again thank you to all my supporters i think ive finally caught up on all the evemails just the one question to answer here thoughas part of csm4 i raised andor supported a number of wormhole related proposals refitting t3 ships in wspace shared corp bookmarks saving probe formationsas i dont live in a wormhole system i wont try to second guess what issues players find while living there however i will continue to support proposals raised by wspace residents and if you have any specific areas that you feel need to be looked at i would be happy to discuss various ideas
voting for you
cheersvoted for youye those are some of the core issues will get more of my guys to vote for you

thank you for your support
ok ill admit it im one of those idiots that has warp scrambled a gate by accident and had concord blow me to pieces its funny and not so funny at the same time keeping that in mind i am in the camp of removing insurance from ship destructions involving concordyes i realise this is a bit harsh for the people that dont read the warning messages but eve is supposed to be a harsh universe unfortunately i dont think removing insurance at the moment would be a good thing due to the abysmal ui that can allow newer players who dont know the ui well to make this mistake without knowing they are actually making a mistake once the ui is upgraded to the point where any ambiguity of whether your target is able to be shot or not is removed then it should come in imhoas for afkscript mining  it needs to be removed from the game how this should be achieved i have no definite insights into but making mining more interactive is one thing i have pushed for in the past unfortunately ccp in the past have seen this differently but since my job would be to push the player concerns to ccp im happy to give it another goanother thing i wouldnt mind seeing and it was briefly discussed in the industrysci forums was t3 modular industrial ships like the t3 cruisers they would have base stats that are then modified based on different subsystems you install  better mining yield heavier tank etci think that would help a little for defence as the attacker couldnt be sure of what you would be fitted out with and would have to be more cautious it would also allow for specialized mining setups for those wanting themi hope that answers your questions feel free to ask more and ill see what i can do to answer them 
seeing the informations that the eve economist gave in the old blog he has no real idea on the effect of t2 bpo he love to do pretty charts and avoid any real attempt to see what is the in game effect to be blunt i think he has not jet realized that eve is first a game not a economic simulator similarly seeing how the only official data on the loot reprocessing where heavily contaminated by t2 reprocessing ship reprocessing and mineral compression items i have some serious doubt about ccp capacity to know what is the real situation of the game if you can get them to release real informations cleared by dubious interpretations and spurious data it would be much appreciated and if they go and remove t2 bpo whatever form of compensation they decide to give i pretend to have a collector item for my bpos a gold framed name bpo to keep as a memento no in game use beside being sold as a collector item and maybe to be able to put it on a wall in my house in incarna but i have worked to get mine and want to have something to remember them

upfrom the campwebsitea true friend is one who has the courage to disagree with us when we are in the wrong and advise us for our own good rather than let his sympathy or sentimentality cause him to agree friendship is not friendship without trust without it i walk alone i prefer to concentrate on few topics instead of dealing with a lot of subjects thus increasing the chance of performing succesfully therefore i want to arise attention on the following issues general low sec revamp the 5th csm should focus on outlaw space militia and piracy reform lvl 4th missions in low aggression timer up to 1m30 sec align to bookmarks wormhole entering in wh space brings you 8000 km far from the wh exit jump range 2500 km rockets dps increase add implants on capsule killmails overload area is too small inactive poss should be removed make gang assist modules work when one or more squad commanders are not on grid self destruct under aggression should generate killmail user friendly killmail xml show items in containers when looking in assets show lens damage ships af revamp dramiel balance cost decrease power grid decrease to 34 velocity decrease worm balance speed up two launcher one turret power up to 36 deimos cost decreaseincrease the eos drone bandwidth
we all know that the ongoing capaign is having many potential candidates for counsils however there are some capable runners knowing what they are doing and some that donttheres also a guestion about theyr agendas and aimswhycome there is no candidate election machine within the eve online it would tell you which candidates best match your interrestshere is how it works candidade will submit a poll of interrests which you select from priority 05 5 beingh highest in each gategory gategories being from ranges of ideas such as game bug fixing economy trade mission developement lowbie protection low sector developement ambience developement background story low level pvp hi level pvp wormhole etch etch in each gategory you can submit max of certain points which depletes max appointable points  gategory thus you cant submit a poll query of 5 in each step you cant post all 5UFFFDs you can post several 0UFFFDs however as you dont support this side of developementnow a counsil candidate has submitted priorities and agenda he can have open statement about what he represents a bio for candidacy so to speaknow voter has ability to do the same submit a poll and see who of the candidates best match his agenda system compares the points given and shows candidates best matching your choise and you can select a bio for review after then you can select if you want to vote for him or send him a guestion about hisher campaignnow theres a way to better see who is best suited to represent your agenda
you could try the csm vote match website for this you can find more information on it here
vice decision for transfer to be honest i was not sure where this belonged to as it is developement topic yet its current event alsohowever site mentioned abowe does not fit the need of the request because it wont target the candidates for you and not all candidates use offsite pages also this is game issue whycome i should need to go to different site in order to find a person in the game for the gamealso this is not a big issue as there is php templates and ready made opensource systems for this during realtime elections theres always general sites that allows doing this questioneers where the politicians can submit theyr views so people can target them better usually from the press poll machines are there for a reason and i call for that reason please allow us players to find our candidate that we could truly vote upon
week 4 entries close tonight at midnight est
updated with the latest information i really appeciate people sending in corrections and links to new interviews etc please continue to do so
good work on them trying to cover everything but they focussed more on policies which tended to run into each other id have liked them to look at qualifications and other things that set candidate apart
nyphur i would like to point out that the idea of fleet stacking penalties was just thatan idea not something i necessarily plan to champion rather it is one of my goals if elected to focus on pvp balance related to blobs ecm and neutral remote repping wouldnt mind seeing your entry for me adjusted to reflect that more accurately the other goals are low sec improvements of an outlaw nature ui fixes especially related to streamlining cumbersome tasks and better communications from ccp to playersthat said you did a very nice job on presenting the candidatesnot an easy task to summarize all that im sure
 the whole point of this alt is that he is dedicated to csm keeping him free of my mains ingame reputation and keeping my main free of csm politics remarks mails etc check the website for my policies see the next item also you can follow me o

the greatness of eve stems from the greatness of its community the many many players who fly chat blog tweet joke on vent and generally create that sense of belonging eve is unique in that players are actively involved by the developer trough csm however as long as only a meagre percentage of players actually votes our collective voice is but a whisper after all if the council only really represents a fraction of us all what power does it havemy proposal to involve major alliance leaders qualitate qua in csm has a lot to do with this they by nature of their prominence in ingame politics represent a great many of us they are very involved with the playability of the game and can give indepth feedback on many issues from sovereignty mechanics to drop levels also they have a vested interest in these subjects and will strongly make their point with ccp leading an alliance is not easy and it would also reward the players who dedicate themselves to the game in this way it seems a very sensible and straightforward thing to implement this in the next iteration of csm the council now being elected csm5 should establish a ratio of alliance leaders to other csm members and a minimum alliance size for involvementindependent candidates such as myself are also important to make sure the csm does not become the domain of fleet battle planning sovereignty hoarding powergamers we need your votes who you vote for is ultimately less important than that you vote every player adds to our credence and influence with ccp and with each other every vote counts we must not whisper but roarvote be heard i call on all of you vox populi vox dei vote macclone jump for csm
eves upcoming expansion is causing a stir mainly for the new features expected in this release the game is expanded with more gameplay and more interactivity trough the client and website and this is in many ways a great improvement of evehowever there is still quite a big difference between the superscifi interface shown in promotional movies like the new tyrannis trailer and the infamous spreadsheetsinspace approach of the client interface one of my main goals as a csm candidate is to influence ccp to improve the game in more subtle ways in each release a big step in the right direction would be upgrading the user interface into the sleek and sexy interactive treat presented in the promo videos this would make the game more engaging playable and immersive without dramatic changes like revolutionizing the industrial and territorial aspects of the game as tyrannis doesfixes and features should be inseparable and complementary parts of new releases ccp hats off to you guys for your almighty work on tyrannis however as long as youre going to ask for our opinion id like to point out that there is a lot of room for improvement that doesnt involve altering the nature of the universe and our relation to it dont nerf space into a small sphere around stars space is huge open and empty by definition let us go there and hide our ships in the folds of darkness between stars as we mean to pour your efforts and enthusiasm into giving us a user interface that reminds us of minority report instead of the accountant it would be appreciated every second we playi would be gravely misrepresenting my fellow players of i did not also address lag in this context although the ramsan upgrades the anticipating of announced fleetfights and all the improvements tested on sisi are all meant to improve this problem for many it feels like ccp is not doing enough fleet fights still turn into slideshows destroying the fun and excitement and leaving players frustrated and annoyed as long as this is not adressed more fully any expansion is going to feel like a dud to many of useveryone realizes that tranquility pushes the limits of what is technologically possible every day wed rather pay for more hardware to make the game run smooth than for more developers to crank out releases like tyrannis hear us we love the game first the extras second make the game run well then well see how we can expand itthe whole point of the csm is that expansiona are not a takeitorleaveit proposition but something that developers and players synergistically improve to their mutual benefit lets make it happen vote macclone
if you mean personal ability well my rl history speaks for itself there is no issue with the groundwork it gets done my only concern is whether i will be able to take that groundwork and effect enough compromise within the csm and between the csm and ccp and that i really wont know until and unless i am on csm5 to trythere are enough candidates who were on prior councils and who can run again due to changes in the termlimits rule that i have my doubts as to the possibility of getting on the council i think the termlimits change was a bad idea it has high potential for making the csm a clique with largely the same people returning council after council if elected i intend to suggest some modifications such as limiting members to 2 consecutive terms and requiring a 2year break before such candidates could run again this would allow for more turnover in the csm without forever forbidding seated members from being on the council againmy advertising readsvote wiselygreymouse for csm5

the current cyno effect is so lame so weak the old one gave such an awesome feel for the immense power needed to distort spacereally want it back
hell yeh
you are horribly wrong blaster tracking sucks it needs to double to make them effective it is embarrassing because when you get to your optimal you cannot hit anything due to trasversal so you have to operate in faloff which reduces your damage because thats not whats suppose to happen rightand what about those 99 of the cases when you are not sitting with no motion at 0 at the gate and wait to get tackledagain wrongget out of 1x faloff and the damage becomes paint scratching because damage decreases exponentially with range
i still think its a halfassed solutionminmatar always had the fast rusty primitive looknfeel maybe niche is not the correct word i would call it a major feature pall solutions i see are always in the same line of though but with different attributes replace speed with damage or range or tracking and in the end you just have give it 50 more of x and everything will be ok maybe the solution will be more in the ac line of though a bit more here a bit more there i mean a full weapon system redesign that doesnt change the basic principals of blasters  it must hurt up closemaybe the definition of close range must be increased just like the range of falloff was a few time ago give it a bit more range tracking damage and even a bit of speed in some ships if you still have toim not the exceleve expert guy to do nice graphs to show how much should be given to each weaponship to make it work and a full redesign calibration really looks like a very difficult task but they did it to acs didnt theyplease make it work without giving major features to other races otherwise in 1 year gallent will be speed amarr shield tanking caldari drones and minmatar target painters  just exaggerating a bit p
the latter of course the reason people dont fly shield fit gallente more is that they suck and dont know how to play in fact if gallente could fit neutrons without lol rcus and if they didnt have ships which are sometimes ed stat wise eg brutix uses that so potentially useful utility high over cyclone to get a awesome 10m3 more dronebay seriously now they would in shield fits be passable if they got a dps boost on top theyd be more then passablethe only gallente t1 ships which you can fit reasonably with neutrons is the shield myrmidon and the megathron the rest of them require glasscannon fits or rcus which made sense in the age when the neutron blaster was the top dog but laser dps got boosted since that day ac dps got boosted torp dps got boosted these fitting stats are completely unjustified in this day and ageby the way when you look at those sad dpsehp stats dont you feel horrible about the fact that a equivalent minmatar ship has very good odds of bbqing you point blank or that the vexor will just  the thorax at any range most likely a moa and arbitrator too haha that is highly indicative of the fitting and to some extent dps issues im talking abouti do a lot of upclose murdering and i have never considered flying gallente for that because they simply do not offer a tangible advantage in the zone where theyre supposed to be superioralso devils advocate subbs blasterboats would be 11ty billion times better with more mids for shieldtank fits since shieldtank takes a lot of the blaster woes away and naturally removal of stupid active rep bonuses which prevent you from fitting damage mods and decent guns if you take advantage of the bonus no seriously most medium sized blaster boats are better with shield buffer as things are case in point brutix people just insist on doing the wrong things but thats not a ship problem you still have people who fit purger rigs and sprs to drakes and take them out to pvp granted fairly rare these days and complain how caldari suck people are just not comprehending how scrambler only for tackle works just fine youre doing it wrong that is not a turret problemalthough you are correct that a damage increase is not honestly a range increase because at 1x falloff the dps is negligible
rofl talk about being a total noob with blastersyou know there is something called to move around while you fight to lower your transersal rightif you just sits there and just shoot you deserve to die in a big ass fire to stupidityand if you double the blaster tracking then what is the point with the web nerf earlier
this why fly a blaster boat if you can fly an ac or pulse boat if there isnt an answer it doesnt have a nichethe brutix is a fine example of eitheror bonuses almost like the classic splitweapon minmatar ships potentially this would be different if active tanking was more onpar with bufferpassive tanks without work on active armor tanks gallente ships would be better off without the rep bonusesi am guilty of shieldspeedblasters on gallente ships in most cases it is simply a better fit for the role they are supposed to fill however the comparable amarrminmatar ships do it better because you dont waste bonuses
i agree that ungrouping your guns would essential create more chances to penetrate however would this also not mean that your volley damage is so low that any penetrating hits would be of next to no noticeable damage also using two rail ships vs one target so what they should winand on the subject of passive shield tankers being the most vulnerable would this be a bad thing
i never knew that there were caldari and gallente rails here i was just thinking that you put the same weapons on each ship
yeah but hold your horses now you pick the rokh which happens to be the only battleship in its tier that is geared towards fleet sniping then you compare it to the apoc which is a much more versatile ship and one tier lower from there you conclude that the rokh fairs well in that comparison when looking at the pure ehp and dps aspect of sniper works and then since the rokh seem fine with railguns you pretend that you thereby have demonstrated that railguns are fine
kindathen he tries to blob usgoon way with his many postsdays repeating this again and againhe doesnt mind he was proven wrong already
i like his logic in in that one ship using rails is fine therefore all ships using rails are fine
the rokh is a great killmail  high rof good buffer so it isnt primaried often and extreme range to hit almost anything it doesnt contribute to a fight like other snipers but if you want to be on as many killmails as possible this is your bs if you dont want to be loathed by everyone else in the fleet because you are flying a selfish ship that doesnt pull its weight you might want to fly something elsegallente snipers on the other hand are just a pile of weakerthan weak range weak tank weak speed and weak damage
no the logic is some ships using rails are fine therefore the problems are not with railguns but with the ships that are not fine
i do not know why but rails on rokh ferox harpy vulture moa merlin eagle shoot significantly farther then rails on gallente ships i did not discovered where is secret but it is so
it seems like the important question is whether theres more ships theyre broken on than not and the answer to that is a resounding yes rails are the problems and any ship which is deemed problematic after the rail fix can be tweaked imo as long as they are reasonable with the hybrid fix there wont be any ship tweaks requiredliang
right rails on rokh is fine all gallente ships are not fine with railsccp do not want to think about finetuning blasters and gallente rails so there is simple idea change damage bonus for gallente ships from 5 to 75 it is simple microboost for gallente rails and blasters
blasters arent ok on the rokh nor on the mega or hype rails arent sufficiently awesome on the rokh and they outright suck on pretty much everything else the problem here is hybrids as a whole trying to balance the ships around this individually is follyliang
my enlighted master asked me to approve this threadsince in the modern world slaves can vote as well wtf im abusing this and voting
this idea is among the stupidest nontroll proposals ive ever seen on the assembly hall you think that the sleipnir one of the scariest ships in eve needs a massive buff youre crazy
totally agree with the op except that being able to refit in bare space would be silly but inside a pos definitely

i support this whole heartedly

pretty nice idea
agreedhowever i think they should just get rid of the password all together and it be dependant on the owning corps standing including allience inheretancein this case the options would beallow corp by default1 allow allince2 allow standing textboxalso allow put access but not see or take of the fuel bay to anyone
any account security feature not applied to every account is not a feature i will endorsea low cost alternative could be simply a card mailed to each player with a few hundred unique one time use codes which must be used in order client would state which one was used last or some such also a feature like this would facilitate secure account sharing thus i am reluctant to endorse it for that reason as well
i know im going to get flamed to hell and back for this but here i gono no nowhythe majority of people who get there accounts hacked is because1 they have no concept of what a strong password is2 visiting gold selling wares and hack sites3 downloading random stuff on the internet ie hacks cracks any tiny piece of software they can find to cheat with4 not having adequate anti virus malware and spyware software on their machine people point to wow you just have to look at player base of wow mostly made up of stupid little kids who are always looking for ways cheat the system so they visit every gold selling sites they can downloading every hack they can no surprise that they get their account hackedif you use a strong password which you change on a regular basis use an up to date anti virus malware and spyware software dont submit your login details on any website and do not download software from wares sites then you will not get your account hackedwhy should i have to pay for other people reckless actionsits all well and good to say if you dont want it dont pay for it but there is still a cost both in manpower and financial to be incurred to setup the systemso we at some point we all have to payjust think about itif you do not visit any wareshackgold selling sites if you do not give out your login details if you do not download software from anywhere other then a valid and repeatable source if you keep all your anti virusmalwarespyware software up to date if you use a strong password and change it on a regular basis then how is your account going to get hackedhackers do not specifically target people they simply hide their trojansviruseswormskey loggers etc in software and wait for idiots to download ittrust me i know
yes because good and reliable sites never get hacked updated antivirus always offer 100 protection and santa lives in the north pole all your security measures are valid and should be followed but another security layer will never hurtsupported
i dont remember where this was said but a dev pointed out that many accounts are hacked without password fails likely because people use the same username and password on websites as they use for their accountadditionally one of those keychain devices is easier to break en mass especially if a hacker can buy one than the current method of using strong passwords if someone figured out the algorithm and this happens especially when a hacker can buy a copy that would likely be the end of eve so unless normal passwords were required as well as the keys for those who want the keys not supported because these would likely only provide a false sense of security
in regards to authentication fobs such as the rsa secure id fobs these have been hack before however instead of only a few accounts being hacked its was 1000salso as a previous posted stated the majority of accounts have not had they password hacked this would mean they have either given there password to somebody or they have a key logger installed on their machineif you visit other mmos it is always the storythe passwords have not been hacked user just login to find that their characters have been stripped bare
ive been following this topic since last september
this is one of many proposalsissues which have had strong support on the forums and in csm then nothing it would be nice to have all the existing in process issues updated
im up for any buffs on all the nonthrasher destroyersedit thumbs up
supporting my own thread
1 when you have want to buy or want a gift contract with a pile of items like fuel or ammo you cant complete it even if you have this required items in your hangar you have to split the pile and make the smaller one with the exact number the contract require i guess you can consider this as an extra antiscam option but we need an option to turn this feature off imagine that you need to give a fuel for the 300 capitals in your alliance and you will get the scope of this problem txs for klemenzo  krechmer for pointing that out2 right now there is no sort by contracts option in contract system only sort by page option and if you have more than one page its pretty hard to sort things out and find the best offer there 3 lots of my friends asked for the sort by distance option to find the closest contracts they can get 4 multiple items search option for example i need to monitor the faction small energy neutralizers but we have 4 identical items imperial navy ammatar navy true sansha and dark blood small energy neutralizers i have to search them 1 by 1 every time i want to check the cheapest oneend
i just took a look at the tyrannis patch notes while they are certainly not finalized for another week i dont see that theres anything in there about alliance logos can we please get a ccp comment on this
supported
when was the last time you saw an alliance logo added to the gamehow many times have they posted that theres a new system for adding alliance logos to the game since thenbasically despite there being several updates to the alliance logo submission system there hasnt been an alliance logo added to the game in about two years if we dont ride them about this itll never happen
see all the alliances without logos that have been around for 12 yearsmy fingers are crossed that this will be rectified with tyrannis but there hasnt been any feedback on this topic so heres to hoping
what a joke tbhccp are the most procrastinating company ive ever seensupported
dotlan is actually a poor example of what alliances do and dont have logos in we contacted the dotlan admin directly and asked him to include our logo on the site but our logo is still not in the game
lol cajone seeds xdhells no to lvl5s in high sec  they should remove the ones that are there already
actually this isnt a bad idea level 5 missions are more difficult than level 4s and one of the factors for determining mission rewards is the security status of the system the agent is based in if the high sec level 5s reward was kept in line with the security status of the system it would work out fine the missions would need to be such that one battleship couldnt tank the mission of course so team work would be the keyim still surprised that ccp placed level 5s in low sec in the first place did they expect anyone to run themnothing wrong with the idea at all
not supported different zones have their exclusive content level 5s and fw are low sec only content and it should stay that way also lvl5s are boring and repetitive just like all other missionsa challenge demands risk of failure by definition in eve that means your ship explodes how many ships do you think youll lose in lvl5s once youve got them all memorized how often will you lose one cause its still challenging i think you want a new isk faucet to grind not a challenge
they are not an isk faucet please stay away from them
very few ships can solo lvl 5s and usually encourages a group so it adding more wouldnt be too bad
the only issue i see with this is blasters why not just add 30km to their optimal
i am getting increasingly frustrated with ccps stance to the pos code as i understand it the long term plan is to replace them entirely but so far i have seen no plans of what will be replacing them nor any word about when either redo the code ground up or scrap pos entirely
does this translate to ewar modules as well in that they calculate their range from the tower and not their own positionif so definitely supporting that this needs changed
shame people make new threads on this will never get looked at this way
yes
more shiny please
yes
they should be a way we can paint our own ships and add logos it could turn out to be a mild to major profession toohave it so we obtain minerals from planets for example and with the aid of skills  facilities produce ink  paint d where we can paint ships or for the sake of ego stations  structures
i forgot when my cruiser 5 ended and lost about 6 hours anyway on the topic of the op 24 hours is plenty it lets you log in when you want during the day check your skills or  what i normally do  just leave eve hq running and check it occasionally to see when the skill is going to end if i dont feel like logging in
give them a finger
ive never had to wake up early to put in an eve skill ever so you must be doing something really wrong as soon as you see your current skill queue  24h you quickly add a next skill to tide you over for the night or you do the old switcheroo like if your current skill still takes 23 hours and you want to train say fuel conservation afterwards you put fc 1 2 and 3 first about 6 hours or so iirc and move your current skill to the end of the line that way your queue will be good for more than another day againso not supported
you made a slight typo in your proposal you typed 48 when you clearly meant to type why do i have to train my skills on ccps schedule anyways it should be unlimited ive said for years now i want to be able to create an alt sub him for a year leave him in a hangar full of books and come back to a titan alt skills are too fundamental for us to have to  around with them supporting this that said its not going to happen adapt put a long skill into the queue  if your current skill runs longer than a day switch what skill you train
why not 9 months
thanks for the replies like i said this is mainly for people who do not have access to their machine everyday hence they end up losing days if not weeks during the year of training time simply because they have no accessmaybe the ability to access your training queue via eve gate could be a possibilitythis way you could leave the 24 hours time frame alone as you could access your training queue when ever and where ever you areafter all are giving us the ability to access eve mail and and edit our bio with eve gate as well as the ability to see our character profiles and skillsnot too sure where the comments about having to wake up came from but hey once again thanks for the replies 
sounds reasonable to me
i support this i want to love my electronic attack frigates but im having a hard time doing it right now
no wed know it was you even if you typed like an ordinary human
holy crap i cannot even believe the idiocy my eyes are seeing currentlywell heres my 02this happened to me back when i was a highsec loving carebear knew nothing of fittings and thought that my ship class meant everythingexhibit a
dude how did that work lol
nobody needs to actually argue with tj ever again no matter what its about or what stance he takes he could be saying the sun is hot and you could counter with you lost a dramiel to a badger and he would automatically lose the argument
this
just as i train up for what i was led to believe was a decent ship ccp then pull this crap on me now ive got to train for a badger wtf ccp protip if you have to protip people its probably best to wait until youve killed them
this
id suggest that this guy be banned from posting any more proposals or anything at all but the lulz are just too great
i suggested that on 2nd or 3rd proposal of his it was clear from the start that his thinking ability was impairedhowever i dont think ccp would dare discriminate against mentally handicapped especially since they employ several such people in key positions of game design
fyp
i think your an idiot most mission income is from bounties
not that i agree with the proposal but i do think he is talking about bounties on players in witch case you are the idiot
then if only npcs can collect bounties it is also ed think about it for a min bounty hunting should be a profession the problem now is its hard to and when someone gets a high bounty they just kill themselves
durrrrrrrrrrr youre the idiot see i bolded the proper usage of the word if you read the post youd see i was referring only to bounties that players placed on another playermore over bounty hunting as a profession doesnt even exist right now its merely a trophy to show how arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr you are thus this would allow players to use the bounty mechanism for one reason under this system players could pay to annoy players they otherwise wouldnt have the means to kill themselvesnote the distinction between annoy and kill if i want to kill someone right now i come at them with bcbswhatevs if i didnt want to take the timeeffortrisk to do so i could simply throw some isk to make their life a bit more annoying by paying for targeted npc spawnsthe problem with bounties at all is that ccp has made it clear theyre ok with people running multiple accounts at the same time understandably for fiscal reasons as a result theres no way to implement a punishmentreward schema that wont be exploited by multiaccount alts corpmates what have you thus bounties should be somewhat useful by allowing people to harass others for a priceread before you post
theoretically he wouldnt can flip u in low sec period anyway lemme get this straighture gonna help those newbs by implementing a mechanic that can be used to place a bounty on them so npcs can harass and kill them nonstop just so u dont face the consequences for afk griefing newbies another fail proposal for more easy high sec ganks with no suicidingsec loss required not supported
are you also opposed to merc corps jesus its just a way to add some spice to travel by having npcs spawnattack not in beltsplexes
thought i might post this while pushing a fenrir through empirea few things that have been ingame for years now and probably annoyed everyone that has flown capitals at some point not gamebreaker mind you but wouldnt it be nice ifccp would finalize their efforts to stop bumpinga titans jumpbridge range would be increased to 10km or even furthernot everyone in the same fleet as the capital would have access to its shiphangar even without configuration maybe even have different layers similar to corphangarsthere was the option to sort every dronetype into its own category with the click of a buttondrones and fighterbomber would not appear inside shields if launched close to the pos shield and fly around it instead of straight through resulting in the drones losing lock and turning aroundan toggled dronecategory in space when recalled would automaticly collapse in hangarship or atleast if there would be the option for thatctrlleftmouseclick would lock a broadcaster from the broadcast window like it does from the watchlistthe ingame capital navigation window would become its own button maybe next to cargo and above show tactical overlaythe cynobroadcast would show the location of the cynowe could get the old jumpeffect back or a new shinier one  a plop doesnt carry the time and effort put into these ships very well
i think the biggest flaw of capitals is their unbridled use on the forumspeople of earth posting in capital letters will not hammer the idea home more it will make people hate you
the diemos lacks identity and even more criminally for a hac specialisationthe cruiser blaster area is pretty crowded thorax brutix vigilant proteus moa eagle ferox the diemos is slotted as thorax  diemos  brutix with the vigilant being everything the diemos wanted to be but isnt id tweak the diemos role to something unique a true knife fighter in eve terms high speed  low siggydps isnt really a major issue  760 odd is good for a hac and anyway blaster dps is a multiship issue that might be fixed soon idpendant of the hullslotschange to 546wtf is the point of that last high we want specialised face melting dps boatattributesincrease speed to 300 after skills 40 ish  2kms on mwd a vaga is still 25 fasterreduce siggy to 80 20 cpu for the extra mid 50 grid as its 2 low anywaybonusmwd  75 trackingfalloff  75 recieved rrso why would you take a diemos now  gets in range fast has the tackle to keep a target in range minimises damage with a low siggy and speed while still hitting well with the tracking bonus stays alive through boosted rr and hac resistancesnot at all a solo pwn boat but more then enough differences to a brutix to fly one and worth the extra 100 mil if you use it in its own specialised way
methinks youve gone a bit overboard there loli say double the hac damage bonus and replace falloff with a mwd cap or sig bonus or summin
it already has a cap bonus to mwds with the gall cruiser skill
the diemost suffers from having to fight up close where hacs typically go to die this is where the name comes from it also suffers from being a lolarmortank combined with shortrange blasters read sloooooow dooooown the shield brutix is almost always a better choicetherefore 1 gun 2 mid 2 low damagedamagefalloff10 shield hp bonus awesomeness ensues in 321

still doesnt make up for the turret loss tbh 512512578125 41575 i dont think the ship needs a dps decrease
it is not a nice idea it is a result of a mind numbing 25 pages diemos thread on shc and took multiple days to do all the numbers and tweak itit is also not only a in your face hac concept but a extreme flexible medium range support rail hac with the ehp of a bc plus puls zealot dps performancewith damage drones i got the hac damage bonus at 15 per level first but i think it would outdo true sniper hacs in this style in general it is only a small dps exchange for a lot more flexibility at any range ehp fixed fittingboth cpu and powergrid and being useful in a 2 role that doesnt require dying this much
as already said the deimos is competing with many ships in its role the brutix does the same the deimos does same dps and same ehpwhat the deimos should have going for it and alrdy does is speedagilitylocktimesigradiusall of thosnough tho for starters the deimos has a sig radius of 160m the zealot for comparison 125m a better agility would help too for maneuvering under hostile guns and lockspeed increase
how i would do itswap hybrid falloff bonus for 1km of hybrid optimal per level applied after ammo modifications and whatnotthat means that the deimos can operate just outside of scram range with null and neutrons getting a 10km optimal or can avoid the tracking issues of normal blasters by being able to operate a little further outit also gives it a definite niche over the brutix and doesnt infringe on the vagabond or zealot as they both still outrange it by substantial amounts and have other advantages

someone brought up a good point in that thread cloak is the counter to probes with that idea in mind cloaking is fine in fact i think it needs a boosti am officially renouncing my support of my own thread
100 riskfree your ship abandons close to all of its offensive capabilities in favor of fitting a single module that would allow you to cloak up and oversee the battlefield god forbid you actually get caught
a look at the killboards of the alliances in the sc and nc will immediately show how risk free covops piloting ishint it isnt
are you aware that this is an entirely different topic now
you are quite amusing  you bring up an argument eg cloak is riskimmune he proves that the assumption is wrong you but this is not the topic but keep destroying your own arguments 
it sounds like you want a t3 ship nowi assume this will be available on the t3 frigates as well when they come out
i know its sad
when he first started posting nonsense in assembly hall i suggested he should be banned from this section of the forumbut i wouldnt be surprised if some of the key ccp game designers were just as messed up in the head as this guy after all they did make the great nano nerf
ibtledit  i support locking this thread

as per humar normal error they take the worst case scenario as the only outcome as is right now even if a falcon only has a 5 chance of jamming you it can in theory jam you for 15 min straight it can also miss ever single jam between two downtimes if it has a 95 chance of jamming you this is the nature of being percentage based taken to its extremes the more natural way things tend to happen is to be a rough 3070  positive outcome scenario for the person casting it even if the chances are very low for an ecm boat to jam someone they will more often than not in fact jam them what the simple proposal put forth does in practical terms is reducing the duration of wich you are under negative effect the problem with ecm is that its nowhere near the described balance between races as is all races are indeed very evenly based but only one ill say it again only one module will render any ship in the game completely useless for the duration of wich its in effect thats the ecmto further explain why ill toss you a few scenarios and examples lets say im in a drake i encounter a gang that consists of two vagabonds one rapier and one falconrook doesnt really matter now in my drake i can quite happily engage the gang if it wasnt for the ecm id probably end up dead but assuming i could get tackle on one of the vagas or the rapier id at least take one ship down with me but here is the most likely outcomei engage assuming i have no other option as ill be tackled before i can warp off anyway being a bc if i landjump in next to them and i get tackle on a vaga scramweb i now say to myself haha diaf motherfrakker now a falcon uncloaks and then im more like  why firstly he messes with my targeting in such a way i cant do anything anymore my tackle is gone my mobility is gone rapier and my damage is gone drones are still firing obv now assuming i have fofs with me i can load them thats 10 sec gone so 10 sec left on jam cycle ok so i start launching fofs god damit theyre just shooting the drones what good is that supposed to do ah yes they started shooting the silly vaga instead awesome so then the falcon lose jam on me and i can lock again i want to shoot the same vaga as i did first cause i got him to 50 shields so i lock him up and tackle him hes a stupid vaga pilot but now i cant direct my damage on him as i have fofs loaded wth ok reload frakk im jammed poop out comes my podthats one scenario for any other ewar than the ecm module there are at least three ways of countering any effect they have on you damps have senor booster and signal amplifiers aswell as gang bonuses when in a gang to both targeting range and scan resolution aswell as rigs and remote sensor boosters if you talk methods of negating it by gameplay it could be but not limitied to webbing your target to make sure it cant get outside your lock range making sure youre faster than your target to make sure you keep the range go outside the damps relativly short range and hope for misses in falloff and lastly just nuke the frakker tracking disruptors have tracking computers tracking enhancers rigs drugs and tracking links and in some cases tracking bonused ammo as far as trackign disruptors go and negating with playstyle you have webs to minimize transversal you can manually manouver your ship to minimize transversal you can shoot a bigger target if one is available you can move your drones from target to target and so onecm has two and thats it remote and local eccm
frakking 5 min timer on forums wththis is excluding implants but even there the implants that affects your ships sensor strength are in slots that would benefit you more with other implants there is in fact entire sets for sensor strenght while the others only have hardwirings but its more costly and harder to getall in all ecm stands out as the single ewar module that is too unbalanced compared to the others in the game the main difference and herein lies the issue it affects everything every time when jammed you lose the ability to control your drones appropriately you lose the ability to hold someone down you lose the ability to use your guns you lose the ability to use your missiles not exactly but make it really hard to shoot what you want you lose the ability to activly defend yourself in short all of this can in one way or the other be done when under the effect of any of the other ewar modules in the game this is why it needs to be reworked is what i have suggested perfect no not by any means is it better than what is currently in the game in my honest opinion yes in practical use who knows maybe maybe nota short note btw to people saying the caldari recons have no tank they have exactly the same tank as any other recon or youre fitting it wrong just sayin not that i mind makes them easier to pop so please do keep on fitting them without any tank at all regarding losing the lock of all targets yes it should basicly if you read what i have said is to make it work exactly how the ecm burst operates right now but instead of being aoe area of effect it should be focused one module one target one lock breaks the part where i said stuff about losing not all locks was a part where iwesome were theorycrafting about how the eccm could work basicly act like a buffer for the locking computer enabling you to keep lock on asome random selected locked targets but the ecm ship would always be free youll always lose lock on italso nerfing ecm or chaning it more like not exacly a huge nerf will not render caldari useless in pvp the drake is an awesome boat the flycatcher is being used to great success by us as a nice tackler more like bubbler but you get the picture i hope the hawk and harpy are both good shield based ass the ktisune is anoyign as  to encounter the basilisk is a superb logistic the scorpion is never wrong the raptor is a good tackler the nighhawk is a superb cs for gangs the cerb is very nice in hac gangs the eagle is an alright sniper and so goes the list the main thing about caldari is if you want to fly it youd need more caldari pilots caldari is much more specialized in one aspect of the game being i want to fly with caldari ships on my side all the other races have ships that does better in dual roles but a pure caldari fleet is actually a sight to be afraid of and to those that laugh at the sound of that youve never actually seen what a caldari fleet can do so in short caldari doesnt need to be nerferd as much as put in line with the rest as far as ewar goes missiles are getting better fix my rockets ccp for each time they actually improve their missile coding their tanks are outdone by none when in a proper manner and fleet and they do in fact have the best ewar platforms the lat fact wouldnt change even if the ecm changed as nothing can really mess with a fleet as much as losing lock be it for 1 second or 20 its still the most effective way you can disrupt a hostile fleet as is however you can disrupt it a bit too much compared to what the others do and no jamming is not the only thing caldari does its just the only thing most people see as noone is willing or able to field a proper caldari fleet for those who can i suggest you do and laugh at the carnage that can be created when done right

my understanding of some of the reasoning behind the way the market works is this1 there need to be mechanisms to stop people trying to gouge a market then immediately lower prices when competition arrives2 selling on the market is largely an afk activity so something needs to reward the active market player3 the market is an ideal place to include isk sinks to counterbalance isk sourcesfor point 1 broker fees stop people pricing things way too high by charging based on the total sell price if you significantly lower your orders you have still paid a high amount in fees cutting into profitregarding point 2 the active player who logs on and keeps orders up to date and actually spends time in a region is able to undercut competition by 001 isk without this mechanism an individual could place orders all over the place and never have to actually maintain them it also means that the often large amounts of money that can be made on the market come at the price of having to maintain market dominance so that people cant just set up their market orders and go use their finances to spend all their time buying expensive ships to go kill people there is actually a costbenefit decision to be made with marketsas for 3 there are already several isk sinks involved in the market every buysell order attracts a broker fee every sale includes an scc tax these costs need to be considered when buying selling stuff so that the market is a little more complex than buy at price x sell at price y only where y  x  it is still possible that if y  x you could actually make a loss so the benefits of trading come with risks all market transactions take money out of the gametldr not supported  market works fine as it is
qens that have come out in the past have said flatly that eve is on a longterm deflationary trend analysis of the major market components agrees with this a year ago a ravent1 market was 87 mil in jita now its 76 a zealott2 market was 120 mil is now 93 t3 is a bit too recent for the one year ago number to be meaningful but theyve been on a steady downward trend since they were introduced some items have gone up but the overall trend is steady deflation i dont know how well trained you are in economics but heres a crash course on monetary policy effective money supplyeffective goods supply  price level if prices go down it means that money is getting rarer relative to goods in other words we need more isk sources or fewer isk sinks in order to get price stability other mmos with dropbased economic models that force everyone to the best possible goods do have an inflation problem eve does not asking for additional isk sinks in eve implies that either you do not understand economics or that you do not understand the eve market are you kidding im lazy as hell my orders spend a lot of time tenth on the list in active markets but i know that going in and plan accordingly ive watched a lot of orders in a lot of markets over the last year or so there are some markets where the competition is absolutely furious  i put a couple billion a week through the jita mineral markets for example im lucky to have an order stay on top for the full five minutes there but ive looked at the behaviour out of curiosity and theres no signs of macros its just a heavily traded market with a dozen people actively bumping at any given time the only time ive ever had anything that even looked like a macro was one time buying salvage in a minor mission hub but i convoed the guy and he just had an egg timer running had a nice chat with the fellow i dont have any conclusive evidence but ive gotten into this argument before and looked into it ive never seen any signs that its more than paranoid fantasy its too easy an activity to spot and it has too low a margin compared to doing it the oldfashioned way

was it your aaa alt that lost a leviathan in hw the other day or is this just a normal emowhine post
wow please get atleast the facts right before you turn this into a caod threadalso the issue discussed in this thread wouldnt have made a single difference for the titan losson the topic maybe bump the thread from sok instead of starting a new one
yes my bad it was atlas im an idiot and i know thou this is still a emowhine post
ill skip the slander and get straight to the point its time for you to withdraw from this race its time for you to move onweve seen enough of your views deny all you want the truth is out
it may interest those who have been following this thread that it is now the stated position of the eve tribune that ankhesentapemkah is an unsuitable candidate for the council of stellar management you can read my editorial explaining our reasons for taking this decision here you can find a separate forum thread here
thats how telling the truth works you can only deny the liesof course its also how disinformation works keep enough truth in there that people believe the lies
i think she explained what she did in csm in the cv i dont have much of an issue on that although i wouldnt have done that her comments about hating eve doesnt bother me becasue i certainly had moments where i hated this game if we didnt care about it it woudlnt be a great game really the main issue i have is her comment to the person who has an autistic child that was really uncalled for i would hope she apologized for that one for someone who wonders if others realize there are real people flying these ships that comment is way out of line
she didnt
i was commisioned this picture dont get mad at me
my dear god see how the cp parrot of doom strikes down in furious anger what excellence
independent journalism took a blow today
have you ever heard of editorials and opinion pieces
yes i have
yes journalists who dont agree with you are by definition not independant
think hard before you vote for this candidateyou might login one day and ankh has turned the game into a turd which costs 15 a month to nibble on
this is possibly the last person anyone should vote for this candidate and others like it are the reason csm is failspammailing every mission hub in eden with threats that other csms will move their lvl 4 missions to lowsec
confirming my votes for the pirate wench
and i said what about breakfast at tiffanys
exciting election to be sureplease voteissler
ive got to say after reading what you wrote about larkonis in the immediate aftermath of the great scandal the last thing id have expected is for you to say that you thought he should have done a better job with the heist cant say i agree with that pov but i think at this point its worth saying that contrary to the editorial i wrote at the time if i were a carebear i would definitely have to consider voting for issler obviously as im a pvper shes not going to best represent my interests so im not going to cast my vote for her sorry but i honestly cant say that id mind having her on the council lord knows everyone is entitled to get grumpy now and then and i cant say issler didnt have good reason ill be posting a note on my original editorial from a few months ago to that effect
wow that is a very unexpected and gracious thing to have postedthanksissler dainzefaithful eve tribune reader
i think issler brings a valuable perspective to the csm i hope we get to work together

well thank you for your questions d i will gladly answer them1 assuming we are playing the same game our interests are aligned ccp wont accept my give free titans to all alliances starting with p issue so the only thing thats left are issues that both me and all alliances in 00 would agree upon such as improving poses i cooperated very well with every member of the csm in the csm3 even with the highsec more carebeary types2 you know i really have no good idea for this i dont know if its a cultural thingblue is for boys pink is for girls etc or something else but there is very little in eve that could be regarded as feminine or largely attractive to females the already existing huge gender gap doesnt help things if i hear any good ideas im all ears and completely behind it but for now i really have no idea also demographically speaking this game appeals to older gamers and gamers that like space ships both groups are biased towards the male end of things combine both you end up with a huge sausagefest3 i would definitely spend some time visiting the volcano it is something i really want to do i may also drop ccp into the volcano since it is probably somehow their fault if i am trapped there i also want to go on a daytrip with some of my icelandic pl buddies4 well since they have announced it it will probably happen itll probably take the same form it took last time i just hope theres a cap on potential rewards so even if there is suspicion about favoritism it doesnt spiral into a huge deal such as what happened during that mothership event so long ago as for the lag issue if it happens then ccp will have to reinforce the node beforehand just like what happens for fleet battles as for accessibility just making it many small events in random places should ensure that the maximum number of players can see an event happen at least once
tldr read this editorial explaining why the eve tribune is asking you not to vote for ankhesentapemkahlong versionmy fellow players i feel that it is worth announcing here that the eve tribune new edens oldest and most established independent newspaper has taken the extraordinary and for us unprecedented step of formally urging our readers not to vote for ankhesentapemkah for the csm you can read my editorial setting out our case against her here though due to the limitations of time and space i have dealt with only some of the very serious problems with ankhs record we feel that the case we have laid out is simply too damning to even consider voting for this deeply flawed candidate it is our considered opinion that ankh is morally and temperamentally unsuitable to sit on the council of stellar management simply put we believe that she is the worst candidate currently running rest assured that this decision was taken after careful consideration with the tribunes management and with full understanding of the importance of our role as independent reporters in the democratic process again we most sincerely urge all of our fellow players not to vote ankhesentapemkah thank you for your time
i agree with you that ankhesentapemkah isnt a suitable candidate in my opinion i do feel that you are biased i am a pvper but i know very well that there are many many pilots who would tell you that for them eve online isnt about pvp and have no interest in it that that is their choicei feel that i should say that evas choice to list her volunteer work for ccp would in the uk not only be quite legitimate but also encouraged
would it be encouraged to list that as actual employment without specifying that its par time volunteering or the elected nature of the position also i dont oppose voting for other carebear candidates and neither does the tribune i personally wont vote for one since they wont represent my personal interests as an empirelowsec pvper and i only have one account but there are certainly highlyqualified carebears out there who i would love to see on the csm edit for instance i personally would love to see omber zombie get elected again everything ive heard is that hes a fantastically hard worker and has done a great job
yes i have looked at her cv and it is perfectly acceptable she has listed her employer job title and duties volunteer work in the uk is actual employment
biggest load of a steamin pile of crap ive ever read change the bloody record its a bloody cv not a official application form and tbh noone i know cares except for a few and a army of alts belonging to the other csmsankh is one csm out of quite a few  im sure if she suggested anything that isnt suitable in their and ccps opinion then it wouldnt even be considered items i have been reading lately seem to be written by a army of alts with personnal agendas ive read her past suggestions and votes and she has voted in favour of a no of items suggested by most other csms does that make those suggestions laughable because she cast her vote agreeing with themyou guys are embaressing
i am tired of this bs1 opinion is opinion and not fact2 ccp decides if a candidate is qualified if a candidate is not then they are not allowed to enter the race as to your editorials points3 term limits yes there is a down side to lifting them just as there is a downside to having them in the first place never the less with them lifted there is nothing wrong with running even if you do not believe the term limits should not been lifted so we have a pointless point in the end4 the resumUFFFD issue who the flipping hell cares this does not matter one damn bit her cv has nothing to do what so ever to do with her qualifications as csm sure she brought it up if you dont like it fine dont vote for her but in ether case it is not important5 antipvp csm is a body made up of multiple members each representing ideally a number of different perspectives and backgrounds one member can not change the game the csm can not change the game the csm helps present and prioritize issues players have with the game one member will not change the nature of eve or ccp to think otherwise is folly to put it nicelymy final commentif you dont like ankhesentapemkah dont vote for her it is that simple all of these posts do one thing draw attention to her candidacy just remember any publicity is good publicityoh and htfuthank youashina sitoedit i apparently misread ankhesentapemkahs statement on this and she was refering to fanfest so this section is factually incorrect i am leaving it in since it was posted and just moving out of the main text if ankhesentapemkah wishes i will delete this sectionto be fair i do not have all love and roses for ankhesentapemkahs viewpoints she has expressed the desire to remove the covering of the expenses for csm members to go to the iceland summit i do not like this i will already be expending several thousands of dollars in lost wages my job has no vacation days and airfare ccp pays for flights to iceland on icelandic air i live in southern california i will have to fly to ether seattle or nyc out of pocket to catch an icelandic air flight to iceland i would already be taking one for the team enough with my finances to pay for the entire trip would be untenable at least i could crash on the couch of some i know in iceland my parents had an icelandic foreign exchange student and i am sure he would loan me his couch for a week
i dont give a rats behind about the cv thing  employers should check relevant references in any casehowever i dont understand how anyone would support someone who would stoop so low as to abuse the parent of a disabled child and blame them for causing the disability candidly i think thats on a par with or maybe even worse than racial abuse which is something that even the socipathic bullies who make up the pvp community in eve have never toleratedive disagreed with eva on a number of game related issues but that revealing little display of viciousness puts her beyond the pale as a person
you guys are an embarrassment for independent journalism have you contacted ankh to see what she had to sayher thread is trolled and the comments you are quoting are outdated most of them date back before ankh has even been on the csm and during a time where there indeed was no consequence for suicide ganking there were tactics to avoid getting a secloss alltogether and concord took ages to show up your article is horribly onesided and most of your socalled facts are simply wrong which candidate paid you to post this crapplus being from the netherlands and being owner of a small business i can attest that ankhs cv is perfectly fine
ok ive heard from a few europeans now that ankhs cv is fine perhaps this is because im an american but as a general rule we dont cite parttime volunteer experience as part of the employment history but rather as part of a miscellaneous experience section so my first problem in particular with that entry is that it suggests that it was a fulltime job not parttime volunteer work this appears inaccurate but i can see how there might be different conventions in europe if i can get more confirmation that things are done differently on the other side of the pond and dutcheuropean cvs include parttime volunteer work as part of the employment section without some kind of differentiation as ankh does then ill gladly post a correctionmy second problem which perhaps i should have made more clear is that ankh was not hired by ccpie the awardwinning company which has developed a highly successful mmobut rather elected by the player baseie people who pretend to fly internet spaceships this strikes me as fundamentally misleading and something that cannot be easily explained away by different cultural conventions for cvs
no hearing no double checking quoting stuff that has already been disproven even in the thread itselfi have seen gossip columnists do betterby the way whats up with the people from razor alliance youve been in close contact with about this how much did they pay you
for the record i believe ankh is referring here to the tribunes editorinchief finnagain zero
while i agree with the fundamental message all i found in the article was a tldr of a forum thread and some potshots at eve ccp and aspects of the game i happen to quite enjoysounds like a whiny pvper
i find it funny that the first two paragraphs are basically an apology to the reader that publishing trasharticles like these are the wrong thing to do and attempt to spin thin justifications for doing it anywayeverything you claim in this article is wrongthe things she put in her cv are not only perfectly acceptable they are also totally irrelevant to her bid for csm the only reason it is in her thread is because her opponents use it to fling mud with the alts of the opponents then trying to make mountains out of this nonissuethe thing about uos justice system have been clarified several times in the topic but the trolls keep bringing it up and ignoring the clarifications as did youlike kuliskitur said ankhs quotes about unfair suicide ganking date back from before the suicide gank nerf and even ccp agreed that the suicide ganking mechanics were not balanced at that time funny as ccp even states its intention to remove insurance from concordrelated events the most ironic part is that ankh didnt ask for these measures she asked for playerdriven justice aka pvp means to deal with itankh has stated clearly that she is propvp smallgang warfare and factional warfare being mentioned throughout the years as areas in need of improvementankh not responding well to criticism as you can see she remains relatively calm and polite despite all the bull flaming and trolling going on as seen from prior campaign threads if ankh would keep responding it would just degenerate into a flamewar the trolls do not read nor care about the answers she gives as displayed clearly in the start of the thread where there is clear selective quoting and twisting of her statements by her opponents i applaud it that ankh ignores the trolls and remains constructive under the circumstanceschatlogs could as well be fabrications some people have already pointed out errors in several of them and ankh denied the authenticy of at least one of themgood job throwing your credibility and that of eve tribune out of the window by using a troll thread as only source and not conducting proper hearing nor doing your own research
where did you get that fromi said ccp should not pay the fanfest tickets of course they should be paying the csm summit expenses
well looks like all the hate failed
gets popcornsits comfortably
ankh got  mainly due to the bull that is happened on this forum  7 votes from mei guess you pvplers cant stand a person who speaks and stands up for the producers miners traders as well so you have to spread lies and rumorscheap really cheap propaganda eve tribune  epic fail
qftnow thanks to all this dirt being lifted i am actually voting for ankhesentapemkah with my alt did you get what you wanted now how do you like that huhits not pvpers i am a pvper and i would still like them say improving missions or mining it just politics people throwing dirt at eachothertribune  is only one ing reason anyone has a cv in the first place that is to get employed and get a good job we are all guilty of those motives and i do not give a crap about the cv how i dont give a crap about tribune either
heh dude arent you attending for csm as well are you that desperate that you have to troll some misinforming antipropaganda threadthats 11 more votes for ankh by me and my famillygo ankh go
and 8 from me thanks for all the comedyo7
 ankhesentapemkah  im just sick of this bull gamenow to be fair i think the evetribune is utterly full of  then againso are you so it seems all works out well in the end dontcha think balance and all thatand by the wayyour inability to comment regarding1your belonging to a pvp alliance and never participating beyond raging when caught in yet another fit domi and popped2your complete inexperience regarding pvp mechanics sov mechanics ship fitting etc3your stated belief that something called puzzle pirateseve4your stated beleif that eve is a bull gameetc etc etc etcdoes not equate to disproven hon ps do dutch jails serve free spliffs
this carebear persecution complex is fascinating ankh did well to capitalise on it
shouting irrelevant is not disproving anything id like to point out that you havent even denied any of the logs posted by myself and others of your time in afc ill also invite anyone that thinks im a forum alt or related to another candidate or just an annoyed pvper to check out my info in game youll see i was indeed alongside ankh in afc that im not much of a pvper i flew in cva for a while after all  and have an honestly fairly poor set of battleclinic stats but i also have experience with pos operations logistics and mission running as can be seen from my standings i dont particularly care who amongst the other candidates gets onto the csm i just feel ankh is the worst possible person to represent eve from all those available ive said it before and ill say it again id rather have my toaster on the csm than her at least it wouldnt be quite so dishonest and hostile to what eve is
why should they profit on that or maybe ankh instead whoever made this anti ankh article txs for the nice place for my adv
it isnt easy for me to explain the differences between american and european employment on this forum without a very long post but what i can do is point out to you a few things that may make it clearer to youfirstly uk cvs wouldnt normally have a miscellaneous experience section a uk employer would actually expect volunteer or part time work to be listed as your employment historysecondly it would be expected although not mandatory for your cv to be accompanied with a covering letterif you downloaded the pdf from her website you will note that there are 4 pages 2 pages are the cv and 2 are the covering letter if you read the covering letter she states i have been elected council member of eve onlines council of stellar management she continues to explain what was involvedattending an interview in the uk your cv and covering letter would be discussed issues like pay duties work hours and contract agreements would be discussed for both the job you are attending the interview for and your previous employmentif eva was from the uk ccp would be considered a previous employer i am not from the netherlands but as far as i can see she has said nothing misleading at all in her employment application
in the netherlands a cv usually only has these sections personalcontact information work experience education misc skills  hobbies  interestssee intermediarnl for examplesit is often stongly encouraged to fit your cv on a single page or two pages at most and then print it on the front and back which is very important when looking for a job so you can hand it over immediately when asked and carry several copies with you at all times thus having more sections isnt practical relevant volunteer work clearly belongs to the work experience section in particular if it was your main workrelated activity at that timein addition to that is a covering letter that provides more details about your prior activities and what you learned from them it is also used to explain why you want to work for company x and what you want out of a job while the covering letter is usually changed based on the company you apply for eva has a generic one on her sitedid you bother doing some actual research here like any independent reporter should or did you just listen to the trolls the covering letter explains exactly what it is and what she did thereand under dutch law eva has been an unpaid employee for which a contract of employment is not a requirementmost of the other accusations in the article are equally unfounded i think the only unfit person here is you miyamoto unfit for the position of reporter that is
the vast majority of everything thats cited in the article are your own words posted by you on the eve forums your only possible counterarguments are to one point where miya stated that you appear to believe something that hasnt been disproven so much as challenged and one other post at kugu everything else is you posting here if you can actually prove that either of those comments were false youre welcome to email such evidence to the tribune and well take a look at it but denial is not rebuttal european or american putting down working at the csm as if it was employment in the video games industry is deceptive and misleading as part of the csm she does not handle game design she is not a dev csm members make nonbinding suggestions to ccp the same as any player posting on the forums but the csm has a bit more clout the csm advises ccp and they then choose to either accept or reject suggestions and how to implement them casting the csm as a devs position is misleading at best served as liaison between player base and developers is accurate game design game mechanics analysis documentation is not unless she was hired on as a dev andor wrote their documentation hers
its almost like rl politics
selective quoting ftw nowhere in this article are evas counterarguments presented the article only presents arguments in favor of the claim that ankh is unfit and what not while there is plenty of material everywhere that proves the contrary there is plenty of rebuttal in the thread itself and also in previous campaign threads of her cause this isnt the first time all this crap has been brought up which simply is not included in the article there are half a dozen posts in which eva counters the uo justice whining the article refers to the uo justice thingie but never makes any mention of the clarifications the article is one big pile of libel bias and even some outright falsehoodsnowhere is she claiming she was a dev go go strawman tactics and see the two posts above your own for proof that it is not normal but in fact encouraged to write the cv in the manner she did selective reading eh and this calls himself an editor
so sure theyre her quotes in her own words expressing her own views but cant we at least ignore themcongratulations you understand the concept of an editorial arguing against a candidate so in other words it was 100 accurate but if someone later tries to retract their statement and change it with but what i really meant was then the facts are no longer facts and theyve been rebutted i think thats known as the mel gibson gambit i dont think things work that way ive noted that quite a few of you who have taken to supporting ank do so with this blatantly fictional stuff it is interesting that you folks feel that the truth wont do to support your claims when someone puts down game development on their cv as a function of a job it implies get this that job included game development that is that they were acting as a developer of course by your denial here i trust youre agreeing that she wasnt really developing anything for ccp and shouldnt have claimed that she acting as a developer in her role as player liaison progress is being made
i agree thats terrible what an awful person why are people actually trying to defend this spiteful pretentious useless individual are they alts
it is not deceptive it is not misleading the cv  covering letter is for a prospective employer eva described her duties she also gave contact information for ccp games who would be quite willing for verify what she had doneit is very clear that her job as a csm fills game design game mechanics analyisis  documentation her job as csm would mean she would need to talk to developers about game design and game mechanics and to document that she is not misleading anyone by saying thatif this was the only thing in her cv and covering letter it might be misleading since she covered what that meant in her covering letter and provided a reference for her duties she was not being misleadingthe truth is right there in her cv and covering letter anyone reading this thread can take a look if they so wished they will see for themselves that she is not misleading anyone i do not consider your failure to understand a simple cv and covering letter as evidence to the contrary
yes it is she did not serve as a dev the fact that she gave a contact to verify that does not change the fact that it wasnt true in the first place if the csm are devs then anybody who posts suggestions on the forums are also engaged in game development
no it isnt you are replying as if she called herself a dev at no time on her cv or covering letter did she do that
see if you cant even get the very basic facts straight what does the rest of your rant meanif someone says they engaged in game design theyre saying they were get this designing a game thats what a dev does again by your rationalizations anybody who posts any advice for the game on the forums is a game designer this shows the quality of your argument
you cant get the basic facts right can you she did not say she was engaged in game design you are the only one saying that the words game design are mentioned on her cv this doesnt mean she is calling herself a game designer or a game developer you are the only one saying thatthere is no way my rationalizations would mean anyone who posts any advice for the game on these forums is a game designer you are the only one saying thatthe fact remains that eva at no point said she was a game designer or game developer for ccp you are the only one saying thatyou have no argument at all
again the fact that youre reduced to such obvious dishonesty and you cant even stick to the basic facts that are in black and white kind of shows what your argument is about you are now honestly claiming that when she says that her work on the csm included game design that she wasnt really saying she was engaged in game design who do you think youre fooling exactly just to point out your deception hereif you cant even keep your deceptions straight from one paragraph to anotherand yes someone who engages in game design is a game designer isnt it just strange how that works the fact that you are arguing against your own logic just shows the quality of that logic if ank is engaged in game design by making suggestions to ccp so is everybody who does it on the forums but you claim that theyre obviously not but shes not being dishonest when she claims the exact same thing the sheer amount of dishonesty anks fans have used says all that needs to be said

i am not dishonest you are just wrongthe fact still remains she did not call herself a dev at anytime on her cv or covering letter
you might want to change that from now ona newspaper is purely for covering the news on an unbiased base by urging people in a very distinctive way to vote in a certain way you just lost your newspaper worthyness and arent anything more than a propaganda machine for a party or against a partyif you just post all the facts and then let people decide for themselves you would have been a newspaper by this action you clearly pointed out that you are not about covering the news but are also about making the news which is far from what real journalism is about
umm thanks i thinkim happy to be interviewed any time you like omberozomberogmailcom remove the s obviously
have you ever considered learning what youre talking about before you make claims newspapers have had editorials for quite some time and the ny times is hardly no longer a newspaper if they endorse a candidate
funnyall the big badass pvplers come out together with all of the pvp orientated cool csm kids and cry about a person who wants to make eve a better game for both the pve players ind empire and the pvp peopleand all that is sponsored by some so called eve magazine a propaganda tool for all the cool gankers and gate campersi wouldnt vote on some csms korvin comming ot this thread and whining about a competing candidate epic fail there
no thats the point ank doesnt understand eve doesnt grok what makes it good and her ideas would hurt the game for everybody yes yes theres an elaborate conspiracy against you hide
ow i know exactly what i am talking about editorials are pieces in a newspaper which give a certain journalist or columnist a spot to point out their point of vieuw this however isnt the point of vieuw of the newspaperand no the ny times isnt exactly an example of a newspaper when it started to take sides offcourse people will argue about it but one of the first things a real journalist and editor learns is that the newscoverage should be unbiased and openwhat path they chose afterwards is a whole other story but you can check with any real reputable journalist that being unbiased in newscoery is the keystone in journalismas soon as the unbiased newscoverage is hapered with the journalist editor or newspaper loses the keypart of its credebility mainly due to the fact that you can start doubleguessing any coverage in a certain direction as being partially build up on biased assumptions and blowing out of proportion or smoothed down if its something they favoured for in the passt
again learn what youre talking about newspapers endorse candidates and argue against candidates all the time in each and every single election cycle every newspaper endorses candidates come election time its okay if you support ank but these silly rationalized attacks are just laughable your backofacerealboxwisdom is not impressive but youre more than welcome to find reputable ombudsmen sanctioning newspapers for making endorsements knock yourself out
oops i guess i misread your post would you like a blanket removal of the comment or an leave it up with an edit i am gonna edit it atm
you can troll as much as you want you are clearly not a newspaper but a supporttool for a certain direction which clearly makes you nothing more than a propaganda toolow and if you want some reputable ombudsmen or women to give their opinion about this i will dig up some and guess what then you will start to nag they arent reputable since they arent the ones you deem to be reputablethe states have this amendment which guarantees freedom of speech so ofcourse its impossible to sanction newspapers for being a biased bunch of people rooting for one side and making offbalance reportsas long as they dont lie its fine its not asif you can fine them for only discoveringhalf the truth and then defending the fact they do a biased newscovery by hiding behind all kinds of judicional crapits fine but dont try to rebottle with what certain newspapers do that clearly are funded in some way by a side and as such have to adjust their newscoverage which in turn has nothing to do with pure journalismendorsing a candidate is a whole other ballpark than calling to not vote for someone else by highlighting certain parts and not all of it so it fits your propagandait just makes your candidate look insecure of his own merits
and just for you to have a thourough readfailing to uphold standardssuch a code of conduct can in the real world be difficult to uphold consistently journalists who believe they are being fair or objective may give biased accountsby reporting selectively trusting too much to anecdote or giving a partial explanation of actions see media bias even in routine reporting bias can creep into a story through a reporters choice of facts to summarize or through failure to check enough sources hear and report dissenting voices or seek fresh perspectivesa news organizations budget inevitably reflects decisionmaking about what news to cover for what audience and in what depth those decisions may reflect conscious or unconscious bias when budgets are cut editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus reduce the number of staff assigned to lowincome areas or wipe entire communities from the publications zone of interestpublishers owners and other corporate executives especially advertising sales executives can try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published journalists usually rely on top management to create and maintain a firewall between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department one journalism magazine columbia journalism review has made it a practice to reveal examples of executives who try to influence news coverage of executives who do not abuse their powers over journalists and of journalists who resist such pressuresselfcensorship is a growing problem in journalism particularly in covering countries that sharply restrict press freedom as commercial pressure in the media marketplace grows media organizations are loath to lose access to highprofile countries by producing unflattering stories for example cnn admitted that it had practiced selfcensorship in covering the   regime in iraq in order to ensure continued access after the regime had thrown out other media cnn correspondent christiane amanpour also complained of selfcensorship during the invasion of iraq due to the fear of alienating key audiences in the us there are claims that the media are also avoiding covering stories about repression and human rights violations by the israeli and iranian regimes in order to maintain a presence in those countriesreporting versus editorializinggenerally publishers and consumers of journalism draw a distinction between reporting  just the facts  and opinion writing often by restricting opinion columns to the editorial page and its facing or oped opposite the editorials page unsigned editorials are traditionally the official opinions of the papers editorial board while oped pages may be a mixture of syndicated columns and other contributions frequently with some attempt to balance the voices across some political or social spectrumthe distinction between reporting and opinion can break down in the uk the press complaints commission states that the press whilst free to be partisan must distinguish clearly between comment conjecture and fact but some commentators have suggested there can sometimes be a blurring of opinion and fact complex stories often require summarizing and interpretation of facts especially if there is limited time or space for a story stories involving great amounts of interpretation are often labelled news analysis but still run in a papers news columns the limited time for each story in a broadcast report rarely allows for such distinctions
pathetic you just vomited up a bunch of text that has nothing to do with papers endorsing candidates how hard is it to figure out wtf youre talking about before you say stuffahhh youre hitting all the dodges anybody who points out the facts must be a troll because only trolls use facts and anybody who disagrees with you mus be part of an evil propaganda conspiracy huzzah you wont be able to because youre making stuff up as fast as you can type but good preemptive dodge on that one too again youre making stuff up as fast as you can type thats an ombudsmans job again discover what youre talking about before you talk about it when you have an election that is a zerosum game saying that you should only vote for one gay means that everybody else shouldnt be voted for and thus not elected if a newspaper says vote for candidate a for president not candidate b guess who theyve just argued you should not vote for
i understand that this is mistake on your part but if this mistake was printed in a newspaper your career would be over what does that say about you
eve tribune now propaganda machine for 00 pvp alliancesin a desperate attempt to take wind out of ankhesentapemkahs sails the eve tribune once a reputable newspaper has dropped from its unbiased journalism and has started to openly chose sidesit is still unclear what drove this former newspaper to such action but it surely has thrown a dark blemish on what once was a newsgathering newspaperethical and moral standards of journalism thrown off it has chosen to do a frontal attack towards ankhesentapemkah in an attempt to discourage people to chose this csm candidatemight this be due to financial or other bonds with some people in razor alliance which franticly is trying to convince people that this is still legitimate journalismor are there more powers in the north trying to smear another csms run for the csmthis makes one wonder when looking at all the forum threads and responces in them why people are so afraid of this ankhesentapemkah getting into the csm that they have to pull out every gun at their disposal to make her candidacy as hard as possiblei myself am not convinced ankhesentapemkah is the most suitable candidate but she clearly is the one with the highest profilemy suggestion is that people read what each candidate stands for and looks for the one who suits them most and votes for said candidateif the candidae doesnt uphold as he or she promoted then the election base can write to ccp and ask for clarification of ccp and if needed a formal petition of the playerbase for removal of said candidate for running under false pretences
funny story  the quotes about how suicide gankers are evil and need to be driven out of empire entirely do date from before the nerf but one would assume that the nerf would hardly be sufficient to satisfy someone with such extreme positions however even after the nerf  as recently as this campaign in fact  shes made comments about how suicide ganking needs significant further nerfing its on the first page of her campaign thread for example in other words the nerf hasnt satisfied her so what youre saying is that an editorial in a newspaper is picking a side of the debate and advocating for it why if you ignore the last four centuries of newspaper publishing thats almost shocking find me any pvper knowledgeable about the csm who has bad things to say about omber zombie lavista vista or z0d  three past carebear reps that actually have a clue nobody is opposed to the noncombat parts of the game being improved people are opposed to someone who seemingly misunderstands and resents the pvp parts of the game she listed game development as a job responsibility that would make her a game developer what do you think dev is an abbreviation for have you ever actually read the sort of newspaper that comes on actual paper past the third page i meanpresumably it says that he writes for a newspaper that doesnt keep multiple proofreaders as fulltime paid staff
heh i am interested in the logic here though i had a typo and right clicked to fix it without checking closely and clicked the wrong word therefore papers fire people who write typos therefore it really shows something important about me i dont know why anks supporters cant just say yeah shes said a whole lot of stuff that shows she doesnt understand eve and would harm the game and shes highly offensive to those people who engage in the content that ccp promotes as its endgame material but we like her anyways i doubt anybody would have a problem with that much but troll troll troll doesnt cut it although one nitpick ank defined her job duties as game design and technically not game development but theyre synonyms and she wasnt involved in either let alone as a job duty you folks are hilarious although this new tempest in a tea pot about a mistaken right click to fix a red lined word does say a bit about you this thread is turning into pure comedy gold can i hear some more about journalistic standards
it says that hes not a guy who supports someone who abuses the mother of a disabled child
by the way can i get a cite for that if its true it belongs in the article
whoa were a mouthpiece for razor now finn does that mean i get a raiseitt people complaining that a newspaper editorial expressed an opinion and that that opinion was biasedin other news i am shockedshockedto find that gambling is going on in
by the way can i get a cite for that if its true it belongs in the article funny aint it were not just a mouthpiece of rzr but evidently all 00 alliances because we all know that they speak with a unified voice its interesting as this is a milestone in the history of the tribune people used to accuse us of being puppets of this alliance or that alliance but now were evidently puppets of all of 00 in toto and no all those tech moons are mineps even funnier not only have we not endorsed the rzr csm candidate but we havent even interviewed him that just shows how beholden we are to rzrs views on the csm
bottom of this and top of the next post insert standard disclaimer about how chatlogs may be forged etc but near as i can tell ankh never denied making that statement her only response that i found was the following
193050 ankhesentapemkah  il looking at a lawsuit to eve tribune now tbh
ahahahahah
bump so everyone will know the truth about this candidatevote for ankhesentapemkah  ruin the game we all know and love
eve tribune writers have bias its unavoidable really we also get accused of far more bias than we really have but thats a different story that bias is why we have always offered anyone who disagrees with one of our articles the opportunity to write a counterpoint obviously with the understanding that they need to raise genuine pointsdemonstrate sourcesbe reasonably well writtenetc that will be published and the person who writes it will be paid at the same rates as our writersthat offer has never been taken upwhen offering interviews to all csm candidates which will still include ankh should she decide to run for future csms and be willing to be interviewed  which i will fully understand if she does not i try to be as neutralpositive as possible in fact you can see my interview with her in last weeks issueother writers though are also free to hold and expose their own opinions and in this case the majority of our editorial staff agreed with the opinion of the writer so it has also been adopted as the tribunes positionanyone expecting impartiality from newspapers has clearly never read one we just finished an election in the uk and the level of bias in our papers was incredible its human nature when you believe something to try and get others to believe it too
i wanted to go on the record as confirming that this is true some interesting comments were made about me in the context of larkgate i was contacted and offered an opportunity to offer any sort of rebutal i thought was appropriate in response i started to respond had some rl distractions and by the time i could get back to it i realized id just as soon let the whole matter passi have no doubt that the tribune would be glad to offer ank a chance to respond to the editorial if she is upset i think shed be better off exploring the possibility of creating a clever and insightful rebutal to the editorial instead of insinuating she is pursuing the possibility of justice in the dutch courts me wonders if the trial would be held in jitathe eve tribune is an amazing resource to the eve comminity an editorial related to csm elections seems totally consistent with what i would expect from our best space paperi can understand how someone that supports ank might dissagree with the editorial but how they can then twist that into an attack on the tribunes integrity eludes me to the folks that complain that this editorial somehow is inconsistent with a great newspaper all i can say is what about political editorials in a newspaper do you not undertandissler dainzejust renewed her virtual subscription to the eve tribune for life
yep i already offered in this thread to retract anything that ank can actually show is untrue it seems unlikely as all the quotes were either from anks own posts on eveo or from chats whose participants have verified their accuracy at best it seems that her response might be along the lines of her fansthat being said if ank can actually muster a cogent coherent response well be happy to publish it and pay her for her time doesnt seem likely though
eve tribune is indeed a great resource for the eve community nevertheless this article was horrible i gave more of an analysis of why the article stunk in the comment section of the article itself and no i do not like ank eve trib is great for articles on game mechanics tactics and strategy but often the writers disdain for eve pilots who do things other than pvp is a bit overbearing
while i think csm is a sham if there is one single candidate that you should not vote for it is most definatly ankhesentapemkahnot only because shes probably born in kenya but also because of the pure sleazy methods she has used to harvest votestelling mission runners that voting for her would stop lvl4 missions being moved to lowsec for example
happy to confirm that the chat logs are accurate sadly i dont have the originals just what i copied into an email however everything from when ankh first spoke in corp chat to when the conversation turned back to a discussion of the sorry state of the cva jump bridge network is there feel free to pm me in game if you need further info
aliariami just wanted to say that although i dont think eve trib did a good job on this article that doesnt mean i think what ank said was in any way acceptable it was completly out of line and standing alone is good enough reason to not vote for her i think it indeed shows she does not care about the people flying the pixel ships and given her claims in that regard that is really eyeopening i hope you dont let people who make comments like that get you down and i wish you the best
before i vote i do have a question to every csm i am interested in i feel that the imbalances in the game is the piracy the griefers and spammers now i dont like anyone who does anything that would be considered as cheating a customizable ui would allow possibilities of more bots while i know there are quite a few bot programs for eve most of them would probably be slow clunky and odd a customizable ui would allow it so bots would be easier to make and use how do you propose to help ccp see alternatives to this one major problem i am sure ccp sees it was one of the things that lead to the downfall of wow the second thing that lead to wows downfall was evei dont care if you all call me a carebear or not there are too many douchebags that cause the game to be less fun because they are griefed jihaded etc i agree space is a dangerous place but i think the biggest imbalance is there is too many criminals without any form of law enforcement other than concord and a few hard coded rules i feel that a player run law enforcement entity would be a good idea clean up the bounty system add a couple of skills that help tracking down specific players easily i feel that in itself will balance out a lot of the imbalances these douchebag players actually create eve is not a sand box it is either you are a pirate or you are dead one griefer told me there is no such thing as negative consequences to griefing in high sec i feel that is wrong i feel atleast if you suicide gank someone if that player is in a corp everyone in that corp should have kill rights on that player for 2448 hrs yea sure most players use this game to relax but honestly i would like to see more punsihment for the pirates more of a player run ccp endorsed form of law enforcement i am not talking about gm rights i am talking about space copsi would love to be a space pighave an npc dispatcher and your mission is to take out criminals who come into empire negative security standing players in 1 and above would you endorse space pigs why or why not
to those picking apart trebors particular ideas that are based upon speculation without any argument besides thatwell i find that a bit silly theyre not end all be all sorts of ideas but ideas based off of what he can assume and guess at in terms of the programming and back end it feels to me as if theyre samplesexamples if you will which is quite finein any case i do have a question for you myself one problem that occurred with varied addons in wow and in fact took several years to solve and keeps popping up every now and again is that some particular ones ended up putting quite a load on the server themselves some for example made extensive and heavy use of private channels and sendingreceiving information between ones entire guild eventually some functions that been utilized for this were disabledbut the problem existed for some time and in most cases admittedly it was causing clientside lag for those in large guilds using such programs as opposed to a strain on the server itself this leads me to the question however  between lag and the ui which is the one you will throw the most weight behind that you feel you might be able to most effect in a term as a csm member as is known and been mentioned both are relatively tough problems to work on as far along as the game is
i know that its our duty as eve players to have a massive inferiority complex where world of warcraft is concerned and to bash it at every opportunity and hey its a game that deserves some bashing  i played it for an hour and came to the conclusion that it was diablo with a subscription fee but this is just patent lunacy wow has thirty times the subscriber base of eve saying that eve killed it is like saying that betamax killed the dvd
currently eve has a better system and is more engaging to those that dont want to feel like they are in a bad 80s cartoon unfortunately i have adhd so sometimes i dont type my complete thought i also skip around when i do thati didnt mean eve killed wow overall because there will always be fanboys of starcraft warcraft and diablo but for me eve killed wow
argh server borked when i posted and i forgot to copy the text hours of careful cogitation and eloquent argument lost now you just get the cliffnotes versioni address this issue directly in the tldr manifesto but in brief a public repository with revokable addons largely mitigates the makes bots easier and secret i win button issuesin order for a proposal to gain any traction imho it needs to a actually fix the problem youre trying to fix b not remove a gameplay option that the devs have clearly stated is a core part of the game that in eve you have a inalienable right to be a total douchebag and c be as easy to implement as possible  or more precisely have the most bang per devhour expendedi think you have a lot of work to do before you will have a proposal that meets those criteriaconversely there is a proposal floating around to revoke insurance payouts when you get concorded it a increases the costs of being a flaming douchebag b still permits douchebaggery and c would probably be quite easy to implement im not entirely convinced it is the right way to go especially since well have to see what effect the upcoming changes in insurance will have but its worthy of serious considerationit wouldnt stop hulkageddon but then i think stuff like that is part of what gives eve its twisted charm
well obviously some thought would have to be given to the kinds of things addons can do such as posting to chat channels there will no doubt be some issues that crop up like anything else its a costbenefit calculation  are the overall benefits to the players worth the occasional fires that the devs need to put outthe honest answer is that nobody who is not on csm and under nda and briefed by ccp can give an honest answer to that question however heres my current opinionlag is the nearterm issue and the ui is the longterm issue as everyone should know because theyve read the oftmentioned tldr manifesto i think the solution to lag in the longterm even though its the nearterm issue grin is gameplay changes if i get on csm im going to hopefully get a better idea of the parameterspace of potential changes and within the limits of the nda want to encourage a serious public discussion of whats possiblethe ui is going to take longer to address it is almost certainly a much larger project than lagrelated gameplay changes and so its going to take more work to make the case to ccp that its in their interests to do itso in all honesty within the scope of a single csm term lag is the higher priority
i appreciate the good words you have singled out what i find to be key and unique to my campaign im glad it hasnt been buried by words
ive been noticing lately that ccp have been more open with us in a few regards and thats great a trend i would like to see grow and continue i think there are game balance issues of course there are lots of things i dont have first hand experience of such as being in a large nullsec alliance or flying capital ships what affects me does not necesarily affect a large number of people so ive decided to stay away from targeting any of my own opinions with respect to balance if i were to force issues such as those it would probably be done selfishly and i dont want to do that my opinion on the new expansion is not yet fully formed its something more than we have already so thats great the implementation and effects remain to be seen so i will reserve judgement for now 
friendly bump 0
i am all for boosting low sec i welcome anyone who is interested in ideas to boost low sec i am not happy with your thoughts on high secyou must understand that many pilots in 00 fund their shiny pvp ships from high sec activities right many of them would not welcome their income being nerfed what do you think a high sec mission runner would do if their isk earn per hour was reduced they would think great now i will have to run missions for longer todayplayers who are not interested in going to low sec or 00 will simply not go there and will not be forced in by any means buff low sec by all means i would welcome it but not at the expense of players who are simply not interested
im inclined to agree the way to solve the problem is to buff the rewards in low and nullsec so that they are commensurate with the risks
yes i perfectly understand that there is lots of 00 players who earn their money by running highsec missions and thats the problem highsec activitiesexcept for trading shouldnt be so profitable nullsec dwellers should earn money they need for pvp in their regions and if they are not doing so then something is wrong with the game design
i believe that its pilots choice how they make their isk if they want to make their isk in high sec then so be it i do not want my income to be interfered with because someone feels i shouldnt if you feel that 00 isk isnt profitable enough in comparison to high sec earned isk then why not boost the isk earned in 00 rather than try to nerf high sec earned isk
anomalies in nullsec are more profitable than empire missions still many people prefer to run missions in highsec because they offer comparable rewards with zero hassle yeah it will be difficult to nerf highsec missions now because many generations of highsec dweller take their high income for granted but it should be done for consistency highsec exploration isnt even close as profitable as lowsecnullsec mining in highsec doesnt give you income comparable to nullsec miners even production in nullsec offers greater rewardsof course demand is lower than in empire and highsec mission runner has no need to fear anybody except maybe some rare wardec suicide ganking mission runners ship requires too much work and preparation to be viable so clearly highsec mission runners enjoy good profit with nonexistent risk there is few solutions to this1 agents in highsec could offer less lp2 introduction of sleeper ai to lvl4 missions would solve the problem too in this case rewards for lowsecnullsec mission runners should be boosted3 lvl4 agents could be moved to lowsecor at least all positive quality agents but it would not change much
those of you who follow me on twitter or my blog will have already seen this the beta version of my csm database site is up and runningit allows you to see the voting results of each meeting or a combined list of all proposals plus you can click on a delegate and see all the issues they raisedill be adding various tweaks and so on as people suggest ideas plus omberzombie has been in touch about uploading the data from csm2 which is great thanks also to tamber for the title image have a look and let me know what else you would like to see included on the site
hey alltea has been working on this csm database thing all week i should know ive watched it take shape as we chatted about it on irc even thrown in my own suggestions on stylingif this doesnt prove to people that tea is dedicated to making csm a successful process i dont know what will the guys absolutely gungho about this stuff 2 votes for teadaze
6 more days left to vote
hmm clear concise answers from someone who seems to realize that games are a balancing scale not an arms race why do i always have to vote for the logical one1 vote good sir
tamber now that i voted for you will you pleeeeaaaaase ask ccp to give me some rookie ship bpos i want somealso please buy my chribba and entity capsules chribba says they are fake but me and you know better heheheheheheres a troll btw
ive gotten a number of great suggestions on my website and i always welcome more suggestions check them out wwwlittlethingsfirstcomforums
care to explain why the vote matcher says you dont agree that scamming should be permitted was it a misclick or do you have a specific rationale for this position if the latter do you intend to actually do anything about it if elected to the csm
the entire pdf document has some kind of odd font requirement and is completely unreadable aside from about 3 sentancesfrom what ive seen others mention from the csm meetings there were a few valuable points brought up like the part about hiding account names from character transfers but the majority of it is a huge waste of time a waste of money flying these kids to iceland and a waste of bandwidth every csm voting periodvote abstain let your voice be heard
i agree that past efforts by dr eyjo to provide us with data have been somewhat lacking but from my past experience in the csm the reasearch  stats department have access to a lot more information than they make public my preferred course is for them to use that data see what information hey can mine from it and make that information public and ask for players opinions as to a course of action that would be the feedback loop they could base their actions onshould they decide that t2 bpos do indeed need to go then i agree it must be handled delicately as people have worked very hard in a lot of cases to acquire the bpos and wholesale removal would disenfranchise a lot of peopleits a very delicate issue which has been avoided for a long time now i personally think its time to make a decision one way or the other
you see my problem with what you say here is the old 40 of all minerals come from mission lootwe all know that the table in question was very imprecise as the loot column did include reprocessed t2 stuff reprocessed t1 ships and items used for mineral compression if as you say ccp had access to better data releasing the that table in that form was done as a deliberate attempt to find a culprit for the mineral prices pointing the finger against mission runners essentially giving false data to follow a political agendai prefer to think that ccp has never really done to work to get a clear table that to think they have purposefully given out false data
that table was released and looked into originally at the urging of csm 2 specifically lavista  me it was completely lacking in information and was imho stupid the entire reason we asked for the data to be released was because we both felt there was a serious issue with how minerals were coming into the game and felt ccp needed to look at itthe table they released was nowhere near as indepth as it should have been and the day it was released we sent off a request asking for more indepth data we never got a response i raised the issue again at csm3 and again no response finally they recently decided to change the mineral composition of looted materials so i can only guess that they looked at our request and checked it outwhat they do internally to mine data and what they release to the players are 2 separate things  i am hoping to change that so that players have more access to the data however as both diagoras  eyjo have said to the csm certain datapoints could cause a lot of disruption to the economy should they be made public so they need to be careful as to how much they actually give outpersonally i think if the data given out was historical in nature like in the qens then it can have very little impact on the current state rather it would give us an insight into what they track and base the changes they make on it would also allow players to point out what they broke in their attempts to fix which would allow a form of peer review which doesnt seem to happen now until it is far too late
i agree with youi simply had this tin hat moment seeing the release of dubious data as a system to manipulate public opinion we have too much of that in rl alreadyi think that a table like the old one cleared of the spurious data would have been very interesting without disrupting the economy as the data were very generic i see that table cited in md and other section of the forum taking it as a perfect picture of the current situation and not as a snapshot of the situation almost 2 years ago before some big change in mineral production wh mining unholy rage and the increased veldspar spawn industrial upgrades in 00 more often than not it is used to support mission runners hate post and not to try to evaluate the real impact on market and mining of the mission loot
oz what are your thoughts on using single transferable vote for csm elections
i think that for the next round voting for csm6 candidates that players should cast 3 votes 1 vote max per candidate1st 3 points2nd 2 points3rd 1 pointreason for this in my opinion is that then you vote better based on what team you would like to see working together rather than to vote based on for example charisma alliance andor some good topics someone may haveperhaps you all remember the tv show  big brother  where people will have to live together for a year csm is in a way the sameas i already said a year ago elect 9 muppets and you will get the muppetshow not a working counsilaside of how well people are able to present their platforms and having good ideas you still will need to have fellow csm members being elected that have other abilitiesqualifications like for example being able to lead a team is the chairman actually the best person able to lead and someone else might have the ability to represent csm better towards the public imagine a frigid scary nerd to push ccp to make things better lol but he had a great platformso in short people should be able to vote for a team not just a candidateextreme
before mazz will do pyou can still cast your votes herewould be good if csm5 would work on this subject with ccp
thatll push things much more so towards slatebloc voting look at the elvenlordvuk lau slate in this election or the goon slates in past they have to split the votes of people which provides a natural brake on how big slates can get thereby broadening representation if you implement this system youll see more 23 candidate blocs and fewer individuals winning thats not what i want
i agree with your point herschelso suggesting that while you casting 3 votes that its limited to only one candidate of the same alliance and with a possability to be able to abstain to vote for numbers 2 and 3
so you cant vote for vuk and elven but if omber zombie and i ran on a slate you could vote for both of us all youd get is elven lord in a npc corp as the candidate with the main doing all the posting and promotion alliance tickers are among the easiest things to fake in the game
i guess that can be fixed by the penalty that this alliancerule will also include candidates that left the same aliance in a period shorter than 2 months
doesnt deal with obvious alts
csm candidacy is applied by rl name and passport and thus it doesnt matter what alt you haveall someones alts are connected only ccp will know to one rl ownerccp can see if the candidated alt involved the 2 month rule of one of his other altsthis includes character transfers as well
i do agree the voting system needs to be changed but my concern with a boorda count even a limited boorda count which is what the op proposes is that it would more easily allow bloc voting by alliances i think a better option would be the single transferable vote which would deal with the problem of different candidates splitting constituencies and works well for multiseat elections like the csm
 1 vote to alpha
let the community vote for features not peopleyou will get a much more accurate representation of what the community wants to push ahead and we would do away with all of the sleezy political vote harvesting mass evemail spamming takeyourlvl4saway fear mongeringevery csm candidate is running with the promise of changing every gameplay functionccp made this game what it is today and it is wonderful that theyre willing to listen to the players but they have let this get out of hand csm candidates will suggest anything if it means getting a free trip to iceland and an epeen extensionvote abstain  let your voice be heard
features cant fly to iceland to make themselves heard and more importantly features cant be supported by 10k people at a time a set of candidates can be
firstly some of the most popular and uncontroversial features have already been agreed by ccp to be good ideas submitting a feature list with the same old things on it isnt going to make it happen but face to face meetings between ccp and a dedicated team at least has a chance of moving things forwardsecondly if you think every csm candidate is running with the promise of changing every gameplay function then i think you have been rather selective with your reading although with over 50 candidates standing i couldnt blame you for skimreading the manifestos
yes they canlook at the ideas and suggestion forum those features are transmitted to iceland a hell of a lot faster then a bunch of pizzafaced teenagers pand why cant a feature be supported by 10k peopleif we had a poll containing features we would have a perfect representation of what the community wants donethe csm candidates on the other hand claim to support crazy ass  in order to get votes and then party in iceland for a week on our dollar
youve seemingly not stumbled upon my stance on things perhaps because im not evemail spamming or for whatever other reasonx
anti csm is like statler and waldorfbooooooo
theres no need for csm at all why do i need you to tell ccp what i want why cant i just press vote on a feature instead
you are extremely misinformed want to see a vote for features start proposing changes in assembly hall and rustle up support for them i think youll discover something important from such an exercise people are a critical ingredient in effective advocacy
i admit i shouldnt have taken that jab it wasnt meant literallyhowever the point still remains ccp should have a good hard look through all of the proposed ideas in ideassuggestions forum then place the ones they would consider into a vote and let the players have their sayotherwise we end up with ankh again
while i dont think csm is necessarily a good thing most things in features and ideas and the assembly hall is such horrible trash
which is why ccp should cherrypick the plausible ideas maybe 20 of them and then let everyone vote on theminstead we have csm people who are running on the assumption that they will be able to do wild things that ccp wouldnt even consider anyways
apology accepted i would guess that ccp doesnt really have the bandwidth to devote to the unbelievably timeconsuming job of keeping up with and assessing all the ideas and issues being raised in these forums having nine elected players who can divide that work uparguably with greater collective insight than any single internal resource ccp might assign to the taskmakes it far more likely that the good stuff rises to the top besides that players can access csm members directly to discuss their ideas be guided in making more informed proposals based on the csms experience with ccp and pointed to duplicate issues already addressed or supported nothing like that direct line of communication exists with ccp there is a lot of value in those things for parties on both sides of the fence
i think most candidateseven me with my admittedly optimistic that the answer isnt not just no but hell no stfu low sec agendaare pretty clear what the csms role is and what the csm might expect to reasonably accomplish however now that ccp is giving csm some stakeholder presence im hopeful there will be opportunities to discuss longer term bigger ideas yes like low sec thatif good enough may catch hold of some devs imagination and be discovered to be worthwhile from a bottom line perspective whether im just being my usual stubbornly optimistic self remains to be seen
removed trolling comments and replies to the troll
precisely but instead we have two very energetic idiots trying to derail every serious discussion about how to improve them i wish these forums had an ignore function 
so what kind of nerf are you going to propose for the rokh eagle ferox vulture taranis moa and brutix
nerf their pg so they cant fit hightier rails without multiple fitting mods oh wai
irrelevant final values are what matters and the final values put the eagle competitive with the rest of the lr hacsdespite foolishness of people unwilling to fit in that manner the ferox and brutix with the rest of the lr bcs and the vulture in a class of its own and the moa competitive with lr cruisers
increase the base range of rails provides gallente rail ships with the railgun niche and decrease the range bonuses on the caldari ships maybe switch a bonus on the caldari ships to something else instead of range targeting range it would have to be specific to each ship in a way that createsmaintains balancethe vulture fits the role it is meant to fill giant tank warfare links and enough range on its guns to ninja in on killmails without any real damage output no changes to hybrids will impact the value of the vulture locking range limits how far it fires not the actual gunsthe eagle currently is in the same boat locking range being the limiting factor messing with the base range of railguns will not impact this switching a range bonus on the eagle to a locking range bonus would allow it to fit its niche of longer range than the other sniper hacs without sacrificing both damage output and tank ie you could use a mid slot for a tank instead of sensor booster as nice as it would be to have more damage on that ship it isnt the niche it is meant to fillincreasing the base range of railguns will not impact the ferox or rokh they are killmail s  heavy tank fast rof fixing them so they truly are participating in a fight would require railguns to fire slower but have more damage per shot so the dps remains roughly the samethe moa is a horrible ship it needs fairly massive work that has little to do with railguns specificallydont know much about the taranis as i dont like to fly the interceptors that dont have the point range bonus even with a 10 bonus per level small rails still wont do a lot of damage maybe im wrong
none because theres damn near no reason to fly them now and they might actually have a purpose then gasp seriously man  the only ship that you might even have a point about would be the taranis and even that im not sure aboutliang
just because you dont do fleet work doesnt mean that they dont do their job well compared to the alternativesthis is a terrible idea and there is nothing wrong with the ships you listed except that you arent smart enough to use them properlyor tech 1 cruiseritis
wait where did i say there was something wrong with any of the ships i mentioned i said gallente do not have range with rails so rails should have more base range many caldari rail ships should have their range bonuses nerfed when the base range is increased i suggested rather bland bonuses to switch with the range bonuses on caldari shipsedit wtf is up with you saying people arent smart enough to properly fit ships that you never fly let alone fit when we are in need of pulsebeam fits well let you know
the vast majority of people in this thread do not think that the sleipnir is the issue at all id argue that it is the most well designed of all the field commands ships atm and is what ccp should strive for when balancing the othersthe two ships that have attracted the most attention in both this discussion and others similar to this one are the nighthawk and the astarte these are the ships that i believe have fundamental issues with both fitting and slots especially when compared to the much cheaper and arguably more effective tier 2 bcsnighthawk needs more grid this issue has been identifies and agreed upon by a large portion of the community for quite a long time running the astarte in my opinion needs an 8th high slot and the additional gridcap needed to run a gang module on a competitive combat setup i believe that the armor repair bonus that is commonly associated with gallente bcs needs a revisit as well i do not believe the solution should be to change the bonus but rather increase the  on the bc and related t2 type ships the major issues i see with increasing this tanking bonus is that it could potentially have a negative impact on pve balance although to be completely honest its not like the brutix myrmidon or astarte are kings of pve atm
i didnt read all four pages i was replying to the op who asked for an extra slot and a bunch of cpu for a ship thats already pretty awesome same with the absolution im fine with giving the nighthawk some pg and i agree that active tank bonuses need to be buffed probably to 10level on all ships that have them giving the astarte room for a gang link is probably too much but at least within the bounds of reason but that isnt what the op asked for he asked for an eighth neutron blaster on the astarte and an extra midlow slot on both the absolution and the sleipnir all of those suggestions are frankly ludicrous
yet another bump

lack of foresight by ccp especially considering the modular design philosophytech iii comes from wormhole space and most of the serious wormhole corps deploy those ships1ps pretty epic radio show
absolutely 100 supported i was living out of a pos in immensea last summer and we were able to swap subsystems using the fitting service at a ship maintenance array then so you can imagine my dismay when i tried to do the same at a tower in our current home only to find my tengu stuck in covert  interdiction null config without going to a station t3 strategic cruisers were meant to be flexible make them so again ccp

biological ships dont seem to fit in with the eve online universe to meit reminds me a bit of dark star one a space game in which you ships grows with upgrades found in alien relicsnot a bad premise for an entirely different game
it might be an interesting idea for another game but its not eve not supported
why not
as much as the idea of having your own biological ship that you can morph according to your needs amuses mei question what theym add to gameplay if they are implemented their roles will me simular to those of current t3 cruisers on the other hand they extremely remind me of rogue drones those are mecanisms gone wild either way although the idea absolutely is amusing it will be troublesome to implement and i would probsably whant the shader model updated and grafics given another facelift with the current grafics engine alive ships would look like ugly parodies after trinity two sure so conclusion idea 910 feasability 310if ccp ever thinks about making a new classlinefaction of ships which they will eventually at some point this should be veryvery high on priorities list i disagree untill recently i thought planetary interaction isn t eve i cannot see why ytou woul not have this as eve please explain how this conflicts with your vision of the game
jove have part biological part mechanical ships  i dont see a problem with bio ships as possably a lost civilizations tech somewhere in hard to reach wormhole space
there is a great deal part of the economy that deals with in the trading selling and building ships if you had a ship that got more powerful the older it was then you would have no need to ever sell that ship it leads to the idea of hurting the balance of the economy of eveperhaps it would be feasible in one respect if the ship only grows if you sacrificed your skill training time for itthe jove is not a playable race and i have heard no news that they will be anytime soonthe biggest issue is balance and hell if you like biological ships we might as well add the zerg to the eve universeidea still not supported

this is an outstanding idea a system such as this would greatly increase productivity and reduce the amount of frustration involved in dealing with production research and copy jobs it would improve security and reduce the amount of time wasted i greatly support this idea and truly hope ccp considers and includes it in a much needed industry enhancement for a future patch
god yes 
working with blueprints and blueprintcopies really needs some love from the developersthis looks like a good ideafull support from me
very nice
its an option not forced i have no problem with giving bridge owners the option of letting their blues fly through it freely
i apologize but im not exactly understanding the complaints here from what ive gathered people assume that1 you will be forced to purchase an authenticator if they are offered2 you will rely entirely on the authenticator and no longer rely on your password3 only noobs get hackedill address 1 first what part of optional additional level of security makes this seem required if you dont want it dont get itnow onto the second one 2 why would you rely only on an authenticator what would be the point the whole idea behind these devices is so that a hacker has to break through your password and the authenticator and i doubt if an authenticator is cracked that it will mean the end of eve considering that if you break the authenticator you still need the password to begin withand finally 3 noobs are not the only ones who get hacked careful players get hacked as well i dont care how good you think you are it doesnt overly matter there is always someone better out there who knows how to get around something youre unaware of and before you know it youve been hacked a virus doesnt only hang around in the bad part of town if that was the case then they would never get to the rich juicy targetsaddendum uh wouldnt it require their password to be hacked for their characters to be stripped bare how else would someone have access to their password if not for hacking the only way that situation would be possible is if someone literally told another person their password and that person logged in and stole their information
doh rena you have just proved you know very little about how hacks workin most mmos when the subject of accounts getting hacked rears its ugly head devs usually respond saying that the majority of accounts do not have their passwords hackedthat is why it is very difficult for them to replace any lost items because it is very difficult to prove you were actually hackedwhy because 9 times out of 10 key loggers have been installed on the users pc which means the hacker does not need to hack anythingit is the easiest and most efficient why to gain access to somebodies account so simple that a 12 year old could do itas to your first point if you dont want it dont use it everyone would still have to pay for ityou think that setting up a system like that is free of course it isnt there is a cost to be incurred most authentication devices cost anywhere from UFFFD20 to UFFFD80 pounds each depending on the manufacturer and quality of the deviceno user will pay that which means the developer will make a loss on each device then you have the cost of setting up the architecture are you going to pay for this there are only 2 mmos who use these tokens blizzard and square enix 2 massive companies who can afford to absorb the costs of implementing such a system and even then they charge 10 dollers per device when they are actually in stock that is
so essentially its just a means to avoid responsibility when someone gets hacked by a technicality its still malicious software used to steal account information which is just another way of hackingactually that isnt true at least how much it costs from activision blizzard an authentication device only costs 599 or 499 and if you download an app for your smartphone the cost is only 099regardless what youre forgetting is that there is a tradeoff while an authenticator may not outright prevent hacking from occurring if it prevents half of the current hacks that occur then ccp will be able to devote less manpower and time to handling hacked accounts you have to consider how much it costs right now to actually reimburse someone for what they lostand still youre assuming that only foolish people can get hacked again i firmly disagree with this and would dare to say it shows how little you understand about how the internet works despite having the best antivirus software to date and all the security you can offer to protect yourself youre still nowhere near being completely safe even if you only visit eveonlinecom theres still a chance that something malicious can be installed even surfing google it can occur there is no 100 guarantee to avoid ever being infected otherwise we wouldnt need antivirus software
no its not a means of avoiding responsibility by the developers part when somebody gets hackedlet me put it this way if all developers said if you get hacked we will restore your account including all items in game money etc how would they know if you were truly hacked after all your password was not changed they would just have to take your word that somebody acquired your password and they sold off your times and then transferred your in game money to another accountcan image how many claims would suddenly appear from people claiming they have been hackedto stop this the developer would then have to dedicate resource to investigate every claim and even then it would be nearly impossible to prove it either wayin regards to costs are you deliberately misunderstanding meblizzard is charging 6 for the tokens this sounds like they are providing these at cost my bad the price had changed this is for the actual token itself there are other costs to blizzard too they need to maintain software on the backend that works with the keys they also need to deal with support costs as users break the keys and lose them or are just too stupid to figure out how they worki have personally dealt with rsa securid as part of my job as many defence companies use thenthe standard price guide isfor a 3 year period for 10000 users the solution price is  1110900 with a peruser price per year cost of  11109now of course these prices are negotiable one defence company who employees over 120000 staff world wide who use rsa securid pay a peruser price per year of 8913 over a 3 year periodhowever that is still a major hit for a small company blizzard is a multi million dollar company and can easily absorb these costsccp is no way anywhere near the size of blizzard ccp do not make anywhere the revenue that blizzard do do you think that ccp can incur these costs without passing them to their customeryou have to look at the bigger pictureof course a careful user can still download something that has a virustrojan attached however your point about there is no 100 guarantee to avoid ever being infected otherwise we wouldnt need antivirus software is simply ridiculous why do you think i keep stressing the point in having up to date anti virusmalware and spyware software installed on your machineits about having the combination of these software being careful about where you visit on the web and what you download and making sure you use a strong password which is changed regularly will stop you from being hackedi am not prepared to pay extra or suffer reduce contentupdatesbug fixes because ccp has to divert resource away from the actual game because some people cant help downloading everything application they can find to try or buy isk from gold sellers to try and cheat the system
its become clear to me now that were both of differing opinions and neither side is going to concede to the other so it would be easiest to just stop the argument hereall ill say is that i still disagree with you and would appreciate a second layer of protection for my account and feel many other people would as well theres just no reason for this to become a war of opinions when all it is is a proposal
good ideai support thiswe need something simple without extra costs
i would love to have one of these for my eve account and would be willing to pay around say 1015 for onesupported
if bagehi supports it you all should
seems reasonable
for those who are for this idea what youre really wishing for is a standalone eve game to play off your computers hard drive where anything and everything around you is not human and can be controlled by difficulty levels and whatnot if thats what you want there are plenty of other environments out there which offer you that controlwhen one purchases an eve account that purchase should be made with the realization that youre buying into the eve environment and all it can entail right you did your homework before committing right it seems that many people come in with the expectation that theyll exist in their own bubble and any external humanhuman interaction will be made on their own terms when that expectation is shattered we get rl emo threads like this oneso to sum that up you bought into eve thus you should have been aware of what can happen once you do so if you werent then thats no one elses fault but your own you are not a ship passing in the night and no one else is either eve is what it is and if thats orthogonal to what you desire then perhaps youre playing for the wrong reasons

this is not a feature request but a bug report fix neededand to think that i spent hours the other day thinking about how the guns should be placed to leave no blind spots
i propose the following to be considered as an added aspect to bounty huntingproblem bounties on players are difficult to track down players are not given the latest intelligence on where they can look for their targeted bountiesproposal whenever a player of a ranking bounty level top 100s comes within the facility of any npc installation or character it updates their bounty information to include last spotted locationcon time to implement into game id view a features such as this as back burner to whats going on in ccp with eve and the future release of dust 514defense of proposal this can greatly improve the profession of bounty hunting by providing up to date intelligence on wanted menwomenconclusion if you leave a trail of blood and money people will talk this should be an aspect of bounty hunting that can act as a deterrent to those bent on a life of pirating it allows corporationalliance affected by pirating to take more direct courses of action

it seems that certain people like to make threads bolded in all caps in which they take a bit of grief over their proposal and then immediately demand a lock on that thread i propose that if this happens three times your posting privileges to this forum be removed it doesnt seem to make a lot of sense to propose something and then refuse to engage in a debate about it amirite that way we can concentrate on those threads made by people who actually come up with positive and necessary changes for the gamelike nerfing badgers

eve online has a distinct art style that i happen to like allowing people to paint their ships any color other than from a very restricted set that wouldnt even be worth it would completely ruin the awesomeness of said art style i dont want to see people flying around in hot pink battleships and bright yellow carriersalso this thread again
no counterproposal we know eve has a set of predefined skins for its ships based on npc corporatefaction affiliation recent previews of the awesome new scorpion model have shown us thesemy suggestion not really a proposal since im not really that bothered by most of the colourschemes if my ships would be  allow players to select from the available corporation skins of the racial ship type ie a blackbird could be issued to a player in civilian ishukone fleet laidai protection service or kaalakiota corporate colours a thorax could be produced in creodron duvolle labs or roden shipyards paint jobs and so on however i remain fairly meh on the whole business of changing the look of your internet spaceship how long until every caldari pilot chooses to fly all their ships in kaalakiota blacknred still itd be nice to get rid of those horrible pointless camo paint schemes wouldnt it
i always like a little customization however paint jobs is going a little far like a space single player eve rip off ive spotted on steam the other day total paint jobs makes a ship look ridiculousi would like the idea of tagging a ship with a logo similar to the options set out for customizing corp and alliance logosthe only downside is that im not really concerned with checking out the tats of another ship in reality the game play doesnt really allow for a close inspection of hull artoverall id say time to improve the game could be spent elsewhereunsupported
everyone who ever participated in a large battle has seen it everyone who i have asked hates it yes ladies and gentelment it is the sensor booster and eccm effect the main problem is that the effect is very long range it covers large volume and so when you have a fleet it stacks up as a result fleet slook realy ungly it breaks immersion increases lag and spoils screenshots because instead of seeing lasers and ships exploding you see a blured blob of light my proposal add an option to disable remote self effects whyle seing enemy turrets firing and enemy shield oosters might be important sensor boosters are clearly not vital esfeshially when you have about 150 ships on the field you do not really care if someone has a sensor booster so i would like an option to turn off remote self effects that is a sensor booster armor repping and eccm effect on anyone except me on the other hand firing explosion and energy neutrolisers effects would still show up what also needs to be done is redesigning the sensor booster and eccm effect to consume smaller volume of space and to be more local much like armor repping effect was redun maybe it should look the way remote sensor boosters do or blue grow arouund ship but it has to be much more compact so it does not stack up images illustrating screenshot spoiuled by a sensor boosting effect this si a relatively small gang without too many sensor boosters so effect is not that bad here in many cases it is much worseplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswith the effectplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswithout the effect the option to disable sensor boosters and other effects like eccm should not requre too much development time and is going to make life easier for everyone who participates in large fleet battles
i never did understand why a relatively insignificant module had to have such a massive visual effect so you have a sensor booster runningwhy does that need such a huge light show tone it down
you can disable effects already esc  display  graphics  effects  effectsvoila the sensor booster effects are gone
i dont have problems with all the effects i still whant to see where my enemy is firing that is very important in combat i do not however wish to see if my enemy is sensor boosting or nit in its current implementation the effect is extremely disturbing as you can see from the screenshots above i would like to be able to disable all remote self effect that means all effects that only attack the ship that carrier them that is armor hardeners reppers shield boosters sensor boosters tracking computers they are not important and in fleet combat cause visual polution i whant to have a seperate button to disable them as for sensor boosters the effect needs to be redesigned as in its current implementation it1 makes no sence2 breaks immersion3 is disturbing4 progressively becomes stronger in large fleets up to the point where you can barely see ships and lasers and only see one blob of light5 looks uglyi would really like to be able to disable every effect seperately but disabling remote selfeffects would do
i support this only if this is true i really like the effects and dont see anything immersion breaking or annoying in your screen shotsliang
that is because this is a small gang and not everyone was sensor boosting unfortunately i dont have a better screenshot at the moment i recently reinstalled my system when you have 50 battleships all sensor boosting and with eccms it gets horrible
they were added with the reintroduction of special events also some of them have factionfit items though a killmail showing one dropping them has not been produced yetexample killmail of an npc that dropped t2 loot
could it be it was actually a player controlled character
whether a ccp employee volunteer flew them or whether some sort of eve npc ai flew them is irrelevant theyre not real player characters and they provide a faucet of nonplayer manufactured t2 goods into the game
supported i have been playing a couple of years now and i think i have seen one eaf flown in space and when it was my fc said wtf are you doing in that to the guy flying it and made him change ships they sure need somehting
spported when your better off flying the tec 1 version of a ship it needs some serious looking at the only ship tha might be worth the trouble would be the kitsune but even that is horribly outclassed by ships that cost a fraction of the price
absolutely agree especially keres and kitsune
agreed
i dont see this proposal as being a bad idea actually obviosuly keep the moon mining ores to the basic ores you can already mine in high secthis would give newer players the chance to try out moon mining in a relatively safe environment to learn whats needed to setup moon mining ops in places like losec and oowhile we are at it though id like to be able to moon mine inside of whs too
low sec is a relatively safe environment you should go check it out some time not in a hauler that takes 20 seconds to align with everything you own inside
what monopoly
lulz
i cant keep a straight face
sorry but any balancing opinions arent worth diskspace they are using when they come from a person losing dramiel to a bagder
im not supporting anything until the badger is nerfed its wtfpwning people all across new eden and nothing can be done
ibtl
noooo dont go emo tjalsoshouldnt your posting privileges be taken away if you demand a lock on every thread you make shortly after you make it
nah eve being a harsh and cruel world i think we could use a good laugh every now and then and emo imho you look kinda daft ranting and raving all over the place whenever you got pwned yesterday you got your ass handed to you by a badger and now you get pwnfuzzled by a drake isnt it time you started actually learning how to play the game instead of asking for a nerf for each ship that owns youat the very least if youre posting about the horrors which befell you only to ask for a lock soon thereafter then maybe its time you should consider not writing the post in the first place granted it robs the community of some comic relief but it saves you a lot of embarrassment
sticky his lock this thread so that his name will not be lost
im sure a battle badger can kill a drake right emo tj

how is getting your fleet to align to something hard to do if they dont align then they wernt listening and get left behind same goes for people who jump when told to hold on a gate
no people should be capable to aligning by themselves when in a fleet and this idea is about as good as if calling targets ingame would automaticly make you lock if your gang cant align properly then the last thing it needs is having it done by someone else
later they could add in a log in everybody button for fcs also you only need to pay the subs pfleets should be nerfed not boosted especially large ones
wouldnt it make more sense to change what the fleet warp command does and have it wait for slowest alignerthat way it achieves the goal and can be hazardous to use without the manual ie individual aligning of ships  lost count of how many ships i have lost and seen lost because it was the fattest of the lotps please add the ability for the individual to disallow fleet warps completely let it default to allowed but dammit the context menu is a poor and cluttered abomination and cause of much grief

i would like to hope that most people would realise that my counterproposal was a satire on how hideously onesided the ops proposal wasthe answer to the problem of nonconsensual pvp in empire is of course tradable killrights integrated with a properly working bounty system a playerbased solution to a playerbased problemalso dont autopilot dont put valuable cargo in a 500k isk untanked hauler dont go via the normal routes use blockade runners etc etc etc
supported just to see griefer tears
you know as a staunch carebear i would actually support this provided concord really came to rescue me instead of just chasing you off and let your buddies pick up the lootbut in all earnesty i could really envision a scenario where you can buy security packages from cooncord like d cheapest for pretty much what you get now and a like 100mil a month or so for total protection or whatever the numbers would be see the problem with mercs is that they are notoriously unreliable you pay them and they turn on you after all because your enemy pays them double but buying reliable security packages from concord that i would seriously consider
thanks all for you replies i just opened three new web pages for three different sites and each one had an eve online ad crazyand no i wont be clicking on each one
wts adblock plus
this made my day thank you tjquote of the decade from the convo
so you fail against a badger and you want it nerfed why not nerf all ships that shoot guns sos that they shoot lovley beams of fluffy goodness eh
a this thread sure is a fine whine it just keeps getting better with age
sticky this thread
awesome thread is awesome

i support thiswith this i can get an exotic dancer then put a bounty on a mining hulk and watch it get blown to bits for 1m isk while i enjoy my dancer
if anyones opposed to merc corps its u for suggesting what would essentially replace them at least untilwhich still boils down to i want to afk grief second why the hell would u now prohibit the npcs from belts and deadspace guess u still cant touch that macro miner or anyone else while theyre operating normally which goes back to griefing autopiloters making shuttles and t1 cheap cargo hauling useless its just universal riskless aggravation that accomplishes nothing but just that great idea u got there
i would love to have these changes if only on the test server to test them out
all very solid suggestions keep them coming liang
also add a controlrange bonus for dreads so their sentries can actually be used against the things they are trying to shootedit for support
ok i have noticed that the deimos is paper thin even with a plate onso i would suggest to swap some bonuses and add one for resist so it stops dying so fastalso as it is close range and the capacitor penalty decrease for mwd doesnt do that much i would swap it for a activation cost decrease and changing the falloff bonus into a tracking one so it can actually apply the damage it can dogallente cruiser skill bonus 10 bonus to microwarpdrive capacitor use per 10 medium hybrid turret tracking speed per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus 10 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level 5 bonus to armor resists per levelfurther on i would decease the strangely high signature radius of 160mm which is the highest on all hacs if not on all cruiser hulls down to its t1 hulls 140mmi would also up the scan resolution to maybe 300mm so it also gets some use in gate camps in exchange the targeting range should drop to 50km because it is supposed to use blasters close range anywaythe 6th high slot doesnt do much adding another gun mount would make it overpowered and it wouldnt even work because the model only has 5 gun mounts i wouldnt want to scrap it though cause it leaves space for some creativity it is true that the deimos is kind of a brick especially when plated and using mwd so i think it wouldnt be a bad idea to take the mass down to 10kt and the inertia to 0550 to make it a bit more agile and accelerate faster with the mwd
seriously l4s will never be removed from high sec not only are they a major part of the economic engine in game but theres too many people who  for whatever reason  enjoy them and would likely leave eve entirely if they were all removed have any of the candidates advocated this
i dont think many would even seriously consider it for the exact reasons you mentioned
ah then i guess i was dreaming this here
i do have bigger plans for fw but the current priority is fixing the bugs and imbalances after that id like to see fw properly finished instead of being the halfbaked expansion it is nowironically the current npc presence in the fw plexes hinders pvp if you play for amarr or gallente you even have to come with specific pve ships to deal with them properly actual pvp is not encouraged in fw as all objectives and profitable activities are pve based plexing and missionrunning adding lp for kills was a first step in the right direction but unfortunately people often do not get lp even though they participated in the killccp already agreed that the fw plex mechanic is flawed and that people often do not find eachother for combat increasing the timer length obviously wont work either and only makes it more boring i personally see a role for dynamic objectives which are broadcast to the whole militiasuch as a convoy will go from x to y clear the way and make sure that as many ships survive with the opposing side receiving a the enemy is transporting military equipment it was last seen in x search and destroyor were setting up a listening post in system x defend us for 30 minutes so we can establish the defenses and the other side receiving a the enemy is building a base in system x you have a 30 minute window to destroy it before the defenses are activatedthe participants will then receive victory points a standing boost and loyalty points based on their successratewith several of these going on at once with mission objectives requiring specific kinds of ships players will always find something to do
and yet again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of evewhat triggers these events timers or number of players currently active in fw how do you detect that what if a convoydefence event starts and there are no enemies to attack it how do you prevent players from blobbing this and grinding ityou dont understand eve these things you propose are too script driven and do not belong at all in te eve experience
i first didnt care about the csm election then read some stuff voted for a candidate donenow after reading the evetribune article i made some research of my own forum your homepage your curriculum vitae take care and came to the conclusion that in my impression you are not trustworthy and i would personally find it highly alienating if ccp would allow you into the csm why because of 1 your selfpresentation and the way you are treating your critics which i think are doing their best to stay as constructive as possible in their effort in deconstructing what i perceive as your bubble why do i think that because the less rational the critique towards you is conducted the easier it is for you to dismiss it which would not be in their favor2 because of the resume issue you stated your time on the csm as employment by ccpi will start with my critique towards you at point 2 and quote from a post of mine on shc to detail my point of viewyou can read the original discussion and my post here
i will further state in my email to ccp that i would not condone the fact that you would generate quite high expenses flights and lodgings are not cheap at all for ccp which could be put towards things like some more workhours of actual ccp staff which i am sure have more expertise than you who does not and never did work for ccp and displays a disdain against one of the coreprinciples of eve with which ccp also advertises namely a ruthless harsh unforgiving space crazyness in lobbying against you are essentially lobbying against the main reason i subscribed to this game at the same time you are also essentially declaring yourself that you do not want to occupy yourself with this core principle of the game since i think that when judging a matter personal experience comes first because while not having to fully understand every issue god forbid you have to have at least some understanding in dismissing this core principle as immoral you are not only passing moral judgement but you are also not giving the impression that you would fight for every issue everyone brought to you equally  but you advertise with that exact statementexample from your first post it is interesting to see that you are following a very clear streamlined nlpesque approach in communication but when it comes to an issue you personally want to see changed you suddenly slip into the classic method of ridiculing the opposing fractions sentimentsno i do not believe you that you can be impartial and treat people who dont agree with your views with enough respecti will also state in my email that i would like to know what one csm delegate costs the companyyear and that i would absolutely not condone the fact that you in my perceived dishonesty would consume even a cent of what i pay for this gameto conclude i provided you with a free bump more attention and yet another opinion you might brush of as troll however with your actions you also provided one the other candidates with now both of my votes
i decided to read the cv and the attached covering letter and i cant see why people believe she was being misleading by listing her volunteer work for ccp in her employment historyim from britain and it is commonplace for volunteer work to be listed in your employment history the uk governments employment site even suggests that you do so
if you read my post again you will find out that i state that she would be stupid not to put it in her cv and that i dont argue against putting it in there per se or her trying to look as good as possible on her resume on the contrary  its perfectly fine of course and we all do ityou will also see that i dont claim that she tried to make the impression of having worked as a devi however have also learnedbeen taught to always separate  working for a wage and  volunteer work or at least clearly designate it as such this she did not also not in the accompanying letter a clean honest cv would say worked as a playerelected volunteer or similar six words done and i would have never typed thisi am arguing semantics here ofc still definition of employment  primarily working for a wage employer  the dudedudettecompany that pays you a wage the main characteristic of her employment at ccpcsm was that she herself decided to run and got next to several other people elected by a fraction of the players not by ccp because of her skills or talents this isnt made clearinstead she chose to underline that she was part of the official council and worked closely with developers after being flown to iceland but leaves it open if she was appointed by ccp themselves ornotalso she states playerdeveloper communication game design from the unique perspective of a game designer i found that i could have a positive impact which is reflected by the changes implemented in the game p4 of her cv professional attitudei am heavily repeating my 2cents so im stopping here i think my point is clear and this is more nerdposting at once than ive done in a year or two
i would agree with you it would be clearer to state volunteer yes i agree each country has their definition of what employment is in legal terms there is no point discussing that here since eva has not claimed to be an employee of ccpyes i agree the manner in which she was elected wasnt made clear she stuck to the positive with the fact that she was elected
really this whole thing about the cv is a storm in a teacupthe real issue is her repeatedly stated contempt for the players contempt for the game and contempt for ccp and the glaring conflict of interest of working for another game company which has a spacebased mmo that conflict alone should be enough to disqualify her tbh
excellent my kind of candidate i dont want alliance puppets sucking up to ccp i want them to tell them when they  up furthermore i  about the game all the time and so does nearly every other capsuleer i know contempt for the players hell i have a load of players i hold in contempt a lot of them troll these very forums so thank you for further convincing me my votes are well spent with ankhbear o
i wasnt going bother voting on the csm but ank just got my four votes i dont agree with her position on some issues but i do agree on her main stated focus of pressuring ccp on the finishing and polishing aspect of expansions which are indeed being rushed out of the door in an increasing state of halfbakedness and brokeness and left pretty much as such while ccp jumps into the next expansion i believe this is one of the biggest problems eve has at the momentbut aside from all that shes ended up getting my votes because of the spine character and determination shes demonstrated in the face of this preposterous character assassination campaign towards her emoraging volumes of tears  now even on eve tribute  at nitpicks over the precise words she use or didnt use on her personal cv you are all coming across as a bunch of pathetic little whiny girls fck off
mmmm hmmm for those who are curious what the tribune actually pointed out was a history of bad judgment on anks part showing that she simply does not understand the game respect how ccp created it and that she has a selfrighteous sense of superiority that leads her to talk nonsense about how horrible people are who play the game as ccp intended all of this was done by the way either with quotes that she wrote in her own words using her own character the vast majority or in a few cases with chat logs which have been verified by the people who were in themsaw them going on but denied by ank we also pointed out that despite her claims on her cv she was never employed by ccp in fact ccp explicitly says that csm delegates are not employed by ccp and that she did not actually participate in game design unless everybody on the forums who suggests and idea to ccp is a game designer just goes to possible motives for wanting to be on the csmsurely though youre not an alt or someone who already supported ank and your wild misrepresentation of the content of the tribunes article is just a coincidence
nice theory you got there though it lacks bite would you like a copy of my cv so you can add whatever nitpicks you manage to find i can also furnish you with private game logs and posting history on unrelated forums im confident youll find there plenty of ammunition and things to get offended over and whine about to your hearts content
which you disprove by doing exactly what i accused you of deliberately misrepresenting the facts of anks own statements in her own words while just coincidentally parroting anks own denials of why her own statements matter i particularly like that bit its anks sure i said crazy stuff that shows i dont know how eve works and im hostile to those who play the game as ccp intended but you can find bad stuff about anybody if you look hard enough im sure the fact that youre using anks own argument about why ank doesnt have to justify let alone address her own comments is just a coincidence i mean after all you told us that you had no affiliation or support for her before right now what luckjust a coincidence im sure and just as im sure of that im sure that you accidentally missed everything of substance in order to dishonestly oops i mean accidentally state that what were talking about are mere nitpicks and stuff on unrelated forums unrelated forums like ya know the forum were posting on now which is where most of her quotes came from here ill remind you feel free to respond to the facts any time nowbut hey elect me to the csm i hate pvpers and more padding on my resume would be good maybe next time ill say that i didnt just work for ccp doing game design but since i fielded questions from people ill say i was employed as human resources management oh oh oh since providing suggestions to ccp is game design and people put those suggestions to me before i forward them on maybe i was employed by ccp for lead game design yeah may be a valid campaign pitch and were just nitpicking it
i have to say i see considerable similarities between ankhs supporters and those of sarah palin no im being perfectly serious take a look at this article on palinism by julian sanchez which is not too long and is worth reading in full and then compare what sanchez sees in the tea parties to whats going on here and in the other threads related to the tribunes editorial boths supporters seem to be fueled by what sanchez identifies as ressentimentthus the more people demonstrate how thoroughly terrible a candidate ankh is the more it seems that her supporters bristling at the contempt they imagine that pvp elites hold them in support her even though there are numerous other candidates far better qualified to represent their viewsjust saying
dariah stardweller is ankhbears btw
she did not claim to be employed by ccp
jezus you dont even have the fantasy to come up with different word choises
she listed csm under employmentnot say hobbies or volunteer work or other interests or anything other than employment i know that listing something under employment might just unreasonably be seen as employment but well just have to live with that mistaken impression eh ehof course ccp had her sign an agreement specifically saying that the csm was not employment but who are we going to believe csm when they say theyre not employing her or her when she says she was employed by ccp she also listed things as parts of her employment with ccp that she simply never did for ccp like game design ccp actually has a position called game designer its their dev position does making suggestions to ccp sound the same as that job description myself i just cant figure out any possible motive for someone in the games industry to want to hold a position that they think they can put on a resume and describe as being employed by ccp doing game design hrm care to hazard a guess
the biggest lulz will be if it turns out that piece you guys wrote on the eve tribune  along with all the trolling on these forums  horribly backfires and contrary to its stated it intentions ends up getting ank enough additional votes to get elected
then the joke sadly will not be so much on the tirbune as it will be on those who voted for her
so no then of course itll be a damn shame if ank gets elected and keeps an actually qualified person off the csm its hardly something to celebrate she doesnt understand 00s he doesnt understand lowsec she doesnt understand pvp she doesnt even really understand pve there are far better carebear candidates if one wanted to vote for one anyways and its not like ccp is going to advertise the thrill of mining or the awesomeness of mission running theres a reason that all of their ads are about combat and fleet fights someone who will at best not help that and at worst hurt that will damage eve as a game and as a brand cheering that on because you enjoy the thought of trolling for ank is kind of lame
oh wait you were seriously expecting me to waste my time answering your distorted opinionated crap and conspiracy theories
in a followon discussion to the low sec focus group mentioned a couple of posts ago my fellow csm5 candidate illectroculus defined had some interesting ideas for expanding the concept of production of criminal goods as a way of boosting low sec with unique content he wrote those ideas up in his blog keep in mind that illectros ideas are just that ideas not welldefined proposals thinking outside the box was highly encouraged during the the focus group as is further discussion personally i thought the ideas were intriguing and once tweaked for overall balance would fit neatly as components of an incrementallyimplemented criminal production supply chainim sharing the link here as a way of keeping all the focus group stuff together for easy access by those who are interested if you have questions for illectro about his ideas you should probably comment on his blog post or in his campaign thread

pitybump
wow the cool kid really is in desperate need to bump and pump his own thread daily right
go back to jerking off to ankh like a good little carebear
right thats a mature response from a mature candidate thats your style puny oneliners consisting of only one word like noooooooooooooooooooooo remeber that thread here great attitude from your side great csm effort no really oh and this time i am pretty sure you wont get a free ride to island from my subs moneyeditconsider that a free bump kewl kid everyone shall be made aware how you as a csm reacted to legit inquiries by paying customers on this board
your main doesnt happen to be natana does it because he started like this on the eveger board and got modslapped because he was being ed
unfortunatly not i adore her but that very thread made me aware of your premature attitude and if you insist i surely can quote some of the rubbish nonsense you said there you have your nose pretty high in the air if it comes down to the customers of evedo you prefer to take the discussion back to the free trip to island that you enjoyed off the subs money or do you want to discuss your behaviour on other boards kewl kid
youre obviously correct that im a stuck up elitist that has never helped anyone and has never done anything for this game or the community ill go outside now and throw myself under the next bus because youve made me realise how useless i amsee its not difficult to treat serious internet business with a lighthearted attitude something youll never be able to do
yourre not lighthearted in fact you are desperatly trying to get your votes together by bumping your own threads and spamming mails and channels and on top of that by trolling other csms threads and by denigrating those who dont agree with your small and personal view of evethats all fine but it is not adequate for a csm candidate in my book so no no free trip to island for you anymore from my subs money i really appreciate that you revealed your true nature in that very thread on this board thanks again and concider this comment again as a free bump you look like you need them
i literally laughed out loud at the massive overdose of irony generated in these few sentences you are absolutely clueless so it suits you quite well to vote for ankh
thanks again for proving my points you are not suited to candidate for a csm seat due to your prematurity and your lack of respect for the paying customers who do not share your point of view allways if it comes down to you disagreeing with someone or something you are only good for one of your silly oneliners containing some minor insult but you are not good for some constructive discussion on the topicso go ahead and continue to flame yourself out of your nomination the more the better as it only reveals to us your true nature
please quote stuff that shows howmuch i loathe the average eve player that is not one of those two sarcastic lines that you have recycled a dozen times here and on the eveger boards that are properly moderated contrary to the eveo ones
this candidate is beyond terrible and will not be getting my 5 votes the posting the ideas and mannerisms are all very substandard
there is still time to vote my fellow eve capsuleers if voted in i will pursue subject like better protection for mission runners along with balancing of ship classes also on my agenda is sovereignty and getting some level 5 agents into high seci am working on a new proposal that will make players that probe out mission runners have to have good standings with that agent they are running and have hacking skills along with certain new modules they have to fit in order to use the gatesthis is just a few of the many things my experience with this game i can bring to the table
emo will call for thread lock in 321

i too enjoy falling for hilariously obvious trolls
do you have a problem with ppl born outside of teh us let alone kenya do i smell racism therewell all csm farm votes more or less in the same manner you forgot to mention those pvporientated csm who really want level 4 mission removed from highsec empire and all pve with that
actually there are a number of carebear candidates out there and this is the only one tribune has run a negative article about
i totally hope she does this
same it would be hilarious id be up for donating to get a decent defence defense lawyer
i do apologise but under dutch law that is not correct an unpaid employee regardless of a format of 0 hour or ad hoc has a contract this is required by law to protect the employee a volunteer has an agreement the difference between these formats may often escape observation is very often mostly irrelevant to the person in question but constitutes quite a tangible difference to the employer since it is the employer which has to set aside good old monies for a range of legally required purposes insurance for one pension fund andsoforthkeep in mind the legal status of employee in the netherlands in fact in most countries of the eu something which does not apply to a volunteer status i dont particularly care for all the drama and i must admit i have seen my share of cvs with far stranger collusions in the range of a few dozen a year but please note the difference between these formatstechnically factually or even principally ankh should not have listed her activities as employment practically it is not uncommon to see people make mistakes like these and quite often it is found that even though the actions reside in the category of volunteer work they do form a base of experience sometimes even expertisewhether this was the case constituted relevance or the absence of that was up to her employer when validating the cv prior to engaging in contract this is irrelevant for the debate here
no matter what this ank characters flaws the tribune going out of its way to discredit her kinda made me cringe maybe im hoping a bit much from an ingame publication but seems like the editor saw some easy prey  decided to get in on some cheap actionpossibly the lure was too greati mean seriously how much of a threat is she even with outrageous ideasisnt there voting involved in csm  so like seriously since the ideas are not gonna get traction and ccp definitely wont get swayed with stuff like pvp is bad  why systematically tear her apartfound some easy prey and suddenly everyone is at their trolling best feeding off themselvesweak sauceto put it in context there have been many bad candidates before i even recon some of them still get back in despite that due to political backing efame based on the attendance records and actual contribution seems that a few others enjoy a free ride  that seems like quite the travestyi guess thats much tougher topic so no need for tribune to go out of its way to ruffle feathersmaybe if you really want to make some public service announcement the editor would consider something not so opportunistic  dont stoop to bashing someone who is already down
so even if her character flaws are obvious and proven by her own words expressing her own views posted on her own account it was wrong to point them out and represents some sort of extreme effort on our part seriously the victimology nonsense does nobody any good what we saw was a candidate manifestly unsuited for a position on the csm so we gathered the facts and wrote the piece you seem to agree with it if she was a strong candidate then we wouldnt have had easy prey now would we its fairly obvious actually we can have a csm with as many capable knowledgeable people as possible able to speak intelligently and constructively about all aspects of the game or we can have some of those folks and some others whose very presence has to be neutralized and who would do real damage to the game if they were able to implement their views unfettered by opposition when faced with the option between those who can contribute and those who can only hinder why would you argue that we should have someone who hinders the process because hey they can be outvoted anyways no to put it in context while there are candidates who arent great or who are even bad none approaches the level of ank which yet again is why shes unsuitable for the csm and why even you admit that shes easy prey
did i miss a patch notewhy would they move level 4s to lowsecon another note while all this is extremely interesting its not to my taste everyone has something in their past that the public can pull apart and torment them with andor expressed extremely stupid things and changed their mind about it laterall these comments and all the drahmas have the potential to significantly boost her ratings and chances of getting a full seat this is a game where people love tears and i hope for your sake that karma is looking the other way when people are selecting someone to vote for otherwise theres going to be lots of themalthough this may seem true on first glance i assure you it is not i for one am the ultimate carebear i dont even undock if i can help it its cold and lonely out there  most of the candidates running for csm are intellegent enough to realise the connections and neccesity of having hisec activites available and youd probably find that most of them have carebear activities on the side if csm4 is anything to go by theyre not above researching something outside the scope of their agenda and experience so that theyre able to make a wellthought vote well most of them anyway i believe it started off constructively atleast but discrediting someones ideas i have no problem with  especially if theyre completely misinformed or ignorant but person attacks are like you say and a complete waste of texttamber
its an obvious joke read up on the original born in kenya debate herethere are very very few people in eve rich enough to be pvp only players unless you think ratting or missioning with an alt is pvp
no use arguing with him the guy has as much humour as the pieces of roten shark they feed you in iceland
ive done a lot of internet arguing a surprisingly large amount was done with the knowledge that i didnt have a hope of changing the mind of the person i was directly arguing against its done for the benefit of onlookers who usually arent nearly as pigheaded as the people who are actually willing to spend their time yelling at people theyll never meet about issues that dont really matter
this thread seems to have gone off onto a few tangentsits easy to see why practicalminded players are already attracted to you the specifics of your theories and examples of your problem solving methods do also give me confidence in you but not for the position of csmthe csm from my understanding is intended to bridge a gap between the players and the devs by consolidating the masses into one hopefully coherent voice i have no doubt in my mind that you could talk shop with the boys in charge however the real work of the csm you must admit is communicating with the fickle selfcentered trolling and often confused player base on order to refine good sense from them its political we vote after alli believe you could be quite valuable to us i encourage you to seek a position in which you may advise the csm and hopefully influence that person with some of your excellent perspective with no malice whatsoever i hope for you and for the rest of us that you do not find you are illsuited to the role only after you have assumed it
i would suggest you reread the thread with this thought in mind how ive handled this thread is pretty indicative of my style of managing discussions consider its signaltonoise ratio vs some of the other threadsi think it demonstrates pretty well the manner in which i would work with players to help them refine their ideas into workable proposals that have a shot at serious considerationas for my ability to deal with a rambunctious player base you should consider that ive been dealing with rabid anime and film otaku for 20 years while running animeigosomehow i get the impression that being an advisor to an advisory panel is a little too meta for my tastesi must admit however that ive rarely been told im completely unqualified in such a nice a way im sure all your exgirlfriends still like you
do you have any opinion on api features ie privacyintel gathering versus convenience that is would you support standings information being api verifiable that is corps or alliances could pull all their standings from the api and one could make cool social networking graphs from italso what is your position on killmails a few years ago killmails were not complete and usually not ccpverifiable via the api and many people who played eve did not care about killmails today checking killboard activity is one of the best intelligence gathering tools since it shows a complete setup and all involved parties do you wish to see a return to those days where a large population of eve did not care about looking bad on someones killboard and killmails did not contain so much information
i am returning for a more active role in eve after more than a year hiatus the war tactic i described was used against my alliance at one time good to know that it has been changedi agree with the risk to rewards of lowsec space however i disagree with trying to push highsec players into lowsec a carrot will work but a stick will just make people quitthis does not address one main issue of missions in lowsec the interruption of missions by pirates do you have any ideas of how to stop pirates engaging mission runners during a mission when i run a mission my ship setup is very different from pvp setup also pirates tend to scan down the mission runners after the rats have started their engagement i know eve is not about fair fighting a lot of the time but mission runners are seeking predictable situations again i agree with making lowsec more profitable but making reducing highsec is not the way to go remember the carrotso let me ask this question why are rare ores and the level 6 wormholes only found in 00 with dominion sovereignty holders can increase the frequency and quality of both wormholes and mining sites move some of these 00 only things into lowsec to allow nonsovereignty holding corps have access to themthanks

what are your plans into changing or proposing changes to missioning in high sec what else you think can be added to low sec to make it more desireable for players to get into
my plans on the mission running in highsec are in this thread already i have stated and will do this again if needed they generate too much revenue too much because of nonexistent risk if there would be more risk involved i would not be advocating removal of level 4 agents from highsec but as i see now the removal would be most straightforward and most efficient step to balance highsec mission running with other activities out there also there is one flaw in level 5 missions which allows them to be ran in high security space it looks like its overlooked error in the game design which should be fixed asap as for the second question i already wrote that one of possible changes would be to move all booster production to lowsec make lowsec into junkie heaven  it would be fun and profitable also some of the changes proposed in the assembly halls outlaw thread could work too for example introduction of lowsec border between some empire factions would be logical and should boost traffic through lowsec also i agree that lowsec could profit from some pirate faction agents there not much like level 1 no more than 2 these agents should help people who want to raise their pirate faction standings and give quite good rewards even at such low levels as i wrote in this topic already im tired to see such promising game are as lowsec to be so barren as it is now so ill try to improve it to be profitable maybe not as profitable as 00 can be but definitely more profitable than highsec also lowsec should have something unique for itself im not completely sure at this point what it should be i put here some ideas already but im also open to suggestions faction wars are nice but their take place only in few places while other lowsec systems look like wasteland deprived of any sign of life im traveling through lowsec quite often and only life i see there i see in the systems which border high security space its kind of sad i think such great potential is wasted
the eve tribune interview is now up thanks to zarch for getting that out
for someone who is normally apolitical in the eve community i have to admit that what ive read seen and heard both from and about teadaze has impressed me enough to actually cast a vote this time i hope others feel the same way about putting people in office who will actually work for the community as a whole and not for their own little cliques
both elven and vuk are totally worth the votes theyve been a large reason that ive actually kept playing the game up to this point and are some of the most knowledgeable guys about the game i hope getting both of them back into csm will help push some stuff forward in 00 and im confident theyll continue to push issues on the things that are truly breaking the game at the moment i hope others feel the same way and will vote as welledited for terrible spelling
1 vote from i
hope you make it in bud if i had more than 2 accounts youd have gotten one of my votes p
most matched tamber 70
i see that ccp delayed the patch to work on it further looks like the csm process works well with all the people campaigning on this issue im not going to say that was the sole reason but ill bet they noticed that people want things in a more finished state
i would also be interested to know how you feel on this matter i am uncertain there can be any real deterrent against all the different forms that scamming can take and believe its a wasted sentiment if you have an idea that would truly keep a social environment like eve honest however id be very impressed
yeah that was a missclick i was in a hurry to get to work busy weekend for me when they sent out the vote matching notice i only logged into eve to check and see if i had been contacted filled out the questionnaire and left for work after a quick look over my responses i did not see the incorrect choice there it should have been disagreei do not like to see people scamming but i do accept that it is something that can be done in game that said scamming suffers from the worst riskreward ratio meaning that the scammer gets all the reward and no risk i do not have any ideas on how to change that situation thoughif you have any other questions let me know
straight scamming is low risk but it also has a very low success rate so one could argue that one is basically risking time but glad that you dont actually want to nerf it
friendly bump for someone who has my vote well three votes acutally with alt accounts also a big thankyou for taking the time and trouble to help newer players get to grips with one of the best aspects of the game your guides are enormously helpful and to anyone wading through the mass of promises offered by the csm candidates and wondering who to vote for i believe that ahinas website proves that she will put her money where her mouth isgood luck
true but everyone risks time every time they are in gameflippington bigboy thanks for your comments and votes
let me go find my thread from csm 1id still prefer a modified borda count which i think extreme just suggested in a thread on here again but would be satisfied with a stv system the reason for that preference is the historically low voter turnout for csm elections  the droop quota for csm 4 would have been 2115 votes not a single candidate got that amount the highest was 1553 so basically not a single candidate would have a seat until they go through multiple rounds of transferscountbacks so stv could work i just think the borda would be more representative of a 9 person council as it places more weight on the secondary votes than the single vote system basically you are voting for a council to represent you not just a single personthat said pretty much anything is better than the current voting systemin the meantime since ccp wants it to remain as a single vote system the least they could do is change it so you can actually change who you voted for up until the deadline instead of having it locked in
i read the wiki and i think that stv system is way too complex and impossible for people to understandthe only ones that possibly understand how stv vote works are people from the uk usa ireland and aussiei have no idea what a boorda count is i tried to google it but no infoi would say keep it simple and for everyone to understand like the eurovision songcontestofcourse the eurovision songcontest is no longer what it used to be due to the baltic votesi think the setup and ruleslimitations added as discussed and answered will do the trick

i read a few posts so i apologize ahead of time if im repeating anything anyone has said ive noticed people saying that if the damage is increased then gallente would be too powerful upclose however we all do agree that something has to be done with the damage i mean even with void which only does the 25 range instead of the antimatteralso faction 60 the maximum range even with falloff is between 12km and 16kmi would much love for them to increase the damage output outright but then we run into everyone just switching to close gank gallente if they lower everyones resists to meet the damage output then that doesnt only help gallente out it helps everyone which in turn gets us back to square one i would suggest of a complete system overhall which would take way too long and too many resources but it would be nice to have a completely different combat system where you have points to put in whichever resists you want and whatnot but thats for another post of maybe even for eve ii who knowsmy suggestion to have gallente ships naturally resisted to the speed reduction of webs and scrams while increasing their tracking agility and normal speed valuesthis would fix both problems and be pretty simple but i have a feeling everyone is going to say its overpowered with the mobility amarr lasers and minmater guns would be at a disadvantage because of the movement causing their already low tracking to hurt them in the long run which would in the end require more pilot capability to even out the transversal when attacking the other condition would be the webs and scrams it doesnt help if we cant get in range if gallente ships were resisted to webs and scrams speed reductions to a degree then it would help with the range problems gallente speed value can only be reduced to 80 of their total speed value so if the top speed with an ab is 500 then speed doesnt drop below 400 regardless of the amounts of webs on the ship same thing with scrams speed can not be lower then 80 of total speed value if the tracking speed values and agility were to increase to meet these needs then i think the whole issue is solvedi know this all sounds a little crazy more then welcome to omit or change things but i think it leads to a good direction this all plays more into pilot capabilities while giving us the tools we need to make up for the horrible damage output we stay out of low transversal lowering the damage output on us while keeping our damage output pretty much the same this way everyone damage overall is the same only thing that changes is the mechanicwell thats it for now i hope i made some sense i post when im dead tired and i always pray it sounds the way i planned it too
even with 20 raw dps increase i dont see a real point in it even before qr blaster ships where at least 10 dps short to overcome similar flownfitted ships by pure dps advantage at her rangeehpdps wise the damage is also split into drones and guns so it is mostly a 1216 boost for most shipsstrong point of most good solo ships is not the dps it is the flexibility and the ability to leave next to no weaknesses in the offensive and defensive capability to prevent other ships from using them against yourability to deal with small stuff some kind of gtfo ability ability to preventcounter kitting not losing all abilitys if you get neuted ability to dedicate rangewhile blaster ships where not capable of doing some of this things they still had solid mix of it enough to make them work that changed with qrim quite happy with using ak ships as damage dealers atm dps difference is not this big after putting selectable damage types in and using the bigger range window  a bit more speedagility would be nice but you will still lose the fights you would lose today so no big change what exactly do you think is nuts high dps also you still end up with a limited damage dealer for smaller gangs instead of a flexible solo ship we already got akslasers for this meh
do you even do a cursory glance at what happens to the ships with you make your proposed changes this is a serious question
i think we need to think of something a little more interesting than just fiddling with the rangedamage of railsi still think a penetration mechanic can be balanced and give rails that second tactical advantagebeams have raw damage dps and exceptional trackingarties have selectable damage types yes close range but meh and extreme alpharails only have range and then that range advantage is only seen on selected caldari ships
it has been proven that damage penetration cannot be balanced in any conventional sense of the word you might be able to make it such that it wont be ridiculously overpowered in the extreme situations but in doing so youll make rails utterly useless in the average case ill take my regular joe damage boost pleasealso i encourage you to take a look at the optimal of a sniper mega vs optimal of a tempest and dont give me none of that but you operate in falloff crapliang
why shouldnt they be hacs on steroids these are the field command ships right  t2 insanely expensive there has to be something justifying the cost and usage over a standard bc
t2 battlecruisers are the meat and potatoes of this game in terms of bang for the buckdo not f ing f with my hurricane and harbinger damn you
because command ships arent meant to be hac on steroids is the comment some ccp dev did in a blog a lot of years ago when explaining why they arent stronger than what they are an no i dont want to sped hours searching the correct reference in ccp idea command ship have a role in being command ships and so they should have the capacity to use efficiently command modules not in being bigger hacs that dont mean to that command ships cant be made better simply that it should not revolve only around making them simply better killing machines but instead making them capable of doing the role they are intended for
then they should not have introduced field command ships because fleet command ships cover that role completelythey introduced so much stuff in the meantime anyway that boosting cs is really in order particularly the horribad ones hi astarte them being able to sport a warfare link which is sleipnir and abso only anyway and abso has problems doing it is a nice thing for a small gang but said small gang also needs a ship which performs in direct combatlarge gangs will never use the field cs in boosting role since fleet does it 11ty billion times better then again im ok with them being trash too since they salvage well and sometimes drop faction loot  ideal loot pinatas and preety easy to kill on top
i support the thread in the sense that they need a boosthowever i think fon tunes them in a better direction normally in eve ships have a role ccp try to balance things around that create things around that and thats the whole concept behind them whats common between these ships they were on creation very nice balanced between tank and gank your survivability let you outlast opponents while having a quite respectable damage output that has changed through the years the introduction of rigs and inflation in skillpointsisk combined with alot more pilots nowadays as well as the totalhelldeath of active tanking has killed thisid like to see some love in general to active tanking that would sort these ship out partially as well as a multitude of other ships at the end of the day these ships should be able to tank while doing respectable damage and should have enough fitting over to throw on a ganglink these are not big scale fleet ships but should be shining in small and medium scale

you could shield tank it also armor astarte is a suicide mobile anyway
nice
some good stuff love the black market

not supported here are my reasonsfirstly there already is pirate space these are also known as 00 npc space also the only affirmed overlord areas you are suggesting are also included in npc 00 space curse syndicate fountain delve and venal all contain pirate faction stations with pirate faction agents in all honesty it would be a hard sale to convince people that pirates run low security space when the names on the stations clearly state otherwise also destabilization doesnt equal cheap rates or cheap bribes in reality things become more scarce and more expensiveas far as low sec sov goes i like the idea but id rather see you breaking things to get those results rather than paying someoneblack market idea is silly but cool id rather just see a use for most of the items also black markets dont really exist because not everything is illegal everywhere for example slaves should be a part of the black market in gallente space while in amarr space they should sell on the open marketagain its not that i dont want to see low sec boosted i just dont think this is the right direction for it more breaking less bribing

  not farscape not looking itits just ideas the seed for the mind implementation may vary essence ships  technology derived from the existing excellent way what is imho to deepen the world of evecordially dar daryps sorry for my english
good ideas dont come solo they are preceded by many many bad and ok ones this is an interesting idea certainly not a bad one but not a good one either we certainly need some new direction for combat in eve and biological ships is not outside the realm of possibility hey instead of biological ships how about biological weapons you know fire a green liquid that chews through shields and armor and instead of destroying the ship just eats all the drones in the drone bay
definitely supported i always thought it stupid that you could not do this and all through my eve playing life have thought it was a simple oversight every expansion i give it another attempt hoping it has been fixed
make it more transparent
this is actually a pretty simple idea the idea is that you can take a group of waypoints set a particular constraint and then optimize them a constraint might be that a particular system comes last for example as it stands there isnt really a way to do this if you optimize and then put something to the bottom you wont have the best path an example that i ran into earlier todaystarting in pemene we want to go to mesybier duripant villore eglennaert dodixie and finally aunia pressing optimize with these waypoints set we getmesybiervilloredodixieeglennaertauniaduripantwhich is a 15 jump route it is also mostly useless because now we are 5 jumps from aunia where we want to be however if you put aunia to the bottom now you do not get the most efficient route the route you get simply switching aunia and duripant above is 18 jumps with a little trial and error i constructed this route which is 16 jumpsmesybiervilloreduripanteglennaertdodixieauniathe idea behind this proposal is that we shouldnt have to do trial and error like that but should instead be able to set aunia as our 6th destination and optimize the other 5 waypoints at a minimum we should be able to set our last waypoint to be something in particular because situations like the above where i did some shopping before going to my agent are not especially uncommon situations where we want to set a 3rd waypoint out of 6 are probably less common
yeah this one has annoyed me many times before supported
bump for awesomeness
the changes i would propose are1 remove rof penalty2 decrease sig radius by 75 per level3 counter to 2 double their mass to prevent them from moving too fast otherwise youd have afs with 8 guns4 give the catalyst  1 drone per level instead of falloff bonus and decrease drone damage by 33 also give catalyst one extra low slot and one extra med slot5 coercer needs two extra med slots6 trasher needs one extra low and one extra mid7 cormorant needs two extra low slots8 decrease powergrid cost for armor plates by 75 per level and reduce shield extender cpu usage by 75 per level9 double the explosion radius for small smartbombs for destroyers10 add 25 resist to shields and armor per level11 do not apply the second proposition increased mass to the tier 2 interdictors12 increase smartbomb damage by 75 per level for interdictorsim willing to change these propositions if a good counterargument can be made against themhere is a proposition that i didnt put in the first twelve because it is too overpowered as it stands but a good discussion should modify it enough to make it viableproposition 13 1 warp disruptor strength or 20 warp scrambler range per level against frigateclass ships only
a thread like this only makes immature people stand out moretruth be told this game is one of the very few that offer a pure pvp experience however its true that concord has been asleep at the wheel for a long time with experience wardeccing becomes a nusance at best so get used to it i do believe that ccp should change it to make the upfront cost of wardeccing hurt a little more corps and alliances like privateers make way too much isk from wardeccing for current upfront cost to matter ever wonder why you get wardecced but it never lasts more than a week or twohonestly the bigger problem is with pirates who fit a cheap bs insure it and make tons of isk killing people theyre not at war with sure you get a security status hit but who cares security status means jack anymore i say if your security status is below 5 your kos to everyone in hisec and concord just watches no sec status hits result edited if your sec status is 0 to 49 players are free to egress you in lowsec without gategun interventionmake those players pirating in hisec either do a fair amount of faction work to maintain it or be forced to recycle their toons or just play pvp style everywhere otherwise lets just fire concord call it all 00 because thats what its become
no
it might be worth pointing out that eve online is one of the only mmorpgs which totally supports the sort of gratuitous griefing which you are currently having a problem with this results in two things first individuals who enjoy this sort of gameplay the nonconsentual types usually find their way to eve via the usual methods banned from other games left other games due to reputation etc secondly these same individuals tend to go overboard on the griefing especially if the consequences for said actions are lackingthat being said youre in a tough spot because i doubt ccp is going to change nonconsentual pvp not because they think its funny when youre ridiculed and abused to the point where you cant log in but because changing it would break the physical game mechanics of combat in eve remember npc pirates engage you nonconsentually as well personally i feel that griefing has seriously tarnished this games previous levels of awesome there is a difference between pirates and griefers lastly i would just like to point out that i have caught a number of people using wow references to their griefing which only substantiates my theory that many of said griefers are actually immigrants to evehowever wardecs are unique and give small corps a chance to get their feet wet in combat and fyi wardecs are never mutual because making someone pay for war is another form of isk attrition
those of us that like to roam and kill pesky carebears and unfortunate souls caught at the wrong place at the wrong time would like to have more targets in 00i would like to see jump bridges change in a way that would increase the chances of a righteous gank or fight just an idea make the bridges like the sov units anchored at planets and not poss making them susceptible to camping and thus forcing victims into our paths should they jump with out a scout this would make the jump bridge a custom stargate that only that alliance or friendly alli could use a boost though remove the fuel requirement for them and just increase the cost based off the number of bridges in systemagain this is just one old eve players opinion
rpers like the killmails and it doesnt hurt anyone solution  make the fits less fail also this may be the first time ive ever heard anyone complain about their killboard efficiency being too high
if this was a rare event or something else ok then killmails are a great thing to hand out as proof of your being at the event but these events happen every few hoursbut i am supporting this proposal because killmails are supposed to be a record of your pvp activities and pvp record they serve as confirmation of a player kill as without a killmail we devolve into i killed you nahuh no you didntthe main problem is that npcs are far inferior to pilots killing a npc that is spawned for you and doesnt webscram you and doesnt focus fire and flies a terribly fit ship is miles below the average player fits sleepers are far harder and do not give out killmailseven worse is that the carriers that are spawned in lowsec drop fighters and capital sized modules why are pvp killmails and pvp loot being given out to players for pve activities is this a major shift from ccp are we getting away from actual pvp and moving towards battlegrounds and more pve these new live events just do not make sense im confused to as why you are changing 7 years of killmails being from pvp it lacks consistency why not give out killmails for missions and mining and exploration and tradinggiving out what are basically free killmails to people devaules all killmails as they are simple to get so it does impact other players the reward for rp should be rp items and the fact that you actually get to rp in a live event
would it hurt you people to actually research stuff before vomiting the stuff above from their mouthsyou dont get npc killmails the ships are controlled by players albeit dev players that give killmails the only thing that is skewing efficiency is that they are currently using sansha faction battleships  but you can hardly expect sanshas to show up in armageddons nowif were about not giving killmails because the ships arent properly fitted fyi the ships have generally a huge buffer tank and no weapons other than nossneuts  i dont know about the carriers as i havent seen them i think they have fighters though lets not also give killmails for suicide ganks and industrials noobships etc i mean they cant be properly pvp fitted why should you get credit for such kills
thati like the idea of ccp devsvolounteers melting faces with properly fitted faction battleships spr lolfits on the other hand meh
true power are wing on my killmails since i can remember they deserve evry loss they get
obvious strawman is obvious
id expect a faction ship flown in an event like that to be faction fitted and to go down in a big fightthe killmails i couldnt care less about
this is a terrible idea just like it was a terrible idea the first time ccp did it
im not sure  i like the idea of ccp using events like this to progress a storyline of course heavily influenced by player actions and it caters to both a crowd of pvpers and roleplayers
a couple pieces of lowend faction gear might be tolerable but if the loot is going to drop you cant really fit a nightmare with the sort of gear a nightmare deserves and you definitely cant fit a wyvern with the sort of gear it deserves that said could they not at least make the t2level fits sane
ofc everyone dreams of shooting sprfitted nightmares with no guns and neuts with no cap booster them dropping cn invulns would be sweet
le sigh only if they fight back properly ofc
the killmails allow people to see how those ships are fitted the fits on those ships are so horrible youd think they pulled random strangers off the street and put them in charge of these events it is proof that the people running the events have very little understanding of the combat systemfrankly it is utter incompetence it is yet another proof that ccp have no understanding of eve combat system and therefore they can not be trusted with game balancing decisionshow can someone fitting their ship like that have any understanding of the problems blaster ships have right now and even get an inkling of whats wrong with rocketssure maybe these are only the low level people who are incompetent but they have superiors who have to approve their action if any superior approved of this hes just as incompetent as they are i vote yes on hiding the killmails at least to reduce the stress i feel when i see how much ccp fails
i seriously ing hope youre trolling the fits are bad because the ships arent meant to kill as many players possible but to survive as long as possible  ergo they have nearly nothing else but armor plates or shield extenders  equivalent rigs and resist modifiers
which explains the shield power relays on battleships right
the idea behind this is to give eve pilots a better feeling of being in deep space the nebular effects are fantastic and no one would say otherwise yet a yearning to see actual black space still stays that is why i suggest this layout on a topic that has graced these forums many times beforeby constellation  30 have nebulas  70 dontthere it is plain and simple feel free to give your opinion
back when i was a young and innocent newbie i used to think you took damage when your ship collided with another whats more i thought this was cool as hell in fact i still do i would assume that this is something that is possible to implement given that the mechanics for bumping already exist although they are slightly dodgy at times before i talk about how i envisage this working i want to address the most obvious problem how you deal with this in empire space for high security space i would say the most elegant solution is that when another ship is collided with a check is made to see if it is a valid target  a wartarget a corpmate someone you have killrights for or someone with aggression for whatever reason  and if they are not the target is merely bumped as in the current system with no damage occurring your shipborne ai overrides your controls at the last second narrowly avoiding disasterfor low security space how this would be implemented is trickier imagine a frigate accidentally bumping someone on a station undock and being instapopped by sentry guns  i would suggest that ramming can only take place on grids that do not have sentry guns on them assuming this is possible to implement otherwise the same thing occurs as in hisec however in a situation where ramming can occur the ramming party receives gccso how would this work the last paragraph implies it is possible to distinguish between the rammer and the rammee this is how i envisage things going the ramming ships speed must be over a certain threshhold as a percentage of its maximum with a mwd active  i would suggest perhaps 50 but of course am open to suggestions in order to trigger collision damage this is to ensure that the majority of collisions are the result of genuine attempts to do so avoiding the loss of 100 fleet bs when half of them fail to align when the fc tells them to damage would be inflicted to both parties determined by the speeds of both ships the directions of travel of both ships and the masses of both ships i think this is best illustrated through a few examples first of all lets say a frigate is moving at very slow speed perhaps scrammed and webbed and machariel a ship possessing both very high mass and high speed bumps it from the rear what parts of ships collide can be determined simply by looking at their direction of travel and i think this would add a very cool tactical element to positioning your ship during combat whilst moving at maximum speed with its mwd overloaded the machariel would suffer merely a blip on its shields while the frigate would suffer huge damage exploding in a huge ball of fire out of which the mach emerges pilot grinning manically now imagine the same machariel this time with an identical ship coming straight at it with them colliding head on both moving at top speed in this case there isnt really a rammer and rammee just two maniacs who would both suffer equal damage as they are both taking the blow from the front the damage would not be so catastrophic indeed the raw amounts of damage that will be inflicted will be something that needs to be carefully balanced however anyone whos ever tried to bump a moving ship at high speed trying to stop someone burning back to a gate for example knows it is rather tricky so i feel this would not become the only way in which people tried to resolve combat a final example our trusty mackrel is now sitting stationary revelling in his glory the frigate pilot returns in a brand new merlin ready to enact revenge he overloads his mwd and rams straight into the rear of the mach and explodes hence even with careful ship positioning and a well timed mwd burst i believe an overwhelmingly larger ship opposing you should lead to rather spectacular failure to be continued
what does this add to the game firstly it is undeniably cool and i believe would be great fun primarily for pvpers but im sure the imaginative ratter will have fun with this too patrolling hisec belts in a nanocruiser ramming the frigate rats to death perhapssecondly it adds another aspect to combat another way in which fights can somehow be won leads to a whole family of tactics and strategies to develop furthering enriching the gameplay experience allowing more diversity in the way people play the game and adding another way for highly skilled pilots to distinguish themselves in conclusion i believe that whilst there are balance issues is there any aspect of the game that is free from these i have laid out a way in which this can be implemented that adds to rather than detracts from the core gameplay and i hope have convinced you that this would be a really fun thing to have in the game
excellent idea matsumoto yoshizu
supporting my own topic
tldr
unfortunately this will immediately get exploited for isk gain unless ccp introduces some type of real penalty for suicides
the proposal is to introduce voice commands that could be triggered via keyboard and mouse sequences this type of interface has been used in teambased fps games in eve the voice command interface may allow for better faster more structured fleet and other types of communicationshow it workseach pilot would chose one of a few prerecorded voices to represent them in the game then using their keyboard and mouse they would chose options which would in turn speak to your fleet using the selected voice the spoken commands would also be displayed in the fleet chatkeyboard shortcuts could be used for generic commands such as tackle the primary regroup at my location or command acknowledged while rightclicking an enemy or friendly ships or other objects could be used to issue objectspecific commands useful in assigning primary targets alerting of new contacts or designating retreat location voice commands will not be able to pronounce the names but the name would be displayed in chata practical examplebattle begins the fleet commander activates the voice menu by pressing v then selects m for movement then j for the command jump in now may sound complicated but its very quick to press vmj especially once you know the commands by heart the fleet would hear this prerecorded command and would also see it in chat next the commander assigns the primary by rightclicking an enemy ship and clicking assign as primary fleet would hear something like primary target is the damnation at 40 chat would display this command along with the ship name additionally the primary could also be marked somehow maybe different color reticle or what not options are endless here because eve knows what your command wasa fleet member notices an enemy reinforcement fleet and presses van voicealertnew contacts which alerts the fleet new contacts spottedcommander presses vmr voicemovementrun which directs the fleet to run run run scatterthis is a just simple example to give you an ideaadvantagesuseless chatter greatly minimizedeliminates languageaccent barriersability to see all communications in chat as well this is huge for many reasons some examples you wont miss any communications during bathroom break you wont have to ask someone to repeat if you misunderstood you can turn off sound if desiredcommands could also trigger other events such as highlighting the primary for the fleetmore realism because of prerecorded voices as opposed to hearing actual voices which just reminds you that youre online with 5th graders and creepy basementdwellersno need for 3rd party software or servers for voice communication and therefore less setup time and less bandwidth lossyour youtube videos will sound as good as the ccp trailersdisadvantagesmain disadvantage would have to be the fact that you cannot speak freeform it would fall on ccp to ensure that they make the command interface elaborate enough to accommodate any situation also nothing is stopping you from using your mic too you just have more optionsthe usefulness of this feature would depend on implementation things like clunky or overly complex interface lack of command variety or bad voice acting may deter people from using itpotential performance degradation since eve servers would have to relay the messages to the fleet just the message code the voice would be stored on the client it would have performance implications overuse would have to be controlled via spam timers etcplease voice your support and feel free to post ideas that may make this better
wow great 2 million iskies for 20 or a char slotok maybe on adjustment pilot who takes loan must have a positive wallet at the time of the loan
would you rather he type char instead also great reply reallynot if youre only allowed to use one toon per accountabdiel kavash you didnt even read the postcorporation status would be the fair asset along with the negative balance this way pilots that dont pay on time lose agents it would be nice to apply corporation status to the availibily of said loans
so you start a new alt on your account his initial 5k isk gets you a couple million transfer to main biomass repeat itd be crap money but itd be something people will farm and its still pointless and destructive of player businesses

im sure for vets of the game and even noobs everyone misses that oh wow factor some aspects of the game had when it was more new nobody had battleships let alone titans so seeing things like this added that oh wow factor to things now obviously thats impossible to bring back to eve in that form as the game is now i do however propose a way to bring a bit of it backreally simple why not toss a little randomness into the mundanemissions mining etc are all far to predictable not that there shouldnt be some level of predictability but why not throw a little randomness into the mix to keep things interesting its what keeps people interested in every day life the little things that are familiar but a bit different that make you step back if only for a moment and go oh coolso the to the point version of my ideamining why shouldnt some rare rock occasionally spawn in a belt so some dumb luck miner gets a little extra also as you head out to mine there is a bit of that what if today is my lucky day factormissions why not have some of the faction npcs occasionally spawn similar to belts or have something about the mission in general be a little more random variablefaction warfare why not have some random npc fleets even if only on small scale to prevent node death engage each other on occasiontech advances far to predictable why should it not come from predictable routes but on occasion slip into more unpredictable avenues such as missions ratting etcstory driven events just random storyline driven events that pop up every now and again that actually happen in spaceim over simplifying a much larger project i realizeyou could pretty much do a whole expansion on just making things in eve a bit more randomized to kill some of the mundane that has crept into any long running mmo i think my point overall though is if in any avenue your playing the game through there was even just a little bit of random variation to it itd make all avenues a lot more interesting
i honestly think that the csm should push for this in the next expansion the one after tyrannis should focus on breathing new life into the game
only if its an option to turn off
bombing tactics are valid and they work noone will sit in a paper tanked ship and just let you shoot at them if they can help iti am sick of people like you trying to ruin hard work so are they going to ban you what are you doing going to 00 in a noob corp how did you make 100 friends and how did you convince 100 noob corp people to come to a place that had a jump bridge post with your main or stfu
i dont suppose anyone minds me mentioning this
why do we listen to someone who lost a dramiel to a badger
fyp and i have no idea liang
unless im thinking of the wrong thing back in the days of living out in nullsec in order to use a bridge you needed the pos shield password why in the  didnt you just get under cover
if you read the forums for last couple weeks youd notice that emo tj has began trolling this forum with nonsensical threadswhy dont you remove his trolls and send him a warning while you are at it
wouldnt it be nice if we could inject a skiil while we are training the prerequisites for itexample you are training electronics v and have 2 hours left on it the next skill you want to train is cyno but youre leaving town within the next hour and are going to be gone from eve for 2 days you get to miss all that time from your queue congrats
i know this might be too obvious  but  train something else in the meantime
but i want my cyno alt ready by the time i get back
training other races frigateshaulers helps always nice when you got a wide choice for cyno ships 
its already been requested and refused by ccp theres consistency issues with someone starting a requisite injecting a skill and then changing their queue id like itor something like it but its not possible

it will help alleviate albeit slightly the already heavyily burdened low slot configuration for armor tankers as it is now the utility output on lows for shield tank far outweighs the utility output on mids for armor tank anything that will open up low slots for armor tankers would be a great improvement cap chargers should reduce armor boost as does relay shield give us armor amps
diversity is good for the game so no we dont need to make all slot stuff the samealso  if you move the propulsion upgrades to the mids  where do you put the ewar stuffabout the armor amps you got 1 rig for thatshield tanker lack that rig but got a module insteadall in all  your proposal is mixing like 45 things none of the idea seems to be thought through  so nothing to support
yeah i forgot about not having shield boost rigs soo make oneas for ewar being squished by a total of 3 modules i really dont see a game changer here more like a game balancer
 warp scramblerdisruptor stasis web tracking disruptor ecm target painter sensor damps remote eccm remote sensor boosters cargoshipore scannerreally just 3
yeah i really think you should addinertial stabilizersoverdrive injectorswarp core stabilizersto that mixim not being facetious hereanother thing to consider is the velocity and agility penalties that come from cargo expanders and heavy plates
no just no
a no with me as well i will go even further low slots could use the passive modules and med slots the active ones so expanders and cap bats would move to lows while dcu and armor reppers could go to mids this will free up slots for both armor and shield tankers and make sense from the gallente point of view youll actually use your active armor bonussesi have not yet thought this through enough to make a full blooded proposal as this will require a lot of recalculated modules
no
im fine with special event people dropping t2 loot if they actually fly competently and not have lolfits on their shipsif they organize themselves into strong gangs that cay lay waste to at least a few carebear battleships then the loot is well earned
t2 loot has always been produced by players and now npcs have more control of an aspect of the game that they barely touched before if ccp wants to reduce the value of t2 bpos then they should directly address that issue directly instead of devaluing all t2 blueprints whether invented copies or bpos won in the lottery
ephemeron is quite known here you just discredit yourself
people will whine about anything these days are seriously complaining about some t2 items dropping during a special event that happens once in a blue mooneph is his main and he has about a bajillion kills so try again
obviously i stood corrected and fixed my post caldari provisions is usually a pretty obvious alt troll corp pbut yeah t2 items shouldnt drop from ships not flown by actual players even if a ccp employee is behind the computer while theyre being flown eve is different from almost every other mmo out there because the players have a large influence on the game whether it be pew pew pvp or the economy
if it was possible to grind these ships then yes they shouldnt drop t2 however since theyre special events a status which precludes the ability to grind them then the mods dropped by those ships will have an infinitesimally small impact on the t2 market
youre clearly unfamiliar with old live events you think t2 loot is bad try to wrap your head around an event that drops an opux luxury yacht its fine
this is one of those threads that once again prove eve player base can and will whine for just about everythingthere is what 46 of these pc battleships  yes only the actor ships drop t2 loot  destroyed daily and they drop around 35 t2 mods each usually t2 shield extenders or such these live events wont be happening constantly however so color me not very confident that these few t2 shield extenders will collapse the t2 market as the poster above me said live events of the past dropped unique ships like the opux luxury yacht worth billions of isk are you fine with that then
tbh i understand his case  and i wouldnt mind it if they only dropped named and faction loot
we all know that adding certificates for players didnt really do much for the game my idea is for expanding certificates for use by corporations heres the conceptfor pvp corporations a certificate would give information about killmails generated per month certifications could vary based on the type of ships in the killmails so you might get on for capital engagementadvanced for killing 4 or more capital ships within a monthfor industrial corporations a certificate would give information about shipsmodules completed per month certifications could vary based on the type of shipsmodules built so you might get capital constructionadvanced for building 2 or more capital ships within a monthdiscussion allowing this type of information to be more accessible could add new dimensions to political and strategic play alliances and players would be able to consolidate capabilities and compete in targeted ways some alliances may seek to dominate certain portions of the market or grow their pvp base in a specific area and create a battle strategy as a result this concept is currently used in rl by corporations all over the world they may acquire a corporation to improve their market share in anticipation of growing demand or acquire another corporation to reduce competition in a certain market this would also be a good step toward making corporations actually behave like corporations in rl now all we would need is public balance sheets and a public shares system and players could simulate corporations completely
pvp corps have killboards for thisid have to imagine most industrial corps would be hesitant to announce that they routinely produce capital ships and thus routinely have freighterloads of capital parts moving around to those seeking juicy highsec targets to declare war onif the intention is to make it easier for alliances to gauge the utility of the corp theyre recruitingwell an indy corps failure to produce sufficient ships for their alliance provides just as good a service record i cant see adding certificates at a corporate level being of any more concrete use than those at a player level
your not thinking thenkillboards are used by alliances i know that information has to be sifted through however industrial corps might not want to have capital construction information available either but it is a corp rightthe difference between the mafia families and corporations is only the legitimacy of how they make profit legitimacy requires transparency i mentioned this idea to someone in game and he said the same thing about industrialists not wanting to disclose capital production information but think about it a little more if you were able to see what certificates each corp had you could recruit much more effectively and if your corp had vast capital production capability or pvp prowess you would be a hot commodity and this requires a lot less digging new forms of epionage and more strategic gameplay would result
people managed to train without daily access to their pcs for years before the skill queue existed i used to work away from my home pc 5 days from 7 and i just made sure i was training something that lasted for the time i was awaypeople have been proposing extensions to the training queue since it appeared provoking reactions like give them a finger above 24 hour skill queue is perfectly sufficient especially as you can tweak the skill queue to last longer by adding short skills to the front of it while a longer skill is trainingtldr  no support unnecessary change
she did not say she was employed by ccp
you voiced the same lie and then when i pointed out that in her own words ank claimed that ccp employed her for among other things game design and when thats pointed out to you you just go back to the original fiction thats just been refuted and claim again that when she says shes employed by ccp for game design she didnt say that again who are we going to believe anks own words or your claims about anks own words obviously we cant believe her if her words disagree with your claims so anks own words posted by herself are distorted and opinion oh yeah and ank is many people and her own words that she wrote represent a conspiracy against herits an interesting game you a person who just so happens to be parroting all of anks dodges but never supported or really heard about her before just now are playing and one that what luck just happens to repeat all the dodges that ank is using that ank has to rely on supporters or alts like this just shows that the accusations are 100 true
m8 i downloaded and read her cv she did not say she was employed by ccp so who is lying
youre repeating the same lie and over and over and over why and rather obviously people can posting personal information is not allowed on our forumsapplebabevery first entry under employment history ya know those things that youre employed at is ccp games where ank claims that the csm constituted employment even though ccp had her sign a document which explicitly stated she was not employed by them she also claims that her employment at ccp consisted of among other things game design something that only paid and hired ccp employees developers actually engage in
m8 i understand what you are trying to say it is common for volunteer work to be listed in your employment history this doesnt mean you were employed by them eva wasnt lying when she listed her volunteer work under her employment historyi will say again eva did not say she was employed by ccp
thank you for a wellmannered discussion i did not expect thisobviously we differ in our interpretationjudgement of her wordingsselfrepresentationwhatchamacallit and i think this is a good point to leave it at that since im quite sure none of us can or wants to convince to other side at all costs  i made my best to point out my opinion as clear and rational as possible and i got the same impression from you  the rest is up to the voters to decide and i expect ankh to be voted into the next csmcheerio
i like it when youre reduced to contradicting yourself one sentence to the next do you even read your own lies before you post them just to see how laughable they are your dodge is that while she said she was employed by ccp she didnt really mean it because other people list nonemployment under volunteer work yet again employment history sorta i dont know points to things that you are employed for in your history whatre the oddsno no dodges now about well in lower mongolia or well in the uk ccp in specific had csm members sign documents which explicitly said that they were not being hired by ccp to turn around and call that employment oh im sorry we cant trust anks own words when she says she was employed by ccp because even though she said she was employed by ccp people often put down nonemployment as employment to say nothing of the fact that she claimed that while employed by ccp she was employed doing game design among other things something of course which the csm positions do not entail at all
anks claims disagree with the netherlands own civil law on employment saying that its considered employment in micronesia has little bearing on the matter on one hand we have anks own words saying that her terms on the csm constituted employment with ccp on the other we have people saying that ank saying that her terms on the csm constituted employment with ccp doesnt count as ank saying that her terms on the csm constituted employment with ccp i mean honestly ank says employment history ccpand some people respond see she didnt just say that ccp is part of her employment history
if you take a step back and a good breather from your prolific forum witch hunts and rantings you do realize how much you are sounding like glenn beck dont you even down to the conspiranoid ankisgoingtodestroyeve weeping and doomsday sensationalization quite fitting since eve tribune is turning into the fox news of eve
you can address the facts any time now or just troll harder youre not very good at trolling though id suggest growing a spine
this is not a contradiction neither am i lying it is common to list volunteer work under your employment history by doing this you are not making a statement that you have been a contractual employee this must be frustrating for you to understand but unfortunately is true no she didnt say she was employed by ccp she is perfectly entitled to list her volunteer work under her employment historyyou are not obliged to solely put contractual employment in your employment historyi have no knowledge of any document that eva may or may not have signed with ccp this sounds very similar in context to a paragraph you may find in a volunteer agreement yet again she did not state she was an employee of ccp yet again volunteer work is commonly listed in your employment history this one is a little subjective this would be something to discuss with an employer and would serve no purpose discussing it here
i see you just really like lying not all employment is contractual but get this all employment is go figure employment again whod a thunk it it doesnt matter if people not employment under the employment section of a resume get this not employment isnt employment even if you say it is i know whod a thunk it i do admit though i like these lies of yours i can say i was employed in any number of jobs but because people somewhere on earth put down notemployment as employment im not saying its employment ill change my resume right now would you suggest that i should say i was employed as a secret agent or just as the president of the united states it is common for the yano mamo to consider beating a woman until she is disfigured by scars to be an act of love therefore when someone beats the  out of their wife its not really abuseor even better he didnt abuse his wife he just beat the  out of her this is not a contradiction and neither am i lying yes it is and yes you are ive already cited this and everybody can see youre lying instead of saying that when she listed it under employment history she didnt actually list it under employment history which is an obvious lie why dont you just claim that she listed it under employment history but really she meant something else that at least isnt laughable and again you show that your job oh wait put that down on your resume under employment here is to defend ank with any degree of dishonesty at all its subjective as to whether or not people voicing their opinions are really engaged in game design as a part of their employment with ccp damn i too have provided suggestions on the forums i guess in addition to being the president of the united states i should also list that im a game designer hrmm ccp never paid me for my employment as a game designer maybe i should follow anks example and contemplate legal actionhonestly though your lies really are awesome she didnt say she was employed by ccpright there she lists ccp under her employment historyshe didnt say she was employed by ccpright there there in black and whitedoesnt countwhatlots of people list things that arent employment as employment does that mean that theyre not listing them as employmentwell noso theyre listing them as employmentyesso she was saying she was employed by ccpno it doesnt count because lots of people list things that arent employment as employment heres a hint there are two different phrases work history and employment history guess which one means the history of things youve been employed to do and which means everything youve worked at whether or not it was something you were employed at
this really is where the problem lies for youin evas cv she has an employment history in this section she is perfectly entitled to list any volunteer work you do not have to solely list contractual employmentyou see ccp listed under her employment history and you believe this is a statement by eva that she has been a contractual employee of ccp uhm noactually people can see that you are talking out of your arse keep it going evas votes double every time you post more of your nonsense
ahhh shouldve looked you up first im sorry ank you a bit upset obvious alt is obvious
listing volunteer work under your employment history isnt a statement that you were a contractual employee get it yetno this is a cv this not a contract you may pretty much put anything you want to under your employment historyno she did not state she was an employee you are correct you are perfectly entitled to list both in your employment history
just stop lying try it you may like it i never said it was contractual employment thats just your lie you cant quote me saying that because youre making it up i pointed out that its not employment of any sort and that ccp specified the same exact thing id expect you to say that and then to lie and say that putting it there doesnt mean youre claiming its part of your employment history but as long as youre posting to the thread with more dishonesty ank please explain how youre totally against removing term limits and to prove how against them you are youre going to immediately take advantage of them thats almost as good as i just said i was employed i didnt say i was employed
anyone is entitled to put volunteer work in their employment history this is not a lieyou are however making me laugh
post with your main
so the other i went down to my local church and helped serve homeless people some piping hot soup shall i list the vatican as an employer youre right people are entitled to list volunteer work on there resumes they just usually list it as get this volunteer workpeople bs on resumes this is pretty much a given however you werent involved in game design anymore than i would be if i started a features and ideas thread also post with your main troll
finn while i agree with most of what youre saying you arent winning yourself any friends calling people liars and flinging poop doesnt convert people to your side even if they are liars and do deserve to have poop flung at them yeah its fun but it doesnt actually serve your purposes
this is how i look at it most folks are capable of reading the evidence objectively and seeing what ank has said in her own words theyll make their decisions based on the evidence other folks are capable of reading the evidence objectively and then seeing how ank has tried to handwave it away and the dodges shes used and theyll make their decision about her trustworthiness that way and a totally different set of folks wont read the evidence because ank tells them not to or theyll simply discard any evidence that isnt flattering of ank the first two groups will have already made their minds up upon reading the evidence without requiring a debate to choose the third will have made their minds up before reading the evidence and they wont require facts to choose id wager that 999 of people actually will make up their own minds regardless of the arguments anybody in this thread makes and theyll only decide based on the facts presented and not what people say about them im not really trying or caring about making friends so much as im enjoying pointing out some folks behavior most people when presented with a situation will form their own judgments and it will be the introduction of new facts not other opinions about the facts that will change their minds this isnt persuasive writing this is ranting oh yeah and theres a fourth group of people too alts who are most likely ank
to be honest the deal about the resume is a minor point i devote one paragraph to that and somehow thats what everyones talking about but even without the dubious resume ankh is simply far and away the worst candidate currently standing her own statements prove itand the most anyone can muster to defend them is to accuse the people quoting her of trolling patheticps 3 lady spank
1 agreed that its minor but its also rather elucidative rather than just say yeah i was padding my resume and i wasnt really employed by ccp and i wasnt really designing game content for them which i think all of us would have understood and most would have excused ank chose to use an alt to argue for why she didnt even do what she clearly did2 and of course its the focus because ank wont address her own quotes in her own words made on her own character that show what she thinks of pvpers and how shed ruin the game if she got half a chance shes actually done her best to brush them all aside and her supporters have in turn done their best to keep discussion away from anything substantive point out anks own words and its a smear that she wont address her supporters will merely parrot her dodge and it goes without saying that her alts will too thats totally not true they can also accuse people of inventing the quotes of nitpicking of being on a crusade of smearing ank and a host of other dodges its like theyve got a new thesaurus and goddamn theyre going to use it
eva stated in her covering letter that i have been an elected council member of eve onliness council of stellar management this should be clearmost people are clear that her cv is perfectly acceptable you are choosing to argue about it you are also making a complete fool out of yourself
post with your mainalso stop talking about yourself in the third person ank its kinda weird
yes its a person who has only ever commented on these issues it could just as easily be an offended lurker as an alt its not like she doesnt have diehard supporters after all
true although i see no real reason for someone whos already on the record as supporting her to keep supporting her via an alt but using an alt account to defend yourself does have advantages its true that until it posts with its main we dont know for sure who it is but it seems much more likely that its ank logging on to defend herself than someone else whos already defended her on another account logging that one in especially since ank hasnt been posting since the alt has been
yeah but ank has been ignoring any detractors since about page 7 and this is one case where npc corps dont always imply alts  she actually has supporters there im not saying its not an alt obviously it could be but its silly to assume that you know for sure
or maybe its a noob alt of someone who is not in a npc corp but just does not want ppl to know who their main is ppl do that you know
its almost like there was a second paragraph on my post that said exactly that
with the amount of propaganda and outright lies she is spamming into mission and trade hubs of late shes guaranteed to get on the csm shes implying that every other csm candidate wants to move level 4 missions to low sec while her filthy smear effort is blatant to anyone reading this thread the majority of people under her carpetbombing of local spam and emails will just take it at face value and pass their vote to heri find this to be disgusting behaviour for someone who is supposed to be representing the player base
posting in an epic thread of lolz i voted for ankh
its only for csm for  sake ccp arent going to take everyone of her ideas and implement them even if she does get voted in theyd be flushing there own game down the toilet people are making out shes getting voted in directly as a ccp employee and its not like ccp are never going to check there forums for ideas and only go with hers personally i would hate to see her get in because her ideas are against everything i do so to see them all implemented would turn me away most likely with many others plus we always have merc contracts
well you seem to be the right person for the job you can have my votesif you get in i shall foward any ideas i have for drugs to you
confirming my vote has been cast in your favour along with those of the corp that have votedkeep up the good worksimplesmulls
in an attempt to prove how worthless i am i just handed out 3 motherships and a titan on sisi to people for testing also bump
thanks i think it does a good job of explaining how important it is to vote for me issler
so i am somewhat puzzled that a very random other candidate seems to have become in many folks eyes the only alternative carebears have to vote for i want folks to realize there are several other carebear oriented folks that would serve you much better should you offer them your supportyou especially should realize that the effectiveness of whoever wins is directly related to how well they can work with the other csm the high profile candidate who shall not be named that seems to somehow be considered the primary carebear candidate most definitely will not play well with others should they tragically be elected to the next csmissler dainzethe carebear no one talks about who plays well with others and is also running for the csm along with several other good carebear candidates and one not so good one
confirming you got this carebears vote issler
for a nice background story on this candidate read thisassociated killmail  some convosmethinks you should ask for a buff to fotm ships if anything

there is already a juicy thread on that topic of exposing her various flawsso why does a newspaper  need to jump on the bandwagon and crucify her seems opportunistic from a neutral perspectivei mean the same publication is running interviews with csm candidatesif said publication was so concerned about policing weak csm candidates or whatever it would have done so on a regular basis towards other characters that dont perform i am opposed to anks views for the most part i support pvp  suicide ganking and all other kind of bad things that make eve the sandbox it isbut it doesnt change the fact she is expressing an opinion this opinion might be shared by many in the carebears  co crowdjust cause the pvp 00 crowd is more vocal on the forums should not be an excuse to go full swing characters assassination on ank from a newspaper even if anks views are out there isnt eve a sandbox that caters to various play styles and isnt csm a democratic processlet it run its courseccp is not going to jeopardize the core tenants of its sandbox game ccp is under no obligation to implementation ideas from this csm conduit so unfettered and real damage dont come into the picturecsm is an ingenious way to get the playerbase vested and involved its also partial pr exercisebut dont be under any illusion ccp has its own priority qhindering or alternate views is it a group of people that are infallible and their way is the only wayeven good ideas have unforeseen circumstancesif csm is about catering to one segment that is beyond reproach then i guess thats hindering no to put it in context while there are candidates who arent great or who are even bad none approaches the level of ank which yet again is why shes unsuitable for the csm and why even you admit that shes easy prey some csm members not contributing once elected isnt that more fail those are touchy subjects so lets go full swing and bash a easy prey
so your argument is essentially a claim that since its news we shouldnt comment on it and of course the point wasnt that the rest of the candidates are perfect but that ank is clearly unsuitable for a position on the csm for reasons detailed at length but its only my opinion is the dodge of those who cant back up their claims so what if her views are her opinions her opinions show shes not a suitable candidate for the csm nor should i add are quoting her own words character assassination if the things shes said reflect so poorly on her does that speak to the nature of her views or the wrongness in pointing out her views if she got her ideas implemented shed ruin the game even if she cant shed take up a csm spot which could be filled by someone who can actually do some good and csm members will have to counteract her influence like i just said and you just quoted nobody at all has said we should eliminate or hobble pve nobody is saying shes unsuitable for the csm because shes a bear but because of her lack of knowledge about the game venomous hatred for pvpers etc in other words youre saying someone should be entitled to her own opinion when that opinion is that nobody else should be entitled to their own opinions and im not sure exactly what you think democracy means it doesnt mean that candidates can run for positions without being challenged or that voters cant make mistakes no a csm member who is actively bad is worse than an empty chair i would in fact vote for an empty chair before id vote for ank again if shes such easy prey that shows shes not a good candidate people wouldnt have to be complaining about the fact that its so easy to point out her flaws if she was a strong candidate shes a weak candidate so dont point out how weak a candidate she is is simply not persuasive
confirming that quotation is a form of character assassination

it has come to my attention that certain malevolent forces are organising a series of griefing raids against one of our erstwhile csm applicants this bitter and unworthy plan will no doubt explain her lack of presence on the servers during before and no doubt after the honest and democratic vote of csm has been lodgedwhile i have canvassed for another csm applicant  the ever effervescent mazzilliu i would like to state in the spirit of eve playing comradery that i am 100 against any form of in game trolling or hindrance of any upright member of our glorious communitythis dark and uncoordinated mob no doubt mad with visions of rapine and slaughter  have infringed on that unnamed csm applicants close group of friends unearthing vital and private communications of a particular nature  you may have tasted from that bitter cup with some of the fabricated salacious rumours about her personal opinions in short  she is personally breached something i am loathe to share with you most moral reader and it is incumbent on us as a collected community to say no to this very thingi would urge you in all seriousness to add her to your contacts list share with her via in game communication your heartfelt support seek her out via in game means and should it be necessary shield her frail and feminine form with your ship words and thoughts i shall not name her but she stands amongst us a leviathan

yes
 thisif a damage penetration mechanism works it is almost actually equivalent to a damage boost because they both achieve the same result breaking through tanksalso in the fleet fight situations most rails are used in you are either destroyed outright by the alpha of a fleet or are rrd up before being destroyed either you have to nerf armour tanks by letting you penetrate straight through to structure or you indirectly boost armour tanks by letting shield tanks get penetrated with all the complexities and the fact that in a fleet fight you dont have time generally to admire the well made game mechanics i think its better just to go with a damage boost
make rails load up only one bullet at a time and have them able to swap out shells instantly one problem solved improve rail optimal by 1012 decrease range bonus on caldary ships to 75 that of an apoc
omg one bullet only so i would have to reactivate guns every 10 sec or whatalso nice try with placebo boosttry harder
you are either an idiot or a troll of your own benefit i honestly hope that its a troll if you switch ammo instantly to switch ammot oyu need to reload your gun hm could that mean that you reload instantly no way
i fly an armor astarte with 2 damage mods 7 t2 neutrons and 74k ehp not as much as id truly like on a command ship but hardly papery
i have already supported the thread as changes are in order simply i was saying that making field command ships a super hac was not ccp ideat3 cruisers command version has removed one of the possible after changes role that of a ship fastermore agile capable of working well with cruisers fleetsfor sure all the field command ships need to be capable to use a warfare link without nerfing too much tank and dps probably this summer ccp will do some rebalancing of weapons and ships so maybe they will look command ships as there is a lot of rebalancing it is only a small chance
ok again this isnt just about pirates one thing it is though is not about 00 its for people who want to live in lowsec and not 00 so npc 00 is not in the equation herethe idea isnt that a corpalliance run or own the lowsec system it is about them being the acknowledged overlord of teh underworld there or teh anti pirategood guys in systemdoes a mob boss burn down the local businesses no he makes them pay him protection money this would be in the form of cheaperbetter services the same goes for the good guys in lowsec tehy get cheaperbetter servises out of gratitudeas for destabilisation what an entity is actually doing is making a differnet stability not breaking itit isnt lowsec sov its recognition of forcethe main thing is to make it very different from both hisec and 00not flaming your response just clarifying the ideas

on behalf of our industrialists please we beg of you
while there my be need for additional refinements the core concept is sound this is a good item for the csm to take up

always for more usabitily makes perfect sence good idea
agreedalternatively make the shadows nonstacking which is to say the shadow of one probe is not such a big deal and is somewhat useful for orientation but when two or more shadows stack on each other it gets darker and darker till its difficult to see if the shadow never got darker than a single one is now there wouldnt be any problem

instead of changing the way wardecs work why not give industrialists a way to fight back that is more becoming of their chosen path for example you could make all products resources and products made by those resources which are put into the market by a wardeccd corp and their alliance off limits to the opposing corp and their allianceie unfittable or fittable but you run the risk of concord attack despite your bribe perhaps this could be obtainable by a similar bribe to concord for a small corp this would seem useless since your products represent a very small portion of the total market or may not affect a combat oriented corp at all however this would encourage small industrial corps to join large alliances so that it would more likely make an impact on the aggressors furthermore since this also affects the aggressors alliance the product ban might give the antagonizing corp some political considerations worst case scenario the aggressors and their alliance have other sources or are self sufficient and the ban does nothing but at the very least it requires the wardeccing corp to think about and prepare for a few more factors before they wardec a small corp for no real reason but to get their jollies also it encourages these smaller corps to work together and who knows maybe theyll find out its fun consolidate some of those smaller corps and end up with a larger richer and better prepared corp at the end
so if a corp produces veldspar then their attackers cant use ships and modulesseriously this is the worst idea ive ever seen and given that emo tj posts on this forum thats quite an acheivement
the root issue imho lies with ccps overromantacised notion of pvp yes these know its harsh but at the same time shroud themselves in the illusion that its all about bonding glorious battles good learning experiences etc the reality of course is that any thread of honor ccp stop censoring a perfectly legit word like modicum kinda makes you look illiterate is far to be found in eve i have yet to see a mechanism that isnt being abused by pirates and griefers naturally they dont see it as abusing to them whatever they can get away with is a valid game mechanic wardeccing is one of those areas where ccp must have envisioned fun ways to do pvp in highsec yet here too for the most part its just low lives preying on noob corps funny that is although honor is a rare commodity if it were ever put on the market it would still be dirtcheap as nobody seems to wants itthe problem of course is that you cannot simply outlaw wardecs in highsec nor can you make them so its a mutual thing frankly the latter is really one of the most stupid suggestions ive ever come across heremr h can we declare war on you guyschurchill um  no lol seriously in pointing out genuine issues people tend to get too carebear overboard in their proposals to deal with them whilst im a carebear too lets keep it real okay
i was think about righting up a detailed description of what is wrong with your statement about mutual war decs but i do not want to feed the troll go back to playing wow tbh
funky gotta say good idea but you should really start up a purposal with it rather then adding it to the discussion on this one being that it sounds more like an embargo or trade ban idea you cant however stop someone from fitting something they already purchased however you can force them to stop purchasing items produced by your corp or alliance however its a double edged sword by proventing them from purchasing items from your corp or alliance you provent your corp for possibly making isk you could say this was the industrial side of the wardec once a griefer corp or alliance builds up a rep enough industrial corps will have trade bans on them that they wont be able to purchase theyre ships and modules lol sounds a little more effective then hiding in a station or paying for a merc to come in and help lol though other corps could band together and put the same thing towards an industrial corp in so doing causing that industrial corp to fold being that they cant sell theyre product like i said double edged sword send me a private message in game would like to talk to you about this and possibly have you post it on here for csm consideration

i find it hilarious the only reason given by the op that the kill mails shouldnt exist is because of killboard efficiency ratioworried about your epeen much  looks that way with a corp name like sons of viagra
nullsec pubbies whining about their killboard being devauled oh the lolzis your ego suffering a little too much that carebears get to have some funalso you do realize the reason they are fail fitted is to prevent outcrys of favoritism for people getting that phat loot being dropped otherwise right
its possible to make cheap fits that are nonfail using the same fitting rules they followedt2 rigs t2 gear i can make a nightmare that deals 1129 dps pulse1024 dps beam has 164k ehp pulse170k beambeam needs a pdu to fit and runs a mwd a cap booster and a shield rr that gives 314 tank to another nightmare the cap lasts a decent length of time and as long as the ships stay in a ball their tank and dps would both be pretty fearsome  drop a couple dozen of those onto the field and watch the rpers boil the nightmare is a ridiculously good ship even without faction gear as long as you fit it right
not gonna lie when i first started playing eve i was convinced that ramming did damage  mostly because someone rammed me and shot me at the same time and i was too dumb to check logs i do like this idea its adds some tactical flair to the game where far too often people hit keep at range or orbit and its just cool my only concern apart from having like 40 people bump the same dude and instapop his ass which can be eliminated rather trivially are the hardware implications of it with ships bumping against one another constantly just randomly the server may get stressed making the are these bumps valid computations but if it turns out these computations are negligible or can be implemented in such a way that crazy lag isnt created then im all for it and it sounds pretty baller
if im understanding you correctly youre implying this will be used for suicide ganking in which case i suggest you actually read the thread as ive addressed the hisec issue
actually i did read it you imply that what you proposed eliminates the possibility of an exploit which is not the case no matter i actually like the idea of ramming but i like it as a crazy last resort kamikaze style attack which it can never become in eve for obvious reasons
well an exploit is possible with any game mechanic that is not thoroughly tested before being implemented on tq you could argue that no new mechanics should ever be added in that case
too much computation not enough useful game effect i like combat mechanics as they are not supported
how are you defining useful gameplay as far as im concerned anything that the majority of players will have fun with is useful with regards to computation i disagree there is already code running to determine if bumps occur  and lets face it they are reasonably rare an additional check would be added here to see if the speed of the ships is over the threshold and if theyre in empire whether they are legally able to collide it is very unlikely that this will be the case and so the real bulk of the calculations will rarely take place making the additional strain on the server will be a lot lower than it seems at first glance
youd have to be careful how you did it because eve is overflowing with hotkeys already but in principle i like it would be a nice addition to the game
i think this falls under the category of feature creepyes if done properly this feature could be cool but lets be fair it doesnt help mucheve online is as much about the metagame play as it is being a sandbox what options do we have today eve voice ventrilo mumbel hierachies for command structure and communications and broadcast menu i want to hear the fear or joy in an fcs voice when commanding no recorded messages will be able to do that being an fc andor leader is competely metagame play u dont need features like this to make a good fc i also think that this feature would result in clutter too many options a lot of confusion also remember that these msg would have to get translated in a couple of languagesits a good thought but i dont see it working and i personally wouldnt want it
you want to add a sound based feature into a game infamous for poorly implemented soundgood luck with that
i like 
this might be a bit overpowered you would just give a 001 isk bounty on wartargets and then you would instantly know where they are there are allready locator agents that let u find who every you want just takes a bit more time hunting is a sport i personally dont want this feature as it would reduce my satisfaction of finding and killing people
i think the down time should be changed once a monthas it is now some people get to be on right when the server comes back up and get first chance at all the newly spawned stuffi think this is unfair to those of us not able to be on at this timeif it rotated once a month then all eventually would get a chance to be on right after the new stuff spawns
1 downtime should be in the working hours of ccp which happens to be euro timezone and making the the dt at early noon gives them the time to fix problems without having to do night shifts2 i cant really understand all the whine about respawning  just last night i got pretty nice drops from plexes in highly crowded space and that was well into us tznot supported
dont forget the dt is during nonpeek time for most users
also downtime is when item ids are freed up from items that have been destroyed or trashed so they can be reused this is maybe the most important function aside from general server cleanup
fine i will just move to france
but then youll be at workschool when dt hits and youll start whining again
why dont you ask some australians about how great it is having dt right in the middle of your prime time im sure theyll be more than happy to tell you their feelings about it
all of us know how powerful supercarriers and titans are and time it takes to destroy oneeg supercarrier with resist all at 90 and is under attack by 100 dreads  support this would be around 400k 4k dps for each dread 90  40 000 dps  20k random dps  60k dps total so you will only need ensure u have 18 carriers in triage w 3rr reps 65k damage per second repping supercarrier till 14min logoffsky timer goes offtherefore i propose creation of a medical pos for supercaps only supercaps could not be repped on battle and only way to repair them would be throw this medical pos it could repair up to 3 supercaps 1 armorhull each hour and this structure once online it cant be turned off only destroyed this would be only available for sov level 1 and can only put 1 med pos per const for examplesupercaps once inside medical pos cant warp out until they have all armor hull 100 repped so supercap pilots would think twice before going to battle or something elsehope u guys liked my idea
either you have enough remote repair support on the field or your super capital diesas some kind of special pos would favor sov holders over attackersnot supported
supported 
then noone would take their super caps outthats kinda against what ccp is trying to do with super caps to begin withthey are trying to make them useful on the field and they want them usedif you cant kill the super cap kill something else
do you know theres jumpbridges cyno jammergene u telling me that favors attackers not holders
if you have 60k dps on the field you can pop a triage carrier roughly every 30 seconds so those 18 triage carriers turn into popcorn in the first 9 minutes and then you spend the other 6 minutes doing 20 million damage to the mom if its logged off then its hardeners arent running and skills arent applied to its hp so that should be enough to blow it up pretty easily i dont see a problem here
well if the mothership pilot just logs the active modules keep running only if he tries to relog and logs of then the modules turn off bonuses might be gone after the first log off though
i was assuming that you neut him dry in those first 9 minutes
i would just like to be able to email the book marks
no to your ideabut loans are hard to make player to player because either you need full collateral which sucksor you take a huge riskif there was a way to force a player into bankruptcy it be nice and make it when someone takes a loan you cant biomass your charproblem is its hard to have loans like real life because in real life thing go badly if you cannot pay
i am sure it was most likely mentioned before but i cant find itthe same code that puts fighters back in the drone bay after the client crashes needs to be for all droneshaving to restock up on drones is a pain in the ass not to mention that if you use augmented drones your out a few hundred million
posting again to give a thumbs up because like half of this game they did not think ahead enough to implement a thumbs up when making the op or adding a thumbs down
just a thought  the normal drones cant warp unlike fighters
honestly who gives a  if they can warp or notso it sounds logical in a spaceship game that they made it back to the drone bay
i much prefer the reconnect to drones solution to this particular problem avoids the entire logoffski scenario and doesnt break immersion contrary to the automagical returntobay option
reconnect to drones makes sense having the drones try to make it back into your bay makes sense but it shouldnt be automatic  they cant warp to you like fighters can
lolrpreasons is just arguing semanticsif you are going to put forward a real reason against then please do soand all ships are not immediately in emergency warp upon connection break
i didnt intend that as lolrp i intended that as a game mechanic reason assuming im not scrammed i can warp off the field but ill lose my nonfighter drones without possibility of recall the proposal is to make logging off do something that cant be done while youre logged in i dislike the idea of logging being a proper tactic for anything besides i dont want to be here any more giving it functionality that doesnt exist any other way is bad
i am not sure if this has come up allreadyreserved texture id slots on the ship models 1 for corp and 1 for alliance which are automatically pulled from your character information and autoupdated with your current employmenti am a 3d artist and currently employed for a game developerive extracted all eve models and seen how they are made its not hard to implimentall the logos are allready in the database technically this would just result in 12 extra draw calls which should be very manageble

i agree custom paint jobs will tend to get way out of hand we dont need rainbow fleets roaming around anywherei dont however see any problems with limited personalization such as slapping your corp or alliance logo the name of your ship or some motto semper fidelis what have you onto the side of your ship that would likely be easy to implement and make people a little happier

if i eat at mcdonalds do i have experience working for mcdonaldsif i live in a house can i offer to build or design themhow many other claims of hers are based around the same spurious logic that visiting ccp as a guest is the equivalent of at least a year of experience working for that company having been successful against other applicants whose cvs are of a similar accredited qualitythe fact that she is willing to take advantage of the ignorance of potential employers to gain a job requiring experience and training speaks volumes about her attitude to any role she is givenit is not the size of the details upon which she lied or even about what subject it is the fact that she is happy to lie in her life to people who trust her to act responsiblyif she can risk the success of one business by lying why should we trust her to give a week of advice paid to ccp
well obviously since its her own words that reflect poorly on her own character its not character assassination its character suicide
is ank related to joesounds like the stuff he says
dang i knew i shouldve voted for ankanyones whos raised enough ire and bile for a concentrated smear campaign deserves at least a vote
can we please get a new troll tactic i mean i know that anks own words make her seem kinda nutty but claiming that were smearing her by quoting her own words is getting kind of old and the inherent dishonesty is autorefuting maybe the next troll should be that we hacked anks accounts and used them to say things that made her look bad as part of our smear campaign that weve been planning for years
ahh the things id do to her characters if i hacked her account
fit some ships properly join intel channels configure the overview properly that kind of thing
i loled
get her alts to scout instead of posting crap in her thread you know play eve that kind of thing
i voted but i think you misunderstand i think players in eve should be a douchebag if they want i want douchebaggery but i think that a player entity or system should be spiced up to be more of a player run law enforcement agency if you told me that i could hunt down  sec status in high sec just by joining the areas militia i would be more willing to join the milita i want to be a different kind of douchebag i want to be a douchebag to other douchebags i want to be a lawenforcement officer in eveit doesnt really fix anything but i think it adds to it

i agree entirely the idea of players griefing ankhesentapemkah in and out of game sickens me she has as much right to play the game as anyone else and its terrible to think that she may very well stop playing due to the ill will directed toward her can we all not find some common ground to stand togetherwe should instead look to her lantern jawed stoicism with admiration and pride

have you ever tried to reload in a large fight slightly op idea until lag hits it then it stops workinggallente railgun ships would fire further than amarr beam ships for less damage as they should caldari railgun ships would have a little more range than either and do the least damage you clearly insinuate im missing something but unlike normal arent pointing out where you think the flaw is in someones argument this leads me to believe you cant find a flaw
underlining the key words here it makes me giggle recalling them to admit nhs grid issues back in the early 2008 absolutely nothing has been done since thenid bet we would actually get tech3 battlecruisers sooner then they fix cs class and i just hope those will pwn as much as current strategic cruisers do

why not give the siege warfare link that actually gives the shield hp bonus a script whitch work similarry to a sensor booster scripthp bonus script gives the hp bonus of x and kills the regen of shield with x shield hp bonus added immediatellyregen script boosts the regen with x and decreases the hp boost with x shield hp bonus added by regenthis way both the carebears and the pvpers would get their choise ofcourse one can leave the warfarelink unscripted so it would work as it does nowthis was a quick thought only readed this thread to the beginning of its 4 page so im sorry if doublepostingugly ericedit supportededit2after having a smoke and giving it a little more thought this idea of mine would not work correcty beacause of the passive bonuses if i as a squad commander have siege warfare at v and the mindlink ill get quite a nice bonus if it would ever get the chance to applyive newer fought in those big fights dont know how the things work in there in practice but the small gang warfare and small time roaming the shield hp bonus gets newer the chanche to apply if i as a fleet bonus giver am the sqout and primary tackler i go alone to a system  no bonuses tackle a target call up my fleet  get the bonuses but as i am already engaged it will newer apply to me nor my fleet due to the fact that they just came to the same system and warp straight to battleif im then again the booster and somebody else is the tacklerscout the situation remains the sameif im camping in nullsec the present system have a small chance of actually aplying but if camping in lowsec the gateturretsstationturrets again eats up the bonus we almost gotand as many of the others have said too the passive regen bonus a ship actually gets is countable by one hand fingers if not flying big ships so it really doesnt make a swat to anythingugly eric

there are areas of eve gameplay where the volume of clicks has been used as the limiting factor for how much return a user getsthese clicksinks are not always needed and often similar results can be achieved without the use of this gameplay crutchthis proposal is for ccp to1 make a list of clicksinks that exist in the game2 discuss and analyse these areas of gameplay with a focus on their contribution to gameplay3 create userstories for removing unneeded clicksinksexamples might include invention or bpo locking where the clicks provide no gameplay element apart from painobviously pi is a major new clicksink with gameplay being tied directly to how often you clickthis creates a situation where to be good at pi you have to click more then othersclickcentric play like this is not good for users it creates injuries and adds nothing to the game
this seems to be an intentional feature of pi much to my chagrin i dont see that one getting changed but the entire science and industry interface yeah it needs work there are others too though none as bad supporting this
yeah exactly clicks should never be used as an intentional gameplay throttlethere are ways this can be achieved without putting the limiting factor onto how long a user can click before going to hospital

wrong eve isnt a pvp game its about ganking players with the wrong fittings  ships
you can get interaction by just setting up a mutual chat channel and you seem to be saying that the wardeccer is in it for a good fight an abundance of station humping plated battleships and neutral guardians seem to disagree with you
wait you are sitting in a nice safe station and complaining because there are bad guys outside who want to kill you off and on for a week you realize the undock button is an option right you dont have to press it additionally this is a reoccurring theme throughout eve no matter how big and bad you your corp your alliance or your coalition getsheres the deal these little corp gets decd by small pvp corp things are part of learning the game that learning cliff is because this game is different than what you are used to playing you have to live through war decs a few times to lose the i am a god among ants attitude drilled into people in single player games and in many of the other pvecentric mmo games eve is about connections and cooperation connections take time to develop but there is a satisfaction that comes from them far greater than mining an asteroid cooperation can be achieved almost instantly in the game dont cry about the lesson being unfair learn from the lesson and you will grow

go lilan  makes complete sense 
we seem to have drones for just about everything except salvaging i myself do a lot of salvaging for money or just for manufacturing when i salvage 50 wrecks at a time it can take an hour or longer depending on how far some of the wrecks are away i would like to see some salvage drones to hopefully decrease the time spent salvaging
when a system gets 800 players there should be an emergency flow procedure where every person in that system will have to pay 10000 isk a minute if local is past 900 people will have to pay 50000 isk a minute and if it goes past 1000 people will have to pay 250000 isk a minuteif a player doesnt have enough isk he will drift into negative status and if he gets to 5 million isk he will be teleported to a neighbouring systemthis will solve blob warfare people idle and afk spammers
yes lets take away any motivation ccp has for fixing the lag in the first place
and who does the isk go to bad idea unless you implement this in jita then im all for it
under current game mechanics corps require diplomats to be directors to set corp level standings this becomes an issue at an alliance level because diplomats need to be directors in the executor corp to set alliance level standings and that of course brings about security issues with wallet access and the big red buttoncould we possibly have grantable roles within corp that allows a person to set standing at a corpalliance level without having to be a director

i couldnt care less about killmails given for those ships im glad that live events are back even if i do not participate in them but i agree that fits need to be better preferably faction fitted
just take examples from my death mailshow about ccp let me fly those faction fitted nightmares let me choose the mods and i will make a bloodbath out of those carebears
tis the beauty of live events if you want to bring a winfit nightmare bring it and shoot yourself some rpers will only work on the lowsec events of course but still
fight back properly against 200 ships targeting the nice faction fitted ship piloted by the ccp actor and disregarding the npc piloted ships and what is your definition of fight back properly in that situation living 10 seconds more thank to the faction fittings
if you were to design a bait ship with the constraints offaction battleshiponly t2 fittingshow would you fit iti mean thats basically what that ship was it lasted long enough to pull a bunch of people together in high sec who ended up shooting each other based on the battle report a faction battleship designed to kill people with the ability to do that sans concord would be horrible i cant imagine the threadnought steaming from the devs killed my drake they killed my raven toothe problem with many of these live events is the inability to pull together pvpers in a timely way without melting dozens of pveers firstsure these things are supposed to be terrifying but imagine the terror a player could wreck with a faction bs that was immune to concord
assuming the servers could handle itwhich they probably could if you pick a system that isnt naturally too busy and reinforce the node they should make an event with a decently fit group of enemies and give out an hour or two worth of notice to people let them actually form up properly and then throw a ball of lasery death at people if they actually built a proper npc ai into the mix itd be really awesome imagine a proper sansha fleet  headed up with a leviathan maybe a wyvern or two a few triage chimeras and dps revelations couple dozen nightmares some phantasms basilisks onyxes rooks curses and the like in support maybe 100 ships in all with human pilots on the important ones and competent ai in the rest small enough that the players could win but big enough that theyd know they were in a fight now that would be a live event worth having
proposal prevent planetary interaction  failwe need to stop ccp from turning the new planetary interaction into an new epic failthere should be a claimable grid on the planet but on the test server its not therei was in the understanding that when i build on a planet no one can build near my sites in order for others to get my sites and resources they should engage war thats where dust comes inat the moment you can build right on top of other pilots planetary interaction construction sites but there should be a perimeter around your pi stuff so you claim that part of the planet building on top of others means no competition over planet resources no competition means no wars in dustif this problem is not fixed then pi  faileditif ccp decides to fix this after the launch of the upcoming patch then they have to nuke all the planets to get a reset in other words destroy stuff from eve pilots resulting in a time  isk loss on there side
you want to prevent planetary interaction to be greater than fail so you want pi  fail or pi  fail instead thats an interesting position to take
the data that has been released about dust does not indicate anything remotely resembling what you seem to think it isdust is to be woven into the sovereignty system any impact on pi will be collateral damage like mopping up moon towers so none of your sky is falling arguments has any meaningwhat you should be concerned about is the absolutely insane difference in earning potential between nullsec and everywhere else  according the last numbers i saw pi will barely make a profit outside of 00ccp made a big fuzz about limiting the passive income of null with moon changes and now they are giving them a whopper only difference is that they will be free from having to fight over empire turf for that income but can print their isk safely in their backyards
hurray i want to print isk you dont understand 00 you think individuals are making large amounts of passive income passive income in 00 requires a lot of cooperation read an entire alliance to the point that per capita income is fairly low from passive income sources compared to say rd agents also the passive income in 00 is constantly flushed into the war machines required to protect it so i would question whether or not these passive income sources amount to net positive income
wait what poses are absurdly profitable yes it requires some cooperation small but it damn sure doesnt take an entire alliance working together way to try and defend your current isk printing machine and demand more im not even sure why 00 should have such high value planets considering that most of 00 is more safe than most of low sec liang
you should not get a gcc for repping someone that does not presently have a gcc no being 5 is not a gcc

edward the point is that using the starbase tower for the source of these reduces the importance of tactical placement and the utility of various shortrange modules a 75km scrambler only has an effective range of 45km on a large towersisi giving me troubles with updating ill test it soon with ewar mods when i get it back up and running

im torn on this on one hand its a massive pain for the industrialists on the other hand it ensures a steady supply of the crap subsystems on the cheap while driving up prices on the good ones which leads to a nice price versus capability spread not sure which one i care about more
tbh it seems to me that ccp just did not want to invest the resources to redesign the ui when it was originally implementedthe crappy and the good subsystems require the same parts to build just different printsthe price for the good ones is higher not because of supplydemand but because they have to make up for the crappy ones so essentially the buyers of good subsystems subsidize the bad ones
uhm  the ui would be there already as you said the invention ui allows you to pick the output type already so you basically break your own argumentation when trying to counter herschels argumenti am with herschel here not supported
long story short basically people are using the momentum of supercaps or whatever ships that will work to bump enemy ships outside of pos bubbles here is an article in which pos bowling was recently used to kill a titan linkageand no this is not some whine thread about getting fed by pos bowling just to head that offthe issue here is that people are exploiting the existing flaws in space astronautics of the eve game to do things that make absolutely zero sense a shield is suppose to deflect massive amounts of firepower yet a super cap can be slung into it to bounce ships inside out the super cap is then forced out by the shield almost like it was made of rubber instead of energy there is also the second issue of tiny interceptors bouncing ships the size of titans like a ping pong ball no sense whatsoever the mass of a titan is so great a tiny interceptor should be flattened by it but the reason a titan is bounced is not because of mass issues but because of the silly borked coding of autoavoidance computers that keep and two ships from touching in the gamesuggestionsrequire pos password to be entered if warping to a bm inside a pos shield or a bm that intersects with a pos shield in transitrecode pos shields so that nothing not even ships with huge momentum can push into a pos shield when i hit a wall i certainly stop pretty dead coldintroduce an anchor ship option for supercapitals so that supercaps cannot be moved unless unanchoredcreate a new ship collision avoidance code that takes into consideration two ships mass when a bump occurs ships with high mass would not be moved at all
the mechanic has only become a bannable offence nothing more but what it doesnt do is solve the problem the titan from the news post was bumped out by warping through the pos which is apparently still possible because it happened with the atlas titan and ive seen people warping through a friendly pos with dreadnoughts as well1 yes absolutely2 agreed3 id rather like to see that titans are locked in place just like dreads in siege when the jump portal is activated rather than an overall anchor4 absolutely although changes have been made to less then impact supercapitals should not be so easily impacted by ships many times smallersupport
i propose that concord starts selling monthly protection plans i know this concept was offered earlier in jest but i could really see it happen  heres the outline1 basic package free you get what they offer now2 rapid response plan 100 mil per month per sec level ups response time to that of a higher security level to a max of protection equivalent of that which you get in 10 space not applicable in  05 space so if youre in 05 space and want the 09 deal youll pay 400mil a month flying in 06 space gets you 10 type protection for that money and should you happen to fly in 08 space youll still only get 10 protection3 antigank plan 500 mil a month same response time and protection level as that of basic package but additionally youll get a beacon you can carry around in your cargohold which makes scanning your ship and content impossible the beacon is programmed by concord to work for the time you paid and its personalized so its of no use to anyone else but you loss of the beacon will be restituted by concord not paying your monthly fee just means it will stop working remotely deactivated by concord not including protection from combat scanner probes4 all packages are personal nontransferrable and nonrefundableand now cometh the beauty people willing to sign a highsec nonaggression pact barring legal wars will share in the vast amount of isk concord makes this way at 500 mil per participant player per month this could add up theres no penalty for not signing but if you do you could receive a fair amount of free isk each month people who have anything but the basic package can themselves not participate in the highsec nonaggression programmeyes essentially this is a protection scheme like the mob runs you pay not to be harassed but i feel its a good compromize its not just asking pirates to be nice but makes you pay a hefty sum if you want it and pirates get something in return
concord is meant to punish not to protect youyou are responsible on your own that you are not getting ganked
so not a huge boost to hisec in any way then because hisec doesnt already have enough advantages for manufacturing research etc righthow about starting with1 basic package new characters get 30 days free protection then after that they have to pay or concord wont lift a finger on their behalf concord steadily raise their rates according the increasing value of the ships they flyand take it from there your current proposal is nothing more than a boost to old rich players combined with a proposal to give the money back to npc corp isk farmer alts why the hell should concord give people isk why wouldnt they just keep the iskplease laugh at me for biting on a troll because id rather ihbt than that you seriously thought this was a good ideaif you want an improved counter to hisec aggression then by all means propose a player based solution like a working bounty system combined with transferable killrights not even more magic invincible npcs
not supported for following reasonsit will put noobs at disadvantage none of them will be able to pay that muchit will grant 100 protection for macro users they easily can afford 500 mil per month
2 isnt crazy but probably isnt worth the effort of coding 3 is crazy and the beauty would be farmed to hell and gone by 1man alt corps not to mention being completely nonsensical and against the entire design philosophy of eve so no not supported
i think you totally missed the point of the original proposal  which was to limit how effective concord was not supported at allliang
first off i will not use my signature caps lock and bold so some people dont get all butt hurt about it at first i was not going to do a mission balance proposal but my followers have had many request for it so here it iscurrently in order for a pilot to be able to successfully be able to run a level 4 mission they have to fit specifically for it and being able to tank the mission and any pirates that butt in is simply impossible so the following will happen to help balance these losers not minding their own business every single mission plex and dead space will have a gate at the beginning that everyone has to take if the mission belongs to the player wanting to activate the gate they simply just need to hit the warp button when selecting the gate and they will be warped off to the mission if anyone else that is not in the mission owners gang they first have to use a hacking module to break the code chance of success is also affected by that players standings towards the agent who gave the other player the mission the higher the standings the better chance to break the code on the gate once the code is hacked the player will be able to take the gate when the intruding player lands on the grid all rats will reset aggro and choose new targets at random to even the odds now because historically pirates have always waited till they outnumbered the target by 51 odds the mission owners rep amount will then be increased by 600 like a siege module does for a dread if the gate leads to a dead space or plex the first person who has discovered the gate does not need a code to activate the gate all others muse hack the gate unless they are in a gang with someone who is already past the gate if someone who is not in your corpalliancegangblue to you is in your mission and steals all rats reset aggro and choose new targets to help balance this new threat if someone steals from you in your mission and you agress them depending on standings with the agent who supplied the mission a squad of npcs that are from that agent will warp in to assist you the make up of this squad is dependent on the difficulty of the mission the harder the mission the better the back up squad will bethat is all for now i will trust that any nonrelated comments on this proposal will be handled appropriately so i will have no need to lock this thread if anyone tries to derail it remember the rules all comments have to be constructive and not trolls i will also be starting a mailing list for my followers to keep up with the latest balancing issues i will be working on
my costructive comments involve taking a neutron blaster to your ship any time i see you in localare things so bad in the north that you have nothing better to do than post crapthreads on an alt
thank you for stopping to use caps it makes it more readablethat said i do not think the idea is well balanced i for instance would see problems in inducing the heightened rep amount by taking a few alts there
hacking entry idea decent but each individual not in the mission pilots gang will have to perform this action regardless of their gangreassessing aggro mechanics needs work the idea of new arrivals possibly gaining aggro from existing nonaggressed npcs sleeperlike has some bit of merit this will have a deleterious effect on logistics however due to weighted aggro mechanics already in the mechanicsaggro mechanics nothing different than anywhere else
tldr
nice planbecause the nc historically spam titans into subcap fights proof i propose that all sc ships have 99 resists vs titan weapons to make the fights more fair constructive comments only pleasetldr 010 why hasnt this obvious troll been banned yet
mumbles something about badgers and dramiels
i did a mission once in a badger but a dramiel pilot came in to it so i killed him
this can be said in one sentenceplease protect agentrunners from pirates  ninja salvagersnot supportedone should use brains to avoid unwanted encounters instead of asking for mega advantage like there is only one thing which can be used  npc aggro it will be logical if they cycle through targets same way slippers do
why not just ask for the i win button outright instead of spamming completely moronic save me from da piwates requests would save time eh
supported once again an excellent suggestioni would love to see more of your threads tbh and will be joining the mailing list asap shame you arent applying for csm 
removed trolling comments everyone is entitled to their own opinion in this forum this is a place where all players can get the csms attention regarding issues if you do not agree with something please be constructive
simply put there is no reason why one should have to be in a ship to rename it especially since in station there is a rename ship item on the rightclick menu each shipeven though it only works for the one youre actually in if for some bizarre reason this is not feasible then remove or grey out the rename ship item from all the rightclick menus except the one for the ship currently piloted

awesome idea
so no  there i was in a fleet warp as we were coming out of warp i smacked in to a corp mate sending him flying 50km would this idea kill me because i was part of a fleet warpa group of capitals cyno in some where and play ping pongsomeone warps to their pos their warp lands them on the pos what happens next
congratulations on not reading the thread i understand its a good 2 minutes work but maybe just dont bother commenting if you havent read iti already clearly stated that one party in the collision should be moving at at least 50 of its maximum speed and have its mwd active precisely to stop these kind of situations being a problem

i dont much like the idea of ramming for damage in combat purey because to be fair if a ship rammed another ship that woudl realistically be suiciding your ship or steamroling the other ship depending on ship sizesi do however hate the bumping mechanic due to it being a ridiculous tactic which really does ruin immersion due to its ludicrous nature
ramming speed to get to the gate in the middle of a gate camp worse ramming speed at the interceptor flying at me from the gate camp which is usually directly in line with the gate so if i miss i just jump the gate
in pi its designed so that i may setup all of my installations find out the limitations such as cpu and powergrid then click a setup button once i am sure that this is how i want it setup up then all my instructors are put into place automatically a similar system should be put into pos setup this way i can setup all of my modules tell them which one i want anchored and where once they are setup i click the setup button and the instructions are carried out possible in a queue one at a time like its done today but this way i can take the 30 mins to set everything up then leave while the pos puts itself together but im not required to stay at the pos all day to complete the task of placing anchoring and onlining my modules
a pos onlining queue has been requested before its a good idea but ccp has already heard the request so theres no real point asking for it again
the delay is deliberately meant to slow down the process of setting up a pos if this queuing idea was allowed resistars would be much easier and safer to setup this limits the ability of system defenders to attack the pos before it becomes this hideous monstrosity that requires a large fleet to killobviously this is less of an issue postdominion but remains a valid reason to not allow capsorcas to dump an entire highresist pos on the field in enemy space then cloak up fly to the edge of the grid or safe up to safely wait for the pos to finish the queue
yea you should probably fight in a real fleet fight before suggesting something like this and by fight i mean you should try being the fleet commander on one side of said fighttheres just so many things wrong with the idea that it would look like a dissertation trying to get them all into a single post
a real fleet commander in a real fight has voice comms set up and wouldnt use this but i regard this as being the same sort of idea as eve voice  it may be inferior but its easy and itll see use by smaller groups who dont have the means to put everyone on teamspeak not all features are aimed at the highend players
youre obviously the authority on the real means of communication and no other means should be allowed because you said so real commanders would never use this you speak on behalf of all of them and since eve only consists of real commanders this proposal is wrong very logical thanks
i see now that your going to be bitter towards anybody who does not agree with your ideastellar way to start it off yo this is but one of the things inherently wrong with the idea there are reasons that alliances use other means of communication the least of which is the inability to communicate with the fleet and get updates during one of eves frequent crashes during fleet fights ok ignoring how stupid you are for coming off all baaaw you dont like my ideaallow me to break it down for you slima fc has about 2 million things going on while driving the fleet hes usually dual accounting at least or hes got whispers set up to 3 or 4 channels that have scouts logistics dictors ecthes receiving about 9 metric tons of information looking at maps if he doesnt know the area by heart and hes giving a lot of orders to those different people and this is all outside of a fightsometimes your opponents are dying fast enough to make verbally calling targets a pain much less using some click and key combo to work them out all while running probes getting warp ins moving scouts ectin short its too much and im sorry that me not liking your idea has you all butthurt but this is a dumb idea that would get used by like 120th of the eve population for a week before they went back to the old faster way of just basic voice communication its a waste of programing time
then youre completely missing my point i agree no 00 fleet with half a brain would use this feature but there do exist groups of players that arent 00 fleets a gang of newbie missioners could easily find this feature to be exactly what the doctor ordered for example doubly so for people who dont have microphones set up and working which is actually a pretty significant portion of the eve community pandemic legion is organized and elite and i doubt you tolerate people being micless but matts missioning and mining doesnt work the same way this feature isnt useless its just aimed at people who arent you
i agree with everything you said except this
disagreeing or stating ones opinion is one thing making presumably factual statements that no fc would ever use this and therefore its wrong is something else this was the point of my replyyou may be right that a fc of a large fleet may not want to use this i wouldnt know my goal here is to offer an alternative to the other 99 of the eves players who dont command large fleets those that may only have a couple hours for a smallscale pvp those that dont want to waste hours on just setup and preparation those that may have language barriers that prevent them from fully enjoying the game etc etc
by comparison to other groups i mean
i would like to suggest the following considering the current state of eves little annoyances that the entire major improvments be broken into two types at different timessummer revamping limit the summer content expansion to adding things like graphics for existing ingame materials reexamining existing ingame mechanics and the like mission changes ship modifications such as af and destroyers ammunition updates for things like rockets ect no new content per se beyond updated existing in game items issues and the likewinter expansion adding new content a holiday gift to the loyal players who have become so addicted to the marvel that is eve this will give build teams an entire year on specifically new content while other teams are given a similar year to tackle existing content issues
while the principle of fixing old broken stuff first is one i agree with i dont think it lends itself to the neat categorization youre trying to impose for example what were the dominion sovereignty changes they were new content in many ways but they were also intended as a fix to the old sov mechanics summer or winter also i bet youll hate this change as soon as you realize that you only get fixes once a year and your preferred fix isnt in the fix patch for the year sorry mate but this is too simplistic to work
there shouldnt be too many mechanic fixes in the same patch because they might not mash together well but theres a lot of buggy unfinished and lowquality content that needs to be fixed before more features creep onto us with tyrannis at the very least ccp could fix a few basic mechanics at the same time like the eris and the dramiel without throwing the balancing off too muchi dont support exactly what you propose since you seem to be asking for an emphasis on mechanic fixes instead of emphasizing content fixes but in general this is the right proposalthis may not need to be done every summer but it definitely needs to be done this summer
i was just looking at my old old classic content screenshotsfraps today i was so sad typhoon has been derusted almost completely engine trails gone cyno effects ruined sensor booster bubbles gone in favor of an effect that makes my eyes bleed shield boosterhardener bubbles gone the per polygon cloak effect was badass tooid go on about sound because even though its always been buggy at least the sounds were good and you could hear them from more than 5m away now im with the eve has sound crew though
he said top 100something like the rouges gallery would be nice though some of the top bounties in game dont really even play anymore something that kept a running track on bounties like 24 hours oldtoday you can see where each person in eve with a bounty logged off at yesterday when was the last noted movement by the suspect ect ectsimple tracking programs would actually do a lot to make an actual bounty hunting career in eve viable
im not opposed per se but i do have a question  why do you think this feature is needed given that we already have locator agents and buddy lists
you know a lot of bounty huntersbetter yet do you know any one person in eve or have you heard of one person in eve who is a bounty hunterthere are some seriously steep bounties out there it should be more than a lucrative profession there should be a few old rich bounty hunters at this point only there arent anyeve is too large and location agents suck they are usually well away from the area your target is in and by the time you get there the target has moved the process of finding someone in eve is nigh on impossible even with the use of multiple agents on alts and a near sherlock holmes approach to finding people youll never actually end up near them unless they are station bound altseither remove bounties they are pretty stupid and useless in their current incarnation or finally 7 years after release give bounty hunters the tools they need to be a proper mini profession
id love to be a bounty hunter hunter

removed trolling comment it is ok to disagree with this candidates views however name calling will not be permitted  adida
perhaps we are being far too harsh and pedantic can ankh simply say that it would have been better to have added the word volunteer to her ccp entry in her resumei mean if she were to admit that it would defuse the situation we could move on to other topics of discussion
the trolls would find something else to nit pick about im sure
with a candidate as bad as ankh the only thing you need to do to troll her is to quote her
no no you have it backwards ank is such an awesome candidate that to quote her own words at least if they dont paint a flattering picture of her is slanderous and a blatant act of trolling the fact that anks own words make her look bad just shows how horrible you are
tinfoilshes trying to get the votes of all those people that want to see the csm to fail its reverse psychologytinfoil
sounds great
the hedonistic angst coming from the pvp mouthfoamers in this thread is hilariousoh and anyone who suicides defenseless ships in empire is nothing but a griefing coward
i dont think you know what that word means stop using it also anyone who flies defenseless ships is a tool
come back when you fully understand the game
the trolls would find something else to nit pick about im sure with a candidate as bad as ankh the only thing you need to do to troll her is to quote herthank you for proving my point within such a short time frame
removed trolling comments  adida
its getting harder to figure out when you folks are trolling and when you just fail to understand whats going on do you really not realize that he refuted your nonsense by pointing out that nobody was trolling ank and alleging that posting her own words is trolling is an absurdity or are you trolling about your refuted allegation of trolingbecause thats meta baby same question are you unaware and lacking knowledge or trolling do you not understand how funny it is to see you using words whose definition you obviously dont know while you talk about how following ccps intended game mechanics and possibly scoring some neat loot in the process is cowardly and wrong and other people need to figure out how the game worksor are you trolling same question is this metatrolling do you really honestly not understand why anks own words arent slanderous accusations about her or are you trolling id ask if you really dont understand that papers write editorials literally all the time and that posting facts doesnt make one lose credibility but you and i both know that youre just trolling on that point so why waste the time discussing it eh
you know a forum is going downhill when people start making posts like this to preach about professional standards and dignity
fixed that for you
nah thats not her style she has vices but forum vulgarity isnt among them
im sure its all very hard to understand you need to be an einstein to understand why nit picking about this resume thingy is trolling
ah so you were trolling of course believing that something is important even if someone else sees it as minor is not in fact trolling pretending that a difference of opinion on the importance of something is an attack that is trolling likewise you were responding to a statement about anks own quotes obviously all of her forum posts and all of her chat logs are her own words and all of them were dismissed by you as trolling since you dont like their content pretending that quoting someones own words is trolling is dishonesty designed to  people off in other words you were trolling in order to claim that people were trolling like i said meta baby
no the nit picking about the resume is just that nit picking going on and on about it just to make someone look bad is trolling anyone making a point about that clearly has his or her priorities wrong or is just plain trolling pick whatever suits you best
the reason people nitpick is because once one person nitpicks the other side pounces an easy argument to counter and blows it up also because ankhe and co ignore ankhes statements they refuse to reply confirm deny etc they just ignore the statements and continue calling out individual weak arguments im sure ankh and her supporters will again ignore this but
thank you for pointing out how stupid it is to squable about resumes when you have much better smear material
youre a tool im pointing out that its you and like minded individuals keeping that argument going some ankh detracters post a ed argument and youre milking it as hard as you can to avoid having to answer to the real things that make your candidate worthless then again thats her entire campaign platform say bull ignore it when it comes back to haunt me scare carebears
wear tin foil hats much
dont worry  if she gets elected itll be my personal pleasure to lick your tears dryhere here have some milk and cookies too no need act like a complete emotard over some selective and decontextualized quotes someone may have said under a certain situation or another if you dont like her and what she says dont vote for her simple
oh brother i actually looked at the thread you got them from after checking a few posts it just became blatantly clear that you are ripping things out of context again did not continue to check furtherand you still whine about ppl not responding to this garbage and like stated b4 get pretty much anyones chatlogs and forum posts and you can prove just about anything about them if you had mine you could prolly prove i was a pedophile a white supremacist a jew with a leather fetish a communist a capitalist a terrorist a homosexual tranny and a gangsta rapper
no seriously stop trolling disagreeing with you is not trolling claiming it is is trolling having different priorities than you is not trolling nor is the definition of having the wrong priorities disagreeing with you claiming it is you guessed it just stop trolling speaking of which calling anks own words smears just shows that you are willing to use obvious lies in order to troll in support of her stop it wow you guys hit the talking points real quick if you cant handwave away anks own words as smears then why they must be out of context except of course theres still no context in which those comments arent nuts unless of course your claim is that before all those quotes ank said i dont really believe that otherwise she was endorsing the ideas the ideas are nuts therefore there is no context in which endorsing nuts ideas is not nuts but please provide the full quotes and show us the context in which her words become nonnuts
since context is so important please reread this chat log posted in its entirety no lack of context possibleedit posting things that people say can show you something about that person whodathunkit
wow some people do really have problems do start such a smear campaign against a candidate disgustinghowever ankh has my vote i like the topics and her focus in the csm and i think she will represent my play style and me as a player very good and i think she can seperate her very own opinions from her work as a csmi wish you good luck ankh dont let those trolls bother you
1 i never claimed disagreeing with me is trolling thats the spin you are giving to it claiming i am claiming that disagreeing with me is trolling is well trolling 2 having quotes from someone where he or she uses strong language is better material for making someone look badsome ppl might call it smearing  than argueing about how you should list unpaid work on your resume dont tell me you cant see that simple fact3 and yes they are taken out of context go see for yourself like the part about psycho virgins or something ank is quoted calling players something like that what the quote does not show is that she only copied that of the previous poster
thats because everything that has been quoted was not out of context at all it showed your ignorance and im afraid to say malignance in its fullest and sadest gloryeverytime somebody disagrees with you and backs it up with arguments you dismiss it as troll at first i thought you were just beining dim but in the run of this thread it kinda appeared to me you really believe that it appears youre the kind of weltfremd person who lives in her own fanatasy believing herself somekind of genius you will dismiss all critizism and experiences to the contrary as false or as personal attackswhy do you think the other carebear candidates are not getting the responses you get
finally a substantive critique unfortunately i dont think the context makes ankh look any better but by all means read the original threadedit also snipe
whoastop the presses ank is definitely guilty of countertrolling someone on the forums two years agothe biggest lulz ofc is how you guys still totally fail to realize how retarded it is be so incredibly hungup and butthurt over such things
you just did right above you just said that if someone believes that her resume is significant then they are just nit picking and trolling that was you saying it just now why is it that so many of anks supporters argue this way theyd be liars engaged in trolling the point is not that she used bad language but that she endorsed a number of insane ideas that would hurt eve you know this because people have told you over and over and over again and yet you dishonestly describe it in terms you know to be false  you posted one thing if you want to refute more you need to actually do that  as it is you didnt even refute that one quote as nothing changes in full context someone says its just a game people who get so upset about an internet space game are obviously antisocial psychopathic virgins ank responds people that use a game to get their enjoyment by frustrating other people definately are antisocial psychopatic virginsit is dishonest for you to claim that this somehow shows that she wasnt saying what she saidbut yes miya is right progress is being made now instead of claiming that those who disagree with you about the importance of things are trolling accept that people can have subjective preferences without trolling ank even if you really really like her and if you claim that quotes are out of context show how the context actually changes them all weve seen so far is that in response to someone saying that people who get upset about eve are psychopathic virgins ank endorsed the idea that gankers are psychopathic virgins that doesnt absolve her by any means
pro tip posting a smiley in every post does not make you look less ed and butthurt the other way around actually
it pleases me to see how closely youve been following every post of mine
this whole thread has sold me on anknametolongtotypekah the amount of fear drooling hate spewing and stalking generated by the simple mention of her name speaks volumes she has the nullsec  lowsec ganker warriors afraid and thats a good thing fear the ankbear for she will one day rule the galaxyshe gets all 5 of my votes d
before you do esteemed and mentally stable voter please consider shes a complete  and there are alternatives for anti nullseclowsecganker warriors as yourself check out this candidate linkagejust for the carebear voters consideration
to be honest the level of pvp play is pretty low in this game especially on the corpalliance level it would be nice to make the pve experience better and maybe get some fresh blood into the game
figured that i might as well post with my main and bump this excellent campaign thread back to the top best of luck
there was some excellent discussion regarding the mercenary profession in the last of the mynxee focus groupsyou can download the recording from the following link there is both audioonly and iphone friendly audiovideo file that indicates who is talking at the timenetgameradioin the download section there is also an an audio version of an interview i did with myxnee for a new eve news vodcast show i am working on by the time the show goes live the csm5 elections will be over so thought i would post here sooner than laterrd

hopefully for me well im all in favor of paybacks a  in eve so any proposal that lets people give douches a good douching starts out with one point in its favor imho as my 2 son says touchUFFFD douchUFFFDbut to get a game mechanic proposal seriously considered you not only have to make the case that it will add to the game but come up with an absolutely minimal set of changes that you think will have the desired result the smaller and more elegant the change the more likely it will get considereda big part of what a csm delegate ought to do imho is help players craft proposals that stand a chance of getting adopted
i will be sad to see the end of the pink sig theres always next year unless they decide not to elect new candidates or give the current representatives irresputable tenure or something lol i mean who knows with ccp x
corbeau and what can you say about fleet fights now they are really laggy if local is more then 700 pilots and it is not very funnyi can understand that it is server problems etc but also i think it is possible to find a gameplay solution for this problem so what are your terms
i already stated my views on fleet fights before local 700 is fine i dont want to see such fights gone like some candidates do but lag is a problem problem which csm can not fix only ccp can do this i as many others want to enjoy lagless fights but im concentrating on things which we can influence like improving fleet experience by fixing little but annoying things for example everybody have seen fleet management window this window can be very annoying in large fleets when many people are joining and other are leaving its impossible to do anything then you can not change wingsquad commanders because window automatically scrolls to the top its nearly impossible to find yourself in the long list and its just plainly frustrating so if you think that large fleet fights  bad then im not your candidate but if you enjoy fighting in large fleets and you would want to have more pleasant experience then im definitely candidate you should vote for
as a low sp pilot i want to know if there has been any thought of doing a review of all the t1 ships going back and ensuring that they still are performing as they were originally intended in todays worldi feel that with all the game mechanic and mod changes that these ships no longer perform as intended and you get what we see today which are a handful of t1 hulls being used in abundance while the majority are barely seen other than gimmick fits

tamberfirst thanks for the free events and everything im fairly new to eve and might not have gotten interested in the csm process if it wasnt for the promotions run by other well established players such as yourself and avalloc so thank you for getting me interestedin the interview with the tribune you briefly mentioned that youd like to see the mini profession of bountyhunting worked on could you be more specific on how youd like to see the bounty system fixed or reworked are transferable killrights part of you plan thanks for your response
you have my vote
hisome good news as you may or may not be aware  there are quite a few candidates who support enhancing the bounty hunting system which means it will definately be submitted again some bounty hunting proposals have already been submitted through the csm however and ccp replied withsoveriengnty lols um lets ignore that for now shall we this doesnt mean we cant champion it again though ill be promoting lana torrins new bounty system as a backbone to a new system which seems to be the most popular proposal so far and although im not 100 on her system of skills to compliment this proposal id also include dierdra vaals which would introduce transferable killrights and change bounties to a new contract type this was submitted to ccp during csm2transferable killrightsbounty hunting improvements csm2more bounty hunting improvements dierdra vaal versioncomment welcometamber

friendly bump for an honest candidate
great guy who deserves your vote 
yeah im getting the embedded font error aswell maybe use a font that isnt so obscure
the pdf seems totally broken but it was working at the time this thread was originally posted ironically this is also the only set of minutes that ccp have published during csm4i will find out what has happened and try to get it sorted
last call to votechange the way votes are being handledyou can vote for me herethank you
everything herschel says i agree with including most of those outside this thread and especially since he says it so well tamber
last call to vote as voting will close soonevery vote will count this roundyou can vote for me herethank youextreme
you have my vote x2 oh hallowed horned one
you made a mistake in your mistake
that is indeed a problem i have not considered
in eve there is a problem with the availability of me and pe research slots for the general public at the same time pos labs often have available research me and pe slots that arent used as it as already been suggested in the past it would be very useful to upgrade the pos laboratories functionality opening those slots to the general public for a fee probably programming this feature would be difficult but it will open a new player managed market renting research slots with healthy competition something that is always welcome in eve on a relate note it would be nice to find a solution for the old problem with copy and invention slots that cant be shared outside the corporation but as it is apparently a programming nightmare i am not including it in the main proposal
self support
sounds good in theory except for when your enemies or competitors fill up all your labs with longterm jobs and then cancel them leaving your labs shut down and their bpos safe and available for their own personal use the proposal is good and i would support it if it were modified to cover as many eventualities as possible
i think the problem with copy and invention is that you have to have access to the hangars on the labs themselves this isnt a requirement for standard research if you have the appropriate skills scientific networking iircthat said you do not even need to have access to the physical pos itself in order to use the me  pe research slots contained on it as long as you possess the requisite skills i for one would love to be able to rent out research slots to the publicas a possible solution to the problem with invention and copying you could make the lab accept materials from the users personal hangar as long as it was in the same system if you need an rp explanation say robotic drones carry the material out to the lab and bring back the finished results but i agree with venkul that should be a separate proposaltldr supporting the ops main idea  letting us rent out me  pe slots to the publicedityou could allow poss with public slots to charge a cancellation fee and then set it ridiculously high so even if they do this theyre paying through the nose to do itanother possibility would be to fix the slots so they actually release when the job is cancelled which imo is the way they should have been in the first place or alternatively to hold the bpo until the slot is released or until the lab is taken offlinealso at least in the case of our corporation wed probably reserve at least one or two of the labs strictly for corporate use so even if they fill up the public labs we still have our own slots that we werent renting out anyway
i strongly support this proposal i am always looking for slots
not sure why this would be a problem as they are still paying for those slots for that time anyway so it certainly wouldnt hurt the corp that made them available second if you get a lab thats full of canceled jobs you can always unanchor and reanchor the lab not sure if you also need to repackage it and all those slots will be freed againthat said im not supporting this as it would make lowsec even less worthwhile than it is now long wait times for research act as a good reason for researchers to seek out lowsec and have their corps erect a pos out there
speaking from experience thats not entirely accurate  at least not since the introduction of wormholes i think a lot of corps would probably risk class 1 wh space before they tried lowsec simply because it limits the size of the ships an attacking force can bring in to bash your pos it is potentially safer that high sec a la no battleships unless someone is actually building ships inside the wormhole
well for starter your enemy would pay for the privilege of shutting down part of your service secondarily you dont need to make all the slots available to the general public remember that not only your pos slot will be used up but the enemy character science slot would be used too i think that people shutting down poses would be a bigger problem than enemies filling your lab slots my opinion is that if the laboratory owner shut down the poslab the job should be immediately canceled and the fee refunded if the job owner stop was the one to stop the job he should get no refund instead
csm1 asked for this to happen if im not mistaken and ccp said no the pos mechanics simply dont allow it and as with all pos changes ccp is deathly afraid to touch the code so as much as id like this to happen it wont
i think it was about the copyinvention slots i know that the pos code is the problem for that reason i have limited the main proposition to me and pe research seeing hot that part of the pos labs function can be shared with other people i think that the functionality can be extended to more people to make the changes to the code as limited as possible it will probably require players to be in a corporation and to have a hangar in system an update from ccp even saying it is not feasible would be useful
i think every csm has asked ccp to change poses in some significant way my fingers are crossed that they eventually get the messageedit support
to not open a can of worms to actually see this happen id like it to be based upon standingsthe idea i certainly like
supported but noting there are actually 5 gang warfare subsystemsi dont see any mining links there however a variation i would note to be consideredthe fleet doesnt actually need to know the link bonusesperhaps the fleet composition tool should have this information in order for the fleet boss to allocate members around as needed fleet composition already shows ship type and fleetwingsquad command levels it would make sense to include gang linkbooster info there
i want to wet mine and use it in pvp yes i think this should definitely be added as one of those little easter egg items id keep one in my hold at all times
we need towels
go my supportthanks for the forgot to tick lol
you forgot the tick
i also want to make it possible to have an avatar that just wears said towel
i find the lack of towels disturbing every weary traveller should carry one with him
this is the most serious case of seriousness i have ever seentowels or gtfo ccp
if you do not support the pod goo has won
confirming that the op is a hoopy frood indeed
this is unacceptable
the development plans of implementing towels in eve have been on display in the alpha centauri office of ccp for 50 years now you have my approval
i fail to see why there are no towels in the game towels are our life towels mean we can be prepared for any situation with the trusty towel by our side im sure even the most scared of carebears will venture into lowsec to brave the pirate hordessupported by 42 you answer for everything an anything with more of everything thrown in
ill support this proposal but only if we can get some towel boys to go with those towels and also tribe  miss ya sweetie
nice ideaquick question on how you envisage accessing bpos as items for transitie currently i drop all my bpos into a small can and transport them as cargohow do you see a library entryhanger being accessed to facilitate the function of transporting 1 or more bpos to new stationspos hangers
i have an alt who trained three months indu skills we had a organized hac building operation for few months more it was easy dock up to a station select a bp from corp hangar  manufacture 500pcs  go pvp with main  profitthen i tried to contigniue it alone after the corp organized project ran out after few hours of investigation i came to a result that im making much easier iskies on a belt in nullsecthis idea would make the induskills of mine usable again would get some nice income of those three months invested in induskills ps its simply lazieness that made me decide not to indu on my own not that it would be frustrating or something its just easier to sit on a belt and killing npc imoeric
ooooh shineyregardsgil

keep it up
several proposals when put together would change the bounty system to fix what is a broken game mechanic 1 bounties are rewarded for destroying a targets ship not just the pod2 the amount of bounty awarded is the value of the ship lost subtracted from the total bounty3 killrights are tradablesellable as per other proposals4 optional killrights are awarded even if the victim has attempted to defend themselves assuming that it isnt the case now5 bountied losses do not receive insurance6 a bounty can not be collected against a wartarget7 bounties can only be placed on someone with a negative sec status fellow corp members or people who have quit your corp within the last 24 hours8 a character can buy off a bounty on themselves by paying the amount of the bounty which gets refunded to those who placed the bountyexpected results tradeable killrights allow bounty hunting to be pursued in highsec ship based bounties with no insurance means that the bounty loss will actually be a loss no matter the situation not being able to collect a bounty against wartargets and not being able to put bounties on players with a positive sec status would remove the ability to use bounties as a harassment tool these changes would mean bounties would be useful fun and balanced
not bad ideas but they dont actually solve the problem which is that the person with a bounty on himher can collect the bounty very easily with an altsecond problem which is specific to your ideas is that sec status can be made positive with a bit of work not that i really understand what youre going for with the whole sec status thing anyways which is itself a crappy mechanic
yes someone can collect the bounty with their alt but the max bounty they can collect is the value of the ship and wont get both bounty and insurance so there is no advantage in doing soyes negative sec status can be fixed with work but to do so would mean that a fairly significant portion of their gameplay will be spent fixing sec status and not pirating the goal of the sec status restriction is to make sure bounties arent used to grief noncombat characters a noncombat character wont have a negative sec status an alternative or addition to that restriction could be if it were easier to gain killrights bounties could be allowed against those you have killrights making bounties even more of a revenge system the big disadvantage to either killrights or sec status limitations is that bounties wont really exist in 00 but since right now bounties dont matter it would still be an improvement so ultimately i stand by my proposalalso 1 support for my own idea  
i like the idea of bounties being linked to the value if the ship destroyedwould bounties awarded for a pod kill be up to the value of a targets replacement clone
ill bump this once a day until next september
supporting as i was the one that proposed these changes i would like to know what happened to my proposal
supported because destroyers are next to useless in my opinion and because changes are never a bad thing
more then likely the way these things work is not by scanning your hard drive for what you have on it but for what is running in memoryyour antivirus does it your firewall does it what is the difference between those and a game having access to whats in system memory
the difference is that antivirus software looks for a general signature or pattern in the code on the computer both on the hdd and ram whereas the scanning software for a game should only be looking for something in a specific list of software packages so game scanning software like punkbuster are less intrusive privacy wise than antivirus software
i would support this assuming protection for false positives ive literally had a 600 worth of hardware destroyed by software which i thought was impossible at the time that was trying to protect against copy protection i would expect a phased deployment beyond the current system phase 1 would be a system test program that ran the scan but didnt do anything except warn you that you might have suspicious software installed with a way to research the specific software and contest the results this system would also apply to trial accounts after a few months of that system live on tq you would need major data sets to work out the false positives i would expect phase 2 would not ban accounts but hamper them in some way like locking login or forcing logoff while the macro software is detected running
you cant use technology to solve a social problem
this is the same as saying that ccp shouldnt have fixed the exploit last month that allowed certain players to avoid local for a period of time and immediately jump on thier prey there was a whole big uproar over that exploit pages and pages of comments in the thread this is not a social problem this is a legal problem it is a clear violation of the eula ccp is well within their right to seek the most cost effective approach to solving the game you as a player also have the right to stop playing the game in the hypothetical i believe you like many player who played the other game would continue to  to high holy hll about the way the problem was solved but ultimately you would continue playing the game because of the time youve already invested scream privacy you would still playi dont really take issue with all you people who  about macros believe that its a ccp problem should address i am absolutely dumbfounded in the fact that so many people here assume the absolute worst in the people who write the code to bring the content seriously how is it that you play the game day in  day out when youre perspective is that the game is brought to you by evil intent ccp
you lost me at scans your machine last thing i need is yet another company who feels entitled to push invasive drmlike crap on me simply because they let me play a gamewholeheartedly not supportedi like my own idea a lot better to be honest instead of painstakingly analyzing server logs in a onceevery5years holy rage op make cloaky npc belt rats that recognize bot patterns and who come out to shoot the macrominer with concordlike deadly firepower
not the absolute worst perhaps but venturing a guess i reckon a lot of people feel that while ccp may not be particularly fond of macrominers theyre purposely turning a blind eye to them because those thousands of russian macrominers are also each paying 15 a month
we have no rational fearhonestly my issue revolves around fleet fights some fleet fights strain even the best computers add another process that is constantly scanning your computer in the background and eve takes several steps back from the lofty need for speed concept
there are server side methodologies which have not been usedai which look at hours played actions of ship financialdefine that which is typical player then flag that which is notat point when activity passes threshold activity monitor this personscanning of client side is lazy method and unacceptable to manyin the system in which i have been based for many weeks very close to 00 i see one player in hulk which is obvious bot always online when i log in at random times of day repetitious behavior hour after hour i log in and leave system she is there i come back she is still there i login in middle of day or night she is there always there in many weeks she has never not been there she start after downtime every day and is there all daydetect the obvious on server side is solutionccp does not know player hours played systems visited items sold time range of items sold modules used if i mine 237 i am not bot maybe i just love to minelooking in the users computer is not option i usually get kiss before someone touch my stuff
i vote againstsalvage drones would give too big an advantage to salvage thieves it would mean salvage thieves could run salvage from 50km or over 100km with a good fit ninja salvaging is already a griefing mechanic we dont need it any easier
salvage doesnt belong to anyone and thus there can be no salvage thieves since there can be no salvage thieves salvage thieves can not get any kind of advantagesalvage drones would mean that you get the option to either be more effective in combat with normal drones or make a bit more money from it seems fine to me would even make it easier for people complaining about professional salvagers what they call thieves to salvage while they are fighting so that there are no more wrecks available if anyone warps inseems fair enough to me
this assumes that only ninjas can have salvage drones it would make salvaging easier on the mission runner as well support
salvage drones would actually quite a big boost to mission runnersbut what the hell supported anyway nothing wrong with comptetive rewards
it will be made everywhere this way people will have to use their brains in fleet fights and no one will be able to blob to the point where everyone is just a number for their alliances causeso lets say theres 250 people vs 500 people this would be classed as blobbing too however since all the serious players  alliances are in 00 they would easily with the help of many naps be able to fill the remaining quantityso when the battle changes to 500 vs 500 people will have to make a decision either lose money and fight or be forced to lower numbers
pingregardsgil
not supportedit is already possible to kill a ship on a jump bridgecyno beacon at a armed pos if you know what your doingthat the op hasnt figured out how to do so is no reason to change the nature of this module
some people obviously havent tried to gank at the jump bridges its done so easily and so often that there is no need to move them to the planets i have seen even freighters to die at the jump bridge and smaller ships die constantly by the hands of stealth bomber pilots
someone else did one of those topics that come back once in a while was stupid idea back then is still stupid ideaand pretty sure you cant online cyno generator arrays in cyno jammed systems
you can because you can link jump bridges to them
ahem a proper sansha fleet with 1 titan 12 supercarrier a few carriers and support fleet of faction ships 100 or so totalagainst a ragtag fleet without any capital ship no chain of command no time to organize the fleet right mostly made up by pve peopleyou see nothing wrong in this picture herschelit is an event made to entertain players not a training course for 00 battles killing a titan especially a well supported and well tanked titan using bs and smaller ships is a long process fighting a 100 man fleet even if 90 of it is made by ai controlled ships with several capital and supercapitals in high sec would be a nightmare or you want to limit events to low sec where alliances would bring well organized fleets if the payout is good enoughnote that a good ai could potentially be more damaging than a fleet of the same size managed by players as it will be capable of more efficient focus fire
i agree as long as it is done aboveboard and not steered towards powerful 00 factions on the basis of favoritismmy sense of the gist of this thread is that people are getting bent about killmails of expensive ships with failfits whawhawhat were looking to be in the business of qualitycontrolling killmails now failfits dont count thats funny thumbsdown not supported
i support this with the exception of the most excellent concord special ops bs that rote kapelle took downyoull only get that kill from my cold dead hands
that is really what the problem boils down toit would be worth having people would be much more willing to participate and such events would be a considerably bigger dealif a fleet like that showed up people would come to fight it people including those who can kill such ships can you imagine how giddy empire pilots would be to be involved in taking out super capsa side note i was sad to see a lack of real faction caps hearing about these events had me hoping for some monstrous true sansha carriers with spikes sticking out in all directions
you missed the part where i said that youd give at least an hour of advance notice weve already had events with a supercarrier supported by large numbers of faction battleships and the players won that with zero advance notice give people a couple hours to get deployed and youll get considerably more strength in place along with time to shake down at least a semblance of a chain of command i expect itll be fine and worst case the players lose a roleplay event if they get trashed make the fleet smaller the next time
ok now explain to me how you can make that feasible in high sec and if you limit it to low sec and the rewards are good enough how you think to keep alliance fleets from getting all the goodiesgive reasonable rewards to convince people to bring and risk a capital ship fleet and you will start hearing cries of favoritism and risk node shutdown make the reward too low and no one will bring the cap fleet the events so far are aimed to non organized groups allowing thrown together fleets to work after a fashion even if not really efficiently that allow the common joe to participate in this kind of event make it so that it require a well organized fleet an you will make it an exclusive for large corps and alliances pve content is already weak in eve making more of the top end pve mixed pvepvp in this particular case accessible only to alliances wouldnt be a bright idea from ccp part you really think an hour will make a differenceyou either have the cap fleet or you havent it giving an hour notice would simply mean that if the rewards are good enough to warrant a cap fleet use some alliance will claim the operation and shut every other player out and we will heard the cries of it was near alliance x territory it is favoritism
hershel they are meant to be fun roleplaypve you are still not going up against enemyu fleet that you can do in nullsec i dont think ccp whants it to wtf pwn all carebared by dropping 50 nighmares out of a wormhole that deal 1k dps each thats a bit too rough
super caps can be taken down by subcaps the difference in tank between a super cap and a normal cap is nothing more than bufferif you can break the tank of a capital ship you can break the tank of a super cap
again theyve already done events with two dozen nightmares and a wyvern with zero advance notice how is my proposal unreasonable in comparison to that and assuming the lag was kept under control i can think of few things more fun than a fleet fight thats open to the masses
ok i am a mining most of the time and all i have is time to think of thing to  about and most the time i dont get chapped over them but there r some change that would be a welcome change to the game the frist thing is that u make a ship the rorqual it is a cap ship just like the orca but it cant go in to high sec witch for me sux because there both cap ship i dont quite under stand what ccp is thinking here but if u dont want release the rorqual to high sec can u at least let station compact ore and ice for a fee and i also have alot of ship that are rigged out and would like a ship mantaince bay to carry up to say 6 battel ship of space so that i can move my crago ship and mining ships and so on with out losing the riggings my last point is my big one for me to buy stuff and have no lab tell me what sec of space it can be used in just sux buttox so in the marker or dicrition of a item would u be so kind as to clue people in what is high sec or low sec only please thanks kinadyan
i think kinadyan has a few good points perhaps not elliquantly spoken but it seems that he is trying to say that getting some explnations would be nice and perhaps some reperations for equpment locked to hostle space ie low sec also i think it would be helpfull if ships were listed by some sort of rateing system in there description at the vary least something that listed the minimum and maximum security space that paticular ship can travle in
orcas are capital ships in the same sense that freighters are capital ships they use capital components in their construction but they use gates and can be built in highsec rorquals fall into the same category as dreads and carriers  the true capitals if you will they cant be built in highsec they cant use gates they require the capital ships skill and they have a module that anchors them in place while unlocking the ships true capacitysiegetriageindustrial core yes they look the same to a builder but they are very different re mineral compression in highsec it already exists  its called a 50 refinery in almost every station refine it into minerals and move the minerals theyre invariably smallerespecially for ice re hauling of rigged battleships you have a couple options a highskill freighter can generally haul two at a time if you set a courier contract you can move them to lowsec and haul two in a carriers ship maintenance array you can fly a shuttle one way and a battleship the other until theyre all moved or you can sell them in place and buy new ones all these are annoying but moving rigged battleships should be a little bit annoying
thats a mighty negative stance indeed wanting something to be a  fail is bad enough but if he wants it to be less than a fail isworrying do we really need more  stuff
unfortuneatly the op is right
just imagine 50000 pilots building on the exact same spot on a planet just to  off someone and there is nothing that one person can do about ityeah he could order a planetary assault strike to be executed on the dust side of things by contracting some forces to assault 50000 bases build by 50000 pilotsi see an isk problem for the dude sins his pi base only makes him 05 mill a day if not less in other words no one is going to be fighting in dust sins no one is going to pay them to
nothing stops the dude from moving elsewhere
actually building right over top depletes that area faster and eventually each person there will only be pulling the minimum so its kind of pointless unless your just doing it for greifing goodness as for dust well we know absolutely nothing about how pi will be tied into that for the profits you are presupposing you actually know what value the goods pi produces are going to be sold for but we wont know that until a month or two into release
heres a theory based upon the analysis of a variety of sources pi is not intended as simply another feature of eve it is intended to provide a hook inducement to play for dust514 and in the end provide a synergy in play and marketing for both dust514 and evedust514 needs a hook if released on its own merit it might be just another combat game good but not a killer stand out from the crowd released with the hook of being able to interact with eve thats a very interesting hook and will favorably affect marketing of dusthow to get eve players to interact with dust514 get eve players hooked on pi give them a taste for pi let everyone who wants to get into it get into it let them build infrastructure let them become annoyed with people building on top of them and affecting their isk flownext start up dust514 no interaction with eve yet just build familiarity with the game mechanisms build player combat groups figure out tactics attract interest from eve players who know what comes nextfinally let eve and dust514 interact eve players want to protect the infrastructure theyve built conquer the competition to increase their isk flow and must use the players of dust514 to achieve thisthis will occur in all areas of eve regardless of sec status of the solar system and is not exclusively a factor in territorialitysovereigntyultimately pi will not fail in all likelyhood it will achieve its goal and make a great deal more sense once dust514 interaction is fully deployedregardswindjammer
that last part is true 00 sec is safer than parts of low secas to moons being absurdly profitabletechnetium 37k iskunit 37mhourdysprosium 20k iskunit 2mhourpromethium 15k iskunit 15mhourfirst you can see why the sc wants northern moons now as opposed to their old school dysproprom cash cowssecond you can see how little each are worth by themselves compared to rattingmining for the same period of time third these moons are defended by 10003000 characters so in a per capita sense they are worth little more than 14 million isk per month per character per moon and thats for the high end moons as compared to an rd agent which can net a character roughly 10mmonth per agent per characterlastly rd agents are completely safe passive revenue you dont have to worry about someone taking your agentso if you want to complain about passive income sources you need to look at the ones that net the most per capita passive income if an alliance could magically get all their characters to train to use 5 rd agents each and take the profit from this they would be rolling in more isk than an alliance holding a dozen high end moons
id just add a caveat no gcc from nongcc rr in lowsec but if you rr a 10 in highsec you do get gcce forgot my thumb
concord doesnt spawn when a 10 enters highsec  thats the faction police so aggression should naturally go to the faction police not concord and no that doesnt make a license to kill noobs in high sec since concord still responds as is appropriateliang
this happened to me on friday little fight in 00 jumped into low sec and repped one of the pilots who had been shot up bam gcc for me now im stuck in the system because i cant follow the gang
ok so i had a decent post written to reply but the forums ate it and im pretty lazy so instead ill just say fair enough
people of the assembly hall we have a grave threat facing us as we speak a tide of foul depraved threads lurk beneath the surface of this once noble and great forum ready to ensnare and drag down the innocent into a world full of twisted corruptionfriends i propose that we bring down the divine wrath of the hallowed moderators on people who are obviously seeking to defile this most sacred forum and have their presence purged from our soulstldr i think people who are obviously trolling and seriously its really not hard to tell should be banned outright for posting crap in the assembly hall some recent threads come to mind where the moderators seem to be clearing out all the trolls except for the one that matters the opim not saying ban everyone who has a bad idea but seriously is it so hard not to tell a mistaken idea from a troll
and yes ill probably be banned too then but its a price im willing to pay
plz ccp it was finally for awhile but it has become overly rampant stop the obvious and serious repeat offender trolls so that this forum can be for actual proposals signed
its about time ccp took care of something that is out of hand serious posts only plz
in an ideal world youd probably do it something like this1 idea is put in fi which now has a support thing like the assembly hall at the moment2 idea is supported by insert whatever number you want people3 it is moved to the assembly hall where it is still debated on4 csm take issue to ccp5 ccp implement itexplain why theyre not going to implement itthat way the players will self moderate the forums but thats never going to happen
supportededit had to remove my support as there was a pointer to towel hate i cant risk towels getting bannedi like towels
just because an idea is out of the box and you feel threatened by it dont assume it is trolling theres alot of great ideas from people like emo tj for example and tbh you guys just bully his ideas now i say if you dont agree to something explain why but accept that people are not all square
please do not question moderation thank you
i fear it is not only the assembly that needs a heavier hand but also fi stick a tldr version of the commonly broken forum rules beneath the login area and start enforcing them
this is something i have to fully support
letting the trolls run riot does not help the credibility of the csm
there is nothing more that really needs to be addedsupported
thisccp is pretty lenient with the trolls in other sections and i have no problems with that but keep them out of here this is a place for reasonable mature discussions not pointless and meaningless babble
this we are not talking about banning yet another hurt noob that believes that we should be able to shoot ninja salvagers me being one of them we will ban people that ask for towels we will delete topics that ask for doomsday devices on rifters we will ban people that ask us to ban the entire pandemic legion even if they deserve it
you lost my support here
a yesno vote that changes the ranking of a post would really fix this problem better than mods deleting horrible proposals
ccp hath forsaken us
got my vote regardsgil
i ment they used th old uido you oppose this or not support it aka idk
i do not support the proposal as it stands because there needs to be variety in prices i do support it as a complex solution under following circumstancesdifferent types of rats enhabit didferent sleeper complexesthey drop different proportions of different lootsdifferent ships and subsystems requre these materials in different proportionsyou can choose what you want to invent different prices are achieved by different building materials so yes and no at the same time yes as part of a small t3 production revamp on its own probably no
what  you can not be serious on this one do you understand that by buying the preferred subsys you subsidize the less desirable ones do you have any remote knowledge of the market your proposition does not make any senselook at the curse and the pilgrim they cost roughly the same sure why should it be otherwise they are made of virtually the same componentsyet the curse is traded roughly two times more often as it is more popular why should it be different for the t3 subsystemsin fact your suggestion would make the preferred components vastly overpriced look at caldari hybrid tech decryptors they already cost 20 times as much as the other races decryptors thats what happens when the premium and crap products require different materials the price difference goes through the roofit is also nonsense from a game balance point of view as you would have to rebalance the materials as well should you choose to rebalence the subsystemi would also like to mention that different sleeper types already inhibit different complexes and that they already drop materials in different proportions
gets my thumb
then how does pos bowling still exist it happens i cannot attest to the frequency or how small a ship can be bumped outside a pos but the article in op is evidence pos bowling still happenstitans are not the only supercapitals that can be affected by this
it doesnt what must have happened was that they managed to get the pos password and then they warped in some capitals with the correct password allowing them to enter and used those to bump out the titan
thisotherwise they would have flown off with the ship in all honesty
pos bowling is fixed for quite some time now
execution pos bowling is instant player account termination according to ccp regulationsif there still in game then they must have had the pos shield passwordccp will have to check all players involved in killing the ship to see if one or more of them entered the pos shield password that day around that timeif they had used the pos shield password then they had all the right to kill the ship
what is the point of the whole standings system if a simple password is all it takes to bypass itpos shields should behave like a solid object to anyone without blue standings regardless of access to password create a pos setting tickbox to allow pass to override standings ie as is if need bepeople can still pull their lameass metagaming to bump a ship out but it would require burning the infiltrator  riskrewardthe mass dependent bumping mechanic is already in game as far as i know whether it could do with a tweak is another matter
if you dont have the password you warp to 10km outside the pos if you have the password you can warp right to the pos this isnt an exploit this is bad security a costly mistakethis dev blog promises an end to this silliness poses will be able to be set based on alliance standings
no it doesnt actually standings are not used to give access to the forcefield so this will only mean that you dont have to set everyone blue on corp level to prevent your towers from actually firing on people
1 the dread that collided with the titan was friendly so it had the pos password2 this is not pos bowling you obviously have no idea what pos bowling is or was so i will explain it to youband of brothers was probably the most prolific abuser of said crime where 3 or 4 titans were warped at 0 to an enemy control tower of course being ejected again since they didnt have the password the fields were porous then you could penetrate at speed but would then be ejected upon ejection collision mechanics would drive other ships out at great speeds as the titans left the pos the bob fleet would usually be hot on the heels of the titans raping everything that got cleared from the shieldsthis was fixed three years agonow shields are solid state warping to a tower when you do not have the password stops you a few km from the shield edge read that as the leading edge of your ship is stopped a few km shortunless you have the pos passwordyou sir need a game mechanics review before this goes any further as obviously you are ill informed about how towers caps and super caps properly work in todays eveyea sure we could make pos shields standings dependent then when you keep a bunch of crap floating in your towers like spare dictors and logistics that many alliances leave in high value pos i can simply get an alt in to a group blue to you and come take all that stuffno actually thats a terrible idea
i kinda like that idea spy alts will actually have to be in the fleetpos to accomplish their ends
not really if your pos is set to allow blues in and you leave something in it me with blue standings can swing by that pos any time of the 23 hour day i want to liberate the item from the evil pos
thats why you are in pl and im not blue to you
ok so as people play with pi and then decide its not for them and forget about it we may begin to see a buildup of abandoned pi colonies on planets since decommissioning a structure does not return any isk to the player players have no incentive to clean up after themselves also there is no incentive to keep playing pi as you can let your colony go dormant and then pick it up again in 3 months with no bad effectsi propose 2 changes1 pi structures degrade over time if they are not actively used after all if you are not running production then the workers are bored and leave your facility since they have no work to do and maintenance grinds to a halt this could be a long period of time and progress in stages such that if you have no industry running for 2 weeks the various facilities begin to suffer percentage penalties to whatever they doextraction production storage pgcpu after 4 weeks the degradation is worse 6 weeks worse etc up until some point the structures become worth only some salvage value which is a percentage of the original isk sink used to build them at any point prior to a facility reaching the salvage value point it can be repaired and brought back online by the owner for a simple isk feelike repairing a ship2 a new item type in the ship scanner to scan for pi structures to display their current statedegrading salvageable for example maybe active colonies are shielded from scan salvage drones to salvage pi structures only after all you are in a ship in orbit and you have to salvage this stuff on the planets surface the salvage is simply a generic item pi salvage that can be sold on the npc market for a percentage of the isk used to build the structure in the first place by having an actual item instead of just giving an isk transaction into the salvagers wallet however this provides another opportunity for pvp as there is something to take and a ship must be in orbit around the planet he is salvaging in order for the drones to workas a side effect it also provides incentive to get out there and scan for planets with decaying infrastructure and for someone to remove it thoughts
allowing people to blow them up will solve the problem but this works to a certain degree as well
when we get to the point of allowing them to be blown up you simply apply the salvaging idea to the smoking wreckage as well
not for free nobecause theyd have to show up less less work for them  decent citizens get to share in the law enforcement cost saved both profiti think its really a psychological thing people have conditioned themselves to thinking youre nowhere safe in eve and i dont even disagree but much like in rl where people hire bodyguards and such what is so eve breaking about people buying new eden protection as well besides way i see it security is just a commodity like everything else why should it not be marketable nobody is laughing when i mention ship insurance why would hiring extra protection be any different if people can afford it why not because its a boost to old rich players as you put it well everything which costs isk favors rich folks we might as well abandon the whole market thenif you were to buy a rapid response plan only magic invincible npcs would be able to get there in time no one else can be notified and spawn out of thin air within secondsthe bounty system as it currently stands is pretty bogged we can probably agree on that transferable killrights would indeed already be quite an improvement like being able to outsource your kill rights to a security company you hired gonna have to think about that some more as playerbased security options are endlessly more complicated of course very sensitive to fraud for onei still stand by the idea of having a reliable marketable form of security though
why not just hire a corp
if people are ready to throw 100m isk to be protected why not hire a corp or pay alliance dues
someone find the km where emo died when shooting a ninja
hello i think this is an excellent idea it is well balanced and will make mission running in highsec much safer it will also force all pirates to use a hacking module in their midslot thus putting them at a severe disadvantage to me my only worry is neuts because npcs are easy to tank and a neuting typhoon could still kill you with the 500 repair amount increase i suggest you add neut immunity to the trigger effects of stealing will join your mailing list right away
you missed one
thank you for keeping this thread tidy haters are gonna hate i guessanyways back on topiccould you please be more specific on your problem with my proposalstay on topicstay on topicso you think being aggroed by an entire pocket is fair while the pirates come in to gank you
i am not sure if i support this could the op maybe explain why we need this in more detail
here
are we talking about lowsec or something i have not had any issues running lvl 4s where i have had to tank both the mission and pirates if it does concern lowsec then i have no experience running lvl 4s there so wouldnt know if not then why are pirates shooting at you
you dont have to tank the npcs specifically i use 1 rep dcii and 2x eanms regardless of mission npcs on my pve ships i also run missions exclusively in low sec since im an outlaw and no havent had pirate issues i try to ensure others do howeveronce again emo proves himself hopelessly inept at this game and demands an i win button because he pays his subscription i had avoided feeding this troll but too many have taken him seriously no additional protections are needed for players engaged in pve there are enough as is you just have to use that soft gelatinous mass between your ears a little
ssshhhim hunting wabbits
except that the gate is controlled by the npcs youre trying to kill so in reality it should work the opposite way the gate should need to be hacked by the mission runner but the pirates who are coming to save the npcs lets be honest they arent going to kill the npcs after killing the mission runner should have free access
since the elections for the council began me and many others dont know who to vote for as there is many holes in what the people are saying and i was wondering if setting up a channel in eve or a thread so we can ask the cantidates directly what they are going to do this can also be used to confirm possible rumers like the one about some council members wanting to move all l 4 missions into low sec knowing who if anyone is in support of this or not will help people decide on who to vote for
csm public channel exists and just about all the serious candidates poke their heads in from time to time regarding all l4 missions being moved to lowsec you can check the csm vote match results only four candidates answered strongly support to that proposition  corbeau lenoir chip mintago avicenna sarfaraz and darius johnsonwho has since dropped from the race only corbeau considered it an important issue a few others were somewhat in favour a proposition to do that might get 29 votes on the council if the voting goes as i expect it to and i dont think either of those two care enough to bring it up and even if the csm did bring it forward i doubt ccp would change it your l4 missions are safe
yeah this is an off topic thread the right forum for it is the jita park forums however if a csm is doing their jobs right they should be transparent in what they are doing a good proposal should outline the issues and proposed solutions along with pros and cons of the proposed solution a csms job is to gather the proposals write them up in a clear way and present them to ccp if a csm is pushing a particular agenda or is neglectful of the player demographic they are not doing their jobs properly and should not be supported csms dont develop the game and they have zero decision making power they can gather ideas and present them to ccp and then turn around and assure us that ccp isnt as dumb as some of the dev posts make them look
ankhesentapemkah please post a video pronouncing your name and explaining its originive heard plenty of trollsinsults talking in my time playing eve but i must say blaming a mother for her sons autism takes the cake autism is not hereditary just so you know ccp please introduce a kind of vote which cancels out a vote for a candidate i do not follow the csm closely so im not fit to vote i do however know exactly who i dont want in csm
you are either 1 a troll or 2 a bitter person who wants to spite others for the loss of your poorly fit internet spaceship please choose one
i havent read all of this thread but it seems to be about the journey of a confused 8 year old girl with multiple personalities sad
if you want to cast an antiankh vote id advise dierdra vaal judging by her past runs ankh has an effectively guaranteed seat on the council and i frankly expect her to do well enough to make a serious play for chair dv is the other serious contender for that spot that i can see and hes generally a reasonable fellow
aaaaahhhhhh i have an idea for the next csm campaign aaaaahhhhhh greate an alt named ankhesentapemkaa aaaaahhhhhh and ill get a buddy of mine to supply the passport aaaaahhhhhh repeat for number of buddies with passports

1 tell me how the resume thingy is relevant then you either are trolling or you lack the ability to focus on the things that matter if you think that it is relevant and thats what i said you twisted it into everyone not agreeing with me is trolling youre setting up straw man to make me look bad that is trolling in my book 2 her ideas are far from insane in my book she has very valid points if she says that outlaws have it too easy in hi sec hell even a lot of the pirate crowd says they dont care about sec stat cause you can still move about pretty much freely as long as you dont autopilot and hover in one spot for the record i dont think pirates are mentally challenged or immoral or something like that in that respect i seem to disagree with ank3 yes ank threw the psycho virgins comment right back in the trolls face or maybe you want to deny that comments like that are trolling if you then quote only ank you are taking things out of context which was my point4 no im not going to nit pick about every quote and post it anyone who does not suffer from tunnel vision can read the thread or one of the billion other threads or chatlogs posted here and see that things are taken out of context 5if you want to have a serious discussion stop twisting my words and start admitting things are being taken out of context when they are indeed taken out of context like my example since this repeat mode is kinda tiresome

mental note do not get sucked in to everlasting threadnaughts next csm election
i like the people who prey on those too lazy to read the thread oh yeah its just trolling ankh said it but yknow the context there is no context in which a representative should be throwing insults at people there is no context in which she should openly state that a demographic is inferior and needs to be punished not only in the context of the game but in person yes she did bring up a mental institution and on a softer note temporarypermenant bans for antisocial pvp activity you can cover your ears unless youre an ankh alt which would not surprise me and pretend none of these things were said or that theyre out of context but heres the rub ankh has not denied any of those comments she has not apologized for any of those comments if they were not what she truly believed i think she would say so dont you shes had what 12 pages to simply say i was angry at the time i dont feel that way or my opinion has changed or yknow anything but she wont do that she wont deny the statements because she still believes in them and thinks silence is the best way to deal with it and why not other bitter carebears will read that and cast a vote thinking theyll get back at all those evil mean griefers and so long as she can have alts  blind followers saying its not real its out of context well then that offers protection from anyone who might be offended provided theyre easily lied to  tldr answer me this if you cant answer the rest o poorly disguised alt how is a thread where ankhyou rant about changes she wants to criminal activity followed by a tirade of insults to the pvp crowd out of context in proving that ankh is biased you can see her opinions they are extreme they are openly stated in that thread not revoked etc saying theyre out of context is like saying that if a politician said i hate minority group and think they are all worthless it would be ok as long as it was not an official press release clearly if its not an official read riddled with half truths and lies to sound good statement its not how they feel right edit just throwing out an in before this post is ignored to pick apart something easier or a massive rant against a single line
boost concordboost hulk efficiency
i may not agree with some of anks ideas but i must say that do agree with many of her ideas i think having a voice on the csm that is different and shakes things up is greatlove it or hate it there is a large player base in the game that holds the same beliefs as ank these people want their voice and ideas heard and ank will bring those ideas to ccp through the csm process if elected eve is a sandbox and in my opinion ank is just asking for more tools to build her idea of a great sand castle i like that
you realize ankh has effectively been on every csm yes when she hasnt been on herself shes had a puppet on the csm ignorance is sadly a deciding factor in elections
yes thats what the whiners in this thread dont seem to comprehendin general i agree with anks views and those views extend way beyond her view on how to punish ppl who break the law in hisec and i agree with her general view on that too mainly ganking in hi sec has too little consequencesand like me there are a lot of ppl who support a lot of anks viewpoints again those viewpoints extend way beyond her viewpoints on hi sec crime look up her passed vote counts and tell me they were all ank alts thats another point nearly everyone supporting ank in this thread is called an alt at least one time this must either be an attempt to troll the supporters or and that would be a quite frightning thought ppl are so narrowminded that they cant imagine anyone supporting most of anks viewpoints i would like to make a comment on the harsh language being used i dont see why you should get mad by being called murderous vermin if you are indeed playing the game being murderous vermin and blowing up innocent ppl for no other reason than your own lulz or profit well dont be surprised if ppl tend to label that like antisocial behaviour its a game and i can see the fun of playing the bad guy i might even join the piwate ranks one day if only just to experience that aspect of the game but if you are playing antisocial psycho murderous vermin yes ppl are going to call you that
once again someone manages to focus on the unimportant details and leave out the main pointshe is supporting ank because he agrees with many of her ideasand his exact words are  i think having a voice on the csm that is different and shakes things up is great that does not have to mean that he supports ank cause she was never on the csm b4
i think jita should become a trade hub to be different and shake things upedit i guess there are some bitter carebears who can get behind ban all the pvpers though
weve already argued that and you know it stop trolling so again if someone disagrees with you then theyre trolling or if they dont focus on only one issue and go and discuss others why then theyre also doing something wrong again if you cant support ank without trolling maybe you need to reexamine your arguments i quoted what you yourself weer saying you said that people who thought that the resume was something worth talking about eg disagreeing with your appraisal were therefore trolling i know that an ankmeme is if my own words make me look bad then you aer trolling me but its not a very effective dodge paraphrasing her ideas doesnt get around her actual quotes saying that people who enjoy ganking should be locked up in mental institutions is infreakingsane which means your denial is hollow and your claims of context are deceptive she said ityah thought as much the one quote you claim was taken out of context was in fact not taken out of context and meant exactly what people said it did but you claim that there are a lot of others out that there are also inaccurate you just um hey look over there so in other words do not post your quotes if you think they make you look bad and start admitting that even though youre wrong and refuse to actually cite any evidence i should admit that your baseless and so far debunked claims are right hrm why does that seem a bit odd
this is a girl we should all feel sorry forshe tries so hard being confrontational and rude on the internet forums has thought her she can maintain the sad selfimage she hasbut when provoked a bit her idea of fighting trolls with trolls is to blame a mother for her autistic childbut besides her character and mental stability cleary being in need of serieus help lets look at her ideas about evecan anybody put forward an original idea of hers that even remotly makes sence in eveyou cant you know why because she does not care about evelet me repeat thatankhesmpatalkelal does not care for the game you playshe cares for herself and struggles whith her own worldcarebear voters there are much better and more reasonable candidates out there for you people who are actually passionate about the game you play
it seems that amongst all the discussion about how to attract more missioners to low sec no ones really asked them what their take on low sec is and why they do or dont operate there im not talking about opinions from pirates with mission running alts but from players whose main play style is pve so i created a post in missions  complexes to encourage feedback from this new eden demographicfeel free to chime in on that thread with your thoughts

i was commenting from the perspective that your publication is going out of its way to do thispersonally i am not opposed to the forum discussion on anklooks like an easy target tribune decided to jump onfrom a neutral perspective it looks opportunisticlets see if you take on tougher targets in the future thats why i posted still not making sense ps razor dude  i guess everyone that disagrees with you is a troll 
dear stovoankh is an easy target as you put it because she is so thoroughly clearly and totally awful as a csm candidate and yes we did go out of our way to do this we did so because we decided that it was worth doing whatever we could to attempt to convince people that she should not be elected because we believe she would be awful for the game if she were we have no intention of taking on tougher targets in future csm races because by definition a tougher target would be a better candidateso according to your reasoning the tribune was wrong to publish an editorial criticizing ankh because she is so utterly terrible a candidate that doing so was essentially shooting fish in a barrel and unsporting but it would have been ok for the tribune to criticize a better candidate because she would have had more of a fair fighting chancedo you have any idea how dumb this argument makes you looklovemiyaps your perspective isnt neutralpps id like to introduce you to my friend the paragraph you two really should meet sometime
as we come to the end of csm voting i would like to encourage everyone to vote regardless of who gets elected an increase in the voter turnout makes the csm a stronger and more legitimate voice of player interestsneedless to say i hope you will vote for me but i would prefer you vote for someone else than not vote at allbest trebor
while i agree with most of the things youve desired change as a ecm pilot i highly dissagree with buffing eccm or nerfing ecm the range nerf was bad enough range was the only tank avaliable should you be versing hostiles using different ships to the ecm you had fittedalso none of the other types of ewar are based also on chance all the others are simply based on your optimal with those modules in an ecm boat if you miss a jam on something within range due to bad luck chances are your going to drop if you dont get out of there before being tackled i had a spree of bad luck like this once even with only caldari ecm vsing only caldari ships 2 drakes and a crow 2 ecm on each and they all missed a cycle no need to state what happened rest of the fleet couldnt do anything to summarise the result and that was based on effective scouting most jamming ships wont be fitted out like that in a spur of the moment battlei also do agree with the ecm drones though theyre essentially a get out of jail free card against most frigates due to a lower signal strength so often have i heard over coms ive got him t nevermind hes away jammed by drones or something along those lines
so what youre saying is that you got really unlucky at one point and died thats life though not being able to jam a crow with a racial jammer is a little odd decent skills give you a 100 of a jam unless hes got eccm but just because its possible for a small gang to kill an ecm boat doesnt mean that ecm isnt disproportionately effective compared to other forms of ew for instance its the only type of ew thats really effective against the gang you just described td are pointless sds only serve to reduce their targeting down to point range which doesnt really do anything unless youre in a gang full of lacheses and tps dont do much against shield tanked ships that already have massive signatures webs are decent against the crow but a webbed drake can still hit you just fine also i have a video of me being jammed 4 consecutive times by a rack of ec300s in a recon while the odds of that mathematically are phenomenally low i believe many will agree with me that it happens a lot more than it should
i too am an ecm pilot the range nerf for rooksfalcons really wasnt a huge nerf in my eyes namely because i didnt dualbox a falcon on gates why dont i think it was a big issue well the range did go down  but eve as a whole got significantly slower a vagabond going 11ksec catches up to a prenerf falcon in nine seconds a 4ksec vagabond catches up to a postnerf falcon in fifteen seconds  and thats assuming your sitting still a falcon can mwd say 25 the speed of a vagabond  thats like a prenerf falcon mwding at 3ksec oh right and falcons can jam even harder oh and scorpsblackbirds can still sit at crazy range so yea i dont really see the nerf thereand i am fine with ec300s jamming frigates honestly i want them to do that what i take issue with is stuff likethese complaints arent just the crazy ramblings of unlucky people it happens it happens far more than it should and im fairly certain something is wrong dont get me wrong its hilarious a falcon missed a jam on my drake the other day and then my ec300s jammed the falcon
one day left so if you havent voted yet you should do it now
thank god this thread has remained clean 
wulfnor wants a free holiday
in my opinion it is time to flatten the tiers in some ship classes there are for example a handful of generally useful frigates and cruisers a few which have very niche roles miningscanning then too many also rans which exist just to be a base for the t2 variation slasher for examplebecause it doesnt take much time to train from one tier to the next there isnt really any need to have such a gulf between the terrible and the awesome in a ship class for instance very few people are going to use any other minmatar frigate than a rifter for longer than it takes them to train frigate 3 i think adding a slot or two along with a bit more pg andor cpu would make ships like the breacher more viable for long term useit is good to have variations between ships within class and also between different races but this should be on a role basis and not simply down to less overall slots and fittingthe ships are already in the game so a few tweaks shouldnt take a large amount of time and it would benefit not only brand new players but also those players taking their first steps into pvp agony unleashed pvp basic plug 
you got my vbotes i liked your performance
its been a while but you have my vote t
the csm thingyif it is cat i will delete this character and post on my mainus and if its ankh i will make a rage thread about how i am going to leave when in fact i will still be playingwtb resultsalso free masternerdguy

a vote for vuk and elven is a vote for a better evevote now elven click elvenlord vuk click vuk lau
hello elf lordi have an answer for you and a quite solid logical one at that its quite self explanatory really i believe such commentary and attitude are in violation of multiple agreements and would further constitute a negative image when put forth for review by ccpit is clearly stated in the rules of eligibility that ones conduct is a factor in granting an application quotecandidates are expected to be active on the csm forums and participate in the discussion of topics they are also expected to adhere to the eulatos and carry themselves in a manner that sets an example for other players to followsource
thanks to everyone whos pledging support behind my campaignif youve been paying attention to the test server development youll notice that ccp have rationalised the distribution of planets to be more consistent with the laws of physics so  great news there for the kind of people that care about it
wow a candidate that makes me think the csm wouldnt be such a waste of space with someone like you on it 2
last 32 hours or so to register for the politicssimulatorremember that you do not have to vote for tamber to enteryou do not have to vote at all infact er
tamber for queen you can has my votes
all my votes are belong to tamber
all my votes are belong to tambert
all my votes are belong to tamber
all my votes are belong to tamber
nvm 
i wasnt even going to vote in this farce however i figured if one of the candidates were to run and wanted to fix the t2 bpo farce yes there are a lot of these arent there then id vote for themhowever checking the candidates page and using my browsers find i cant find one candidate who wishes to get involved in thistoo big curly an issue
no its probably that most of them dont consider it an issue like a lot of the rest of the players
more of an issue is the number of people that continue to use an apostrophe when pluralizing bpo
there is an issueahhh you mean the lotteryi agree the lottery is unfair every day new people are selling their prints through some lotto on the sell forums and this is just wrong innit after all the winner of those lotto games should be ashamed banned with tar feathers and hmmm wow this is sounding fun and kinky but yea back to my original questionthere is an issue
you sure like calling things farcesid vote for a candidate who is going to tackle threads on the wrong forum
you could vote for cat i think she is the only active member of the forums that has promised to listen to the community rather than pushing their own and alliances agenda
what forum should it be in its a question regarding the csm i dont see a forum for it the question isnt about science and industry its about the csm candidatesso far all your posts are farcicaland i for one am allowed to poast when tired and irritated at not finding a decent csm candidate im just surprised it wasnt in caod
no csm has the balls to deal with this issuei would cast my 2nd vote to that candidate asuming voting hasnt ended yetthere is an issue if not ccp should go out and dispute community numbersremoving t2 bpo might not be the solution for the issue though
indeed i wasnt eluding to the fact that removing the bpos was the result i was after i would just like a far broader range of things i can make to sell
thisas far as i can tell about 90 of the earths population cant seem to understand how to correctly use apostrophes which is pretty sad
jita park speakers cornera less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar managementalso why vote cathe trolls the fourms is the only reason u know about him then untrolled and elected to join csmpeons comes to mindrant
the topic of t2 bpos is on the top of my things to discuss if i get in  so i guess that would be me your looking to vote for
what issue that some people have things you dont strike an emotional reaction in youill never have a state raven but im not going to csm all over it
state ravens are just nice to have they can in no way be compared to items directly influencing othersedit my 2nd vote will go to ombiezombie
 this which csm do i have to vote for to have this problem looked at
last days of the election dont forget to vote dv
cinori is the only one whos actually explained how the csm can have an actual impact instead of failing again youve got my vote cinori fix those little things
thanks for the support guys
last minute vote for you after a lot of deliberating i was sold on your entrylevel pvp platform so please try and deliver on it i would also like to mention that both elise and woodhead were close in the running for me and that if either spoke up during hopefully your term they would be worth listening togl
bump

yep pdf broken
last couple of days to vote  dont miss this opportunity to make your voice heard also voting for me would be nice 
although i dont know him ive only heard good things about omber zombie and hed be a great choice for chairperson with his track recordplus hes an aussie tamber
thread has been cleaned up please refrain from discussing real life politics and post in a civil mannerthank you
i lool at the csm candiates who are going to start  with other csm candidates before the voting ends then they have to work with each other in real life and its going to be awwwwwkwaaardi also throw mud at ccp apple babe for attempting to clean up such a thread as this
already happend
i really would like a pancake
sorry i thought you meant herethe elected csms should vote on who is chairman in the beginning reguardless of how popular a csm person is the group is going to work together if the person that everyone most wants to work with is in the lead i think my csm groupcsm3 got lucky getting a good chairman but it could have been really bad if we got a chairman that is determined to be a  like in a previous csm
maz csm can elect its own chair the publicly elected chair has to allow it though so far no chairs have taken this option
back to the top with you
i bet 50 mil that ccp is not going to fix it with tyrannis makes me wonder why there is a csm since this problem has been disscussed in iceland for over 2 times now
i would love to have a reason to fly my afs in pvp

id prefer to see a role bonus as opposed to a 4th not all interceptors get 4 bonuses either each frigate class shiptype is tailored around the original hulls they also come standard with extra resistances some of the highest in the game and extra high slot hardpoints this makes them quite a match against other ships in its class and im sure many a cruiser and battlecruiser has been lost to a skilled pilot in an af if youre dying in afs you need to learn how to shoot drones and dare i say it learn to stay out of web range the comments about blaster enyos is silly theyre far too slow for anything like that blaster ishkur sounds more reasonable but again when youre inside the 10km range anything goes that being said lets give them something else like a 25 increase in capacitor rate to make up for all those flashy modules which require tons of capacitor in relation to how much afs start out with standard that way theyll have a spitting chance at running active tanking modules as well as the repsboostersgunsabmwd you get the picture just my two isks
i am guessing your talking about the taranis which instead of putting two separate 5 to small hybrid bonuses they combined it to one 10 per level
like all hybrids need love issues supported
semantically more a fix than love supported
either blasters need love or blaster boats need unreasonably high native resists
eft dps of blasters is fine the main problem is to apply that dpslook at classes in fantasy universe there are archer rogue tank and other every class has balance tank has low dps and high defence tank can do low damage long time due to defencearcher makes medium damage at long range his tank is his speedrogue dagger has high dps but very short range he should has something to apply his high dps speed evasion or other tricks otherwise rogue will die without inflicting damage to targetso i hope you see some parallels caldari has range minmatar can kite barrage  tc or te  good range amarr has good buffer tank and good dps with scorch they have long range and still good dps  gallente has the shortest range and slightly bigger paper dps they have no speed advantage hull is not the fastest  armor rigs reduce original speed and agility they have no tank advantage active tanking is not good with cap eating weapon buffer armor tank is not so good as amarr little low slots no armor resist bonuses waste of active tank bonuses shield tank works but it works better on shield shipsgallente should be fixedsimple solution increase damage bonus for gallente ships from 5 to 75 per level slightly increase base tracking speed of blasterscomplicated solution total strategy change for gallente ships base speed increasing signature decreasing special bonuses like stasis web speed factor or other  i do not know but it is difficult becouse it interferes with other eve ships and items
hybrids definitely dont deliver the goods railguns are inaccurate and do very little damage statistically they are inferior to everything else but in actual gameplay they seem even worse that the numbers suggest blasters arent much better  their supposed to be the highest dps turret yet everyone knows autocannons far outdamage them and hit more often of course the biggest imbalance in the game are caldari missile ships that never miss can do every kind of damage and deliver just as much dps as the best turretsall without any of that falloff or optimal range nonsense oh and they cant be neuted or disrupted meanwhile between their inefficient armor tanking weak drones and terrible guns gallente are worthless
support
supported though itd be better for a lot of rework of lacking railboats than rails themselves

many broken things in industry that would need to be redesigned and fixed before this would become possiblei believe it was intended but then a structure was used without foresight which locked out most of the future possibilities and hamstrung industry
supported for mepe that doesnt require physical access to the pos similar to allianceas far as having someone lock up all your mepe slots and cancelling the job is concerned this is actually a money spinner all your labs are rented thats exactly what you want even better if all the jobs are cancelled you simply repackage the lab and open them up again  you get paid double you get the isk they put into the jobs the first time  there are no refunds if you cancel  and you get to rent the labs out a second time even if they got smart and kept one active job in the lab  its still fully rented which was what i wanted in the first placecancel as many jobs as you like ill happily repackage the lab if youve cancelled all of your jobs and then ill rerent the lab slots meanwhile the labs that are not publicly rented are churning out my personal research for free
i may be wrong but it seems this is at the heart of the problem without the factory manager role and the ability to cancel all corp jobsa user does not seem to have the ability to cancel their own jobs as a result of the database structure used once a user loses factory manager they are unable to cancel their own jobs for corp it would appear this wasnt foreseen and may have been broken when installations had queues addeda redesign of the core of industry will likely result in all these issues being easier to fix

sure ill sign it i agree that there should be a limit because probes simply cant reach that far but make the limit more like 45 aus from the nearest body that way deep safes will still protect you from anyone using the scanner and from people not specifically checking for deep safes but will be vulnerable to properly applied scan probes

destroyers are used as antisupportnuff said they can be sensor boosted to fux and be pod killashonestly theyre not broken they are just often not used correctlyin the pve realm its all salvage  if you can fly a cane
oh  yes please fix destroyers
this in not a discussion if they cdhould be boosted it wqas determined by the playerbase and agreed upon by csm and ccp that they need a look at and it shall be
ccp and the csm have clearly stated this will not happen since it would make destroyers wholly overpoweredin anycase destroyers do need to be looked at and no having an anti frigate role only is complete bull and totally limits the functionality of destroyers
personally i love the idea but here are two big red flags that have to be considered in the problem solving equation1 cost anaylsis  x solution has to be something of a cost effective approach2 game play  x solution should not be changing existing game mechanicsin terms of cost analysis any resources that get allocated to problem solving and ongoing support will be sucked away from other budgets in terms of game play in my discussions most legitimate miners would prefer that changes in existing game play should not be on the table its also my personal preference as well because when you change mining mechanics you have to change them across the board and im of the opinion that there is enough for a miner to do in null sec when mining dealing with rats and also keeping an eye in local for neuts or wts all at the same time that being saidwhere i have concern on this one is the ongoing costs basis of your proposed solution as a business manager i look at development costs in both options but in terms of customer support how many support tickets are going to be created as banned accounts protest well i will need to treat them equally as i treat all support tickets because we may have made a mistake now we look at the following scenario a im having to staff additional bodies to cover this ongoing support or b im going to let support levels fall the macrobot monitoring option provides for a much lower level of support where an account gets banned they get a termination notice that says sorry your account has been banned as a macro specifically weve found xyz macro software running while your eve client was running youve violated the eula and your account is terminated i mean lets be real here ccp targets a commercially available bot software specifically marketed for eve you will get 90 of the bots out of the game those who write their own or use macro software designed for other programs im sure they will slide by but this method clears out most of the cheaters with a lowest cost approachits sort of a we think you have your hand in the cookie jar in comparison to we know you have you hand in the cookie jar for lack of a better i havent finished my first cup of coffee analogyagain the idea you propose is one i really like but it just doesnt fly from a businesscost perspective its great way to do a onesweep but as an ongoing management tool i think its too expensivejava
i think you missed the point about what macro miner isthe whole point of macro mining is that you do not have to be anywhere your pc you say all they need to do is a do is a sound warning that implies that the person is by their machine 247 which negates the point of macro miningif i was going to macro mine i would simply install eve on my laptop no i dont play on my laptop but with a laptop i can leave running 247 without the wife shouting at me  create the macro in one of the many macro software tools which are on general sale for UFFFD15  30 dollars setup a dozen different patterns to different asteroids fields start it close the lid on my laptop and walk awayonce day i would check on it start a different pattern and walk awayby doing this it makes it much more difficult for players to spot that im a macro miner as i am not in the same spot over and over again so the chances of me being reported are very lowby using the method suggested i would also make the pop up appear at random time intervals as well i wouldnt be able to do this as i would constantly have to monitor it as a macro would not workas for those who are actually mining for real all they would have to do is every x minutes is press a button how is that annoyingwould this do anything about macro ratting and macro spam bots maybe not but the question to ask is what makes the rmt companies more money and how big a hit would they take if they were no longer able to macro minepsno i do not macro mine and neither do i support it in anyway shape or form pssseriously i dont
java buddy glad you relaxed on your last post thought i lost you to the stupidity of some people lol and ranka my dear most macro miners either a are rmt b are alt accounts that support a pvp main and there is no doubt in my mind that macro miners contribute as a majority of the plex purchases so they really arent spending any money to play the game also to help you all understand javas outburstwith things type liked no no no ccp has zero right to install that software on my system you are absolutely correct they have no right to install things on your system but you have to understand that people have no right to violate the eula nor do they have the right to make real money of a game created and copy righted by another individual or company also ccp does have the right to protect theyre assets by giving the option to the enduser to either accept the eula and its protection software or dont play as for ccp dying off with the implementation of this java can prolly work the numbers better then i could but last time i looked into it it was something like 15 million usd to develope an mmo and about 5 million a year to keep it running with what is it now 300000 subscribers in eve or something like that at 1749 usd per month per or 1049 per month if you pay by the year per subscriber they would have to loose something around 250000 subscribers for them to have any kinda hurt you have to understand online gaming namely pay to play online gaming is extremely profitable which is why the games that are free online games survive so well with sponsors etc also i almost forgot to add in there there are a few of us that possess a life time account which we never have to pay on again but that number isnt over 10000 subscribers being that they didnt offer it for that longhold on gotta site my work below or people will freak lola game time card is 60 days or 2 plex at 3499  1749 per monthyear subscription is 12 months for 13140  1049 per monthlast press release on user accounts from eve online is here 300000 subscribersi wouldnt doubt that the 300000 has grown being that number is from may 09 by the way for those obsessed with numbers 300000 subscribers paying the rock bottom price of 1049 per month still comes out to 3147000 thats alot of money in one month but you have to take taxes etc from it which would prolly drop that to around 15 million a month so again all you people saying ill leave the game if i was ccp id be rolling in my chair laughing in the end its up to ccp on what they want to really do either way they go they will loose subscribers and gain subscribers the question is do they want fake subscribers that when the game dies it really dies meaning everyone just drops because a majority of the subscribers are rmt or do they want it to die off slowly with a majority of the subscribers being real players also a game that has a majority of real players tends to last longer then rmt players and or having players that cheat on the game
also the other question that needs to be asked is if you were to take macro miners our of the game what would this do to the marketif say only 5 of ore is produced by macro miners then the effect wouldnt be that bad however if say the percentage of ore was more like 30 then that would have a massive effect on the market so those that just say ban them all it isnt that simple if the number was large then you would have to do it on a gradually so to lessen the effect on the marketafter all just imagine if 30 of the ore being mined in game suddenly just disappearedalso the argument that ccp are not bothered about macro miners because of the money they generate via subs is utter nonsensehow much money do think ccp are losing because people are buying isk via gold sellers and not plexs off ccpthe price for 2x plexes are 3499  UFFFD30  43  at the moment looking at eve market the cheapest are 300 millionso for 3499 UFFFD30  43 you can get 600 million iskvia a gold selling site you can 13 million isk for 39  UFFFD38  48so for a few more pounds  euros  dollars you can get more then twice the isk via gold selling sites so while macro miners are in the game and generating the level of isk that allows the gold sellers to sell twice the amount of isk then you can buy legit it will hurt ccpccp wants rid of these people as much as we do
i just started mining and you can usually tell who is macro mining and who is not i dont know the solution to this but it annoys me that it exists because i am waisting my time  as the ore i sell is cheaper than a macro miners ore they sellthey will always have an upper hand of having available isk to themlets say macro mining was 100 abolished i think this would improve the game i beleive as ore prices would rise more people would probably steal ore from us miners and therefore more wardecs would probably occure too but at least the ore i mine would be comparable to some mission items i get that i can sell for millionsim just a newbie player thoughcheers
usually if lessons are unfair you ca get the instructor fired can we do that to eve people
noyou might as well scrap the game altogether if proposals like this are allowed to flyor have i been trolled again seems likely
i support this topic for it even the ieee and icc international color consortium in real world activities is ultimately funded by corporation membership while a company does not need to adhere to such organizations it is founded to be more damaging to them than proactive if not why in this game we would make an exception is to only constitute greed or fear change is what makes this game fun and change is what should be welcomed
will be fun to see a missionrunner and professional salvager have salvage drone wars makes it harder on professional salvagers if they come on a domi or anything droneboat whip out the salv drones hah awesome idea
salvage drones are hidden away in the database somewhere or at least the skill to use them is in therei think it would be a bonus to mission runners and ratters at least you could salvage the nice big juicy wrecks during the missionif both the ninja salvagers and the mission runner had access to salvage drones then theres no change in the current balance i see vexors and myrmidons becoming the new salvage boats of choice while the destroyers and other bcs take a back seat while the battleships would field a flight of salvage drones to clean the choice wrecks during the missionedit added my thumbs up
im against this a salvager costs the ship its fitted to quite a bit cpu high slot 5 km range etc having it just as a drone would be overpowered even if the drone was 25 m3 a dominix would be uber in this caseits been suggested before and shot down not supported as it would be nigh impossible to balance the costs into a decent drone
only way to make this happend is by making the drones 25m3 and so slow that even an amarr bs coulb outrun the drones the salvaging itself should have cycletime of 10sec20sec and 15 of the succes a module have t1 drones compared to t1 module t2 to t2 so that one single module is as good as full fleet of dronesi do not agree anyhow with this it would have some advantages but also it would make the salvaging too profitable profession if 5m3 drones could do the salvage
how about tractor beam drones that you can send out to gather the wrecks you target a wreck and the drones go fetch it for you and bring it close enough to salvage that would save some of the salvage time without unbalancing anythingi support salvage drones and tractor beam drones both seem like helpful noncombat items and would add versatility to most ships
salvaging drones could easily work they could be similar to that of mining drones having a couple different types for example you could have a standard tech 1 which is say 10m3 that cant salvage anything bigger then a medium wreck and your salvage percentage is based on your salvaging drone skill then you could have the big one say the 25m3 that can salvage anything and everything but is slow also you could have a tech ii 10m3 that could do the same thing as the big one but requires a tier 2 skill trained as well as say salvaging drone skill level 5 say in the end you would need something cruiser class or bigger to salvage with drones it would actually slow some people down being that each time a drone salvaged it would have to return back to your ship much like a mining drone as for a drone boat mission fit being ubber lol not really because they would have to pull theyre drones in and send out theyre salvage drones potentially making the mission take longer being that they wouldnt have that extra combat drones out doing damage it would speed up a few things but you also have to remember you can only launch 5 drones max unless your in a carrier or super carriergonna support this one
i figure that most serious salvagers use a destroyer to clear up after their mission and since the only destroyer that has any drone space is the catalyst and thats only got 5m3 then i dont think theyll be a right lot of usenow id love to see t2 tractor beams 30km range and a slightly faster pull say about 700ms or so but i doubt theyll ever happen since all the anticarebears will winge
if salvage belongs to no one then neither should salvage drones if someone sends out their salvage drones i should have the right to shoot them down without any aggro or concord penalties they should be heavy drones top speed of 150 ms not be affected by drone navigation computers or drone navigation skill a full rack have the same chance as a single t1 salvager with salvage skill lvl 1 to gain salvage and have to return to the launching ship to deposit salvage they should require drones 5 and heavy drone operation 4 any salvage drones claim would have to be destroyed when they are no loot drops from destroyed salvage drones the base cost on them should be over 2 mil isk each with these stipulations they would have enough drawbacks that no one would bother using them because they suck and ccp can still say ok we put them in now shut up about it already well fix them soontm theyd be about as useless as all the other drones that nobody ever uses and no one complains about being broken
voting against this is a boost to missioning allowing bss to solo lvl 4s and then quickly mop up salvage with drones without sacrificing highslots to salvagers
supportedtheres a lot more that can needs to be done with the corp interface and roles  like being able to grant a role that allows you to grant other roles  hierarchical roles besides the directors  who are the only people who can grant roles now eg specify which roles can grant each titlebut im derailing so ill stop nowi suspect evegate might make some of that functionality easier to implementthis at least is one step in the right direction
this kinda stuff really helps with managing the workload within corps and alliancesi know this isnt quite the place but does anyone have a link to the thread about allowing jb fuelling by standings rather then by allianceonly i want to support that too
supporsed but  i read ccp simply has no bits left in roles mask a full remaking of roles system is needed

i have had the horrible experience of fighting 2 major 00 sov wars since dominion i think the jury verdict has become quite clear on the fact that dominion is worse than pos warfare but i think that the basic idea is fine so long as some simple changes are made1 reduce all station hp shields by 50 armor reduced by 75 and upgrade resistances to reflect similar hp the only thing worse than shooting these things atm is repairing them neither side wants to sit there for hours on end repairing them when they already have to spend hours repairing other lame things like pos repairing does not generate fun it hardly ever even provokes a fight so quit wasting our time2 reduce ihub timers to 1 day max reduce station timers to 15 days max this means the current system of 6 days is reduced down to 3 days for a station system this means way less camping and less options for staggering timers in multiple systems3 fix titans as predicted its really becoming wars about who has the most super capitals and even worse who has the most titans proliferation is at a ridiculous high for supers and its only going to get worse the only counter has been proven to be other supers atlas tried the gank a titan experience under the most promising of circumstances they had a leviathan at point blank with 0 cap and 0 hardeners activated their 60 capitals never got it below 50 shields before they lost too much firepower and his hardeners were able to activatereps kicked in fix the dd so that dreads in siege have a defensive advantage against them that does not allow titans to be the i win of fights4 cyno jammers are still a joke its way too easy to get a new one online when a cyno jammer dies prevent it from being killed and replaced force it to be repaired5 pos orbiting tactics are a joke ive said this for 3 years now that its a bad concept to have in game and an even worse concept now with super capitals everyone knows it not a full proof tactic but it is a very weighted tactic for the tower defender this is bad considering they already have a massive advantage with the tower gunsecmmods 6 slow bomber rof down 1 minute 50 second reload with max skills is way to fast to make a new bombing run either cut down the cargo capacity so they cannot do this as often wo restocking or cut down the rof to at least 5 minutes nothing else needs to change but allow at least some chance of actually having a fight wo needing to warp until you can do formation warping that doesnt stack a fleet spread across 200km on a 5km sphere when landing bombers will continue to be overpowered also cyno landing spots need to be a 20km radius not the current 5km 6 change sbus to a 1 hr anchoringonlining time create a module for the defenders to use to disrupt sbus after a 3 hr onlining span that cost 2x the cost of an sbu force more fights to occur during the wait time for ihubs and stations to come out of reinforced theres just not enough potential for fights atm similar to repairing stations nobody in their right mind wants to wait 3 hours to defend an onlining sbu knowing that even after its online they then have to chew through an ass load of hp on a station and ihub just to reinforce them in particular this hurts smaller organizations who already have a prolonged period of attack on the stationhub bc they are smaller those are probably the 6 most pressing issues with 00 sov
why yes i do agree defenders dont already have enough advantages they urgently need anotherdisclaimer no i dont
i think the bombers are fine as anti blob measurement especially as a smart fleet can easily avoid much damage with spreading out we dont need to make it easier for the closely hugging blob again
didnt you post a month ago that youve never run bombers and therefore cant be too sure there are very limited options for warping a fleet in and spreading out before bombs can hit theyre not good options theyre just all the game currently offers either that needs to change or bomb launch times need to change lol initiative guy talking about repairing stations as an advantage to the defender obviously youve never had to do this particularly in the buggy armor state nobody wants to spend 34 hours of their life repairing a station thats not an advantage for either side thats just bad game mechanics the game should not promote something so dull that it drives people away from the game
it was torothanax who wanted educate us on bombers although he never used them
caod  that way keep your smacktalk in there pleaseif you want hubs and stations to have fewer hitpoints thats fine by me but theres absolutely no excuse to make it even easier for the defender to ignore the first few fights and only turn up for the last one there are few enough penalties for the defender losing or not defending as it is
this is one thing i cant agree with if the attacker brings out the effort to do damage to it you should have to put effort into repairing iti do agree with 2 3 4 and 5 though i cant agree with 6 because i believe bombers are balanced as is already a normal bomber can only stock four bombs at a time
youre pigeon holing stations by saying it must take the same amount of time to repair as it does to siege but it currently doesnt armor triage is a very limited use tool which is why its so unlikey most pilots have it compared to dreads which have a variety of functions for use including combat sieging towers sieging stations etc and you realize the imbalance most carrier pilots spend a lot of time training for shield triage bc for years thats been whats important for the most part that still is whats important 50 dreads can nearly 1 cycle a stations armor 10 minutes 10 triage armor carriers with max skills and a gang bonus cant even repair it in 40 minutes since a triage carrier with 4 reps is about equal to 16 normal carriers you can virtually write off normal carriers repairing it honestly i could do without the resistances too but problem with that is the suicide effect similar to what was happening with sbus and speaking of which original post updated to include change to sbu
uhm  armor triage did i miss anything i always thought the triage module affects both equally  and i am pretty sure that almost every carrier pilot has capital remote armor reps trained aswell as 3 out of 4 carriers are usually armor tanked also repping armor of pos modules but please correct me when i am wrong
might want to break out specific ideas and into sepearate threads so each one can be addressed separately this could turn into a very long thread with varying comments where its going to be hard to follow specific subject matter people would want to vote onjust my 002isk
you are correctthe op is comparing two things that arent equal 50 dreads v 10 carriersit doesnt take much to see why 10 carriers wouldnt be on par with 50 dreadsedit as someone who has shot too many poss i like the new sov mechanic better than the old one i dont like the lag i still dont like poss as poss remain the passive income source for alliances as well as the location to jump fleets in and safe fleets up they remain the primary target of alliance fleets sov warfare is better but still needs work
ok then i have a number question for the opif 50 sieged dreads need about 1 siege cycle to reinforce a station how long would it take them without siegeandif 10 triage carrier need 40minutes to rep armor of the station back up how long would it take 50 triage carriers to rep it back upbecause imho that are the numbers you should compareand yes i think ccp was expecting to see fights when the defender try to repair the station didnt work out it seems i think not a single region fell so far where the defenders were really fighting back it was either wallet issues or the defender retreatingmaybe a system similar to taking systems in fw would help the whole blob warfare or having the carebear system indeces affecting the system security level that way you could break sov levels with roaming gangs  that way you might see sov level 4 dropping because there wasnt enough miningratting and you loose your cyno jammershooting structures for sov is utterly boring
so 50 dreads kill it in 10 minutes and 50 triage carriers rep it in 8 in other words what youre saying is that if you have gangs of equal size the carriers rep faster than the dreads dps and you think the carriers need the buff here
no im stating what is practical to expect in a large fleet in todays eve yes you can triage either armor or shields if you have both trained most pilots do not either requires the prerequisite of remote armor or remote shields to 5 whether theres logic or not for why people do or dont have it its just a fact that most will not train armor triagethis game is not made based on the what ifs its based on the practical nature of humans nobody is going to train armor triage just for the rare instance that they have to repair a station or ihub 90 of 00 now has absolutely no reason to train armor triage bc stations are not threatened however pos are threatened everywhere every day hence the high likelihood of shield triage pilotscan that change in the future absolutely but unlikely something you guys also fail to consider carriers are the only practical way to repair a stationhub every ship in the game including carriers are practical for reinforcing them so how is that balanced
could you please fix your terminology there is no armor triage or shield triage skilland your argument is still largely flawed as for fleet fights most people armor tank their carrier also the armor tanked titans and motherships are seen very oftenso i am very very sure that most carrier pilots will have capital remote armor rep skills or atleast you will find as many carrier pilots with remote armor repair skills as you will find with remote shield transfer skillsso please fix your terminology and try to find a better argumentthanks in advance
you dont train armor and triage skills for repping stations you train them for repping ships i hear a lot of ships armor tank
umm  seeing how much they get camped now while attached to a pos makes me doubt this ideajbs are the home teams personal trainline and they are one of the few defenders advantages while fighting on home soili do want someone to get them to fix the standings issue where you have to get someone from the alliance that owns the pos to dump fuel in instead of letting blues to itthat can get real irritating and its unfair to the alliance who own it people should carry ozone with them and pay their own way
at least they did a lowsec event nextdoor to me so i could pick off stragglerstons of fw people were doing it then adhd came in etc fun stuff wasnt online to watch the whole shabang but it was nice and chaotic
im just curious since the events started how many player ships have been destroyed by the event staffhow many of the destroyed ships were battleships or t2how many people get poddedplease dont say 0
 ryanqzqz  i know theres been some t3 losses tooid say theyre doing okayedit yes they are definitely doing okay also im thinking that my proposed fleet was too small
i was at an event a few hours ago in a navy domi it was what i happened to be in when an even sprung up nearby never got shot at so still have it
ouch
ok i suppose its not so badtho i still would have killed much more if i was part of the even staff any decent fc from a major alliance would probably make a big difference
why dont they use sleeper ai for this 
given how awful z are at ship fitting and flying i would have thought the opportunity to inflate your kb stats would be a good thing terrible idea ccp could fitfly the ships better ofc but good fun for the empire dwellers apparentlylol z cripesnot supported

as written this suggestion is senseless i could agree with using a special type of server object that shows up as 0 points on a killboard hint kills of concord battleships are showing up as zero points alreadythe killmail is like that spoon from disneyland that youve had since you were 5 or that shot glass from the mall of america or the tshirt from your first concert theyre trinkets to show you went to the event many of the comments are worse than senseless these events are not about carebears or pvpers or rpers  theyre about expanding the storyline of new eden these are for all of us if you dont want to go fine if you want to go greatthese events are as much about pvp as anything else  in lowsec the remnants of the battle usually turn on each other except when an overwhelming force from one faction or another is on the field
oooooooookaaaaaaaay take a moment and consider what would happe with that many players injecting datacores into the economy having taken the aforementioned moment what do you think would happen im looking for something along the lines of supply exceeds demand the price plummets and all those players are suddenly earning comparative zilch but feel free to choose your own words another way of looking at it would be to consider this if it were really that easy they would have done it if through nothing more than alts using a fraction of their massive income to purchase plex and thus be freefood for thoughtwindjammer
datacores only yield 10mmonth then what the hell is all the fuzz aboutthat is 30m for an account 360m per year  so once a year you can buy a plex or pay rl money do some shuffling around and let account go dead again with no actual profit made  seems like a pretty poor deal to me which just happens to be why i sold my research account by the bymoons and soon planets provide income that is entirely ingame with no rl ties at all so after the setup is paid it is all profit null planets will be absurd printing presses as they cannot be destroyed like pos and are under the umbrella of a bazillion capitalslowhigh planets also cannot be destroyed and the umbrella may extend to some but yields are scaled so low that some will probably never get into the black once nullsec starts flooding markets with their gunk that is before factoring in the much higher random neutral traffic most of which is more than happy to gank a hauler or two non negotiable space needs to be able to impact pi operations destroy some structures that must then be repaired ie no added cost purely a time sink but time  isk gives small strike teams something to do in null low and highsec scaling between lownullsec needs to be a lot more even allowing null the advantage of being able to sell products below the price that lowsec pays to produce same and still make a huge profit is just stupid competition will be nonexistent except between the null powerblocs and they will probably create some nefarious cartel  failing the scaling part give lowsec planets a monopoly on some or all of the highend processes so that even nullsec has to gohaul there for complete chains or sell on markets letting lowsec do the work with a profit

nofrom the op in the otif you do not want this problem make sure you dont have pirates in your fleet stop flying with boneheads that pod people for the squish without regard to their standingsstop flying with people that cant take 30 seconds to pop a rat as they are wanderingnegative status is not suppose to be easy there is no reason to make it easier when the fixes for the problem are already therei thought this would be a thread about the neutral logisticss during high sec wars which is a problem instead it is a pirate whine i want to be bad but i should not have to pay for iti personally giggle when i see a solo red in a gang in low sec never had a single one ever get away lots of tasty 2t kills because some lazy pirate cant keep their sec status under controlbtw i have flown with red flashys in fleet if i am fcing it is their problem still i have flown with a red flashy as fc i like flying with them as fc but i never will do it again if they are red flashytldr no problem working as intended
i do not mind taking a gcc when i or my friends are being bad but if neither i nor my friends are being bad then i should not take a gcc i should not take a gcc when missioning or plexing for example
if your sec status has dropped below 5 the consequences should to be extended beyond encounters you engage in so gcc for repping someone with bad standing sounds fair to me
supported
a forum of this size with no way to search it seems ridiculous a configurable search would almost certainly cut way down on the number of new topics since people could find and join existing threads imagine if you could find stuff using googlelike searches or search by poster date etc i dont know of another major forum lacking these basic functions ps if there already is a search feature i sure as heck cant find it
there is a search box on the upper right cornerbut i prefer
chribba already did it its linked in the post above ccp can save the development time and use their developers for more useful things as long as chribbas around or they could just buy chribbas code ifwhen he no longer wants it
also they are already working non a redesign of the forums that will follow the release of eve gate my hope would be that they address this at the same time  along with the host of other features these forums are lackingfrankly it would be better if they took an off the shelf forum package and simply wrapped it in custom css
ahh yes gankingbut also regular stuff tooif you are the instigator   lets say you can flip  then if you get killed during the aggression countdown then i was saying  your insurance should not pay out you started the fight and lostcheers
what good purpose would this serve
how about we get some mods that increase damage of drones we get mods that increase damage of everything elsegallente are already weak thanks to blasters being  so why not have some hi slot modules that increase drone damagelike a generic t2 drone damage increase would increase drone damage but these modules would have to be activated and ofc use capthere will be small  medium  large and capital any ship can use it but drone boats would really only benefit lets say they have the cpu  powergrid equivilent of guns  launchers to prevent abusei for one would prefer to have my drones do the damage rather than me
the ships that will significantly benefit from this module aredominix rattlesnake giladominix is already powerful mainstream small gang pvp ship it can deal very high damage with full blaster set or have soso dps but have full rack of neuts making it very deadly to anything without a passive tankrattlesnake and gila are faction ships so it is ok for them to be overpowered to some extent this ships are drone ships like the dominix only they have shield tanks so their low slots are available for full stack of damage modswhile it would be really fun to fly those with drone damage mods i fear that it is a bit unbalanced due to the fact that these ships will field high tank and high gank setups with all high slots free perhaps you you agreed to take 2 high slots away from every drone boat it would justify ability to fit drone damage mods but people wont stand for such changes
actually now that i think about it it would be fair if drone damage mods were high slot and offer about 15 more damage as opposed to 22 with other mods
i should add the mods will do damage to drones of its size with the exception of the current drone boats like ishtar  domi
yes please
im getting tired of people trolling every damn thread i make especially when i do a balancing one in assembly hall better moderation would be much appreciatedsupporting
the irony is killing me
supported however i would like to say those who act in a way to demean belittle or berate a poster should also see the same treatmentthe collective is to discuss possible ideas and solutions to in game problems theres no need for some of the things that are said to other people just because they disagreeso thats just a pipedream i know but how about we plan on them being both lazy and rude and give them an option to just vote no on an item
supporting a catclone postim guessing emo or musical troll has posted something in the past 3 days that was lolable
lol
i am strongly against overregulation that said i must support the proper use of moderation in order to maintain the function and usability of this forum call the troll on it and if their responses doesnt show they are serious about their questionissueproposal then temp or permaban their character from this forum a little banter is no problem to anyone trolling is besides being just plain annoying so moderators lets please have some effective moderation here
trolls arent just in the assembly hall theyre all over the forums not even isd seem to be capable of telling the difference anymore as the recent article on pls fist formations or whatever has indicatedso im signing this but only as a first step trolls will troll for as long as they can get away with it so simply put they shouldnt be getting away with it the only answer is more moderation but not just in assembly hall but across all of eveoben
how about this idea we can turn off sunnebula flare effects its driving me insane i cant see my controls or the hud half the time and frankly it hurts my eyes after a while even if i had to reboot the client to change this id do it happily
yep so do most pvp gamers they behave exactly the same fighting and trolling carebear threads insulting offending and flaming people who play the game in a different waydo you speak again about the majority of pvp kids out there i mean have you seen and looked at some of the pvp threads about the ideas from the hardcore pirates what to do with empire and minersso you talk about those guys cuz what you wrote here perfectly fits to griefers and gankerslike like this guy here
ank after reviewing most of the candidates for this seasons csm i was looking for professionalism in their presentation and evidence that the qualifications are present for such a role for csm i may not have agreed with your rp terms in the past and much of the ingame quarrels that were stirred however i recognize that this is not a role playing event for csm so due to your professional ability to present your campaign your background and career irl i have decided that you get my vote though small i hope other readers take notice of the same that i have  btw loved the background action ships flying by in your video interview
they dont try to hurt people by blaming them for their autistic childno it doesnt at all and that you are not able to see that means that you are either yet again ankh or indeed only 30 days in the gamethe main point is that ank does not understand eve does not even like it how can you expect a person who does not feel passionate about the game do a good job as csm memberissler dainze
because clearly ankh  corbeau
yes but do they then expect to be elected to the csm
yes they do
ankh is the greatest eve player in history think about it the point of eve is to achieve whatever you set out to do make a net profit in the process and crush those who oppose you ankh is merely doing it on the meta level she has set out to castrate eve this whole talk about trying to get faek work experience on cvone shows possible indirect profit angle and if she succeeds she will destroy the game for all those she dislikesshe uses tearladen carebears and other hello kitty refugees the way 00 alliance leaders use their drones she social engineers with the best of them just look at this thread and her campaign and she mad the quintessential eve playeri didnt vote for her because despite the massive trolling potential she is so nuts and antieve that youd have to be profoundly handicapped to actually do so but i will certainly applaud her if she ever succeeds in the task she has set herself
in much the same manner as jita scammers spam mails to people in station ankh has been doing the same in motsuheres a mail i recieved just before downtime so the gist of the message is 00 sucks but its ok my alliance isnt a powerblock we dont hate you like they do look heres a video dont want to watch it then vote for me anywaytldr im leaving eve to play puzzle pirates and need a csm vote to put on my cv send me a vote and i will send you 6 back
in short ankh is the greatest goon
she surpasses even karttoon o all hail eva o
name a carebear thread that isnt nerf pvpers so i dont lose spaceships you are not morally superior just because youre afraid of losing your spaceship get over yourself although i see where ankh gets her supporters from
at least thats a step in the right direction you acknowledge that there is a playerbase that supports ank till now ank alt1 was screamed nearly every time someone said something that could even remotely be interpreted as support for her now all you have to do is convince that playerbase that getting ganked is actually good for them good luck with that
yeah of course there are a lot of helpless people who support the candidate that can make sure they dont have to use their brains funny thing ive never been ganked in all my years of eve i must have superpowers or something or i take responsibility for my own safety rather than crying for the devs to do it for me  you are still an ankh alt
true most ganks can be avoided i never got ganked in hi sec in the years that i play and i did not need superpowers for that either you are still a whining troll
and yet you think the people who do get ganked shouldnt be held accountable you think they should get a free ride and a hug just for signing on cause thats pretty much ankhs platform shes even mentioned banning people for ganking as a good example of a justice system
rofl yes lets hold the victims of crimes accountable for being victims she deserved to get d cuz she did not fit a proper tank your honoryoure a real piece of work buddy and on the banning thats never going to happen and ank even said herself that such a system was not for eve
this is a video game im not sure if you noticed comparing getting a pixel spaceship blown up to a real crime is nonsense its not against the rules to shoot people only against the laws which are designed to be broken yes if ccp wanted no pvp in empire theyd simply make it impossible to do youre also assuming this is a world where something other than your own choices effects your circumstances so yes yes it is the victims fault its less person d and more person wanders into warzone gets shot they knew the risks going in and the way eve is designed its impossible to get ganked unless youre stupid  putting yourself in a situation where you have no control there is no reason you have to choose to be vulnerable but plenty of people do and then are simply shocked when someone takes advantage of that remind me again why we need to protect stupid people in a video game about a harsh and unforgiving universe
you really have no idea how stupid you just made yourself look do youthis is actually the whole point this is what you and almost all new players dont understand about evepeople enter this game with previous mmo experiences in mind thats why almost everybody will rage disproportianlythe first time heshe gets blown up its why most new player dont get why people pod eachothereve is another kind of game you cant compare what you would consider griefing gameplay to griefers in for examplewow on a pvp server completly different concepts applythe day you understand that is the day you will see how big an idiot youve made of yourself
theyll never see that they think blowing up a spaceship is comparable to a crime i cant mention due to a wordfilter they want an all powerful entity to protect them from the world because they sure as hell cant be expected to handle things themselves they subconsciously and hopefully fallaciously seem to believe that other people are so vastly superior to them that they cant possibly stand a chance against them they cant outfight outsmart or outplay people and thus theyre helpless and need protection from ccp realistically they could but theyre crippled by their own fear i mean honestly do they really think pvp players are some sort of unstoppable evil gods or something a different species which theyre completely unable to compete with id like to think they have a bit more self esteem than that but no even an army of invincible unstoppable unavoidable npcs who kill anyone who attacks them is not enough to put them on even terms with those crazy pvpers
your new vid baffles me i never thought it possible to make yourself look even more snip removed insult shadow than you did in the old vid it makes me wanna cry and when i read your posts o m gi dont mind carebear candidates but you please leave our game alone you can have all my stuffplease im begging you please

you take your internet spaceships way too seriously mkayi would like to thank all the antiahnks for giving her so much publicity that any nonpvp minded person in the game who hasnt been living in a veldspar roid for the last month now knows who she is and how much she annoys pvprs hell with all the free publicity given to an alleged antipvp candidate she might even end up on the csm as chairperson i think your editorial might have been far more effective if you had ignored the person and instead let her threads die for lack of use guess we shall see very soon but i fear that all the publicity is going to ensure her a place on the 5th csmgood job guys
she was going to win either way she has her constituency and itll vote for her no matter what we say and its not like we can say anything to change their minds because theyll interpret any of our complaints as evil pvpers trying to ruin their game the harder we hit  even if its justified  the less theyll listen all this is a fart in a windstorm for her chances tbh the electoral system simply doesnt make it possible to attack someone out of the race which is good in principle  it ensures even the small disliked groups get representation  but man can it be annoying in practice
because for some reason ccp did not recieve my application for csm i have to vote for the next best thing so far the best is hands down ankhesentapemkah the only thing the rest of you know how to do is complain about lag and being blobbed outnot only do you clearly not get eve but you cry about making eve into something it is not my vote goes to ankhesentapemkah
look look all the kewl pvp kids the gankgriefers and wannabe pirates come out and cry here ohhh the irony so much whine from the cool class of eve from the people who cant accept and face the fact  the reality  that eve is not only a pvp game but as well a pve game and now those who redicule and mock about the so called carebears and their whines are whining for themselves because a person is nominated who stands up for both sides pve and pvp i wonder why no campaign was started against those csm candidates who wat to nerf the  out of empire carebears its all so obvious deal with it and deal with it in an educated and mature manner now us pve players us suicid gank victims you laughed so loud at we have a candidate as well you like pvp you are one of the kewl kids well time to respect our candidate as us pvefolks pay as mch for this game as you do now go gank someone and cry me a river
when exactly did ankh start standing up for pvp because last i checked she considers shooting other players to be immoral also precisely which csm candidates want to nerf the  out of empire carebears i actually looked into peoples answers on csm vote match there are exactly zero candidates with any hope of winning who are strongly in favour of moving l4s to lowsecthe standard measure of how much you want to nerf carebears and three serious candidates who are even vaguely in favour the idea that theres any sort of serious movement afoot to wreck empire is sheer fantasy
hello alt ps post with your main
this post is pure ressentiment judging by your post youre not voting for ankh because you think shes the best candidate because shell improve the game the most because her ideas are the best because you think shell best represent your interests no youre voting for ankh because you want to stick it to pvpers who you resent for being the kewl kids and the best way to stick it to said kewl kids is not to vote for a highly qualified reasonable rational carebear candidateof which there are severalwho will best defend your own interests no the best way to get back at the pvpers you so hate is to vote for the most flagrantly unqualified crazy inflammatory choice available this is sad for two reasons first pvpers are not your enemies out of game we carebear ourselves we depend on carebears for our ships and modules and we want carebears to prosperif only so that there are more targets second pvpers are likely to get several seats on the csm anyway perhaps even a majorityalthough they will likely be split between the nullsec and lowsecempire crowds who actually have some fairly divergent interests this means that it is all the more important that pveers industrialists carebears etc receive the best representation possible something they simply will not be getting with ankhbut you dont care about any of this all you care about is making some futile pointless selfdefeating gesture to try to upset those arrogant liberai mean those arrogant pvpers youre cutting off your nose to spite your face as is every carebear who votes for ankh simply because she es off pvpers
actually the reasons why i vote for ankh are my very personal concern last time i checked this was a democratic election so the specific reasons for voting a party or a person has not to be justified to the public be assured though that i do indeed think that ankh is my candidate and will represent and advocate my interests in the best wayi do not hate anyone here why and how should i i dont know the persons behind the pixels but i know and i read here a lot of statements that are a testimony for the opposite the pvp crowd hates the level 4 mission runners in empire they want to get rid of level 4 missions in highsec and so want their csms they want even more suicide ganking they cant stand a carebear in a marauder or faction bs and they lookout for easy targets in lowsec yet they complain that no one comes to their lowsec no the haters here are the pvp crowd as you can see judging from this thread or from other threads where they insult and ridicule carebearsand for the record ii do not think that ankh is flagrantly unqualified crazy inflammatory choice available not more at least that some of the other pvp csmcandidatesthen explain to me why they constantly insult and offend and whine about carebear whines then explain to me why they constantly demand a drastic cut to empire actionscontentincome instead of asking to boost their part of the game that phrase made my day you want carebears to prosper then explain to me please why the majority of your csm want to cut off carebear interaction in the game let me point you to an infame example
hello trollthis is my main i came back to eve from a 2 year break and started a new toon so deal with it even if this would be an alt  which is not  what makes the differenceso the call to nerf carebears is sheer fantasy ya explain this to me then
no seriously post with your main
stop trolling this is my main believe it or not what would it change anywayyour more or less rediculous oneliners and your hatred towards ankh made my day though
resonanzatitle elite pilot elite pilot ed lawlmember of die rotweissroten piloten rwrpfor 1 month and 9 daysdie rotweissroten piloten from 20100408 1444 to this dayhedion university from 20100405 1448 to 20100408 1444nice main bro quite a remarkable coincidence that your character was was created exactly on the 30day csm voting eligibility deadline
thanks but i am a sis browell if there is some sort of deadline for what actually then thats a coincidence indeed up to last week or so i didnt even knew about the csm programm and the electionsbut how is that related to this topic
hey miyamotowhen i say tougher targets its other csm candidates with questionable history of performance in csmim stating it from the perspective that tribune only diverts from reporting the news if there is an a target of opportunity a soft targeti never said you should go after the good targetsmy perspective is neutral i have no allegiance to ank dont know her nor have i voted for her i like reading the tribuneinitially i saw that she put in effort compared to many others but after reading her manifesto i could not agree with that  my votes  interest is in what teadaze has to say ps i could care less about paragraph or semantics like you forum warriors next stop my grammar above is an example of how you guys exaggerateruin the game  ankh has already been on csm eve does not seemed ruined for melol at insinuation ccp is at the mercy of ank the publication seems to imply that every single thing that comes out from ank is toxicthat its not possible that some of her ideas will be representative of certain segments of eve  provide counterbalancenor that there is a possibility that she can put forth decent ideas in the course of the csmsometimes good ideas start off as something totally differenteven ideas that look great on the surface  cosmetic  and sound very great from the hype might have unintended consequences once implemented in evemiyamoto the reason i posted in your thread is not to support ank rather how your publication is coming off in this episodeviews varypss  csm scrum or whatever is not the only avenue to identify issues in this game ccp developers would be aware of many issues that plague this game its the will of ccp that is lacking
accounts are only eligible to vote for a csm candidate if theyve been active for 30 days or more prior to the beginning of the elections the elections began on 050510 your character was created exactly 30 days before that on 050410if i were going to run with the why hallo thar alt theme i might point out that for a newbie and if youve had a two year break you are a newbie for most purposes the game changes youre taking a remarkably pronounced interest in the csm forums i might also point out that if one were looking to maximise ones voting power using the buddy program to create three new accounts just before the deadline and then trashing them after their 51 days were up would be a pretty costeffective way of doing things
hi ankh lacking supporters lately i guess your alts is making up for it but be nice to your poor keyboard it must be burning hot with all the typing
ahh ok i see well you might point out whatever you want i came back to eve iun late april and created this new toon what ive experienced since that in the last weeks was mindcrushing basically eve changed totally from my first approaches to this game in late 2004 to nowand it didnt change to the better where highsec was somewhat highsec it became now ganksec i was hauling my first million isk in my hauler to jita when i was ganked there i asked the suicid ganker why he did that and he said he would make isk even ganking an empty haulerthen i researched this very board and i saw this issue addressed here and many similar carebear issues addressed here and i was the responses from the piratekiddo players as well the responses and comments from some of the csmsno csm has the right to complain about ankhs voice standing up for the carebears and no pvp griefer has the right to do so eve became gankcity and kidgriefcity and believe me there are a lot of ppl out there playing this game who are not vocal on this board and who do not like the way eve is going due to the vocal minority here looking for easy targetsthats why i was researching the boards and why i and my family 3 more accounts have voted for ankh we like to have our small corner in eve without some stupid suicid ganker who ganks oftenonly for lulz and giggles why even have highsec if it is not highsec
hi trollhi griefer1becomming desperate because more and more people support ankh and her attempt to make eve better for everyone not only the pvplerswell i got news for you i am not ankh as you can clearly tell from my bad english but my whole familly will vote for her believe it or not who cares believ whatever you want who i am and make yourself look even more sillybut something is surprising that you are creeping out from under your puny stone of oneliners makes me beliebe that someone hit a nerve there
and yet then you got 11 accounts from you and your family members all to vote for ank what a coincidence post with your main how odd and just a few days ago you were saying it was 11 votes just one of those coincidences just like you come back to eve after 2 years make a new character just in time for the csm elections immediately convince your family to go vote for a candidate and somehow the actual main character you had two years ago gets lost in the shuffle evidently along with 6 accounts somewhere between your initial story and your new one post with your main welcome to eve where there is only one server its a pvp server and ccp designed it so that undocking is consenting to the possibility for pvp there is no such thing as safe space only safeer space and high sec is much higher security if i ganked you in nullsec there would be no guantee that id be hunted down and popped in high sec its an exploit if im not hunted down and popped by concord this is just basic eve stuffoh yeah post with your main its not an example of how i exaggerate its an example of you distorting what i said i said that is what would happen if she was actually able to implement her ideas has she in fact been able to implement her ideas like banishment to lowsec for anybody who executes a highsec gank no then not only was there no exaggeration you ignored what i actually said more dishonesty i pointed out what would happen if she got her ideas implemented the fact that her ideas are so insane that ccp would never take her seriously and thus the people who are voting for her are wasting their votes in any case is kind of the point its why i pointed out that an empty chair would be better than ank
finny you lost the discussion at the point where you just went into a personal grudgematchi know for sure you would never make a good reporter or politician because you totally lack the ability to listen to what the opposite side has to say and keep on drudging out the same semantics over and overand if you would have read my mock editorial then you would have replied in a whole other way but you clearly showed that you only respond in a manner which takes part of a post or a fragment of an expression and you gon about thatyou are nothing more than a populistic backstreet caller who is trying to build up a certain reputation with a certain crowd by calling and flaming just a bit louder than the restyou have totally no intrest at all in the well being of eve but merely are out to get more fame and since you fail at it in style you choose the next best way the way of the bitter little nerd
hi enraged trolli aye 11 accounts 3 accounts for my close family and 8 others even 2 more when i think about it  from relatives and friends who got me hooked up againthis is my main deaf enraged trolli yep dear enraged deaf trolly just like you wrote btw i never lost touch with eve since my family has always since then played it activelyand this is my main trolly do not become too much enraged think about your blood pressure it only makes you look silly and dumb and like a 12 year old kid stomping with its feet on the ground that very same server is a pve server as well did you forgot about that dear enraged trolly nowaydays there is no safer space and higher security highsec became useless lets talk again when ccp introduces real highsec space by removing insurance payout from suicid gankers and more harsh sacntions against suicidersoh yeah and you should really stop stomping with your feet on the ground it makes you look even more silly cutie trollyedit did i tell you already trollyfinny that you sound and look like and enraged kid stomping with its feet on the ground because it didnt get the cake post with your main wah wah wah this si not your main wah  wah wah i want to know your main wah wah wahbelieve it or not no one cares but there is no santa claus and this is my main trolly
mmmm hmmm 11 accounts no wait four accounts no wait 13 accounts but your account which you started two years ago mysteriously has no characters on it and only had a 1 month old character your main post with it
you arent a very pleasant person are you
exactly well kid you might realize that some of us are older have a familly have a job need to care for kids and husband and well it might elude you but some for some of us the world does not revolve only around eve and how to gank the next targetbut finnytrolly i understand you perfectly my kids are the same like you in school they sometimes only think at eve they cant wait to get to the pc turn on ts and have their funi unfortunately i cant afford that kind of life anymore and thus eve became less important to me i lost the data of my old char so i am starting over so what trolly finndoes that hurt you personally does that violates your naturaly eve law is eve now going to explode in your head trolly i told you already everything will be fine and no you cant have the sweeties now and no you cant watch tv now you need to do your homework first and no stomping with your feets will not help it and no the world will not explode just because there are 1 month old characters posting on the boards i know dear trolly finny you cant stand that but what are you going to do about it nownow you have two reasons for your miserable life ankh and a 4 week old character sorry about that but eventually you will be fine again i promiseme puts a lolly in finntrollys mouthoh  i only play on the same level like that finnyguy there actually i am an easy girl to like but sometimes certain people will not understand until you show them their face in a mirror
you can not possibly lose the data for an account you go to my account put in your username and then click on the link right next to forgot you password and if you forgot your username you just check your email for an activation email from ccp with the title eve online registration confirmation where it tells you your username post with your main
i didnt knew that as i said eve is not as important to me as it is for you obviously and what do you do if i wont do that simply because i cant do that trolly well i could create another character and tell you that is my main would that ease your pain kid because i am a nice person i would do so if that suits and comforts you you seem to be very obsessed by that post with your main thing poor dude i feel sorry for you actually i tell you what we go together to the park i will spend icecream for you and everything will be allright hell i even make a new character and call it main if you want jszt dont stompo to much with your feet again
right who knew that sites on the internet have a forgot your password link pretty much all the time or that ccp might have some sort of account management and none of your three no eleven no thirteen relatives told you but you managed to create an account right in time for the csm and only post about csm topics almost exclusively about ank and you got your three no eleven no thirteen relatives to all vote for the candidate you like but it never occured to you to ask them so i forgot my password for my eve account how can i get it log your main in and post with it fyp
accusing him to be young or underage is no way to win an argument its easier if you tackle his points head on instead of resorting to ad hominem attacks it just makes you look underage and that youre trolling its also a good sign that youre loosing the debate
correct simply because there are more important things to me than a pixel character in a computer game dear kid who care for a 2 year old character dont spread lies i posted on various topics not only about ankhohh i get it you are enraged because someone is not agreeing with your favorite trolling area and supports ankh i am sorry i hurt your little kiddo pvp feelings poor one noooo there is no santa claus i cant do a thing about that sorry i had to tell you one day trollyfinny stomping with your feet wont change that but i have some calmatives for you once  when your are grown up you will realize that there are more important things to learn and experience out and yes up to then you might keep you main toy and play with it
well i tried that but at a certain point it makes no sense to argue with small children anymore they wont simply comprehend and insist on their sweeties and toys if they dont get it they start to cry and to crush things or to sompt with their feets so what else can i domay i ask you what debate a debate about mains cmon dont get silly where is that debate actually i only see kiddo demanding things i cant deliver stuff post with your main that is complelty meaningless to this whole discussion so i dont care here if i lose  something or nothm i want to help this kid but i dont know how i could ask a corp mate to post for me and tell him that this is my main or i siply create a new toon if that helps him it looks like it is causing pain to finntroll
attacks and snobbery at his age which you dont know makes you look the fool the fact that youre a brand new character coupled with the fact that youve only posted on threads that discuss ankh with the exception of one thread in gd but the content of the thread along with text and style you used is a close match to ankh is good enough proof for him if you feel you cant convince him then drop it actually the debate is whether ankh is a suitable csm candidate or not the argument about mains is a sideshow to the rest of the argument if you wish to put forth the fact that ankh is suitable  then you need to argue the fact however the point i made above already has you at a disadvantage
and yet youve convinced everybody in your family to vote for someone to improve the game for those pixel characters hrmmmas for why an established character with skillpoints is valuable and definitely more valuable than a character you have to start from scratch i dont believe that you really dont understand why that is just get your main already i promise that the mean gankers probably wont hunt you down much with our locator agents which ccp totally didnt mean to put in the game at all nopespeaking of spreading lies youll notice the word almost before exclusivelyand lets go back to your posting history out of all of your posts one is not about the csm but it is a whine about csm issues and pvpers of the others which are all csm posts 74 are about ank of the rest of your csm posts one was the very first postin a thread only eight minutes after the original post searching for the mention of a specific name perhaps that threads original post just happened to mention anks habit of spamming mission hubs your response was to change the subject and get your hate on every single other csm post you made was attacking a candidate you dont like for hilariously spamming mails and channels and for denigrating those who dont agree with your small and personal view of eve like gankersand most hilariously of all you claimed he was not suited to candidate for a csm seat due to your prematurity and your lack of respect for the paying customers who do not share your point of view then you went back to arguing that the person who believes that pvpers are psychopathic virgins is the best choice for the csm
actually you are right i simply will ignore his post with your main crap though i really get a kick out of it look why should i argue with him about that why should i argue with anyone about thisit is like real life politics the support of the one candidate will tell the supporters of the competing candidate that that person is not suitable for nomination so who the  caresi have decided that ankh is a very suitable candidate and last time i checkd i was living in a free world i do not need some kid whining the same whine over and over again like post with your main to make up my mind i am accountable to none concerning the decisions i make am ibut i can very well pronounce an opinion why this or that behaviour is childish and why i support that candidatei really dont care if i am loosing something in a video game world or even more losing a debate on a forum with some obvious pvp kid arguing with me about some main or not main but it entertains me tbh
its funny that youre a 1 month old character who just so happens to be unable to access his main and whose interest is totally taken up with supporting ank complaining about csm changes that ank disagrees with and using anks sort of rhetoric to complain about how pvpers suck luckily nobody has ever created an alt before for propaganda purposes what luck that you dont have a main you can post with what luck
i thought you ank bashers all thought all ank supporters were actually alts of ank herself
hell ya i pay for all of those accounts and the other ones i didnt need to convince we had a short conversation about the csm and we came all to the same result ankh is it kid as i said the game doesnt mean most likely as much to me as it means for you i had a character that was 2 months old or so a long long time ago so not a lot is lost who caresoh kid please please dont hurt me please dont hurt me i beg you noooo i am sooo scared i am so scared that a pixel character will make the effort and waste his time to kill my pixel character in highsec it really menas much to me soooo much ya that should hurt mei tell you what i frecking dont care quite the opposite i find it hilarious that you want to kill me ingame because you cant convice me that ankh is a bad candidate kinda proves my point about griefers thoughif it eases your pain i can log in right now and tell you where i am  so you dont even need a locator  and then you are free to gankg and kill me ok will that help you finnwhatevertrollthis only proves my point and confirms my decision for ankh more and more you are nothing but a frustrated and enraged pvp griefer so come and get your gank already i am all for helping out
omg  this has got to be eithera an ankh altb an ankh wannabei really cant decide which is worse
its not an example of how i exaggerate its an example of you distorting what i said i said that is what would happen if she was actually able to implement her ideas has she in fact been able to implement her ideas like banishment to lowsec for anybody who executes a highsec gank no then not only was there no exaggeration you ignored what i actually said more dishonesty i pointed out what would happen if she got her ideas implemented the fact that her ideas are so insane that ccp would never take her seriously and thus the people who are voting for her are wasting their votes in any case is kind of the point its why i pointed out that an empty chair would be better than ank im not distorting anything if she got her ideas implemented shed ruin the gameccp is not going to implement radical ideas that destroy the sandbox nature of this game thats eve online main selling point and niche in mmoswhat ifs  scenarios regarding ankh seem like fear tacticsshe has been csm before  eve looks decent to me so i guess she is not the harbinger of doomthe concentrated vilification seems a bit over the top especially if publications jump in1 person  ankh  evil influence need to be counteracted my bad i didnt realize all the other csm are so easily turnedjust saying there should be an outlet for everyone views people play this game in differing ways so its possible that these very opposing views could ignite generate some sort of compromise ideas down the road that would benefit the communityif csm is only about 1 cliche and a certain subset of ideas better just get ccp employees to read all this stuff on a subforum  everyone can pat themselves on the back thereempty chair candidates are epic fail to the community the csm meetings being current platform to voice views they not only harm the community but possibly even deprived us of some catalyst for ideasif people use vote match  eve online vote match im sure people will get surprising matches on various issues with multiple candidates including the dreaded ankh far from the toxic image that you are projecting
so youre pretty much admitting that you were dishonestly distorting what i actually said when i pointed out what would happen if her ideas were implemented not only do you understand the if  then statement you agree with exactly what i said her ideas would destroy the game your apologia for ank is weak youre now actually arguing the facts of what would happen if she actually got her views enacted is just fear mongering and the fact that she cant get her views enacted and thus is a wasted vote has no bearing on the discussion more dishonesty nobody said theyd be turned in fact i pointed out that ank would be of less value than an empty seat and at best shed simply be balanced out by sane csmers and as we were using anks own words to point out anks own views claiming that weve vilified her is something less than honest like a kitten is something less than a tiger more dishonesty the article and both miya and myself have pointed out that there are numerous good carebear candidates but that ank simply isnt one ps vote match matches up soundbytes and is pretty good at it but its not a totally substantive way to compare ideologies you wont for instance find statements like gankers are psychopathic virgins who should be put into some sort of jail and barred from going into empire even after 1 single suicidegank
dont you go telling people i am an ank alt i have my own opinions and i dont mind a discussion however this isnt a discussion anymore since the thread startednext to this i am going to establish a moderated discussion forummoderated in the form that there will be part of the forums open for postings of csm candidates and pre appointed and approved intervieuwerspart of the forums where only a specific csm will have access to post to point out why they should be in the csm and on what points the other csm points might be flawedthose 2 seperate parts of the forums will not be open for general postings to prevent derailment in general as happens a lot on the eve forumsnext to that there will be an open discussion forum in which people can express their opinions this doesnt mean however that everything is a go there will be a certain level of maturity and responcebility set for postingmeaning that several points of eve rules about forum posting will be maintained at the forum i am going to set up aswelbeingbe respectful of others at all times the purpose of the forum is to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas occasionally there will be conflicts that arise when people voice opinions be courteous when disagreeing with others it is possible to disagree without being insultingranting is prohibited a rant is a longwinded redundant post often filled with angry nonconstructive comments a free exchange of ideas is essential to building a strong sense of community and helpful in the development of the game but rants are disruptive and incite flaming and trolling please post your thoughts in a concise clear manner and avoid going off on rambling tangents personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another text of this nature is not beneficial to the community spirit and will not be tolerated corporation faction and alliance members and other players are cautioned to avoid allowing in character disputes from becoming out of character personal attacks the game is designed for roleplaying andor portraying a role and it is sometimes easy for tempers to flare when the lines between the virtual world and the real world are crossed please keep ingame disputes in the game and off the forum unless it is clearly a mutual incharacter exchangetrolling is prohibited trolling is the word used to describe a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting the players posts of this nature are disruptive and do not contribute to the sense of community we want for our forums i will appoint some moderators from various alliances to see to it those rules are enforcedi want a real discussion forum where csms can have their space to express their opinions without derailment and another space where they will have to answer to the publicunfortunatly the eve forums dont offer this service and thus i am going to work on providing thismy personal opinions aside i am going to do my utmost best to keep it impartial and purely informative on one side and open for real discussions at the otehr side
if you arent willing to defend your opinion why should any of us give a flying  what you think all your posts so far support my initial hypothesis that youre voting for ankh out of ressentiment not reason that and that neither you nor your thirtyseven altsfriendsrelatives just dont get eve
i wonder about that too but obviously some of you give a flying  otherwise this thread woulndt exist and otherwise finntrolly wouldnt act like he doesodd isnt it
ho brother i see emotions are starting to soar relax guys its only a game even if ank is elected she is just one seat and has been on 2 previous csms eve actually became a better place during those times in my book if only for the skill queue that was implemented hell even darius johnson who was on the same csm you know the former ceo of former megagriefalliance goonswarmcomplimented ank and said she was great to work with
this argument is starting to make my eyes bleed
you have my vote trebori gave a cursory glance at all of the other candidates and your message really stuckbut what really sold me was your ability to engage in debate on your talking points and beyondi found these points the most compelling1 you have lots of industry experience in both development and customer service2 you arent afraid to admit when you are wrong3 you engage in point  counterpoint until an idea is refined as the process should be4 you are willing to accept others ideas to help promote other causes if they are in the best interest of evei think the idea of a player run police force would be a great idea possible idea could be that a person with kill rights could transfer or bestow the kill rights to other people or an antiganking police corp to allow for retribution to occur the ganker still gets to be a douchUFFFD but at the risk of a horde coming down on him for it this seems like it would involve minimal changes to how kill rights are managed but that is only an assumptioni do think as csm it would be great if you could take worthy ideas from users and help refine them to ensure the highest chance of acceptancebest of luck to you
wow what can i say other than gee mom i didnt know you played eve one of the things you have to very carefully consider is the unanticipated consequences if there is a way to game the mechanic eve players will quite rightly push it to the very bleedingedge limit look at how useless bounties are for example retribution is all fine and dandy but if the ganker doesnt care if you pop him whats the pointin the long run probably the only way to make a particular mechanic available but selflimiting is by putting economic forces to work in the case of ganking the obvious tweak would be insurance changesplease note that i am not at all convinced there needs to be any changes if youre being trusted to move highvalue cargo you ought to damn well know how to make yourself 9944 gankproof my major concern would not so much be ganking but noob griefing but feel free to try and convince me otherwiseits like the t2 bpo issue addressed earlier in the thread i have no strong feelings one way or the other about if t2 bpos should be withdrawn but definite ideas on how it could be done equitably
you have my votes11
can we get tech2 fofs btw id like them to deal some proper damage or have a warpdisrupting effect
dont worry brenda you will get this the only people on these forums anymore are trolls everyone else thinks csm is an alliance
you will get my vote
last day so please vote for me today
vote for teadaze because he is the best candidate
votes in to a candidate who hasnt acted like a child
 but to make that happen you have to cast your final votes herehelp extreme make it into csm5thank you
i agree everyone should vote cat
well tbh this is somewhat a main going to transfer the char to a new account and skill him up i like the name and the portrait so in theory i have already exposed my main
i kind of hope cat gets in if only to find out if its cat or jake whos gonna attend the meetings
kind sire might i inquire as to your main alt character
beanbag youre the greatestand i do really hope that since cat is all about getting more community interaction that cat wins
hi cat herenow i dont condone the murder of any characters expecially one as artistic and brutal such as yourself lol now you may call me a hypocrite but leaving eve had to go he only caused trouble lolinteresting question lol but tbh i find it hard to speak in lowercase and without punctuation while loling the whole damn time so we shall see xas a weird coincidence i was in a corp with masternerdguy for a while
i thought it had been nice and quiet around here
99 sure i know who your main is
you go girl mmmm
moved from eve general discussion to jita park speakers corner as this is the appropriate platform for this thread
snip fairly inappropriate shadow
posting in another thread that ccp appleguys flicked into the dark abyssyes the pook is as cute as a button level cute which is what everyone lovesso really thoughwho wonswifty  i found them both you cant hide from me
according to the devblog theyre sitting on the results for another nine days for some reason
may they burn in hell they are doing a george bush on the votes arent they
so  time is almost up to vote  so let me make one last appeal highlighting the cool  i have done as an astronomer working on asteroid impact modeling my job was frequently described as saving the world from killer asteroids  during my employment in this capacity there were no recorded disasters due to killer asteroids  i taught a 5 year old girl how to play eve im the only csm candidate who can claim to have helped write a new york times bestselling science fiction book  the eve client uses code i helped create  back when i worked with the xiph people i worked on oggvorbis which is used eve audio yes eve has sound eve radio is also an indirect descendent of my pioneering read quick hack mp3 internet radio station back in the mid 90s  i has awesum dj skillz i have photos of certain high ranking ccp employees which could be considered embarrassingalthough probably notto sum up my campaign in one word  spaecshipps
all 4 of my votes went to tamber
ive currently got a total of 8 accounts which are willing to sell their votes friends n myselfplease feel free to convo me if youd like to buy themps i soon expect to get a fair few more people just waiting for them to log on id expect to be able to a total of around 2030 accounts thanksjovoich
you able to buy t2 bpos unlike state ravens although a couple did sell last year for stupid amountsi really dont see the issue apart from waaaa they have one and i dont syndrome
this is the only correct answer
i would like to vote for a candidate who will make it their mission to block any t2 bpo conspiracy nut from making any sort of impact on the csmpeople like the op are in favor of eternal grind and should really be playing lineage 2 instead
if you think its a farce vote abstain only way to get this opinion counted
so you intentionally want to vote for a moron the t2 bpo problem  everything you probably never wanted to know about t2 bposunless the reader has the mental capacity of a slow 5th grader they should eventually be able to understand why t2 bpos arent really a problem that needs urgent fixing because of two things  its not really that much of a problem in the first place and any possible solution is arguably worse than the current situation at least any of the solutions anybody ever came up with so faryou dear sir must be bloody blindjita park speakers corner thats the right onediscuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar management thats right there in the description
both are grammatically correct actually
well bpos will be bpos but the bpos stats are in the showinfoyou see it all depends on the context
i would risk saying that 90 of the world population uses languages which dont use apostrophes on regular basis
moved from eve general discussion to jita park speakers corner channel as this is the proper place for this discussion
lets rephrase that probably 90 of native english speakers have a crappy understanding of english spellinggrammarthe percentage is lower for nonnative english speakers with which you can actually carry a decent english conversationyou can pretty much spot a lot of native english speakers by their appalling smsspeak writing
i do have to agree that native english speaking players have a lot of times a unique way of typing in chati couldnt care less since english isnt even my second language and therefor i fail a lot of times in basic english and thus have no right of speach in that regardplus i took lessons in reading typonese this helps for several languages at the same time
as with most singleissue questions vote match has the answer the candidates strongly in favour of killing t2 bpos are mynxee issler dainze chip mintago and teadaze all of them but chip have a reasonable chance of winning cast your vote accordingly
i too have a view on t2 bpos that i addressed in this thread if you dont feel like reading it its really not very long my solution is to keep t2 bpos unchanged unless a change of some type was forced if forced my alternative is to have t2 bpos have degrading me levels that stay nonnegative and i go into reasons why in the thread
just want to say im fully behind what you stand for eve needs a rebuild of stale old systems ie faction warfare and bounty hunting however ive read quite a few of the candidates lists and yours is very comprehensive of the right thingsgood luck
bella thanks for your support im glad to get the knowledge out to people who literally have no idea what the csm is and how it can help them its been a fun and grueling campaign but heres hoping
sticky removed good luck to all the candidates
umm theres still 7 hours of voting time left
last call for votes peeps  vote for lyc s
supported
these ships are so bad i completely forgot they were ingame
like stealth bombers
definitely need a boost ive had a redeemer kicing about for ages my suggestionsleave cloaking as it isremove weapon bonuses add bonuses to increase sensor strength per level harder to probe out andor reduce signature radiussmall increase to jump rangeother alternative options for thoughtthe black ops feels like a covert support ship not an all out combat ship  probably should only be warping in to battle after the stealth bombers and recons have decimated the field and its arrival is purely to mop up the survivorsadd bonuses to remote repair  not as much as logistics but enough to support the covert fleet for extended engagementspossibly even allow it fit a gang assist module
bumpedwe want the old cyno effects back or a new one
i support this again to keep it on the top however you guys ever notice no one from ccp ever acknowledges this thread capitals used to be shock and awe now when they appear its just like um yeahjust another ship appeared
signed please bring back the old effects or make even better onesdoes anyone know why ccp removed it to begin with
yes you are correct taranis gets double the  thus counting for two although i dont want to derail this individuals thread so well just leave it at that my only complaint with the op is that id rather see a role bonus as opposed to a 4th i just think that a role bonus fix would be a better addition and last the test of time as opposed to the unknown reprecussions of experimenting with the 4th bonus for each individual shipmy previous idea was just a suggestion based on my own personal pet peeves with afs
in my experience only minmatar afs to give a combined bonus to all is the wrong way all of them dont even need a bonus they need a slot retribution really doesnt need a bonus it needs a medslot wolf really the same thing jaguar the again needs the ab speed bonus maybe 5 per af level or tracking bonus the jaguar should newer get to the same ms and tracking as the dramiel does but give them something to make it really useful althought jaguar is one of the few good afs at this momentwolf needs a medslot or ab speed a medslot to fit a webifier or ab speed to make it fast enough it should newer be the same speed as jaguar but little more would really be goodretribution needs the damned scramblerslot or 100 rolebonus to basespeed then they would not need a speedmod to be relatively fast and could fit a point in the midslot if the midslot would be used to speedmod it would be insanely fast whitch fights against amarr general behaviour but once again would not be able to tackle or any ewarto the ishkur i would give little 5 per af level ab speed also no further bonuses or slotlayoutchanges needed it would increase its survivalibility enoughto fix rockets in general would fix two of the afs pretty well but as i have absolutely no experience in them i better not say anything of those sorry if doubleposting didnt read the whole shabangericedit forgot to support
congratulations on inventing minmatari said it before and i say it again there will be no proper solution to this issue until ccp deals with damage phobiaany alternative solution to blasters such as the one i quoted will simply decrease diversity by making things same or infringe on special roles of other races thus guaranteeing future headache of fixing emergent problems with those other races
do not cut my words from sentence i indicated that i do not know exact complete solution because it is very difficult as for me increasing gallente dps is not a bad idea this boost will slightly balance gallente but not solve and will not brake gallente role of close face eater now there is no sense to use blasters because lasers do 85 dps at 300 optimal and ac shoot farther with selective damage on fastest ships in the game there is only 1 reason to shoot blasters  you do not want to spend several months for other race bs and weapon i would completely switch to amarr or minmatar if eve had no dominix ishtar and ac myrm 
hybrids could do dot that would be a niche no other ship has it wouldnt match the graphics but the graphics already dont match the way damage is done already torps look like aoe but arent lasers look like dot but arent projectiles shouldnt instantly hit targets but they do etc
i mentioned a penetration mechanic in the railgun thread but was told no no no no no by liangto be honest it didnt look overpowered or unbalanced the only tank type that suffered more than any other would be the passive shield tank could that be your dot
damage over time it would impact all tanks similarly what a penetration mechanic would do is turn everything a hybrid shoots into a hull tanker there are fewer mods to support hull tanks which is why only real men hull tank it would take a ton of work to rebalance all the ships imagine killing a titan or super carrier simply by bypassing their normal tank which usually has hp modifiers and resists at 90 and ripping through their hull that has no modifiers and cant get resists past 60 the bigger the ship the more vulnerable they would be to a penetration mechanic unless ccp followed the hybrids with massive boosts to hull hp on pretty much all ships this would be the weird situation created by a penetration mechanicand what about structures would hybrids bypass the reinforce mechanic or would they be left with a noticeable nerf whenever they shoot something that reinforces
no thats not how my idea worked at all my idea for a penetration mechanic didnt just bypass tanks give me a minute ill copy and paste it from the railgun threadits a bit long to transfer over and spread over a few posts its easy to find its on pages 24 and 25 of the railgun thread as you will see its not a simple i win mechanic
i read it in the railgun thread when you originally posted it you modified the penetration mechanic suggested long ago to be like the mechanic in place for 25 shields your idea was better than the old idea i still worry how that would impact tanking as your idea would be a rather significant nerf to shield tanks who have paper thin armor and have max effectiveness all shield tanks benefit from passive tank at 30 shields which would be passing a lot of damage into their weak armorhull tanks
yes but most of the volley would be hitting the shield in a buffer tank anyways as the mechanic puts most of the volley there by sharing it out in a ratio according to shieldarmourstructure a heavy shield buffer tank tank ratio could be 511 so if a penetrating hit was scored which is chance based 5 parts of damage would hit shields and 1 part would hit armour that 1 part then had a modifier of 50 so for ease a volley of 6 damage 5 hits shields and 05 hits armour after applying resists this ammount of damage bleed through could be acceptable as a boost to hybrids its just lateral thinking instead of moar damage
putting peak dps at the target within web range quickly stop targets at gates solo without gimped tackling range and the ability to control range within web range where things that made blaster ships good at her niche putting back the lethal in web range for gank style blaster pvp is a long overdone step and provides a lot more diversity than a bit more dps would do
my idea for gallente niche is that operating blasters should be difficult but those who can manage it overcome the obstacles would get rewarded by unparalleled dps strength and that means a difference of more than a single damage mod on any other shipminmatar should do what you mentioned be optimized for ease of use as opposed to dps power
i would be the last one agreeing against a dps boost for blasters i did fly them with maximum gank all the time then again i dont see the point without tweaking close range for blaster ships in favour of the blaster ship again you request a very very limited small gang tool i basically do the same with the difference that the ships would be useful for solo pvp againminmatar ships already do what i mentioned there should not be a minmatar patent of being the all out solo pvp solution if you are ready to take all the drawbacks and let go gtfo ability there should be a option for people that going in for a kill and are ready to die for it
tweaking close range in positive manner would be undoing the great nano nerf make webs 90 remove mwd deactivation for scramble make ships fast againthat has worked in the past then ccp had to  things upraw damage is a single factor that can be used to manipulate balance in this case it is the easiest way that would involve least amount of unexpected errors alternative balancing requires adjustment of multiple variables the consequences of which are harder to predict and harder to tune properlywhile i dont doubt that balance can be achieved by adjusting many different factors i simply find it unnecessary complication and i dont trust ccp with anything complicated we gotta keep things as simple as possible for them to get it right
have to support this
id say railguns should do a higher alpha than beams but lower alpha than artillery higher dps than artillery much higher not 56 dps but same or lower dps as beams if thats not balanced enough you can increase the cap cost and maybe reduce tracking also give them a bonus where they gain 30 overheat bonus instead of 15 but make them burn up faster give them a big damage modifier increase but also lower their rate of fire to compensate a railgun needs to charge up its capacitors and charge up the magnetic impulses in order to fire and that takes time but as a result it should unleash a powerful shot you have a better chances of volleying certain targets better than lasers but not to the extreme extend as artillery the dps should be close to lasers but not surpassingthis should also help address the problems of hybrid charges as they are twice the size of projectile ammo a rokh would run out of ammo much faster than a maelstromrailguns should be powerful not wimpycurrently railguns have the weaknesses of both lasers and projectiles but possess not of their strengths
bumpd
ah yeah but we are asking for the ability to configure more than one option  stealth bump
1 something about multiple job setting and market ui improvements is needed here too tho ill look for threads
fix pleaseespecially this one allow reactivation of mods accidentally deactivated
if you placed it under your feet at the start of the hyperspace jump then it will be under your head at the end of the jump
supported caod has been in need of towels for years nowben
its unpleasantly like being drunkwhats so unpleasant about being drunkask a glass of water
damn if only id thought to include this in my csm platform id have been a lock for the chairmanship arghbut seriously or at least as seriously as possible this would make for a hilarious anniversary gift from ccp to the playersfurthermore the initial proposal doesnt go far enough we clearly need faction towels
trebor for president
supporting trebor as dictatorforlife
maybe towels are considered dangerous and have therefore been banned by the powers of new eden a tool too multifunctional too powerful too destructive to leave in the hands of the common peoplewell i am not a part of the common people i am a capsuleer i demand this ban to be lifted at least for us capsuleers that is the common man can find himher self something else to dry them with after taking a shower
wanna get high
this guy seems legit
in general terms armor tank should be more sustainable and cap efficient compared to armor reps however deadspace and faction shield boosters completely beats armor reps in nearly every category including efficiency of hpcap not to mention you have the ability to mount a shield boost amplifier on them without additional cap consumption and speed reduction sure it costs more money but if you look at the point that armor tankers dont even have that option armor tankers have a skill that decreases their cycle time and shield tankers have a skill that reduces their cap usagelets make a comparison at the biggest and the best xtype of both shield and armorarmor cap cost repaired cycle time hpcap hpsec corex large 400 1120 15s 28 75centusx large 450 1260 15s 28 84corpusx large 450 1260 15s 28 84shieldpithx xlarge 400 840 4s 21 210 gistx xlarge 204 670 4s 32 168if you notice the pith type is lower in efficiency vs the armor reps at the cost of an astounding amount of recovery a single pith xtype will tank better than 2 centus xtypes and it will cost less by current contract prices a single pith xtype is cheaper than a centus xtype by nearly halfthe real astounding part is the fact that gist xtypes have better cap efficiency than the armor reps and despite the lower hpsec it tanks as well as 2 centus xtypesa deadspace shield small booster will come close or beat a medium tech 2 shield booster in tankinga deadspace armor small repper will not the same applies to mediums a pith atype medium is very popular for uses in battleships these days thanks to its great tank in the matters of its cap efficiencyhigh meta armor reps need to be looked at and fix to put them on the same balance as shield currently armor has a much greater limit in comparison on shield
i agree with you that active armor tanking in general needs a buff so it gets more use in pvp but i dont think that it should be done only on faction reps if at all the whole active armor tanking should be revisited
i dont agree armor tanking has a ton of other benifits that shield tanking doesnt havearmor tanks dont get their tank killed by fitting the mid slot dependent warfare items like tackling gear propulsion boosts ewa and more do any of these in a shield tank and you have a paper tank left as a resultarmor vs shields is fine and probably better due to the preference for remote armor repping over shields
i see you are caldari of course you would oppose to these changesshields get the option putting damage mods hull upgrades eccm mods etc
yes yes remove that
tbh black screen with your blue ball and colored point ever try finding the not bright red ball when your in a system with a red sun
totally agree so hard to see with that shadow
the problem is more in depth first of all i would love to see the profession of bounty hunting becoming solved at least it is why i wanted to play eve becoming somewhen some kind of boba fett now honestly isnt that something that drives all of usas long as a bounty hunter gets faction hits for killing others for cash he wont become something different than that what he is hunting a contract killer poopoopiratefor my point of view it is much cheaper and more easy to become a pirate than it should be i can kill in lowsec and fly back home without being harmed by police or bounty hunters you would have to do bad things for a long time that it has a slight impact on your faction at all on the other side of the medal why should anyone who is in lowsec go back to high sec a second char helps a lot brings everything you need and you can do waht you want being a pirate is cheap easy to afford no ships of them have a high value and they only attack when they are sure to winbounty hunting in high sec is therefore not of sense and regarding that pvp in eve is just related to numbers and not to quality a bounty hunter solo will never have chance quite no matter how good his ship is fitted 2 10000 isk frigs can easily kill a bs due to that mechanics in game even thinking about is waste of timea bounty huntin corp could be an idea but there is like no income then at all since most pirates kill themselves as soon as the bounty is high enoughsolving that would only be possible if1 bounty is set by players but controlled by concorde players having a bounty on them will be shot by gate guns in high and low sec players having a bounty on them will be attacked by police in high sec2 additional amount for offering the bounty to players over concord bueraus like a mission bounty hunters can ask for fugitives after they have proofed their loyalty 75 status to a certain faction stationcorp were bounty is offered for example players accepting that mission can hunt fugitives without being harmed by police gate guns and faction losses players with a bounty on their head can pay release fees of triple amount of headcount to come free from being listed on the wanted roster instead of cash the reward should be lps for example all lps should be depending on faction and numbers of kills as long as you are on the roster insurance will not pay anything for any of your ships as a fugitive person you are not allowed to run a corp being a member of a corp signs the whole corp as fugitive and corp looses faction to max negative after 48 hrs of information that a member of the corp is wanted by police and bounty hunters corp members assisting a fugitive corp member vs a legitimate bounty hunter loose faction immediatly and will also be listed on roster trading with fugitives also sets your faction to negative immediatly cans drifting in space cannot be opened by fugitives faction to concord or bounty hunters guild only can be raised by kills of fugitive players bounty hunters need to have highest faction values 100 for at least 1 empire bounty hunters must have a sec status of higher than 50 placing a bounty on the head of a player requires that the player has a negative sec standing or a killmail prooving the legitimate offending this way lowsec would become more populated and pirates cannot use public stations they have to be on their own and independent in everything then it would become fair and interesting hunting those noobsit is much too easy for pirates anyways
why waste a thread when you know the above will be the answer

everyone sells their oremins at market value ccp is addressing the poor iskhr in mining through loot drop nerfthe low iskhr your making on entrylevel mining has nothing to do with other miners macro or otherwisethe effects on the market by ccp designed seeds are much more powerful then any amount of mininglets make eve really tedious to play lets scan users hardwaresoftware and have it melt their hd if a signature is foundthats a surefire solution we can get rid of macros by getting rid of all miners awesome idea
incase anyone missed it this is the key to this whole thing you cant design any system to beat macros thats like saying you can make something 100 secure any system designed to make macros more difficult instead incorrages them as it is seen as a challenge punishing legit users is never a solution immersion breaking antibot measures such as captcha or minigames will progressively make the game suck mining is tedious enough as it isso where is the solution if its not in making macros more difficultin making mining less tedious maybelike the war on drugs zerotollerance and mandatory sentencing doesnt workinstead harmreduction and support has been shown to be much more effectiveccp has the right idea stop asking them to screw it all up
im really sorry but you are deluded if think its a social problemthe problem is very simply its one of moneygold sellers make lots and lots and lots of money by selling iskto do this they need this use macro miners why because it requires very little in terms of manpower 1 person could quite easily maintain many many ships macro mining without having to be anywhere near a machineat the moment it is far to easy for somebody to macro mine as i and many others have already explainedsomething needs to be changed to stop macro mining from being so easy one way would be remove the ability for a person to leave the clients running all day unattended this only would make an impact even it meant reducing there mining ability say by 10  15 this would help as it would make them raise there prices of the isk they are sellingwhilst you are able to buy double the isk from a gold selling site for only a few pounds more then the temptation for people to buy it will always be thereif ccp introduce measure which mean the gold selling site have to increase the cost of their isk then the temptation for players to buy it decreases if less people buy isk from gold sellers and switch to ccpthe goal would be to instead of being able to buy double the isk it would be more or less equal in cost to buying the isk via ccp
i agree with you very much dr battlesmith with regards to the meta 0 changes in tyrannis my interpretation of the dev blog is that ccp more than likely created a mechanism to manage the drop rate rather than a onetime fix perhaps going forward they will have the ability to manage the basket using this method instead of letting insurance be the sole method of setting the floor on mineral prices as some hypothesize its all speculation but leave your thoughts on that in the si or md forums plenty of people have opinions as it relates to our macrominer discussion in a hypothetical a net increase in mineral prices especially empire only makes it more lucrative for the macro user and therefore i dont think the near term function was designed with the macro miner or rmt in mind however looking at long term effects this meta 0 drop rate tool if it exists would allow ccp to come in with an effective macro miner elimination process where the drop rate could then be increased if only temporarily to counter potential hyperinflation created by the removal of a large portion of the macro miner account base perhaps this could be the infrastructure needed to come in with an effective solution to solve the problem while keeping the market stable something for us to think about and maybe ccp already has i do agree that rmt is an issue in the game ccp made great strides with the addition of plex but limited sweeps reporting potential macros are not solving the problem i see a guy named disco biscuit in the ice field i hit in empire 247 ive reported him but hes still sitting a couple roids down from me right now i can name 6 or 7 more sitting here right now as well im not mad about it i simply look at it as a business problem that hasnt gotten funding finished development or the resources arent available to address it i dont think making it less tedious is the solution null sec mining is far from tedious you got miningratswatching local and as someone whos paid the price for lack of attention on while mining in null sec i prefer it if ccp didnt add any additional layers to my mining efforts im not a programmer but i have a hard time understanding how ccp could make a change to empire mining that wouldnt effect null sec mining as well i see a lot of people getting their panties in a bunch in this thread i wouldnt be surprised to see this thread getting picked up by the people who sell the macros and theyre contacting their users telling them to come in here and flame it down but the reality is a tough pill to swallow a client side solution like warden is probably the most cost effective way to solve the problemjavaedited to included hyperlink to dev blog
is this against the eula disturbing yes bordering on insane yes macros no sanctioned as legit by the gms indeed it was
yeah but the thing is that you can still make a vicious afk cloaker out of things like tech threes when i used to live in scalding pass there was a death or glory guy who would drop his alt into the one ice system we have and just sit afk while doing crap on his mains then he would come back and pop our hulks all the time since he was already at the ice belt afk all the time he could just decloak shoot the hulks then warp and recloak and if we got lucky he would just laugh at our hic bubbles to try and hold his stabbed tengu in place it gets rediculous when one ship can be invincible like that
it is not the afk cloakers you need to be worried about it is the ones who are not afk
yeah thats what im saying if the guy was just sitting in system all day afk i wouldnt care its when he can attack and run like that is the issue that i see even someone thats afk 23 hours then burns a cyno and titan bridges friends in is more ok then the one uncatchable t3 cause he will be held in place so i can finally kill him and i have his friends to kill instead of just getting griefed
cloakers who arent afk arent going to sit around and wait for someone to scan them out in fact they are likely to be constantly wandering belts and gates looking for something to kill even if you could probe out cloakers you wouldnt find them
not supported
yes but that means that as you stated they arent afk and will eventually get bored and leave its still a step up for when someone sits in your system for five hours then ganks someone then can keep sitting in your system for longer and gank someone again specially if you were like we were before gent club wanted our space to rent it out to poeple and only lifed out of pos you couldnt even hide in stations like gc carebears can when mr cloaky red comes along
you know there are a few simple rules that make you much harder to kill or atleast get a shot on killing the the cloaky aswell like eg ratting in groups of 23 fitting rr neuts and tackle on your ratting ships if you want to rat solo  stay aligned all the time so you can warp out instantlyoh and kill scrambling frigs early dont shoot the obvious bait falconarazu if you arent sure you can kill him before his friends bridged in and tackled youhis cloak is his pos he sits in it and waits for you to make a move same way you sit in your pos and wait for him to make a move if you are scaredif you could probe out cloakers why would you fly relatively lightly tanked ships especially under neut and for all non covert ships  if you think they dont have enough penalties  i would ask you to check again for the scan res sensor recalibration and speed penaltiesall it would need is a bit adaption of your play style and you would be fine again but it is easier to ask for a nerf am i rightadapt or die  in which part are you betterps would you trade a find the cloaker probes for a module that kicks you out of pos so i can kill you without all the boring waitingpps wh local for all normal 00 please
you realize that wh local defeats the purpose of having a cloak right and in the cases like section xiii they just come and kill your pos so you cant hide in it any more theres no option like that with your cloak and like i said he only goes after the makis and hulks the guy has 0 intrest in taking any fight that will give him any chance of getting caught and dying the oh have five people sit around protecting the makinaws is a waste of resources as those characters could be mining for pos ice in their own makinaws or out ratting to buy the other npc goods since we had mil five in there too but one cloaky tengu made it so we not only would lose 100150 million defenseless ships but 100s of millions sitting to protect them as the time to decloak  shoot off a couple thousand hp is lot less then it takes for my pvpish mega to warp 40 au from my plexes to the ice belt
no wh local doesnt defeat the purpose of cloaks because smart people still use their directional scanner and see you coming but nice try 
because you know the two months that i lived in a wh i spammed my dscan every two seconds i was logged on also i noticed you didnt argue my last post about why having the ability to cloak for as long as you want to get them to burn hundreds of millions of isk edit not ratting or rat and lose hundreds of millions of isk in exhumer losses edit did not get rebutted does that mean you secretly agree with me that a cloak like tha is broken overpowered so to you sir nice try 
it isnt my fault you do unprotected mining ops isnt it ever considered parking with some cloaked recons around your mack and wait for him to do a moveif he had the patience to wait until you left your mining ships unprotected in a belt he deserved the kill and you deserved the loss he seems to be smarter than you
its not that he has the patience though we know from watching logins and logoffs of the other people in his corp that he has three other accounts you can tell when four people log on and off within seconds of eachother every time so its not like he was not doing anything at all he was prolly happily ratting with blues in russian space with his other three acounts its not like a guy with only one account wanting to ice mine and cant protect himself like i can with my fouralso a heavy missile cloaky tengu can shoot around eighy km or so have fun pointing that unless you have your paper faction point with gang bonuses running arazualso im posting with my main so you can look me up and see that i actually live in 00 your afraid to post with yours i guess as you are posting with a trader corp alt whos office is in jita 44
i do think that someone being able to park a cloaked alt in a hostile system indefinately while being completely afk should be addressed a highskillrequired probe with a long say a minute scan time could work it would require the cloaky pilot to at least pay attention rather than cloaking up and then either playing on a different account or going afk entirelyanother solution would be to make cloaks take charges like a cap booster that way at least the pilot would have to leave once in a while to get more and expose himself to being caught in the processeither way being afk for days at a time and making your targets have to guess whether youre actually there or not shouldnt be a tactic
this ship is bull compared to the other commands it really needs some love and fastso i purpose the following changes to actually make it worth using or training forfirstly it needs an extra low slot or more power so it can become a decent buffer ofc if you give it an extra lowslot it would need more power at least 200 moreok now on the links i always found it odd how the gallente command gave bonuses to ew out of all things s these arent all that great when compared to the other commandsi say introduce drone link modules and the three to be introduce are1 increases damage of drones2 increases hitpoints of drones3 increases tracking  op of dronesthe actual skill information warfare shouldnt increase targeting range but instead the speed of dronesi am working on  here but i feel the eos being gallente should really benefit drones the other commands can greatly benefit their race but the eos is the odd one outanyway i am open to suggestions on what needs to be done i also think the claymore could do with a bit more cpu but thats a different story xd
the use of salvage drones would already be a sacrifice youre giving up the opportunity to use other drones if you choose to pull your hobgoblins and put out your salvage drones isnt that a compromisebut then people will argue that the dominix has an advantage  but the dominix only has 6 high slots because of its massive drone bay the myrmidon again has less high slots than your average bc the vexor same deal even the lowly helios the only covops that has drone capacity sacrifices a high slot compared to the other covert ops frigates wouldnt that be a nice little ship with a salvage drone in it but i digress the ships are already balanced the drone bays are balanced against the number of high slots capacitor grid and cpu arguing that getting salvage drones allows you to do something without giving up something else is plainly wrong
one way of looking at is is that scamming is trade piracy and we all like piracy as a part of the game  right
youre a scammer there now everyone knows you scammer daj mahal is a scammerdaj mahal is a scammerdaj mahal is a scammer
as long as there is no limit to the ignored contract issuer list this isnt needed
capital armor rr is so much more preferred that chimeras which get shield rr bonuses not armor rr are flown with armor rr fitted
any sovereignty system that is based on massive dps overcoming massive hp is going to devolve into lag fests and boring grinds of one kind or another sov shouldnt be based on shooting structures according to set timers at allyou can change the names and shapes of the toys on the field all you like but until the underlying premise changes itll still suck in just about the same way and the bigger the blobs get the more hp they have to introduce to counter the dps
too many times does a gang puss out and deagress and remote repair each other then jump out to avoid a fight when the fight is no longer going in their wayhave remote repairing someone count as aggression
nonext idiotic topic
i guess the badger had remote repairs on it
so i think ive figured out emos game plan here build up a reputation as a troll propose something eminently reasonable and watch people reflexively speak out against it congrats i think you were just metatrolled good ideas are good ideas even when proposed by awhatever the hell emo is
well it isnt like the topic is new and tbh  he should start using proper style and not the all caps bold crap all the time
i heard you like lost a dramiel to a badger bro
supported1
noone takes you seriously mate
oh noes did a 100 man rr bs gang managed to survive your 250 man blob of some sortsnow thats some epic crying right there if thats the caseremote reps are totally fine as they are now nothing more is needed to say about this caseand yeah no one will ever take you seriously after thishahah thats soooooo funny to link in every topics made by emo tj
ffs with writing in caps and bold
not only does emo tj lose dramiels to badgers he also slow boats noob ships then loses his pod for those who didnt believe he lost the dramiel to a drake it is api verifiedremote reps shouldnt be able to be run until the second a person jumps they also shouldnt have a full aggression timer like shooting someone or logistics ships would get creamed on gates as they have less buffer than the ships they are repping
remote reps are fine as they are its just another variable in gang composition and tactics that makes the pvp game more varied and fun and its fairly well balanced as is since you have to give up some dps andor range for the ability to rep everyones aggression timer is the same its not as if you cant deaggress too and jump after the gang youre shooting or just bracket the gate in the first placeit works the way it is leave it
i only have 1 issue with the events and thats not the kms will get to that in a second my issue is with the concord player shipsok they are godly and i have seen one case of dev hax system jumping whilst scramed and webbednuted to nothingthe other half of this is rr the concord ship is a player ship with respect to the fact that is looks like anyother player on the grid now i am agressed and so is he yet the peeps rring him are not flagged to me y is thisanyhoo on to the kms i like em and i would like to see kms issued for officer spawns also
they already do you dont think im the only person in 00 that figured this out almost everyone in 00 farms datacores for extra isk 50m isk per month is enough to cover the cost of replacing ships unless you have a bad month many have several alts on the same account that also churn datacores making that 150m per month per account now thats noticeable passive income
that wont even replace a t2 cruiser its not even close to noticeable
so i guess that we are going to leave out the fact that these moons are used in quite a high percentage of the reactions needed to make most t2 stuff and that the people that control the moons also control the market on that one eh
a complete monopoly on those moon minerals you cant say make prometium or dysprosium with moon minerals found in low sec technetium on the other hand well you can see why the southern alliances attacked the northern alliancessure the big alliances have t2 bpos which allow them extra margin somewhere in the 2030 range compared to someone with 23 accounts running rd agents to manufacture t2 through invention in high sec buying moon minerals off the market again you forget the complete lack of risk that the person me has compared to the 00 alliance who has to protect the moons and stations i can just pull datacores invent then manufacture all in empire space alternately for even less risk i can sell off the datacores for a couple hundred million isk a monthcompletely safecompletely passiveit is impossible to block someone from making this income
the vast majority of the promo 79 and dyso 6 of 14 moons in low sec are all located in aridia which is owned by none other then it alliance i live in providince now and scalding pass before gc evicted evicted us i know that sc wants the nc moons and why
this mechanic is not penalizing the person with the low sec status the person with low sec status doesnt have gcc the person repping them gets gcc this is a penalty for logistics ships in low sec not pirates
sorry for the necro but supported
already available from someone other than ccp why should ccp pay the extra costs to implement and power this when someone else is doing it for free i would rather them spend that time money and effort into implementing a forums feature that is not available notifications of replies to your poststhat or just ignoring improvements to the forums as a whole and working on the game
my first impulse to this idea is to agree it sounds nicebut then i realize that if this is done then there will be less highsec pvp thus i think it is badalso this will make things harder for newbies who try instigating pvp that is also not goodhowever no insurance for ships killed by concord is something that merits proper discussion
i sorely miss a rig that increases drone damage i know there is the sentry damage augmentor already but a highslot solution is acceptable aswell im not a regular user of gallente ships so my experience is lacking the way i see gallente droneboats is that they dont use drones as launch and forget weapons as other races would so drone speed damage and damage resistance are important for them id love to be able to fit an imicus that can actually be useful but the only drone attributes i can influence is their warpspeed tracking range and durability forgot this one in my initial post heh if i lose my drones i lose all my weapons i have to wait for my drones to get to the target or back to my ship when i break off an attack i have to stick around longer and still my drones are just as vulnerable then when i used a minmatar ship despite the drones being my main weapon system on a gallente ship im not sure how many gallente ships are affected by this problemedit2 maybe one final consideration turrets do more damage closeup and less at range would it make sense to reduce drone control range as you raise drone damage  for example 15 more damage mod would reduce drone control range by 15km
full results can now be read in this dev bloghias i mentioned here we will not be releasing the list of who won the election until the 26th this is so that we do not interfere with the currently sitting csm as the elections were called early for the purpose of sorting travel arrangements for the first csmccp summit of csm5i can however provide some stats ill add a little to this later on today39433 votes were cast compared to 21787 for csm4of these votes 754 voters abstained and 38679 were for candidatesthe turnout for the election was 1267some wonderful graphs of times that votes were cast first votes per dayplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesand votes per hour of the dayplease visit your user settings to reenable images
that is a large increase in voter turnoutit will be interesting to see how far that changes the cutoff point for getting elected
it has been an interesting ride indeed much more active involvements as opposed to just campaign statements much more debate and quite a bit more exposurestakeholder element does up the ante here it redefines the stage just beware that can cut in more then one direction
it is just an epic failure that the first days of voting there was displayed a static list of candidateswe filed the importance of the problem about the advantage that one have that is listed on top of that list and yet the change wasnt made in timepersonally i wont jump on the bandwagon concerning ankh i have no problem with her and she was ok to work with while i was in csm2but ill tell you that ankh will have 2500 extra votes due to this epic failure of a static list of candidatesx
its great to see nearly twice the number of votes cast this time compared to last im sure a little controversy more active involvement of the community stakeholder status going forward ccps increased communications all helped plus csm4s and teadazes excellent efforts to keep us informed of their work contributed to the overall credibility of csmthat surely contributed to voter turnoutthanks for sharing these numbers early
was a nice run this once tiresome but nicelots of known names runninggood luck to everyone
i think the frequent login screen ads about the csm also greatly added to the voter turn out  good to see the numbers finally rising btw this thread needs more blue graphs
indeed thats a 65 increase in turnout over the average of all previous elections it will definitely be interesting to see the cutoff numbers this round especially seeing as mm is doing their split tactical voting vuk lau could have garned two spots just for himself in each past election he participated in so he took advantage of that by adding a runningmate will bump someone else downwhile i was running i put together a quick spreadsheet of the previous data based on ccp diagoras devblogs past and did a projection of csm5 based solely on an average of past numbers ive adjusted up 65 to match the total actual votes this round its obviously going to be different if the tactical bloc voting does happen but it gets the brain going nontheless if youre interested heres a url link to a jpeg of the statistics
nice blue graphs i also have some here  my website had estimated 1300 as the cut off also but with less maths involved in my calculations which kinda sucks as my website estimates votes for tamber  885 on another note id like to think it was the calibre of candidates that raised the voting percentage but the more likely cause was all the trolling lets hope theres some drahma and not just a show of block voting force and karmic balancing tamber

it has been interesting and a lot of fun and may i add my congratulations to those who won and good luck with your work sitting on the csmsomehow i dont think i made it to that list would be nice to put some names to those numbers when do those lucky few get to know if they won a seat or is that all on the 26th going to be a long wait if it is 
awesome thanks for the extra information an updated table with new numbers added including a trendline with comparison to my projected
alright so who else got the email lolx
very impressive rise in the turnout but if i am not completly misstaken or understanding something wrong that equals about 311k accounts havent we been at 350k by the time of apocrypha or was that just the number including trials accounts

damn that is a lot of votes so long cautious optimism o

ah the dont compare a game to rl whine what a surprisecomparing it to any rl situation is of course not needed to know how stupid it is to say that victims are accountable for being victims the agressor is always the one who is 100 accountable for his own actions unless you want to claim that you are mentally unstable and the voices make you attack ppl there is no way you can go around that the fact that someone is carrying a t2 bpo in a shuttle on afk autopilot does not force you to shoot at him for example that being said you would have to be a bit careless to haul t2 bpos in a shuttle on afk
while the victim isnt at fault for being shot the victim is at fault for the measure in which his loss affects himif you pack all your belongings in a hauler and get shot its your fault that you lost everything you chose to take the risk of putting all your stuff in one easily shot pinataa smart player doesnt have to lose much of his total worth at all even if he gets shot
it is good for them one should learn something from every ship lossyoure equating painful with harmful ive lost plenty of ships because i was dumb or just plain ignorant each loss taught me to be smarter or encouraged me to learn what i needed to know not to lose another ship in that way therefore i became better at playing eve and consequently lost fewer shipsbut perhaps i should have just cried and whined about how mean and unfair it was that the big nasty bullies hurt my wittle feelings and refused to learn anything and blamed everyone but myself for my own stupidity and ignorance
pretty much sums it up tbqfh  good post
of course you can learn from your mistakes but that was not my point in this case my point was that it will be very hard to convince ppl that getting blown up is good for them
of course its bad for you but if youre smart you learn something from it and it helps you not get blown up again alternatively you cry about it play the victim youre only a victim in eve if you choose to be a victim if im trying to pirate someone and get killed am i a victim not really no the only way to be a victim is to be 100 harmless and 100 careless in fact there are no victims in eve you sign up to play you sign up for a competitive game youll notice that i dont sign up for a boxing tournament and complain when i get punched so yeah if you let me shoot your ship full of bpos its your fault in this setting no one would pass up a few billion isk off of a flying pinata youre confusing i take advantage of your tactical mistake destroy your base and win the game with i raid your city murder actual people who dont respawn and destroy the way of life of thousands its a video game youre not a victim if you think youre a victim youre pathetic so i was playing team fortress 2 the other day and i shot somebody i must be mentally unstable for fighting other players in a game about fighting other players
well my point is that it isnt hard to convince some people and oddly enough those people are the ones who arent crying for more protection for the devs to save them and the ones are arent arguing for their own helplessnessthe only boost that people like ankh and the people that she claims to represent really need is for people to stop telling them how helpless they are and for them to stop believing that theyre helpless as soon as they start believing that they can save themselves  and that only they can save themselves  why then they wont need saving at all
this the inferiority complex makes me sad i have all the tools you do but feel you need severe handicaps to make it fair for me and despite said handicaps i still feel i cant possibly stand a chance against you defending yourself in eve doesnt take amazing ninja keyboard skills just a little planning and some basic knowledge its not that its so difficult that we feel hardcore for being able to do it its that its so simple that we cant possibly understand how other people are incapable helplessness is an attitude in eve youre never really helpless
im looking forward to seeing election results but meanwhile i just want to thank everyone for their support and votes
election is over hope youll make it just letting you know youve been getting our lowsec votes

t2 fofs really should exist they were just likely forgotten about warp disrupting effect would be hilarious but increased damage at the cost of max velocitysigsomething is fine tooalso thank you everyone for the support and feedback all we have to do now is believe for 9 days
hilarious but fun also its worth investigating why did they remove faction fofs from lp stores im pretty sure they could set those back
will you be pushing for a rebalance re belt rats vs anomaly
will you be pushing ccp to release more detailed information in patch notes i have seen them link to a blog by a developer and post videos on youtube but these seem like things that should be done in addition to releasing detailed information on what is changing in them game
i dont
no working as intended belts are free for all and juicy anomalies require system upgrades lack of documentation is known problem of eve as a person who follows changes introduces in various patches pretty closely ill support anything that can improve current situationi hope you have voted for ankh then anyway voting is closed now people who have voted for me thanks for your support as ccp have stated results will be available on may 26th
first things first ill say im quite impressed by what you present here particularly as a firsttime candidate you cover many bases and i enjoy most of what i read and see though i know it is fairly late can i try to pose a quick question as one who is particularly fond of lowsec can i inquire as to why you feel the need for the existence of bubblesbombs usable there i personally agree with the latter but the former i personally would disagree with beyond that im glad to see what i see without doubt
thanks for your comments and question much appreciatedthe bubbles and bombs issue is something i have picked up from talking to people and is just something i want to discuss on their behalf i personally have no issue with the use of bombs in low sec i dont see it necessarily going to change gate camps significantly in low sec however i do see bubbles as a double edged sword i dont want to every gate in low sec covered in bubbles because that would achieve nothing however discussion around allowing interdictor bubble or heavy interdictors to use their bubbles is something that can be explored i hope that answers your question
the idea behind csm is quite good having a group of dedicated players appointed by the playerbase to work closely with ccp is theoretically quite good and could in an ideal world be quite an asset to the game we all lovehowever lately i have seen more and more people running for csm for fun or as a joke not many but a few they acts like joke and plays like joke on the forums with no real interest in making the game better but instead see this as an opportunity to brag or having a good paid vacation in iceland or that is how it looks like for me anyway because when i read the list of candidates and compares it to their forum posts in general  i am getting worried not just for the candidate as such but more of the playerbase who seems to like the idea of voting on such people for fun so a question arises what if a candidate turns out to be a total fraud with no apparent interest in working for the betternes of the game do ccp have a whip under the table and what does it say about a playerbase who openly vote for such candidates for fun or am i just being too judging here
most of the joke candidates dont come anywhere close to getting elected theres only been three who have done anything particularly jokelike on the csm larkonis trassler who did a pretty dumb violation of the nda got caught and was removed from council pattern clarc who lost a vote on an issue he cared about and then disappeared never to be seen againand who was eventually removed for nonattendance and mazzilliu who while often serious did things like raise an issue proposing to turn titans into monster trucks because someone gave her a plex to do it none of them were joke candidates and while two of them did get removed for being stupid they were all fairly genuinely trying to improve the game for most of the time that they were on the council joke candidates exist always have always will laugh and move on  theyre not a threat to anything
how would you suggest we detect the applicants who are secretly applying as a joke with no intention of improving the game but who seem involved enough to get votesyou also seem to have difficulty telling the difference between someone who has a sense of humour and someone determined to undermine their csm position  for a jokei would be more worried about applicants who seem serious but have the intention of undermining the csm if that is possible and in your case i would be worried about suggesting that a player based vote is somehow detrimental to the choice of player representativesshould we be given a choice of player representatives or should we be given them without a votetake care next time you make a post like this your logic leaves a little to be desired
i just want to be on the csm so i can put on my resume that i worked for ccp since i was on the council of stellar managment that means its both an elected position and a mangment position and since there are 300k players or so that means i am managing 300k players and if i win this round that means i will get to say i worked for ccp for one and a half years pretty sweet deal huh
ive never met anybody with so much management experience please send me your cv if youre interested in being ceo of my multibillion international company  im sure that with experience managing so many people you would be a top candidate
did i also mention that im the ceo of about six corporations and im a multi billionaire im pretty much the most qualified person ever you should probably give me ten jobs
full results such as who won will not be published until the 26th we had this scheduled for the 28th however we have decided to pull that back a little this is because the election was held early in order for us to be able to start sorting travel arrangements for csm5 for the june csmccp meeting and we dont want to interfere with the sitting csm too long before their term endsill post up some basic information total number of votes maybe some other bits of info in a sticked forum thread here tomorrow morning
thanks youre fantastic for getting some information out to the drooling people who really wanna know
ill buy you a nonni
you already did not many show up for the meetings and xhagen started to ignore us
confirming i still havent had a reply as to why the ccp csm4 summit minutes are now broken
big thanx to everyone who voted for us and to everyone who voted in general
if ccp has a muppetfilter is this why nothing ever seems to get done
this op simply does not know when to stop
originally by jason hardwickthis man is okay at playing evehe usually flies ibiss and kinda sucks at pvp but overall hes a good candidatedont knock the ibis it can snipe ships out beyond 50km and has a bigger drone bay than most caldari frigates but it really needs a missile hardpoint to make it a proper caldari ship the impairor on the other hand needs changed a laser cap bonus doesnt help if you cant fit enough lasers to stress the capacitor50km my asshehe go illectruculusbump
take an ibis fit it with 150mm railgun ii spike ssensor booster ii targeting range scripttracking enhancer iieven with my less than perfect skills targeting range is 60km and optimal is 54km and falloff is 9km does a piddly 12dps though add a hobgoblin ii and youll more than double this this is of course utterly pointless in the grand scheme of things
thank you for everyones support and good luck to all tamber
now lets hope ccp hurries with letting us knowccp usually lets the winners know at least a few days in advance via email so if you havent heard anything by the 27th its unlikely you made it ingood luck everyone
in this thread ccp diagoras said the announcement date was moved to the 26th he also promised some stats at some point todayhopefully well also get a blue graph from him ccp diagoras loves blue graphs
filthy lies i was framed working on information at the moment
one thing is certain your blue graphs wont ever find themselves in a frame 
i will personally frame diagoras erm blue graphs and give them to xhagen to put on the wall p
getting ccp to release any in depth documentation about any of the features they are implementing would be nice will you be pushing for this
my idea of pimping the bobs are quite different and not thought completely thru they might not be thought on all sides of the coin so if they are crap do kill me ingame in horrible flames of death  give them the allready earlier discussed cloacky bubble with slight implemention let the bubble cloak all uncloaked and uncloak all cloaked  it would be a way to find cloakers easy just fly randomly thru a system with afk cloaker until you find it  the cloaky bubble has few problems i were unable to find a satifying solution a if the bubble is 20km and there are 10 ships inside it how to prevent uncloaking each other or would it be ok to crash and still remain cloacked if inside bubble b if somebody is targetted would it still cloak him c the size of the bubble 5km 15km 55km d should it need fuel give them a aoe weapon maybe as simple as let them fit bomb launcher maybe new kind of bombs to bobs usage only a bomb that is immune to sb bombs but not to other bobs bombs so that in a regular sb bombage you could get one bomb more shot it really needs to be able to fit warfare links as for now a cloacky sneaky gang is getting deacent gang bonuses only if there is a skilled enough t3 pilot abroad and frankly quite often those t3s are fitted to something completely else i may be wrong here but doesnt the covert reconfiguration sub go to same slot as the one that makes warfarelink usage possible there could be created a bunch three new warfare links designed to covert usage  erh ok the minmatar links are pretty awesome to sb gang already p speed sig radius and propulsion jamming range they really dont need anything else  should be so that a bobs giving fleet bonuses works only on a ship where is fitted covert cloaking device give the bobs the covert cloak do not give the bobs more hpresistsdps leave it as it is but give it some useful things like those warfare links or the cloaky bubble give them increased fuel bay so that it actually can roam around without a bunch of transport alts but do not lower the fuel usage also increase slightly the jump range not too much but so that it would be a little more usefulthese were my thoughts of the black ops battle ship pimpages i know there may be some that are technically impossible or it would ruin gamebalance completely but as i have no experience flying a bobs only been jumped by one few times so these are the things i realized also i think that in place of increased dpstank it should be given some more unique bonuses that fits into its role betterugly eric
simple the blasters need moar damage you dont need more rangejust more damage a perhaps better tracking andor decrease signature resolution blasters have more difficulty blaster smaller ships at their range vs autocannons and pulse lasers id say we increase dps by 2530 which will reward the player for being able to close into the enemy a mere 1015 more than pulses or autos makes it not worth trying to travel towards your enemy and take damage before you can deal damage to them
heh ccp has only itself to blame for the current mess it decided projectiles needed a generic boost apparently on the basis of some kind of comparison with lasers while ignoring the characteristics of the ships that they were mounted on that was stupid  the more important comparison is with blasters as both minamtar and gallente ships are best used in solosmallgang combat so we got a projectile boost that undeservedly boosted minmatar ships that were already near the top of the pile  rifter hurricane vaga etc  while not really fixing the minmatar ships that actually did need a bit of help so now we have minmatar ships that are faster more agile and possess longerranged weapons than gallente and thanks to the importance of being able to choose damage types in smallscale fights can often simply outgank their gallente opponents at closerange as well nice one ccp im not sure that overwhelmingly increasing blaster dps is the right way out here doing that can make blasters overwhelmingly powerful in their niche  but i dont think thats good for the game weapons should have an advantage in their niche but it shouldnt be overwhelming otherwise combat becomes more predictable and more boring
i told you guys that it would be like that and i got flamed to hell and back because no projectiles are bad and need moar and some were claiming what ccp is doing is not enough because of scorch actually i have to disagree with you on something even the bad minmatar ships are solid now well ok except the obvious trash which suffers from tier issues ala stabber and stuff even the tempest is preety cool these days if you use it like a tier 3 battlecruiser and not a ganktank battleship i dont really do snipingthe previously bad ones are now actually rather passable and just fine the previously good ones are just a bit too awesome because of a combination of ship stats and good weapons and so on still doing anything with them doesnt fix gallente in the slightest because blasterboats already suck compared to amarrcaldari for everything solo included tbhblasters seem in many ways to be balanced around the state we had in 2007 when they were the ultimate closerange dps dealers and for instance the difficulty of fitting neutrons was there to offset their facemelting capability then amarr got boosted multiple times then minmatar got their boost and so did caldari a bit previously torps did at least the fact you cannot fit highest tier guns without fitting mods on any subbs t1 ship is now completely out of place both minmatar and amarr can active tank bonuses on subbs ships need to go the way of the dodo really utility high needs to be the norm even at the cost of just blatantly adding 1 more slot to some ships what cyclone has 1 more slot then brutix already the guns themselves need a revisit  everything but neutrons has lol dps and  range and is really useless and even neutrons are a bit meh i think a ship makeover alone with easier fitting would go a looong way
first it was obvious that something had to change because there were really two tiers of weaponry  those that worked and those that didnt there were plenty of arguments for bringing the overly awesome weapons down to earth and plenty for boosting the overly sucky weapons up ccp chose to boost the overly sucky weapons up the end result was that projectiles are roughly balanced with missiles and lasers while hybrids are getting the shaftthis wasnt necessarily the wrong solution  merely an incomplete onebite your tongue there are ships which it works well onlianged and gypsio the only reason that people feel that minmatar was better at solosmall gang pvp was mostly because they were better at avoiding solo and small gang pvp when you look at the vaga from the perspective of the cerb it looks pretty damn overpowered for solosmall gang pvp and to a point youd be right but looking at the cerb from the perspective of a vaga in a gang with more than 23 people and the cerb starts to look pretty damn overpowered this is not a problemalso anyone looking to the hurricane as being better at solosmall gang pvp with the drake around is ing crazy even after the projectile boost
it doesnt work well on the brutix or the astarte because they need the speed and the damage mods and stuff on paper it works on the myrmidon particularly with drugs and stuff but tbh the typical way to die in a solo bc is to get baited and blobbed or die in a gang on gang fight where in both situations nanoing it particularly if you have snakes is just much better and you still kill the usual suspectsso while the rep bonus is somewhat useful sometimes id argue there is a ton of bonuses the myrm could get which would be much much more useful because so many good setups dont use it at alli guess theyre ok on bs because tank scales much better then dps as you go upbut anyway the rep bonus has nothing at all to do on turret ships which need damage mods to be useful
or the brutix and astarte need more lows
and more fitting and stuff and so onthe thing is this to get a credibleish active tank for a bc you need a minimum of 5 lowslots 2 reps 2 eanms or eanmexp hardener for astarte dc which leaves you with exactly 0 lowslots on the say brutix which translates into poor dps by virtue of not fitting any damage mods so lets add one extra lowslot which would be good ok now you can have a magstab but even if fitting got changed so you can in fact fit cap booster neutrons dual reps and mwd which would be a huuuge fix for the brutix were talking about the difference between 735 dps for maxed 1 mfs brutix and 848 dps for maxed 2 mfs brutix plated tank requires one low less or 934 dps for 3mfs shield brutix which could then fit eg dual tes or te plus speed mod or stuff sure such a active armor brutix would be modestly useful for someone who does use drugs and have a fancy implant or two but for it to really make sense the armor rep rig penalty needs to get changed to something other then speed something irrelevant preferably and this should be done anyway else when you combine the speed drop and the dps drop and so on between a shield buffer version and active armor version its not really worth it for a lot of situationson the other hand it could live with a generically useful bonus like eg falloff or anything gun related for that matter
rack of ions and 2x rep with 6 lows would be more than enough to bring a dual rep brutix in line with other ganky bcs
active tanking bc dont make sense as long as you can get 152x more armor for just 6 mil worth of rigs and the 1600mm plate is significantly better than armor repjust calculate how long you need to active repair in order to break even with the plate on hp added  forget the cap requirements1600mm plate 4200 hp 125 from skill 152 from rigs total hp bonus 7980medium armor repper 320 hp over 9 sec after skill 1375 hp ship bonus 12 from combat booster 141 from active boost rigs stacking penalized you get 74448  9 sec or 8272 hpsectherefore to active repair 7980 you need 96 seconds and about 1715 capthis doesnt even include the added hp bonus from passive hp rigs to base ship armor which for typical bc adds at least another 2000 hp while active rigs get nothing like thatso in best case scenario your active rep plays you your advantage if the battle duration is at least 100 seconds and you dont neuted and you are willing to pay for boosters with passive mode you get all those benefits upfront not 100 seconds later and if you are in a real pinch you want those hp up front or you diethanks to ccps carelessness with defensive rigs making them vastly superior to offensive ones and making them ridiculously cheap active armor rep has became near obsoletesince passive armor rigs are so advantages to have they are nearly a musthave and that means you have to sacrifice speed at least 15 less speedi suppose this is a rant for another topic but the root of the problem is the same  ccp has incompetent game designers
ions and 1 mfs with ganky bcs it does 700 dps ffs at hugging ranges lets compare it to other stuff blaster myrmidon 846 dps hpl harb does 823 dps can fire all way to disruptor range fmpplated2hs harb 669 dps again longer ranged 3 mfs neutron brutix 934 dps ham drake 719 dps w terror rage usable vs bcs 654 dps w cn terror again longer ranged 3 gyro 425mm ii 2 neut shiedfit hurricane 763 dps w selectable damage types and much longer rangeso you do lower end basically you outdamage fmp harb and cn terror drake to gain a active tank which slows you down using weapons which have hugging range this is sortof important and that somehow is in line with those ships i dont think so tbh if it could fit neutrons and if armor repair rigs didnt kill speed like they do which in addition to bad range hurts you even more since any ship above can preety much kite you with rig penalty in then you might have a point but this way no not reallytbh i wouldnt agree on armor rigs being a must passive tanking yes for a ship like the brutix the killer really is the speed penalty plus lower agility and speed because of plate anyway it does 0 damage outside of scram range so unless its fast enough to have a good chance of getting there no matter how much ehp youve stacked its still useless it really likes the shield amount rigs better and you still gain 16k ehp more then rep fit changing rep and resist rigs not to penalize speed and leaving trimarks penalizing speed would bring in some more balance between them
but you cant make em drinkyoure giving the ships extra effective modules slots just as you can use the range bonus to tank as liang describes you use the lock range bonus for the same thing
would adjusting signature resolution of hybrids not make them more powerful yet unique and fit with their style of play a long range weapon would generally be designed to be accurate at that range so a 10 or so reduction in signature resolution across the board combined with their traditionally crappy tracking would give them more powerful specialized roles based on a higher probability of getting better hits would it not
a signature resolution bonus is a tracking boost there is no difference between the two
thats not exactly accurate signature radius vs signature resolution is a much simplified version of weapons accuracythere was a dev post on this but i cant find it if you take a regular rifle and bench mount it the ammo will not hit the exact same spot every time its fired this is eves signature resolutionif you have a 1 foot diameter round target the closer you are to that target the easier it is to hit it as long as its not moving get close enough and you are very likely to strike dead center very often move it out 100 yards and if the rifle has a signature resolution of 125 feet 100 yards then it will miss the 1 foot diameter target 15 of the time regardless of the target moving or notif i find the dev blog i will post it but it actually gave the above example showing shot patterns on round targets this is partially why the theorized formula for gun tracking doesnt seem to work properly at long ranges i would say this is a good guess as limited testing shows it to not function accurately but its on the eve wiki and i am not opposed to being wrong on this as it was a long time ago
i like this idea however there needs to be a disadvantage to using it otherwise it would break game balance their only means of offensive and nearly most of defense lies within the drones and the counter to that are things like destroying them with smartbombs or shooting them down the fact that you could call them midbattle into the bay and repair them then drop them out again really makes those ships that much more powerful its much like creating ammo out of thin air for a battleship that has run lowit could be a module or perhaps cost capacitor or fuelresource to use it for example i just dont see the point of buffing an already powerful ship
bumping for prosperity
ive heard a lot of people complain about how boring the current sov system is with many reinforcement timers and a lot of waiting in my opinion thats another good reason to change it to a system like thissay that you have exactly as many reinforcement timers as the system industrymilitary index at index 1 there will only be a single reinforcement timer meaning half as much waiting as today but at index 5 it will be 5 reinforcement timers pretty much impossible to break through and very boring to even try
i like this idea leave the possibility to attack systems with the current cumbersome timers but also allow to use this attrition warfare to lower timers or to make them more unpredictable and to capture the system youll still need large fleet anyway so basicly something to do for both large fleets and small gangs winwin really really good idea supported

so far we can only sort our modules by type quantity name and something else i never use id like to suggest we be able to sort our stuff by meta level ive wasted countless hours going through all the stuff in my hanger trying to find meta 4 modules to bring to market it would make the game a bit less tedious if we could just find what we need when we need it instead of scrolling through an endless list of modulesthis could be done quite easily by simply adding a meta column to the details or list display options of our items window

form personal experience i can confirm that high end shield tanking is vastly superior to high end armor tanking about 25 times bettermajor reason for this is the difference between crystal and slave set only shields benefit with 153x boostsecondary major advantage is cap usage only shields get nearly 05x cap usage at same time as higher boost bonus armor only gets boost bonus no capthe problems are specific to high end gear t2 stuff is pretty balancedi support this thread only if t2 stuff is untouched
yes the real focus should be the high meta level armor reps meta 5t2 and low meta reps do not have such a vast difference in quality
also the prizetags are pretty different and mark that a large armor repper should be compared to a large shield boosteri can not support this i think overall balance in armor vs shield still goes to armor due to crappy shield rreric
mmm so you want a crystalslevel tank but to keep your 5s plugged
on behalf of manalapan i preset you with this
the csm has been touted by ccp as a department right with real imput to get a cohesive say from the playerbase its time to put that to the testthis is a proposal in itself to cover many proposals in this forum already however the proposal is urging ccp that the next expansion be focused on improving current content instead of adding new content that providing a sustaining environment is just as vital as adding to itfaction war needs help badlymissions are 2 dimensionallowsec is a vast wastelandthere are network and connectivity issues lagmany ships need balancing work done such as rocket based and assault shipsthe dominion sov system needs tweakingthis is a plea for ccp to focus on fixing the backlog of issues before the game becomes unplayable
yes exactly that is what eve needs id even go further and say that ccp should look at every feature every ship every weapons system and every item in game and bring it all in line with each othersupersupported
they cant even change cyno effects in less than a yeari dont think they got the slightest idea on how to fix the things you mentioned therefore this thread is kind of pointless we need specific threads that address specific issues that tell ccp exactly what to do so they dont  it up
they were examples the point is that the next expansion should work on fleshing out current content and not so much as adding anything newperfection shouldnt be expected but some actual effort in focusing the development to actually handling current issues might be needed
with soon to fail tyranis expansion  halfbaked  bugged as hell and boring  lets be honest after a month everyone will treat pi as a another job they have to do  ccp will have even more stuff to fixthey should spend next 6 months  fixing and upgrading stuff they currently have
bellum in a doesnt know jack about blasters shocker who would have thought blasters with falloff are essentiali hate to think that youre so fast you stay in optimal or hell that you dont start shooting until youre sitting on the targetcmon now gallente dont care about falloffmy ship isnt gold and im not easy to tank think you trained the wrong race if you dont want falloff op didnt actually read teh threadbut seeing a bellum a once respected combatant now turned eveo celebwhiner complain about falloff on blasterswell rage
seems everyone is missing the obvious fix for this just set the cloaks to have 1 hr cycle times and then it turns off any pilot who isnt completely ed will simply turn the cloak back on at that point if your afk it wont be turned back on speaking for myself if i lose my cloaky proteus bcuz i didnt notice my cloak turn off while probing i deserve to lose the ship the only slight annoyance is i have to move to a different safe every hour just in case someone scanned me down in the 10 second cloak cooldown
info war links need to be looked at active tanking is a gallente trait and just like the claymore it buffers ok the idea of drone links is terrible
i always found it odd that the ew ganglinks are the gallante speciality
the eos is a support command ship it can fit three warfare link mods its not meant to be tanking anything its meant to be behind the fleet with the logistics giving bonuses if anything it should have the turret damage bonus replaced with armor hp or resists if you wanna dps fly an astarte
thisits like people want gallente to have two ganktank cs as they used to and everyone else has a fleet cs and a field cs doesnt make a lot of sense really
you know they might be looking that direction because its the entire combat philosophy of the race and its not like info gang mods are useful in 99 of the situations people find themselves in yes you can occasionally use them but its pretty damn rare tbh even for an ewar heavy corp like mineliang
no the command ship without a eank  primary  dead commandship fleet with no commandship  dead fleettherefore it needs an adequate tank which it does not have atm and an adequate link bonus which it does not have etherand by the way commandship is a support ship by definition anyone care to explain why the hell does it have a bonus to dronebay size and hybrid turret damage thats two wasted bounces right there
tbh if you primary a command ship you fail anyway the tank isnt what bothers me i can work with it as i said although if it was given a better powergrid then yeh that would be be greatthe links are badlets have this as an example assume you have 4 members who each want to be a booster they fly with perfect skills damnation vulture claymore eos now the chances of picking the eos as the booster is practically zero its like the fat kid at school who gets picked last because the popular rich kid damnation gets all the girlsanyway drone buffing seemed very gallente dont see how that is a major thing tbh amarr buff all things armor caldari buff all things shield minmatar buff all things pvp having information links changed to benefit drones only wouldnt seem that op imo
on the world map control panel under my information i propose a new optionmy available locator agentsthis would have the same purpose as my available agents except that it would only highlight agents with location servicesi propose this because right now its a bit of a hassle finding locators agents available to me that ive never used before i have to crossreference eveagentscom with my current standings to figure out which available locator agents are nearby
minor but handy supported
yep
totally against no moar missioner boostswhere is that thumbs down buttonremove all lvl5s from high sec aswell
i think the point here was that you could do the entire mission then salvage with drones in that way u could just send out the drones instead of having a salvagertractor on so yea ur getting 2 high slots back which means faster missioning plus having drones to do the work for you either way totally against
i think that would be the better idea salvaging drones where already discussed i think the reason they where not introduced i dont know but the disadvantages where bigger then the use tractor drones could have maybe a different skill tractor range which is per skill level 8 km to the 20km tractor line of the ship so lvl 5 would be a range of 60 km
i agree that tractor drones are a better idea than salvage drone in order to keep things balanced however rather than giving them huge range on the tractor give them bonuses to mwd speed and tractor speed per level that way the donre gets out the wreck grabs it at say 8k and brings it back to your ship to be salvaged have to have the bonus to tractor speed so the drone doesnt lose the tractor lock by going faster than than the tractor does

tbh i preferred emo tjs posts at least they made sense and were sort of legibleanyhow back on to your post if youre finding that gatecamping is boring dont do itthis isnt a wow style game where the devs ram the fun in your face you only get to have fun here if you can be bothered to find it for yourself
i dont pvp but there is thing that ccp can do to make the game fun and not so much like work and i have been on many ts and vent voise chat and all u here is how boared people are i mine for the most part and do mission and like i said i only play because of real life friends if it was not for want to hang out with them online because we live so far apart i would not be here or maybe we should just find another game that has more to it
get out of my head james
if youre playing eve and not enjoying eve you really need to find a different game to playeve does not have convenient pockets of fun interspersed with walking around eve requires thought and decision making you have to make your own fun  no one is going to hand it to youunless of course you think having your ship exploded is fun in which case there are lots of people who will be happy to bring you fun you can find most of them in crime and punishment

im really torn on this one on the one hand the most common uses for this might be handy to keep things sorted on the other hand most sorting can be done either through detail view search function or station containers on the one hand it would mean i wouldnt have to pay for station containers but on the other hand it would mean increased lag especially in busy systemsalternate proposal seed station containers for 10 isk and set npc buy orders for station containers at 5 isk and remove the whole repackaging delay thing change station containers to simple containers instead of secure audited containers wed get the functionality of folders without the hassles currently associated with station containers

i dont see a real purpose for the ship also  it either jams cynos or it lights them not both at the same time also aoe effects are bad because the increase the server load quite a bit imhoon the style  normally you develop an idea in the fi forum and then bring it up in the assembly hall redirecting all discussion to the assembly hall isnt really nice
that was by no means my intent the link to the fi forum is for people to comment change and adapt the idea while this post is just for shows of support or dislike nothing else extensive talks about its merits or detriments should be taken to the features and ideas board i have linkedalso im posting answers to questions and comments placed here on that board just an fyi

the idea of removing the flagship role from titans and building it into a new ship i like your proposal though is just completely bizarre it bears no resemblance to how ships actually work in eve no thanks
confirming i will be flying the wi tigerclaw
datacores are usually spread a bit 100 jumps to fetch them is not unusualmy idea isright click on the agent with the research points in question there is a function create contract in the contract you choose delivery you tell how much research points worth the contract is say a dc is worth 100 rp and you have 2000 rp in the journal then the contract consist bringing datacores worth of 2000 rp to where ever the rp will be loaded in the contract naturally you work with a collateralthe hauler gets the 20 datacores in a package and delivers themthat would save some people time and bring some people more hauling income personally i would be perfectly ok to pay 35 delivering fee in order not to make the grand tourwhat do you think i dunno if you can open delivery packages but with the collateral the theft would be ok as i would get at least the money worst case i would need to buy the datacores with the collateral
supporting me of course 
it would make far more sense if you could just talk to the agent remotely and get your datacores that way and then courier them from there
this id support
no use a courier contract or get them yourself you could just sell them in station as well its not like you cashing in daily anywayccp talked about having interbus operate as an npc courier service this was several years ago and nothing have been done with it i doubt they would add it for data coresthis is a better idea even so no hurry
did they mention current ships in the insurance changes i dont know about you but i paid full insurance for my current ship so if theres gonna be a change we should get the current insurance until we die or at least get a percentage of our payment to the insurance company back
you get neither the contract is retroactively changed no reimbursement go wander around 00 for a while before tyrannis drops see what you can do to get your money back out of it its far too late for the csm to do anything
someone just bought a stabber that he thought was a stabber fleet issue
i dont care about the scamming but the spamming is as annoying as ccp where is your hard antimacro stance when it comes to people in jita repeating the same sentence every x seconds
i wish people wouldnt necro old threads its embarrassing when i dont read the whole thing reply to it and then realize i already replied multiple times
supported i too would like scammers to turn into gms

blobs exist in part atm because its so ing impossible to attack someone in any sort of enjoyable campaign and expect results other than killmails cyno jammers are a big part of the problem when a defender can more easily online a new one and keep capitals in system while adding more through jump bridges defenders get left with the problem of staging in system and fearing the  cage effect or leaving system with little chance of getting the jammer down again hp on stations and pos make it even harder because theyre so high it virtually assures that an smaller organization will have to commit an entire day to one system rather than have the capability of attacking multiple systems at once this again benefits the defender because they can stagger timerson top of it all with insurance the way it is theres no way to bleed wealth off an alliance simply by roaming systems the point of these changes is to remove a lot of the defender advantages and provide more opportunities to create fighting rather than the set timer affect i would have included insurance but slowly it appears ccp is getting their head out of the sand on that issue even if they havent got a clue how to fix it yet as always the biggest problem 00 faces is that it needs very hard changes and nobody is willing to sacrifice their own safety nets for the sake of the game people want to be spoon fed and the result is this  hole ccp has createdim speaking as a recent defender of the north that it was just way to easy even if the attackers were a bunch of clueless gits
i fuel all my jump bridges with badger mk 2sas far as i know you can not have the cyno gen and cyno jammer online at the same time the really crap bit is that if you have a cyno gen mod installed in your hub and decided to put the cyno jammer in there you still get the 2 million a day bill forever and ever
while your statement is true it presupposes this was a good idea
i chuckle every time you make a fool of yourself
good example on someone that is crying
allthough i have no clue why it is necessary to write every comment capitalized i support the ideaexternal remote repper are supporting the enemy therefore it is indirect aggression against the opponent
the bounty system is broken and needs some attention
man some of the suggestions on these forums are awfulnot supported
your missing the point of the post dude it isnt is there a way to do this its id like an easyer way if i wanted reality in my games id just go on a real life killing spree i play games because i want the fantasy of the game i reiterate fantasy secondly i get your input but instead of stateing things like there the facts and your ccp law dog 1 why not state your opinion and leave the rule whipping to ccp employees were here suggesting our ideas that is how games like this evolve by players suggestions
i just thought of smething else the training que its just a small gripe of mien that im limitedto setting a 24 hour training que but to effectivaly train my skills i have to plan a years worth of skills to train now im not saying expand the training que to fufill a full year training plan but i would like to see the ability to using level 1 and 2 skills plus some level 3 plot a 48 hour que or cut back on the time betwene remappings just a thought
a lot of those questions can be answered by simply checking out the eve wikieve wikicapital ships are barred from highsec for a reason which was explained when ccp nerfed highsec capital production that includes the rorqual which is explicitly designed for lownull sec if you want a highsec rorqual the best youre going to get is an orca so stop complaining about itcompacting ore doesnt much matter for when youre refining it just makes it easier to move than the original unitswhich can be fixed by just refining it as for moving your ships invest in a freighter or do what everyone else does move them manuallyas for labspos stuff is explained in tons of detail all over the forum on 3rd party sites and on the wikido your homework before you complain about thingsidont even know how to respond to that
hay what if u dont get the best refine in the system u r mining and and want to trance port the ore back to were u have faction at for the best refine u can get would it not be nice to compact the ore so u can do this and remeber this is fictanle game and ccp can change this if enough player request it so insted of saying it cant be done why not say please corect this and make my life ezyer it a game fun should be the top pryority on the list
ok i get that cap ships are banned for a reason i understand why the roriqual was banned didnt know about the 50 mining so i conciet that kinadyan on the other hand i can no speak for now about leaving a text marking on the ships banned from highsec that is truily a good idea it gives information that is important ie i would like to be a titan pilot however i am not ready for lowsec theirfore i dont want to be a fool and purchase everything for a titan and plan to run it in high sec but before i found out that ships were limited in some cases to lowsecnulsec i could have made that mestake it took another more expeirenced player telling me how stupid i was to accualy make me seek information also some ships have special abilities like the roraquals compacting now untill the day before yesterday i didnt even know that you needed compaction blueprints to run the compactionshouldent this information be readily availble in game for players sure its in the wiki and everybody should read the wiki cover to cover but you tell me honistaly that youve read the entire wiki and i have beach front properity in nevada for real cheep to sell the one who buys that finnaly for myself moving my small ragtag band of ships i own is easy enough right now i own an orca and can carry two of my other ships making it down to running my orca and my bs seperatly but if i may impose fantisy to your staunch reality a moment what if you chould transport perhaps 4 battleships worth of rigged ships to a large fleet combat zone prefitted and rigged for players in your fleet so in the event they loose their current ship then they warp to the het heavy equpment transport support ship and grab their backup now you have a combat ready pilot in seconds rather than him having to go and totally refit a new ship which can be vary time consuming this can turn a battle in your favor quickly that is the heart of the idea for having something bigger than an orca to hual ships and to top that idea off why not limit this het support ship to just hualing ships that are fitted and rigged and yes perhaps that kind of power is better suited to being locked in lowsec but its one hell of a good idea to think about now isnt it
and the cpp said unto the playerbase why do you cry to me tell the children of the eve gate to go forwardlift up high your rage and stretch out your hand over the sea of tears and divide it and the children of eden shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea of tearsand this is how it happenedthen karma stretched out her hand over the sea of tears and the ccp caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind smelling slightly of sulphurish ash all thought the night  and made of the sea of tears into a dry land and the peoples were divided
its great to see a much higher turnout than the previous csm lets hope that the high level of interest in the csms work continues through its lifetimeid just like to say best of luck to all the players who put their hat in the ring for this election i cant imagine it must have been easy to come under such scrutiny from your fellow players and if your elected or not you can be proud of your contribution to the game
well theres two things that increased turnout in these elections1 openness from ccp csm4  ccp did a great job of making the process more transparent and the achievements more visible which has interested more people than before2 old candidates being able to run again has caused for ferocious campaigning hate slander and much other hilarity which again increased the media coverage of the event and thereby the amount of people that votedwhat needs to be done now is that csm5 and ccp continue to provide a detailed account of the process and what it leads to there will always be bitter vets who simply think that the csm is useless but much can be gained among the rest of the playerbase
a quick thought about the increased voting turnouti was wondering how many players with multiple accounts only voted with one of thempersonally i have multiple accounts but i dont like the idea of casting more than one vote as it dosent seem democratic i know its probbaly impossible to tell how many people voted more than once but its something to consider when looking at the voting statistics
i think almost everyone with 1 account votes with each of them you can see that by the comments of support throughout various candidates threads since theres no practical way of limiting votes by individual persons doing it by authenticated via login account is the only realistic option it doesnt make any sense not to cast all your allowed votes due to philosophical reasons everyone else will be giving full support to their preferred candidates you might as well do so too  next time around i miss your podcast
i know a number of people with multiple accounts who split their votes between candidates they liked of course there is a chance that splitting votes too much means none of your voted for candidates gets in but that is the risk you take
updated first post withsome wonderful graphs of times that votes were cast first votes per dayplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesand votes per hour of the dayplease visit your user settings to reenable images
interesting that really shines and interesting light on those first 3 days of mass trade hub spamming with direct links to vote for ankh and the static order of the list with her on top would be neat to find out if there is a relation there in the numbersalso you broke the forum layout
that 3 days was also before the weekend
at last we get the official blue graphs excellent though now i have to find something else to joke about
another potential interesting graph to makewhere the voters cast their vote or where their clone is set to 3 characters per account but i guess you can go with the character that has the most spmaybe post the difference between the votes of the candidates who got in vs the candidates who didnt as well see if the claim that its only 00 people who are interested in the csm is validage of characters who abstained vs age of people who voted for someone would be interesting as well to see if abstains are all bitter vetsas far as the previous graphs go the first 3 days dont correspond to spamming in local i think i believe they correspond to the natural voter base of people people who knew before the elections started who theyd vote for while the rest of the days are people who got convinced to vote for this candidate or that one
very interesting this was something i wanted to see i was not expecting to see such a large number of voters at the last minute and as i typed this i realized how dumb of an assumption that was human beings always wait till the last minute for everything still the number is significant my interest is that it might be worth it to reduce the election time or not guess it does not matter much ether way thanks for the graphs
lots of ppl seem to do that considered it myself for a long time tooedit oh and yay o on the increasing voter numbers
cat wins and ankh loses or i will erupt another volcano just saying
im not a her otherwise it is correct
1260 for 9th place that a pretty competition but i really hope that i havent wasted my 4 votes i have 4 accounts and candidate for whom i voted will be in csm for 2nd time especially considering really big help to russian community from him and his past achievements guess who i voted for though its pretty obvious and not hard to find out even if it isnt obviousand about blue graphs it is interesting that number of whats during dt is pretty higher then just befor dt and just after dt
tamber from a personal standpoint concerning your lottery im disappointed but also because your one of the better people in eve and youd do a heck of a job as a primary for whatever reason if your vote counter on that website is accurate your not even an alternate this time around i can only assume powerblock voting is involved and im truly sorry to see that happenthe csm is inherently flawed by the overwhelming influence of mega alliances and powerblocks unless ccp is willing do something to address this more and more its going to become very clear that its a joke to even vote while there was a spike in voting i believe that this was forced by the nc and sc conflict as people in both groups try to get their people on the council with the potential of affecting the war i am sorry to see that my vote is inherently wasted
considering the actual results havent been released i wouldnt cry mega alliance blob foul just yetin csm4 only around 4 of the 9 delegates or 6 of the 14 if you include the alternates were from large alliances
there wasnt a full scale war on then like there is right now increases the likely hood and the voterspike for me is cause for concern not joy
breaking news ankh openly said on a big dutch website she watches  this shouldve come a few weeks earlier and gave you lots of votes watch from 210 the rest is about her buddies at the pirate party whats in a name clickso whats your favorite movie gallente girls gone wild
so is it griefing if the entire community bands up to kill ankh if she somehow wins csm and tries to make eve into hello kitty adventure island because i really really want to do that something with a catchy namesorta like hulkageddon iiah ankhegeddon
i enjoy a cheap laugh as much as anyone but seriously youre going to make fun of someone for watching  its so ubiquitous that even if someone specifically claims that they dont i assume that theyre lying also carebears gone wild isnt  its a documentary about people who refuse to shoot other players but decide to let their hair down every once in a while and fly tackle
if id have voted i would have voted for you
i wonder if natanas blindly fanatical ankh campaign and hate campaign against me and others had any influence on the results
finnagain zero1 above is someone else painting perhaps a more balanced picture compared to what you guys are saying2 as for ankhs ideas some ideas are in line with other csm on a scale of being moderate her more appalling ideas ie the focus of much debate is her representing her play style viewpoint contrary to your statements of she will ruin the game this ankh individual or any other single individual on csm does not wield enough power to make decisions on their own even after the csm process the developers ccp  who have pretty good grasp of sandbox  are not gonna jeopardize the various play styles with those kind of extreme ideasin all likelyhood we might get her good ideas while the bad ideas will not get traction 3 i rather have passionate candidates represent us then dead weight  obviously our views differ i ask you though would you want someone representing pvp  00 to turn out to be a lame duck  would you want your candidate to dilute their message for the sake of appeasement 4  ps i wonder if this hate campaign actually gave ankh more fodder to convince the carebears who would normally be apatheticgg
i sense some emorage here relax ankh your life wont be over just because you cant control eve remember not to fly anything you cant afford to lose and seriously ankh we all know its you so just gubble it up and post with it you only fool youself as usual
his name is adam rid  ohh no wait 
 i missed the drama excellent stuff tbh you guys were more entertaining than rl politics 3until next year i guess 
awesome
yep heres a joke candidate mazz here to grace us with her ineptitude
well i personally eneded up voting for sokratesz planned to put my votes on angelus but he withdrew his candidacy sadly enoughoh well lets hope we see the playerbase vote seriously because i would hate to see some of those who run in the csm5
imminent tearstamber
i dont care who wins because i hate you now you ruined my csm way to gowe should have backed a winner like webcamforisk or someone else suitably qualified
i just heard i won every slot including the alts now i have to make 18 trips to iceland yikesissler dainzea csm fan
i started the eve blog don quixote from space like a month ago which i like updating once in a while actually it is easier to find a dead moment to write than to play eve i was reading the programs of the different csm candidates with half an eye the other day and i wrote something about it i am posting it here since it belongs here and its the only place it will probably get read by a few peopleif i missed the ideas of some candidates i apologizeand if someone else has other ideas for discouraging blob tactics i would like to hear themedit i forgot to mention that in the blog article i asked myself the question what my character would do if he would run for csm that is why i am talking about my own campaign headlines i am definitely not a csm candidate myselfgeneral consensusone thing that struck me was the general consensus among the present candidates eliminating lag seems to be on top of the general wishlist while boosting small gang pvpdiscouraging blob tactics incentivizing low security space and building a better ui are all important secondssome ideas about incentivizing low security space are as old as the conflict between the amarr and minmatar people for example since mining in low security is usually not as lucrative as it is in high security while being a lot more dangerous it has been obvious for ages that ccp should boost the mining there like adding some 00 ores to them some ideas are newer but yet remain simple which is always a good thing like adding some pirate faction agents to low sec space as paritybit seems to want uiwise the best idea in my opinion is the one trebor daehdoow has to add addons to the eve interface as i understand it it comes down to players being able to highly customize their ui for the job at hand in game by decorating the existing interfacei read about more interesting less high scale ideas toolike make it possible to sell kill rights another one i found at paritybit love that oneor for pve the idea of ankhesentapemkah to make dynamic missions i guess a bit like the random dungeonsbossessubquestsdrops the blizzard diablo games have i am a fan like most people of making pve more like pvp too for all the obvious reasonsand another point on which there is a lot of general consensus do something about the exagerated insurance payouts of battleships the cost right now to gank freighters and expensive mission ships in high security is ridiculously low
my campaign headline discouraging blob tactics as they are nowfor my campaign headlines i started thinking about why i play eve i see it less as a game to prove myself than some others do i like just flying around in space wandering from one side of the universe to the other having just met a whitecollar criminal having flown through another solar system struck by anarchy knowing some of my mining friends in nullsec just docked because their enemies came looking for them some others are happily hunting pirates and another is somewhere moving his trade cargo between the hubs of the four empires it is easy for me to get under hales skin and feel a bit like i am actually there i guess that makes me a roleplayer in disguise but with eve you at least roleplay your own unique character it is not like you are doing the same quest thousands of others do on a daily basis for thrall or whatever his name may behaving said that i would like the pvp to be a bit more engaging though right now you need 2 scouts and 1 good fc and you are set for a 50ppl rr bs gang i am simplifying things here but only to make a point there are too many grunts in fleets and the impact of numbers negates the need for individual skill and game knowledge too much i do not dislike huge fights i dislike the way the fcs call primary after primary flushing tons of game detail individual skill and variety in shiptypes through the drain some csm candidates propose ideas or entire solutions for thisone of the points in mynxees program is discouraging blob tactics by removing some of their advantages perhaps by subjecting fleets over a certain size to stacking penalties tied to the ship types in each wingsquad i like this idea because it is simple although it does not deal with the problem as nearly as efficient as more complicated ideas would doanother idea from trebor daehdoow again changes game mechanics to deal with lag in such a way namely by only showing the n closest ships to your ship on grid that fights might become more interesting since every little region of the fight needs to have decisionmaking one fc cant see everything anymore the importance of range and speedeg changing your position to see the ships you want to see would skyrocket with this approach though it is a brilliant idea but the impact on combat would probably be too big for ccp to give it a tryanother creative idea is the idea of noise described in to blob or not to blob this means delayinglimiting the number of ships that can lock a single ship so it is difficultnot possible for 100 ships to focus fire on one if the obvious exploits can be circumvented this is one of the best things that could happen to fleet warfare in my eyes in theory it would mean squads would need individual targets which means they would need individual decisionmaking hence the need for more fcsor heavily multitasking fcs as the number in your gang rises ccp should be able to at least get something out of these ideas and implement it to make pvp more challenging
the brilliance of wormhole spacemy second campaign headline would have been asking ccp to add truly uncharted space the important features for this new space would have been a place where it is impossible to hotdrop people or bridge fleets in in short a place where capitals online did not start yet every man and every dog in eve seems to own a capital at present even yours truly don quixote here who is a total noob has a thanatos carrier the number of supercaps ingame is ridiculous too i know some smaller alliances quite well and two of them even have a titan i even dont want to know how many the large alliances have i wanted space in which capitals are at least rare  a place without local its just a lot more exciting to fly around knowing a even probably unfair fight might be lurking around the corner distant from normal space have the feeling i am actually flying away from home a place where large powerblocks are less important a place where if you bring 10 people chances are low you will be outnumbered 3 to 1the longer i thought about it the more i realized that my uncharted space was already in the game wormhole space i just never realized it ofcourse it is not so uncharted anymore but the things that were realistic to wish for are in it maybe going tocoming from normal space is too easy and there should be much deeper wormhole spaces that never link to normal space or something but still i think ccp did an amazing job on this one i thought it was just a nice feature but it is more than that it is designed for particular wishes among the players and corporations really a job well done
you know the voting closed two days ago right i mean its a good writeup and while i disagree with some of your preferences i think you did a good job but all the votes are in so it really doesnt matter much any more also trebors idea to have a moddable ui is hardly one exclusive to him i ran on that platform for csm2 and csm3 and i wasnt the only one to support it mazzilliu got csm3 to pass it and ccp rejected it so as much as id love it its dead trebor is just the only one not to have noticed
moddable ui was also passed by csm1 or 2 and rejected by ccp its not going to happen
i was going to post about demanding money in order to vote for you but then realized at least one of you if not both willa get electedb ignore meso lets make a compromise i wont ask for money instead all i want is free machrialdealoo
so youre a troll drama queen bigot and just plain rude way to show what a great potential candidate you are for csm6 or any other future election instead of doing what you just did all you had to do was send some emails over ccp about the issue and it would have been solved quickly using the way you acted as an example would you vote for an official candidate in a political election after she acted like that i highly doubt itfurthermore yes mistakes do happen however im with the ccp poster and this wasnt likely to have happened it sounds like just a poorly constructed fabrication to get some forum attention yay for you
thread locked as ccp diagoras has already answered the question
new csm soon new support by the csm way i see it if every csm brings it to ccp for the next 10 years we might have a shot at this support the dead horse pos thread to long have the pos managers of neweden been ignored its amazing that poss are the base of tech 2 and tech 3 equipment and yet ccp has left them to rot just because something works doesnt mean it couldnt work better at least some changes in the right direction would go a long way to making pos managers a lot happier people much less grumpy and annoyed if your a pos manager and are not grumpy and annoyed your doing it wrong p
supported hell i supported this five years ago fix the bloody things ccpyouve had dozens of viable suggestions of how to fix the pos system hell one of the csms submitted a viable draft proposal of how to fix the pos system years ago why do we constantly have bread and circuses before we do things like ambulation lets do fix existing problems now that pos are no longer responsible for sovreignty theres no reason not to overhaul them
do give them covert ops cloak
overload the rep like any sane pilot would do and it starts to look a lot betteror youre engaged in more than one fight or the fight is not contiguous oractually for the most part you just die anyway the margin on fights you can escape because of plates vs reps is pretty thin when youre flying in very small gangssolo tank matters just as much as gankagain see how it keeps coming down to the speed aspectmaking them fast and agile will not remove the advantage of skirmish from minmatar the advantage of skirmish is to be able to run away and you cannot do that when your effective range is within full tacklescramweb range and you have little extra support mechanismsspare high slots for neuts etc
so boost speed and give blaster boats moar utility i still think they shouldnt be as agile as minnie ships just faster straight line speed blaster damage also needs to be increased within that zone of death vs a blaster boat should be a zone of death
yeah keep parroting that because that will really end up in a massively useful ship exceptin tq the best way to lose a solo bc is to get blobbed and die and bar a skirmish fit the second best way to deal with this is by having enough dps to kill it as fast as possiblepeople you fight may actually fit a local tank and if you cannot break it youre stuck there doing a who has more cap boosters matchunlike ehp and dps which are useful always local tank is useful only while you are primary which really matters even in small gang situationsexcept the part where it does since you can no longer get away and while the lol idea of stuff like brutixes becoming the new zoom to it and tackle ship doesnt seem to nerf skirmish of another race to you it sure does seem that way for me particularly since you want to do it by tweaking base values based on armor fit and then assuming people are ed enough not to fit it with two speed modsshieldfitpossibly snakes if theyre not poor and be able to catch even a damn vagabond every timefyi a shield buffer brutix with 6 lows and a bit more fitting so it doesnt need rcu would already be going 1920ms heated with odnano thats more then enough to tackle the ships in the same shipclass really quickly and most nonminmatar hacs for that matterthe reasonable change is changing the penalty on armor rep and possibly resist rigs from speed to something irrelevant boost base values by a significant amount and yes of course you break other stuff sure such a brutix would be marginally useful as some sort of semicapable solo bc and itd be massively useful for the look i brought a turbofast bc sized tackler lolol crowdand of course it can skirmish its called railguns people dont do this because brutix cant exactly fit railguns well much in the same way it requires fitting mods for a rack of neutrons and anything really its not such a novel concept people are doing it with medium artillery already with noned fitting and a extra low itd be actually fairly solid for thisoh and btw there is one thing the brutix and similar ships do need to borrow from minmatar ships and its versatility currently youre in a brutix a frigate lands on top either you have ecm drones or you die a painful death this makes people not want to fly the ship solo so much because drakehurricaneharbingermyrmidon do not have that problem its really simple to fix it too just give the ship 25m3 more dronebay and a utility high it lacks slots compared to eg cyclone already so there is no need to take something away somewhere else
i to would prefer pre qr stats even if i flown nearly the hole nano age a platedtrimarked face  solo bs it is quite funny that i do use mostly nano setups with ranged dps for exactly the same job this daysshrugsdps as a number is as meaningless as blaster pvp this days there is a reason all pro blaster pvp is shown with maximum tank and minimum dps this daysfixing webs for blaster ships is not complicated or leads to game breaking ships it simply fixes the meta game and gives blaster ships back his niche im not saying it is the only thing that is wrong with it but it is the thing that gives you back at least a point in the meta game by not being as handy caped as other ship classes at point blank without slaves a active tank will remain nearly the same time on the field as a buffer fitfor non comedy active tanks in many situations unfortunately this will be true in both ways meaning that it made no real difference going with buffer or activethe problem is that it comes at a huge pricetag of weapon range flexibility with the fittings speedtrimarks slots dps and being more affected by neutswith implants and combat boosters it can be effective but as stand alone on most ships in plain t2 it puts to many drawbacks up in front for something that might make a difference in the endthis
no it would not turret hit quality is entirely determined by the hit chance and the only thing that signature resolution does is provide the baseline for a linear modification of the targets speed to be plugged into the tracking formula based on target signature radius furthermore the tracking formula weights percentage changes in signature resolution the same as percentage changes in tracking if you reduce the signature resolution by 10 its the exact same as increasing the tracking by 10egtracking part of the to hit formula5turret res  speed  range  tracking  ship sig2modify turret res by 1059  turret res  speed  range  tracking  ship sig2some basic algebra multiply by 910  divide by 109 turns that into 5turret res  speed  range  1111  tracking  ship sig2edit also whoever did that hit quality formula on the evewiki has it wrongeve crops at 5 and 149 not at 51 and 15 actual formula ishit chance 992  avg non wrecking hit qualityhit chance  01hit chance 992003  final expected dps for all hit chances  01
ideas for buffing rails1 decrease rail rof by 50 and increase damage to compensate adjust other stats to keep the same gives an 8 ish second rof with 3 dmg mods projectiles still have 2x volley advantage fixes ammo consumptiondps lasers  hybrids  projectilesvolley lasers  hybrids  projectiles2 create 2 lines of ammo with the same damage at each optimal one 41 therm to kin  tracking one 41 kin to therm  cap use3  10 damage mod4 drop hybrid reload to 5 secs  important for m hybrids hybrid ammo doesnt have the falloff flexibility of projectiles picking a couple of them would work
i think this would be pretty easily to implement and at the same time make it alot easier to fly so 1
the idea holds a lot of meritbut in order to be balanced it should be a much lower base system strength so that the maximum strength can be around what we have now its already incredibly hard to take over systems as is
good idea
this would also further encourage active use of systems which was an objective of dominion

hiranawhy wouldnt the person set up one account use the free 30 days then pay for an extra 30 days 15 and then use the buddy system and get 30 free days to get 90 days right there for 15 the 2nd character would use 21 day free trial then pay 15 for 30 days and then use the buddy system for an extra 30 days 81 days for 15 dollars then the last account would use the free 21 days and pay for say 2 month or the three month option so he would get 81 days for 30 then you just transfer the 2 first characters into the third for 20each or 4000 total so all told you would get these three accounts going for 10000 or roughly 3 gtcs  lets say 16 billion isk if they each make 63 millmonth or 200 mill totalmonth you are paid back 8 months this is far superior than buying 3 gtcs because after 8 months you not only get your 16 billion but you keep getting an additional 16 billion every 8 months in exchange for 15 15 dollars for 16 billion isk thats some pretty cheap isk
i support this product andor service
hell yea
good idea
truly a must have
i cant believe that i hadnt noticed and mite suggest a few types of towelsbeach towel  bath towel  stolen hotel towel as examples and maybe even add colors
this forum is not the right placefile a petition and let it escalate to a senior gmor write to internal affairs
lol grins i guess that is one way to keep there complain lvs down if they handle there own tickets lol
this concerns an entire mechanic rather then a specific petition specific cases should be petitioned but when requesting that ccp change their way of handling certain petition classes going trough the csm should be perfectly fine
since theres currently no way to ask let me speak to your supervisor a gm could completely suppress petitions against themselves thats not right and needs to be fixed
i must be entirely mistaken on the purpose of the csm then the petition system does need an overhaul the circumstance of a gm complaint petition getting put into the lap of the same gm youre complaining about is ridiculous and really puts the fact in the spotlightin fact that type of petition should start much higher up in the chain appropriately with much more serious consequences for misuse
it would be nice to see a response from ccp on this it is clearly a conflict of interest if not a misuseabuse the csm maybe the correct avenue for this but surley ccp reads this forum
makes sense even if he was right it is stupid that a petition against him would go to him
you can ask let me speak to a senior gm and if refused or stalled for an extended period you can contact directly internal affairs at ccp a filter give me a gm different from insert name would rapidly degenerate as people would share the name of gm they feel are unsympathetic so that everyone will avoid them and try to get the bleeding hears gm that will easily reimburse ships lift bans and generally rule in favor of the players requestseven worse it will allow people to try to get gm sympathetic to one alliance or a stile of gaming
the question everyone isnt asking but should have thought of at least once is just what did you do and what was the actionthis smells of whinery
still he has a point i know from experience how frustrating it is when all complaints about a person must go through that person if its whinery the higher up would just brush it off for being just that if its not
i recently ran into a petition disappearing from my interfaces and created a petition under rules  policiesgm  isd it was picked up by a senior directly so as far i am concerned the requested means is already available  turns out the petition i petitioned hadnt been deleted but that ccp tools are fubar and failed at associating the emailaccount properly if the senior is the issue then the matter should go to ia which is by mail only i thinkthe only thing i would like to be more accessible is howwhen to contact ia  especially the how
completely false ask for your petition to be escalated to a senior gm theyre obligated to pass it along right away if that doesnt workand ive never heard of it not working when the petitioner made clear what they wanted contact internal affairs this stuff isnt as wellpublicized as it perhaps should be but it does exist
if i were a gm that would give me a strong incentive to be as unsympathetic as possibleps youre banned
bump this anything to enable the bounty hunting system of eve to work would be goodas a side note if the prey hunted kills the hunter all rewards go to the prey just an idea
supportedmegasupportedin fact several csm candidates ran on platforms stating essentially the same thing ccp needs to slow down on the new content and spend more time on stability and qa issues in my own campaign i proposed an 18 month to 2 year expansion cycle instead of the 6month to 1 year cycle currently in use
actually i agree with everything you posted but i still dont support the ideawhat i would like to see is more balanced expansions with new content and fixes to current onesthe entire eve community is at best whiny if there is only new content and no fixes to your personal favorite mechanic you will whine on the forums wuaaah fix roflkets wuaaah fix fw if there is no new content other people will whine on the forums wuaaah no new content wtf ccp i cancel my 10 subscriptions today wuaaah etc etcthe only chance to please everyone will be to simply do both at a smaller scale rather than focusing on just one aspect and be patient ccp are hopefully aware of the issues but as any company they have limited resourcesnow if only they fix those damn railguns
dont forget the other three epic pirate arcs t3 frigates the other t3 subsystems and ai upgrades theres a whole content worth in just finishing stuff that already exists
i would say that before we go hanging ccp for not getting it we should ask them  ccp what percentage of your resources are allocated tofixing the little stuff tweaks and balances annoying but noncritical bugs minor features that the community asks fordoing the promised we will return to x and which things are planned to getting done with this team just nowrefactoring fixing the lagentirely new features such as pi and incarnajust out of curiosity dustnow im not suggesting we get a lot of time spent on this  i think the eve community just needs some ballpark figures so that it can see if it wants to push ccp to put more resources to existing content
00 not much  but still its more than 0i wouldnt say to much considering how poor upcoming expansion is gooing to bemy guess is 20a lot 
ccp cant not introduce something new they have to introduce something new for the sake of marketing at least they did 1 expansion where they didnt introduce anything new and only improved what was already there and it was the least successful expansion to date so modifying the proposal id say to make your expansion a revamp of corpalliance window implementing the treaties system so theres something to use as a marketing tool and dont add anything else new more importantly than doing fixes is to do a whole expansion without screwing over the player base thats what im lacking confidence in
thumbs up
this proposal gets my absolute unequivocal support gabriel is a smart man who had some impressively creative ideas concerning the current disgusting state of gallentean ships and weaponry he broadened his view and realized that what is wrong with gallente is not a single problem but rather a large group of deeply rooted flaws his work to fix them is some of the most polished forum posting ive ever seen kudoson the topic of the afterburner bonus everyone seems to be allergic to we all need to keep in mind that even a ship with maxed out skills will still not move faster than a ship fitted with a microwarpdrive it is simply to give gallente a speed boost while not blowing up their sig radius to the size where they get killed on the way inthe hyperion needs a buff the hyperion needs a buff badly the proposed 10 to armor per level is an excellent way to give it survivability in a pvp situation without messing with its slot layout or grid its currently at 6 lowslots and low gridim a tiny bit doubtful on the optimal range bonus on the roden boats i feel that gallente should try to steer clear of doing the sniper thing gallente have always historically been masters of close range so i propose that instead of an optimal range bonus gallentean sniper boats might want to try a damage boost to rails make railguns a viable weapons systemmy two cents if it helps
idea of gallente needing a buff is fully suported however the devs should at least try to give their vision and suggestion on race balance yeah sure they might be gallente are fine they are also speedtanks and mwds are fine and when crywhine amount on forums broke thresholds they used 5 ton hammer to balance itdrones still have ai issues and dumb moments when they bug updiemost and astarte eos was nerfed too hard yeas ago and no attempts to fix it damps being a bit meh on bonused shipsblastersgridactive armor tank comedy that leads to most recomented tanks for myrmishtar and even hype being shield
so i read the proposal linked in the opthe proposal linked in the op states that the taranis is so underpowered that it needs a significant tracking boost wut an extra drone a massive increase in overheated turret dps oh and a falloff bonus as well so that it can apply this dps all the way across scram range merely outdpsing the other combat inties by 40 as it currently does is just not enough from this i conclude that the author of the proposal linked in the op is either a lunatic or is simply crying for a set of ridiculous solopwnmobilesmore seriously while there are some gallente ships with issues the blanket bonuses proposed will make those that are already very strong on the frigate level this covers the taranis ishkur tristan and incursus ludicrously op moreover some of the proposed changes affect shipclasses that are underpowered more or less across the board eafs command ships tier 1 battlecruisers nonthrashersabre destroyers and interdictors only fixing the gallente hulls while leaving ships like the hyena in their current state would be silly
how about we poke this until next september
so you are fcing in your rapier  and in the middle of the fleet fight you decloakor i slowboat towards a target  5k before i am in point range my cloak drops due to the stupid timer  and he gets awaydid you even think that whole idea through
eos needs to tank not gank bonuses should support that command links add additional defensive effects so any drone type links are out gallente having ew links is nonsense gallente should have the armour links and amarr should be given new links that affect cap usage
drone links are a terrible idea links are for support not dps try this on for sizeand note that a maxskill eos with a mindlink multiplies the face bonus of a gang link by a factor of 13sensor integrity link currently 3 sensor strength change to either 6 sensor strength or 3 to each of sensor strength targeting range and scan resolution recon operation link currently 2 ew optimal range change to 3 to ew optimal and falloff range electronic superiority link currently 2 to painters and ecm 12 to td and sd change to 3 to painters 2 to ecm td and sd eos i dont actually have a clue what to do with this thing but make it stop sucking please hopefully that makes info warf links suck less badly
yeah i guess i should have made it about information links tbh but i am glad i didnt get bombarded with just use the other race links you arent forced to use information links replies xdwhat about we have the followinginitial skill  increases drone hitpointslink 1  increases drone control rangelink 2  increases drone speedlink 3  increases drone tracking  op  falloffin theory this isnt a dps buff its more of a drone buff although i find it weak without a dps increase tbhsaying that information links are wrong in everyway
more drones is good news in my book i vote yay
i have been experimenting with t3 ships first the tengu  which i consider pretty well made then the lokifor some inexplicable reason loki has very small cargo space if you want to build roaming pvp setup similar to vagabond you get 280 m3 cargo in comparison the vagabond gets 360 m3 cargo  which feels much more reasonable the ac loki setup gives bonus to projectile rof so the rate of ammo consumption is very high which means the small cargo hold particularly annoyingbasically id want to see loki cargo hold increased to at least 350 m3 similar to vagabond as far as game balance goes the little extra space is not going to impact power balance in any noticeable way however the reduced cargo space serves as never ending annoyance to the player why needlessly annoy the player let people enjoy slightly more cargo capacity

so yeah i know the people the jumped the nvuda ship see me are still getting the full version of incarna my problem is thisa lot of the physics  gpgpu stuff is done software side if you dont have a cuda enabled card so i am getting the full version of incarna but not the full experience of incarnaby all means correct me if i am wrong google gdc 2010 ccp for referance
with a quick search i found this so posting the idea here for csm consideration apologies if ive missed it somewhere elsenew skills with prerequisites should be able to be queued so long as the required prerequisites remain ahead in the queuethe whole reason for the queue is to avoid the requirement to set an alarm clock to update skills while you can put something in the queue after the prereqs it could be several hours before you can start the skill that you actually want trainingthis would mean that if a skill is removed a check would need to be made to see if there are any skills which require that as a prereq this already done for skill levels  you cant take a skill at lvl 2 out of the queue if lvl 3 is in the queue after it
if i may impose fantisy to your staunch reality a moment what if you chould transport perhaps 4 battleships worth of rigged ships to a large fleet combat zone prefitted and rigged for players in your fleet so in the event they loose their current ship then they warp to the het heavy equpment transport support ship and grab their backup now you have a combat ready pilot in seconds rather than him having to go and totally refit a new ship which can be vary time consuming this can turn a battle in your favor quickly that is the heart of the idea for having something bigger than an orca to hual ships and to top that idea off why not limit this het support ship to just hualing ships that are fitted and rigged and yes perhaps that kind of power is better suited to being locked in lowsec but its one hell of a good idea to think about now isnt it
looking past the wall of text which i can only assume is an attempt to communicate i think ive managed to decipher it into something like english how is what youre proposing going to be more fun than what is currently in the gameall i can see in you post is a few more potential tools that you can use to work towards the same goals that already existmarines to take over ships different ship carrier even jetpacks on planets  if you find all the multitude of activities that eve currently offers boaring i dont see these new activities changing that
we already have het ships theyre called industrial command ships carriers supercarriers and titans
supported this change is the most epic fail of tyrannis yet and tyrannis is a complete fail to begin with but that change tops the cakebring back the ctrlshiftalt keys to shortcuts
achmed i think youre misinterpreting it sounds to me like theyre making it so that you cant have just a naked ctrl key as a shortcut you can still use ctrlr as your reload shortcut though this is one where its so weird and niche that i have to assume theres some kind of technical reason
this im looking at the shortcut keys now and all the old bindings are still there its rather odd they allowed plain old ctrl to be a shortcut to begin with other than to lock something when clicking on the overview
based on proxy warfare this ship will be designed to purely increase damage on a hostile ship and debuff it in such a way or protect a small area from a specific effect  damage based on its raceit will be a t2 version of a bc the ones that do not have a t2 versionit will be able to equip a module only 1 that increases racial damage upon that ship for example the t2 amarrian version will increase all em damage only by 100 in addition to this it will also increase the effect of ew based on race againamarr  neuts will be 10 more effective on the target draining 10 more tracking distruptors will also be 10 effectivecaldari  ecm ecm modules will be 10 effective on the targetgallente  warp jammers will now have a 100 increase to jamming str and sensor dampeners will be 20 more effectiveminmatar  target painters will be 20 more effective and stasis webs will have a 10 increased effectthese cruisers wont be able to stack and due to speciality activating the module will cause the ship to stop moving and wont be able to warp until the cycle is over or until the ship has exploded effective ecm on the proxy cruiser will stop the effect careless of if the cycle is complete or notthe module can only be used in high slot it will also have a different function via a script rather than increasing the damage of one ship it will reduce em assuming its amarr damage by 5 on all ships within a 10km radius penalties will still apply this doesnt stack and you can either have direct damage increase or damage reductionthis will be good when primarying people and also serve as a nice defensive ship the bonus direct damage  damage reduction wont be stackableoh and each cycle consists of 30 secs
sounds cool to me think it should be called wi ladiesknight though as tigerclaw isnt vey innapropriate

youre talking as if democracy in its modern form is something good its pretty fine you can affect the game in the same proportion youre already supporting it via your subs also considering that less than 20 actually voted we can safely state that these elections resemble true democracy of the past in a significantly better way than stupid one man  one vote mass elections only the most worthy and those who actually care are taking part thats a good thingdont be a fool
i can honestly say that i voted with only one account i have two however i had no real idea about the candidates and went purely of what they wrote in that little blurb thingy next to each of the characters pictures in the voting pagehint people that wrote nothing or very little didnt exactly command any respect o0
i voted for you mostly because there was a voice behind the words but i liked your background and ideas too took me one hour to go throught all the listyou were quite down near the end if i remember i hope you got it i would feel like i bet on the right horse
mynxee won my vote by the sound of her voice alone and her thoughts on ui issues  but mostly her voice must be some sansha mind trick going on because now im her willing slavego mynxee go mynxee  geeky cheerleaderesq bop 
the voter numbers are very interesting i have been playing since before the inception of the csm but this is the first csm election i have voted in this was primarily because in the past i have felt like csm discussions focused very heavily on affairs in 00 space and factional warfare  and while i feel that those are important parts of the game theyre not parts of the game that im active in right nowi was nearly one of the abstaining masses this time too but the increased campaigning along with the article in massively actually got me to look at some of the issues the candidates were bringing up based on that i decided that i should vote i will say that it was a difficult choice and that i only voted with one of my three accounts because i didnt feel quite right getting 3x the votes that someone else might get im still just one player thats just a personal thing thoughanyway looking forward to seeing the winners next week and to seeing what the new csm can accomplish this time
id be kind of curious to see where the votes came from such as how many accounts in britain us russia germany etc voted also did they vote mostly for folks from their own nations or was it spread around pretty well i just dig demographic data like that i would also be curious what the fictional demographics were in that how many came from caldari minmatar amarr and gallente it would be kind of funny if the gallente had the worst turnout considering they are the only democratic empire it would also be fun to see what fictional races got the most same race supporttechnically shouldnt tibus heth win in a landslide of caldari voters everytime tibus heth on the csm might be pretty interesting
confirming that all the mega alliances members diddo have nothing else worry about i mean hey we all know the csm seats are most vital to 00 gameplay and outcome of nullsec wars and stuff right who cares about being able to get a decent fight when you can vote instead
its called taking any advantage you can get a hold of please do not try to act as you people have the high ground anyone who keeps any kind of tabs on whats going on knows the score and knows how bad it is right now the influence you could exercise on the game through the csm to trip the odds in your favor makes it far more likely in these times that alliance leadership would move to have its members vote for their candidate i wont believe otherwise till i see names but this spike in the votes and the heavy zero sec outlook in the past and its effects leads me to believe thats exactly what happenedanyone in the war knows the score i dont need to rehash that out here while i hate it to be honest you guys would be foolish not to i suppose but i cant end without saying this when it comes to fights dont talk about a decent fight when molle himself orders one of the craziest logoffskis ever
okay for the sake of the argument then you adressed mega alliances assuming you picked your phrase carefully there that makes all alliances with mega member numbers aka in excess of 1k members viable with regards to your point of block votingtaking over csm or however you do want to call itby current ingame listing there are over 30 of those compared to the number of available csm seats and the posted votes required to get a csm seat  alternate spot that would logically imply that if your assumption were right all or maybe all but one seat on the csm would go to those alliances history of recent csm panels does not really support this but well maybe this time it all changed so if you were correct wed see on the next csm panel almost exclusively members of those mega alliances if your assumption were right that those were trying to take over the csm more so as we cannot be sure that someone external might accidentally vote for one of the candidates from those alliances gods beware as they might raise some valid point in their campaign going by sheer numbers under the assumption you are right and myself wrong about lots of 00 not caring a whit about csm well see come next week a almost full 00 alliancestocked csm rightwould be utterly surprised if that would happen id actually still be surprised if only half the future csm members came by order of alliance size ofc from those entities but maybe ill be proven all wrong and the conspiracy theory is true
just post the resultsits electronic i would think the results themselves are pretty absolute no
i have cast my votes to the same person this year with my 3 accounts still waiting for that 3000 isk aswell but i would consider splitting my votes if each candidate would better for example my industrial char and the other would benefit my pvp char any ignore all that when is season 3 starting dillon  enjoy the rest
multiple accounts getting multiple votes  actually i see this as being fairer if youre willing to pay for 2 or 3 or more accounts then surely you should have 2 or 3 or more times the say over the future of the game
yeah i did but your missing the focus slightly i meant nc and sc in this regard and yeah i am with an nc corp and ill state it again without names i can only speculate but voting was substantially higher than in the previous four elections and there is a huge war raging if you look at the general situation and see the signs you see what appears to be powerblock voting without the winners what ive stated is speculation speculation based on the evidence but still speculation im not backing off my position that it appears the big groups voted in blocks 1k votes per candidate that got in thats a shocking number and yes i think it has changed i think that both sides wish to influence the war and that this would be one heck of a way to do it honestly i hope your right that it isnt packed with zero sec alliances and i still hold out hope my vote was one of the ones that put tamber in but that isnt looking good names will tell the tale and if this spike in voting was eve being more politically aware then i will be one happy guy even if tamber doesnt make it in but given the following the massive voter spike the conflict up north hw and the zero sec heavy agenda of these candidates im forced to believe that something less than perfect was at work here
based on that should a person who pays more tax have more say in how a country is run yeah i know eve isnt like the real world just a comparisonby some quirk of fate for the next month i have 5 accounts do i really deserve 5 times the say in the games developmentoh and thanks for the graph diagoras more please
you guys know more about this then i do but whats the breakdown of who voted by percentage of accounts that actually had a logon during the voting month like i have 3 accounts that autobill to my cc so they would remain active but i might have not been around for the month due to x and didnt even know that would give you a better breakdown of who actually cared to vote or not instead of who voted  didnt vote  mega afk
you would be surprised look up timocracy in a good encyclopedia or prolly even wikipedia the greeks of antiquitiy didnt think too badly about that as opposed to some comments about democracy occasionally made just as a footnote personally i dont think csm elections rank as truly democratic if the majority of players abstains thus prolly some bastardchild of political theory anway
 and in every precinct
i think people are over analyzing this election a bit the increase in votes is easily explained by the growing amount of players combined with the easy access to vote in the startup screen i think more silent majority high sec newcomers like me have used their vote that said some results will surprise the oldskool establishment in eve most likely people who were given a high spot in the voting list and took their time to put in decent campaign letter will be rewarded new people dont know any of the names on that list and wont vote for big headed alliance bobble heads who dont even take time to put in campaign letter as they dont show commitment solid program or willingness to defend rights of the small playersas for big nullsec alliances taking over most are competing i would think  so they will only undermine each other in the council and work counterproductive it made me laugh when some people said it would influence the outcome of major conflicts it wont  the council has the power of suggestion only  their mandate doesnt include decision making  and thats probably the reason why major alliances have never taken a firmer grip over the electioni think the council overall is a good idea and will help greatly with improving the game by suggestion game adjustments to the devs fresh ideas keep game young the trip to iceland is a well deserved reward for those who help the game advance selflessly every day and thats what its all about in the end just my 2 cents
someone who does not understand condone or appreciate the concept of pvp in eve is not representative of the community ankh is not fit to be a csm snip removed insult shadow

not everything is about you lark this thread is about mazz being terrible and the future ceo of hondaor something
my new honda line of vehicles will include monster trucks and be designed to be optimal for things like ramming i will also accept bribes for minor amounts of moneythat means im taking bribes not for the money but for the principle of the matter and probably get voted off the board of directors when my paid political electoral technicianspets are finally removed by a more powerful entityim eating a roast beef sandwich right now and its absoutely delicious i will no longer buy things from oscar mayer or any other abomination factories everything will be from the deli from now on the way god intended itlark i think you should be included in this thread too because even though we are from different heritages different countries and practically speak a different languageok well you have a funny accent at least i think that in the end we are brothers or sisters i guess you get to sit next to me

i dunno how relevant this is but looks like someone uploaded a youtube of what appears to be hilmar discussing the results at an internal ccp meeting which has then been captured on a mobile phonepoor quality video but the audio is clear enoughill leave you to interpret the info yourselves as its a little ambiguous in places

i can understand the issue and support it to an extent when it came to skill ghosting that is technically your character doing the training when it comes to rp generation its the agent thats doing it not your characterlet me ask a question if youre a ceo of a company and you went on vacation for a few weeksmonth accnt inactive for a month or so does your company cease to function during that time no your company and contacts continue to function as they were so why would someone you hired ingame to research stop doing what you paid him to do or persuaded when it comes to skill generation youre on vacation you arent training so it makes senseagain i understand the problem and perhaps if datacores werent so expensive we wouldnt be having this problem believe me my agent is only a lvl 2 and i generate a measly 11hr but cant you also consider this a helpful nudge to come back and play so you dont have to grrrrind missions or mine just a thought

what youve been put through on this has been a complete farce at no time in any setting should the individual who a complaint has been lodged against be responding to that complaint thats what multiple supervisorsgmsetc are for it is simply unethical for this gm to be responding to a complaint about himself
how can anyone in their right mind in any setting think that it is acceptable for that to happen its just wrong to complain to someone that theyre doing something wrong and expect them to fix it clearly this is a case of unethical action taken by a gm
this is not a acceptible display of gm management

all t2 combate frigates except stealth bombers are underpowered right now do to the dramiel it can do both the role of an inti and an af at the same time and be overall more effectiveon a side note gallente needs a buff and hybrids need some love in general
you obviously didnt read closely enoughand like dzajic mentioned it would be nice if a dev or someone from ccp would at least either acknowledge or dismiss the idea that there is a problem with gallente ships the gunboats in particular if a problem is acknowledged people will throw in more thoughts and ideas on how to fix them rather than simply saying no changes are needed stop whiningand if the problem is dismissed and stated that it is working as intended ill shut my mouth and start training for something else
no uthe op wants to remove the taranis tracking bonus 375 at allv and simply increase the tracking of all blasters by 50 that for the slower among us would be a significant tracking boost the op wants to increase all blasters overload damage boost from 15 to 3050 that for the slower among us would be a massive increase in overheated turret dps the op wants every gallente ship to have a bigger drone bay that for the slower among us would give the taranis an extra drone the op having given blasters a bigger tracking buff than the ranis old bonus ever gave then wants the ranis to have a falloff bonus thus giving it a falloff bonus as well so that it can apply this dps all the way across scram rangetell me do you routinely support things you havent bothered to read
ever since the web nerf gallente has had severe trouble with tracking rails suffering especiallynot to mention pwg is borked and hyperion slot layout makes no sense compared to mega switch mega and hyperion midlow slotsedit additionally replace dual rails with dual blasters dual rails are epic failage
there needs to be more perks to the owners of a system if they have sovereignty to make covering the cost worth it i propose the following perks if you have sovereignty when you jumplog into a system you have sovereignty there should be a delayed effect before you appear in local say like 2030 seconds if your alliance has sovereignty then your cyno does not appear on the overview for people to just rage warp to it and kill whatever is jumping in you should have an increased on board scanner range if your in a system you have sovereignty in if you are not blue with the alliance that holds the sovereignty then you decloak within 10 seconds after jumping into their systemthese are just a few of the perks and i will update the op when more comes to mind bottom line is there needs to be more benefits for paying for these systems especially the crappy systems that are not that good for belts plexes and such

it wont work you didnt type it in bolded caps
the perks are just fine the problem isnt sov costing too much or the upgrades from the ihub its the fact that you obviously dont have pilots flying there doing anything so theres no need to have that space to begin with if you guys use only 5 systems and cant manage to support another 510 why do you have them in the first place other alliances just drop them now since theyre pointless and then get all protective when an upcoming smaller alliance decides to pick them up since they want to use them if youre not going to use them stop trying to hoard space and then complaining about the costs

how about thisuse an alt to create a shell alliance for your peaceful corp of minersuse an alt to create another shell alliance but leave it empty for now except for alt anchorsget wardeccedswitch your corporation to the other alliancerepeat as necessary it is best to have many alt corps and alliances to keep hopping to avoid wardecs and force the griefers to waste extra money for nothing they will get the message and go awayyou can keep your budies on the address book and talk to them on a private restricted channel and work just like a corp while you keep hopping corps when your group has grown strong enough you can all coalesce into an alliance of small corps and permanently stay there if you believe to be strong enough to fight back and if you can really fight back griefers go away because all they want is easy killshighsec wardeccing is just a big griefing toll that more experienced players use to grief noobs there is no chance of a fair fight and neutral logistics just tops it all off as a borked game mechanic

more like this one
personally i prefer her idea shame its older than 90 days i dont see what the big worry is about giving drones extra dpsgallente would benefit the most ofc with blasters and rails being crap atm having a drone buff doesnt exactly change thingsoh and the other links can be used offensively ever had a damanation in a fleet with a guardian op much same with vultureclaymore well that should be classed as defensive have that in any medium sized roaming fleet and you get sick skills increasing range of jammers  webs not offensivei personally think increasing drone damage is fine alot of ships wouldnt benefit and the ones that do are pretty much gallente anyway
i think the info warfare links should be a bit more useful for everyone in fleet as all the others are i was thinking about whats missing and maybe ccp should replace the sensor strength bonus for a scan res  targeting range bonus boosting the whole fleets sensor strength on the off chance that someone will get jammeddamped is pretty pointless the other two are pretty useful as most people in small gangs have pointswebs fittededit i think introducing droneweapon links is a bad idea there are too many people that just dont bother with drones in a small fast gang and weapon links will only help a fraction of the fleet the links would essentially be a waste as only a percentage of the fleet would benefit from them better to have links that will benefit the whole fleet the whole time
you do know that link doesnt affect websjammers yeh p thats minmatar the gallente one affects ecm and stuff like thatskirmish  interdiction  increases range of webs  points which in a way is offensive considering almost everything has a jammer equiptright now what we need to look at is the usefulness compared to other commands and if its a choice between eos and any other command eos will never get pickedspeed armor and shield are covered while theres many options for information warfare links drone buffing makes sense
tell me if im wrong but ccp did try somethink a few years ago as some ppl have the skills books already and they couldnt get it to work then y would it work now i dont disagree just trying to rember facts lol again tell me if im wrong
if they can fix something so needlessly pointless im pretty sure they can fix the legion in entirety
cargo capacity on combat ships is balanced around cap booster charges not around ammo i sort of assume that this was intentional
perhaps but the amount of pure frustration caused by this seems to outweigh any minor game balance effect this may havehave you tried flying ac lokihow many combat ships you flown with 280 m3 or less cargoi bring this up because i tried it and it sucks
actually i do fly an ac loki and between the ammo the nanite repair paste and the sisters probes in the hold im using less than half of my available cargo spacethe only time i could see this really being an issue is if you were going out on hours long roams without stopping to resupply
which is usually my style being in a noob corp i have no blues everybody is an enemybut even if its no big deal for some people surely you wouldnt think that adding 70 m3 would make this ship overpowered which is also my point the difference in game balance is too small compared to better overall enjoyment of flying the ship
yes
cant see why not
my loki setup has even 200m3 now thats really pathetic considering its sole purpose is to support my real combat ships holding some extra ammo boosters and lootfix this
yeah i can understand the nature of the complaint and i dont really see an issue with it  ill support it as a nice to have
fix the legion then other ships then your weight issues
if my math is correct you should be able to fit 22400 rounds of medium projectile ammunition in a 280 m3 cargo bay thats not a small amount by any standards if you find yourself unable to carry enough ammo maybe get a fleet member or two to carry some for you considering the other issues in game id say this is way down on the list
you think that one only carries ammo and nothing more but you also need nanite repair pastea bit spare room for loot220mm ac have 17s rof on a loki with just 2 gyros 16s with 3 2s with 425mm ac so the potentiel 22400 rounds wouldnt last very long
supportin disto those talking about 22k rounds being held you packrf emprf fusionbarragethats sub 8k of each not counting nanite paste 8k of barrage wont last long when your trying to kill someone while fighting in falloff let alone multiple peopleall that being said add it to my list of ship fixesfix nighthawk gridfix eagle gridfix legion everything proteus with lazors does more dmgfix retribution midslotsfix eos bandwidth to 100mfix huginn to a 55 gunmissile layoutfixrebalance angel ships
you should also keep in mind that when roaming sometimes you get to kill something and it would be nice to be able to scoop some loot at least the valuable stuff about 34 kills after you have no cargo left for anything
no

already been asked for already been refused stupidly in my opinion but i dont see ccp changing their minds
i voted a significant 10 number of times across three candidates tbhvuk got a single vote from me after the mass nc alliance mail went out saying ak vote vuk lz vote elven or whatever their names werevast majority of my votes went to a dude from it alliance and a dude from an empire corpthe fact that lemmings will listen to people who tell them how to vote is hilarious tbh i think in the csm if this sort of crap is uncovered on forums or in alliance mails it should automatically dq the candidate but thats another can of worms entirely its totally not enforceable and so open to exploitation its crazyheres the mail that went around the nc
over 300 thousand people abstained
so only 12 of player base voted thats pretty low and in my opinion only indicates how little csm has managed to impact this game so farstability of game system is worse then ever in my playing courier of this gamenew features are halfdone and abandoned pretty soon after releaseso exactly why do we even need csm when it has no effect other then handfull of people gets free trip to iceland bringing things into csm meeteings is one thing results is anotherif i would get my way i would push bugfix release and delay new content untill new content is feature ready to release no half baked  like were getting now pi lacks that little thing called nuke from orbit they showed us year ago in fanfest how come its missing becouse ccp dosent care and csm dosent care
the number of subscribed accounts does not equate to an equal number of people abstaining suggests a deliberate action i bet a lot of people didnt vote their accounts not because they deliberately chose not to vote but due to lack of csm awareness i based this on the fact that numerous times while campaigning i heard even from several folks whove been playing awhile questions such as whats the csm oh has voting started for that where do i find out who to vote for there are plenty of people who just log in play the game and simply fail to tune in to anything external to the game 12 of eligible accounts not playersand its almost twice the amount as voted for csm4 a very big increase hopefully thats a reflection that the various efforts to inform and motivate people re the csm are workingdont forget that ccp is giving the csm stakeholder status as of csm5 it remains to be seen how that will play out to players benefit but it will entitle the csm to more of a voice than ever before its up to the csm to use that voice effectively while recognizing that the ability to influence change in eve is subject to practical constraints imposed by ccp those constraints include resource availability bottom line considerations software development timelines in general ccps current vision for the various elements of eve and obstacles that may arise due to ccps corporate culture it is vital that the csm recognize those constraints andwhere possiblesuggest creative ways around themfrom the outside looking in it may seem as if the csm accomplishes very little however dont forgetas teadaze has often commented in csm4s meeting minutesthat a lot of the discussion that takes place between the csm and ccp cannot be shared with players due to nda restrictions so just because you dont hear about certain things being discussed or addressed it doesnt mean they arent on the radar
or maybe they simply and reasonably have no interest in the csm they just want to play the game for a few hours after work relax and have fun its a hobby they have no interest in external anything because thats not what they play eve for
of course i know quite a few players like that i used to be one someday though something in the game or their outlook may change enough to make them take an interest in the csm and its work or who knowsmaybe something the csm itself does will get their attention and motivate more interest
i only voted and campaigned for catits important we have a voice of reason on the csm
300 thousand people dont know they are buying a free holiday for some fevered egos
they dont know that they are paying for the regular passing out due to alcohol overdose of an entire multimedia company either  so whats the difference there are many options for ccp to improve on their game most of which are an order of magnitude more expensive than 9 airline tickets and a few hotel nights and if you still think that the csm is a prstunt or ineffective at accomplishing anything you have but to thank your own voluntary ignorance
is this an admission that you voted for yourselfcharming
calling on your proofplease supply that which you have chosen to accept as proof since you cannot provide any actual real proof
of course i did why wouldnt i although i gave serious consideration to giving teadaze one of my two votes because i feel so strongly that he deserves to be on csm5
what makes you believe that you have more ingame knowledge than ankh care to elbaorate that or are you just out to insult and call someone names without backing up your claims
just to remind you all that the election is over and that you can all calm down now
while the rage can calm down many of the things shes said and done here can and should be used against her if she makes it on
so tell me if you get elected is there any chance you can actually work with hercause if you cant it might be smart to step aside for someone who can csm members at each others throat do not make for a very effective csm
 me sideways i just saw this thread can i have an extension for being ed off
im not sure it would be good for eve if there was anyone in the csm willing to make extensive compromises to some of the things shes posted i dont know what all her important issues are but some of the stuff she has campaigned with is utterly ridiculous the promise of banning all griefers for example and that i certainly will not be able to work with
well csm members disagree on stuff all the time and that should not be a problem if ppl just behave in a civil manner read not like in this thread 
precisely and the most civil manner for everyone would be to just vote against her every single time she proposes something outrageous but for her sake i will have to doubt that she will behave the same once in as she did here
ankhsince i do read that you want to focus on fixing game balances and have a neutral standing to all individuals what do you propose on the development of lowsec for the people who permanently live there as alot of the ingame money making is divided between highsec trading etc en 00sec mining r  d and plexingratting what would you propose in order to boost the moneymaking in lowsec systems there are quite alot of people who permanently stay in lowsec as combat pilots pvpers mercenaries etc we need to have a steady income to fund our ships we lose on regular basis and have to depend on eg industrial highsec alts which in my opinion we should not have to depend on indy altsif you campaign to work on fixing game balance what would you do to give lowsec pilots some more loveanyways gl with your campaign  feel free to drop by us anytime we haz free cookies 100 carebear friendly ofc yarrr eh care 
what makes me qualified to say ankh is a nitwit and doesnt understand evelet me count the reasonsnumber 1 i dont pretend like im unbiased or fair nobody is if you claim you are youre deluding yourselfnumber 2 ive enjoyed every aspect of this game except for flying a supercaptitan and producing drugsnumber 3 ive played for a good whilenumber 4 i understand that eve boils down to killing and making serious internet spaceships and that the freedom granted to players makes this game the best mmorpg out there nobody else has even come up with a coherent pvp system and ankh here wants to nerfhellokittyize itnumber 5 i dont call my opponents qualifications into question without providing reasonsthere are more reasons of course im just not going to bother listing themi will say this however if ankh wins a csm seat i and most likely many others will suicide gank her over and over and over until she realizes that this game is about nonconsensual pvp and that if she doesnt like it she should leave not run for csm
btw i hope u r successful

elaboratein null we can tackle a supercap with 4 methods granted deployable bubbles really only work in specific circumstances in lowsec we have one the focused hic this leaves supercarriers more powerful in lowsec than in nullsec this is before even considering the likely hood of a counterdrop for example dropping a lone supercarrier in nullsec typically gets the attention of locals who actually have the means to take the ship out lowsec alliances and corps rarely have the means to deal with this i do not see this as a particular problem however i do see the limitations in tackling methods as an issue as it is considerably harder to keep one pinned while the tackler batphones allies for backup im not experienced with doomsday mechanics enough to have a legitimate position on their allowance in lowsec however my position on supercarriers is that something balancewise should be addressed to reduce the effectiveness of supercarriers while in lowsec perhaps not allowing fighterbombers to be launched would be the solutionas to there being more supercarrier losses in lowsec i feel that this is mostly from the increased usage of solo to few supercarriers in lowsec as to nullsec much easier to hotdrop in lowsec without having to worry about the danger from standard dictor bubbles leads to y pilots leads to dead supercarriersalso i know youre intimately experienced with being on the hotdropping end of lowsec supercaps do you feel that your stance on this issue comes from solid reasoning on game balance or from a personal interest in things staying as they are
this part is a little misleading there are 4 methods i suppose but one involves anchorable bubbles and two involve a hic realistically the only difference is that one cannot use standard dictors in lowsec and you cant  cage a pos though i wouldnt really consider that tackling in the same sense so yes it is slightly harder to tackle supers in low sec as i know far too well having missed tackle on a leviathan and a wyvern i swear they all had nomads and istabs because i cant drop a bubble but at the same time lowsec has no jump bridge network no cyno beacon networks and no cyno jammers i bolded that last part because its kind of a big deal i think this is slightly fallacious reasoning i would not for example drop a nyx randomly in delve to shoot some dude is it because im afraid that someone in a dictor will be around and drop a bubble on me not really its the same reason i didnt fly to hw last week in a drake  i would have been far from support and it would have been pretty stupid of me to fly 40 jumps when i could have just gone 5 not because i was afraid of a dictor catching me until hw and before pl laid waste to some careless supers there were more supercarrier deaths in lowsec than in 00 since the change even taking those into consideration i think its about even  which is pretty telling ok but for the sake of continuity dreads shouldnt be able to siege and carriers shouldnt be able to triage everything you said about supers can be said about dreadscarriers in lowsec a sieged dread can only be tackled by a hic why should they get special treatment so youre arguing both that supers are more insulated from risk in lowsec but also that its a false sense of security a fair question i do enjoy me some hotdropping but truth be told every time ive cynod into a system ive had a significant support presence close by so while the perception may be that im exceedingly cavalier about dropping supers on anything that moves its pretty far from reality some of my proposals would adversely affect my gameplay but i feel that the changes must be made ultimately because theyre imbalanced i honestly and truthfully dont think that supers fall into this category
i find the jump bridge network to be a fickle issue lets say we have a similar situation in low and null whoever the sc pilot lets say they are in neutral to hostile space meaning they drop outside of their own territory and do not have a jbgen network behind them to bring in support in lowsec its a neutral deal nobody has jbsystem genss in nullsec theres a chance that wherever youre dropping has either a hostile bridge or a hostile generator there are less options to move people to assist in lowsec than there are in null by that im feeling that the sc is again somewhat more powerful in lowsec than nullsec i dont see cyno jammers as relevant to the discussion imo if you managed to get the sc into a hostilejammed system and get it engaged welp if you could elaborate here thatd be greathonestly im seeing the sc losses in lowsec as a result of the false sense of security mentioned below and thus the more common hotdrops its true theyre not invincible and i think many of those losses come from people who got caught with their pants down by a prepared and ready enemynot particularly sieged dreads and triaged carriers cant warp out or jump out until their cycle ends untrue of a standard sc maybe instead of losing the fighter bomber deployment scs lose the ewar immunity i dont know im not a game balance expert just throwing ideas around as i see a mild imbalance i agree its not particularly hard to kill a sc if youre prepared and ready to counterdrop regardless of sec status im saying that its much less likely for them to get tackled per hotdrop lets see if that makes any sense in lowsec than in nullsec i think a part of this stems from the separate issue of heavy dictors being relatively useless in lowsec pvp aside from rsbd hics on gates and catching supercaps i never ever see a roaming gang in lowsec with a hic in tow dictorhic in nullsec is considerably more common just sayini agree i havent seen you habit guys doing that stuff personally all of my experience is pl and ch dropping and typically its with 5 though i know viper wanted to on our little carrier gang back in kor azor well good its refreshing to have differing viewpoints without anyone getting nasty

actually i dont think anyone truly knows how its all calculated so saying i am wrong and the wiki is wrong and you are right for a calculation that done by a server is idiotic because you dont know that either in fact your calculation makes little sense because it crosses check sums for no logical reasonthe wiki calculation makes sense because the check sums determine1if your turrets can track the target2once its determined wether you can even track the target a hit quality is generated based on sig radius vs sig resolution3applies rangeoptimal falloff to damage outputchancetohit  05  transversal speedrange to target  turret trackingturret signature resolution  target signature radius2  max0 range to target  turret optimal rangeturret falloff2you calculation simply adds turret resolution when there isnt anything to support that resolution is part of the initial tracking check sum at all if this were the case then a frigate shooting at a nanod bs would likely still hit but that doesnt happen in fact your formula would result in small guns have a massive damage boost against larger ships due to really high hit quality as for the rest i dont know since you didnt actually post a formulayour formula checks stuff for no reason why would the tracking check include signature radius and resolution at all it doesntshouldnt make your guns move faster or slower so adding that to the formula is pointless and actually counter productive as it can be gamed and makes balance extremely difficult you track or you dont track first that number determines the rest of the formula and for good reason in fact the whole concept that its considered is kinda ridiculous from a logical standpoint alonefeel free to post a link to the dev that spilled your formula though though knowing ccp something so stupid as to include signature into tracking wouldnt be a shock at all
megas hypes and rokhs are all tight fits cpugridwise allowing them to ditch a sensor booster netting 1 mw and 10 tf is not going to allow a ship to add any terribly exciting modules similarly neither the decreased need of a tracking computer gives 1 mw and 35 tf or a tracking enhancer 1 mw and 15 tf might not even free up enough for an additional t2 armor hardener these freed slots will likely be filled with the same modules these are not earth shattering changes they simply give railguns a niche across the boardpossible i seem to recall one of big nerfs to drones was messing with weapons signature resolution thus preventing mediumheavy drones from ripping apart smaller ships however the bulk of the targets sniper ships are shooting are as large as or larger than the sniper ship this is usually the very reason they are at sniper range
the formula was derived from exhaustive testing by a great many people ive personally tested its predictive powers and they averaged correctly every time id say that it may not be exactly how its calculated but its accurate within 1 or so and really all of your other concerns are easily optimized awayliang
which formula the wiki one i posted or the tracking formula guam posted i think the wiki one is pretty accurate myself which is why i was saying a sig res boost would bring up the dps of hybrids within a nitch that makes them good as a sniper role or at bombarding slow moving or stationary targets but still suck at trackingwhile true it would still make rails more likely to have higher quality shots than other weapons another side effect is they would be slightly better at fighting smaller ships
in your post you only referenced half of the dps formula  the chance to hit the quality of those hits is determined solely by the percent chance to hit at 50 chance to hit you will deal iirc 39505 of your eft dps at 100 chance to hit you will deal 103 of your eft dps due to wrecking shotsit would do this by virtue of making them have much higher tracking than anyone elseliang
yes but tracking and accuracy are indeed separate the change might affect chance to hit a little but tracking would still be a primary player and you could tune it downwards a little to keep chance to hit the same imagine it like alpha on arty except hybrid users want to slow things down or stop them to bring their accuracy to full effector just get a hell of a long ways away hybrids would suffer from a sharper hit quality curve than other weapons this way it would give them a definite flavor and tactical role that is fitting imho since the close up support for both gallante and caldari is done via missilesdrones
so youre suggesting to fight industrialratting blobs with pvp blobs and you want to reduce blobing war of attrition sounds good and all but youre still fighting with numbers and frankly they industrialists dont have those numbers to compete and the war is already won youre better off putting a limit on the amount of people allowed in an alliance to limit their logistics for blob fleets imagine if alliances were only allowed say 15002000 members that means you wouldnt have something like sc trying to conquer the north and the north by responding with a localized peace coalition against the common enemy theres no point in having the nc if the sc is gone because you wouldnt need ridiculously sized fleets and then everyone would be in their own corner
i believe you are completely misunderstanding the entire opwhat he is saying is that theyhewhoever wants it so that an entity of 2000 members need to employ miners ratters production crews to ensure that their system is hard to take what this means is that a group of 10 pilots can interrupt the miningrattingindustry and make the system vulnerable for attack meaning much easier to take a week or three down the road as the index system works now every hour there is no rattingmining the index decays after three days or so you lose an entire level give enough time regardless of how much effort a big alliance puts up trying to defend mining ops the defence will eventually weaken if attacked by good enough pilots this means the attackers gank a ship or two and leaves without any losseswhat the proposal does is it promotes guerrilla warfare on a new level a big entity that wants to invade another big entity nc vs sc ie can hire smaller groups to do the dirty work for them so when they are ready to take over a system they can then roll in and take it in say one day instead of a week assuming if you drop the index levels you dont get rf timers on ihubs stations scu and suchyoull never get rid of the blobs as thats simple as my dad will beat your dad and you never bring a knife etc but it promotes smaller groups or small groups within bigger groups that are specialized to use proper guerrilla tacticsit has nothing to do with replacing one blob mechanism with another
my point was that they have an incentive to spam the system with industry or roams to control the system as far as i can tell if industry affects the ability to take a system then just spam a ton of industry there to screw up the index that way itll be harder for someone to just roll in there and take it as you suggest or in the other way an attacker would simply spam roams to keep industry out to lower the index im just not sure this would work but im not a game designer so who knows
ok you are indeed misunderstanding itsee the difference between what youre describing and what is suggested is basicly now and if you can already just spam the system with huge blobs or massive roams all day every day what is suggested is as i said 10 pilots can do the work of hundreds

no matter what the problem was the player has the right to petition it even if it is whinery and that petition should be fair and balanced this is a massive failure of the gm system one that csm and ccp should prioritize we cant fix broken game mechanics if the gm system breaks down before
as one of karnovs corpies i do know the inside story on this without getting into specifics andor pointing fingers basically a gm has used his powers to effectively stop this char from being used anymore the retribution this gm has imposed on the char is far beyond the actual dmg inflicted by the char especially considering there is no specific rule saying what was done cant be done read the damn eula and rules before imposing such drastic measures on a char that has been playin far longer than the gm has probably been employed at ccp i challene any gm to show me the specific rulerules that were broken in this case prove me wrongnuff said
petition against a certain gm being delivered to the same gm is not right at all
regardless of whether or not the op deserved the action against his character and regardless of whether or not petitioners can escalate a petition a gm shouldnt be able to handle a petition against himselfherself that isnt ethicalthe op should change the wording of their post to include a proposal to not allow a gm to handle petitions filed against them
done
a gm dealing with a complaint about himself totally unethical lets ask  if he though he was wrong to kill all those jews and get him to deal with the complaint shall we

qft but still supporting
there are only a limited number of people you can throw at a problem before they start getting in eachothers way ive no interest in supporting a proposition will either result in a too many cooks situation or leave the development teams many of whom have been working separately from core development on expansions for multiple years now such as incarna sitting on their thumbsccp run fixes as they can and while they might not prioritise them quite as much as possible they do so while focussing on the dream eve represents and while avoiding the issues come with too much focus plus as someone else said its impossible to fix everything in one go  and in my opinion ever this is an mmorpg the most unstable bugliable genre of videogame in existence no mmo will ever be completely fixed unless its become completely stagnantnot everyone at ccp is trained to do code repairs and an expansion dedicated to optimisation without any extra elements to work on which is basically what youre asking for because all the expansions thus far have had new stuff and optimisations  fixes tyrannis especially so and the last one was an attempt at a total rework to fix older issues would just produce a mass of redundant artists and developersquit whining sometimes i think ccp ought just claim to have most of their devs focussed on optimisation with a few working on completing longterm projects  then go on as normal and watch as everyone whining about changing and adding stuff thinks theyve got their way and shuts up then fails to realise otherwise when the new expansion comes out playing up the fixes and playing down the additionsyes there are issues to be fixed but seriously all these posts demanding a complete focus on fixing issues with no further development are just my stuff isnt fixed yet and im going to ignore all the evidence there are efforts to improve whats already there so im going to yell about it until they stop doing other things too thus making myself feel betterccp and csm please ignore this topic and keep on very much as you are
this is by no means a proposal to stop developing new content but a proposal to actually revisit old content and make it complete nobody wants ccp to stop going further quite the contrary but what do ever new stepping stones help you if the road you built crumbles behind you so stop whining about something that has not been said nor is intended
when you revamp current problems marketing can push the changesbuff lowsec with some ideas presented in the outlaw csm thread its new contentupdate the 50 of useless afs and advertise lowsec piracy and epic speed arcsuse hacking and to give clues to hidden abc belts even some very rare ones in hisec but more common in lowsec or maybe unlock a bpc who knowsbuff black ops and highlight covert operatons give them a means to subvert the enemy behind lines maybe even adjustshorten rf timers on stations i dunno lots to play with herethe point is improving current halffinished content can easily be shown as new content hell every foot product comes with a new and improved version or a new car model of the same type

honestly would be nice to have a short update on the status of each if not actually have these fixes rolled out a dev blog with top proposals in assembly hall and what has come of them would be fantasticedit supporting fixing them as well obviously
to be honest after going over the old expansion feature list on the right you almost need to start over and list every featuer and check off the ones not realy implimented
i had a long and insightful post explaining how ccp has plenty of resources to fix problems it also explained how the problems affect the vast majority of usersbut no the stupid and unecessary forum security features ate it so im just going to say youre completely wrong
technically dominion introduced nothing new for its big feature sov revision only a revised way of doing something already in place its all in how you market it
in fact looking at dominion the only new things were1 4 navy battleships2 citadel cruise launcherssov was reworked and the rest was random stuff fbs didnt make it until 11however no changes were made except to sov
this thread has become more about fixing pet peeves than unfinished content as such i want to make sure that everyone understands that your pet peeves arent all that important in the grand scheme of things also the comments like oh yeah just fix these 50 things i dont see why thats hard but each one of them probably has time estimates in the upper hundreds of man hours and they may not parallelize well blahthe forum atmosphere is getting pretty toxic imo i think the primary cause of this is because the players feel like ccp is throwing unfinished content at us  and in that light i think the best thing they could do is delay the tyrannis and incarna expansions by 6 months eachliang
oh sorry forgot about all those parts its been awhile since this thread got bumpedbut yes i do read the proposals even the obviously bad ones the way i see it there is always room for compromise on certain issues and no matter how terrible a proposal is there is usually an idea or something that can be salvaged from itlikewise not all of the elements in a good proposal will be good and so they need to be cherrypicked and examinedin the case of this proposal here i do a 5050 changing all the gallente ships as proposed and boosting blasters wouldnt be good for racial ship balance however if was eitheror either boost gallente ships or boost blasters i would support itthere is also ccp to consider as well not every proposal that the csm brings before ccp will go through and those that do are almost never applied in their original format least this is just my reasoning i could always be wrong
support the part about impeaching jacques roden the word missile should not be part of any federation shipbuilders vocabularyedit ccp got it right with the new comet
i was turned off from pi on sisi right away the second i realized ccp thinks more clicks  more fun well its not fun pi is lame and so are click sinks supported
terrible ui is terrible

my mouse will thank you
this would get lumped into a ui upgradeupdate i am sure they are working on it although the reports about pi are a it disconcertingme misses track and field
except without a doubt the place i click most is on the jump and warp buttons which has nothing to do with ui
doubt this is going anywhere but the ccp blackhole clicks is only a subset of a much larger ui issue and tbh id rather ccp looks at it holistically as whole over fixingpatching parts that may need to get redone at a later date there are many many many many x42 things that needs to be relooked at from si ship navigation overview probing market contracts wallets hangar and etc one of my pet peeve is the way gun ammo selection works its a nightmare the gun grouping was sort of a halfbaked solution that only partially addresses it halfway by working around the gun numbers the core is still badanyway thumbs up
invention need some sort of batch job processing where a batch job only takes up 1 slot also the invention interface needs to remember preferencespi seems to be a very bad click sink streamlining needs to be looked at to reduce this industry interface in general needs to remember my preferences for things
it is not hording space it is our protective border and should be useful the closer you let the enemy get the more dangerous it becomes for us and our friendsmy proposal would give a reason for blues to be there and thus beef up our border protection killing two birds with one stoneattackers have too many advantages as it is and these perks would bring better balance to invaders vs defenders
yes you are hoarding space and if you really want a blue to your alliance to come next to you then do it have them come up and provide space between you and your enemies and they can pay for their sov and ihub the only thing youre obviously using those systems for is just space between alliances put other people friendly to you that support those systems themselves and you get a better wall than just spacestop crying
emo tj how old are you really i mean seriouslyall i hear is crying from you your looking very good by pretending to be a crying baby who didnt got your candy from yo mammas
stop feeding the troll
cool story bro
do i still get reporting if my addition of a badger counter has a support thumb
i just keep reporting every single post he makes as trollingshoutingoffensivei suggest you do the same
emo tj is a well known troll so im assuming this is another troll post as most every seems to be assuming however i agree there should be some additional perks to sov i disagree with the ones the op suggested
reading this thread can cause imminent rage and a pulse of over9000 i was wrong dont waste your time reading thistldr scroll to the bottom of the 2nd postnote english is not my native language but i try my very best hiid like to be able to switch to exp andor kinetic damage with lasers being not able to do so is a huge disadvantage compared to other races for different reasonsfrom the pve perspective tldr belowi currently have 17m sp and fly amarr ships from running missions with my abaddon if i include my implants its like all skills 5 in eft damagewise without implants i know its a total pain to fight everything else than blood raiders drones and sanshas if i get lucky and they dont tracking disrupt like mad x especially fighting angels is a pain in the time i kill 1 angel bs i can kill 34 or more sansha bs and due to my low resists against expkin this single angel bs dishes out as much damage as the sansha bs all together i also have to switch out 2 heatsinks for 2 additional hardeners when fighting angels resulting in even less damage output guristas and serpentis have thermal as second lowest resists lasers do have thermal damage you may say but actually only on short range crystals without max skills multifrequency l range on nonapoc amarr bs is 17km13 with mega pulse ii and 3325km with ridiculous cap and pg using tachyon beam laser ii guristas and some serpentis bs tend to orbit at 51 km on top of that they still shoot into an amarr resistance hole with kinetic damagethe problem with that is i want to go to 00 doing mainly pvp but also rattingplexing to have some variation to do pve effectively i have to go for blood raider or drone space maybe sansha but tracking disruptors are still a problem and no even 2 tracking computers wont help against 6 tracking disrupting cruisers like in sansha blockade lvl4 or sansha plexes   so due to my laser damage types ive limited places to go from corporation recruitement caod and dotlan evemaps i know that the tiny blood raider space compared to guristas for example is owned by a huge alliance with closed or veryhighsppilots only recruitement and the sansha and drone regions are either ruled by russianspeaking andor carebearalliances andor alliances with high sp requirements tldr pve perspectiveevery other race can switch damage types to effectively ratplex all across eve amarr cant and amarr gunboat pilots are therefore handicapped when running missions and limited in regions when searching for a 00 corpalliance
from the pvp perspective tldr belowbasically all amarr t1 ships are armor tankersgallente can switch to all damage types due to drones and deal balanced amounts of kintherm weapon damage at long and close range kinetic is the second lowest resist on all armortanking t1 ships directly followed by thermal vice versa for shield tankerscaldari can switch to all damage types using missiles kinetic is mainly used missiles dont need cap as mentioned above kinetic is shooting into an armortanker resistance hole using same guns as gallenteminmatar can switch to all damage types including expkin ammo being the absolute worst for armor tankers guns need no capacitoramarr dealing mainly em and a really tiny amount of thermal damage at long range at close range amarr deal a balanced amount of emtherm damage em is good against shield tankers but due to the fact that most shield tankers dont need cap for their weapons they can permarun active hardeners andor active repair modules and they also have a passive recharge against armor tankers the em damage is more or less completely useless because its the highest resist thermal damage where a fair amount is only dealt when using low range crystals is the second lowest resist for shield tankers but for armor tankers the 2nd highesttldr pvp perspectiveif you try to shoot an armor tanker with lasers its like biting on granite even shield tankers can be really tough due to noncap needing weapon systems and active hardeners and repairers drake for example lol things are getting even worse on t2 ships where some ships have example jaguar a emthermal base resistance of shield 7560 and armor 90675 in addition to their high speed which makes them even difficult to hit vagabond eg lasers have the lowest tracking of all guns except artillery everyone piloting something else than a laser boat could say doesnt matter i switch to exp or kin and smoke him amarr canttldr conclusionamarr lasers can switch crystals instantly allowing them to mostly shoot in optimal range and they dont have to reload what is this good for if you dont deal any damage because you often have to shoot into the opponents highest resistslasers have the worst tracking of all guns except artillery lasers need a huge amount of cap where most other weapon systems dont need any cap or far less significantly limiting the versatility of amarr ships compared to othersamarr can ratplex effectively in blood raider and drone regions maybe in sansharegions too if tracking disruption isnt too heavy due to that amarr pilots who want to do pve have limited options on finding a suitable 00 corpalliancethe last one currently is personally my biggest problem please tell me if i missed something or got something wrong to be able to go to 00 where i want to do some pve too to have a variation to pvp ive to either train for another races bs including t2 weapons which would take months or learn russian which would take years maybe ccp should add a note on character creation that says if you dont speak russian you currently wont have much fun when trying to find a 00 corp living in a region where you can pve in a laserboat yours disappointed disturbed lucy
sarcasm minmatar weapons do so little em damage its almost worthless to fight them the emp rounds do explosive which theyre highly resistant to and proton damage which does em and therm have a horrible damagesarcasmhonestly the amarr were whining for a long time about the damage output of their guns the devs boosted the abilities of amarr weapons not once but twice now pulse lasers do some really disgustingly powerful damage even with high resistsamarr have many advantages to compensate for their lasers damagespecific weaknesses increased cap size no ammunition needed etc also many amarr ships can use missiles andor dronesseems pretty balanced to me my minmatar character can take out angels well but has trouble with sanshablood each race has its balancing factornot supported
im sorry but the op screams and drips of epic failnessnoobnessjust look at the number of armarrian gank ships out therewhat they lack for in damage types they make up for in sheer dpsplease do your homework and stop whiningif you want to complain about something tell ccp to fix the tech2faction crystal glitch in grouped weapons reload lets start there first  o pi swear half these guys embarrass us amarrian pilots
wohoo instead of some constructive comments you guys throw rocks at me nice one 1 every race has its gank ships 2 wow that made sense srsly did you ever do pvp try to fight an armortanked cane or a drake with a harbinger good luck and dont forget to insure it3 you are not the op in this thread amarr actually need cap for their guns lots of it so increased cap is more a balancing factor than an advantage it has a reason why people fit no cap using autocannons on all amarr ships that dont give a laser damage boost eg punisher prophecy arbitrator
i actually thought their replies were much less sarcastic than what you would normally get for such a proposal i guess your definition of constructive is i agree wholeheartedly heres a thumbs upnot supported for reasons previously stated im caldari currently starting an amarr dualspec
gallente blaster boats also use both cap and ammo with a fixed damage type and amarr can use drones as well also the only gallente bs that is made to use drones as its main weapon is the domifor pvp if you gave lasers selective damage type on top of everything else it would be the only weapon choice and your the dps from you guns should be enough for pve
the only complaint i have with amarr ships is that god awful cap usage bonus on most of them instead of an actual weapon bonus damagerofrange that crap bonus leads to things like the autocannon punisher which does more damage and uses less cap than the bonused pulse lasers the damage output and tanking abilities of amarr ships with proper bonuses are just fine
1 so you just blew apart your own argument by admitting there are very powerful pvp ship fits sounds like someone needs to do there homework2 thats funny i know quite a few harby pilots who are quite good at what they do learn to research before speaking3 what are you talking about i was making a suggestion of a valid problem unlike you splattering the boards with epic fail whinery
harbis melt most ships they are shooting in short order nothing should have a win button ie nothing should be able to defend against everything and kill everything thats fairly central to eve for every armortanked ship that you run into there is a shieldtanked ship that is cursing your em damagecomplaining about not having high enough resists against a specific damage type is ridiculous if you are worried about it fit your ship accordingly the abaddon has an insane armor tankamarr can use drones and missiles just like gallente and caldari have ships that are stuck with thermalkinetic damage hybrid weapons
uhm  not supportedyou seriously have no clue what you are talking about
every races weapons have weaknesses a fixed damage type is hardly unique  most caldari ships are locked into kinetic damage gallente do almost entirely thermalkinetic and minmatar are fairly flexible but still have a lot of forced explosive andor kinetic find me another race who gets a battleship with 62km range on its shortrange guns without any range modules and i might begin to think that you might be hard done by
amarr is fine gallente is the one that needs fixing
ok cool you guys dont get it or just dont want to does anyone of you have any experience with amarr gunboats at all or is this more like a i cant fly amarr ships so dont buff themsmack an armor tanked hurricane can kill every other bc and most battleships solo how about that hmi didnt complain about resists i just mentioned them its true that the abaddon has a real nice tank especially in pvp when using buffertank but in pve when fighting angels its a bad joke even with 3 expl 1 kin hardener only 2 heatsinks left yay and a faction lar in angel extra 4every race can use drones but no amarr bs or bc has a damage boost on drones so its more like a nicetohave thing than a primary weapon for all races besides gallente amarr only have some t2 ships that can use missiles sacrilege and damnation both ships have a strong tank rather than high dps no battleship or at least bc can use missiles the mainly used weapons on most amarr ships are lasersand how about pve guys hmmaybe i didnt make things simple enoughsanshablooddrones emtherm weaknessdamage can be dealt by amarr emtherm minmatar em caldari therm guns and em or therm missiles on some ships raven eg  gallente therm guns  dronesguristasserpentis kintherm weaknessdamage dealt by amarr therm close range crystals only caldari kintherm guns and kin missiles gallente kintherm guns  dronesangels expkin weaknessdamage dealt by amarr expkin not possible caldari kin guns and missiles gallente kin guns and droneswell i didnt expect muchany support on my thoughts because most pilots fly everything else than amarr ships lowsec is full of caldari gallente and especially minmatar ships so why buff something that you cant fly at least i hoped for some constructive argumentsposts that actually have a content but i guess people on this forum are as stupid as in enter random mmo forum here
im a pretty well max skilled amarr pilot and im going to go with youre wrong even armor tanked ships go down pretty fast and if you think drakes are lolariously hard to break with em damage try doing it with explosive tbh all the weapons systems save hybrids are fairly well balanced these days i cant in good conscience support your proposalliang
why do i have a feeling that you were in the battleship and someone else was in the cane
nice finally an answer without flames thank you actually nobody is forced to shoot shield tankers with explosive and because you mentioned explosive i think you mean drake vs cane for example a cane can run dual neuts to turn off the drakes hardeners because their guns dont need cap i cant comment on hybrid weapons or why they need tweaking ive to admit that im not into that the only things i see are hyperion and dominix pvp videos where these ships crush whole gangs solo ok but back to topicto conclude the statements posted above you all think lasers are good for pvp ok now what is with pve nobody wrote a comment on that yet and i stated it the biggest reason for my proposal to revamp lasers
you sir are  but ill explain it just for youcane mwds to bs at close range neut it kill it think before flaming
forgot to support my own post as for dividing eve into constituencies that would be nigh impossible to do properly
by free i meant free of real world currency in game currency has no value can be generated in infinite quantities and is easily acquired i am well aware that some people purchase isk with real world money those people are stupid and fail to grasp the concept of video game nice try though
the following changes would be an excellent addition to fw and i think woul encourange more people to join fw1 allow all of empire to be conquered by whichever faction you are in this can lead to alot of fun ops that can be offensive or defensive imagine gallente navy assaulting jita 2 allow pirate factions to be involved sometimes the 4 main empires just arent enough with the recent invasions from sansha surely i should be allowed to join them and claim empire in their namei think if we expand on fw we can make it really interesting ofc it wont be as easy as hmm lets go conquer jita and sec status of a system will have a major impact on that place
lol those ideas are so crazy they may be actually fun and even work even though it would screw all mission runners over because if someone has low standings with lets say gallente and jita changes to gallente sov then theyll get all killed by the navy oactually i think the navy should be pure player driven would be a lot more fun d crazy o
you dont know what youre talking about occupancy is not sov the reason gallente lost all their occupancy at one point is because of a difference in pay for doing so an attempt to gain occupancy is based on pve caldari pilots get paid billions of isk per character for each attempt to gain occupancy gallente pilots dont really get paid at all gallente pilots get paid to pvp the same as the other factions but the pvp is secondary to gaining occupancy and the best part is that because that ccp screwed up the balance between fw rewards and gallente lost ccp decided to punish everyone who missions for gallente yup if youre a gallente misison runner you get storylines that send you deep into fw lowsec in a mission running ship where you have zero chance of accomplishing your missionfw is a lot more broken than make a bigger mess of it will fix not supported
wtf are you going on about and what does it have to do with the opanyways op i honestly like the idea of taking over empires and such a gal assault on jita would be awesome that said id rather push for fw changes that would actually be conceivably done by ccp
i like the idea of fw shaping the map and i guess in a way be able to attack empires in hi sec ofc i wouldnt want it to be possible to kill off an empire completely but it would be alot of fun to invade hi sec and claiming space under a pirate npc factionjita is now controlled by gurista and therefore security has dropped to 01 if only
3 allow entire alliances to join the fw4 change the fw lp stores such that they have access to all offers from any corp from that faction 5 make a tangible benefit for conquering a system  such as system upgrades or tax breaks or something
a simple proposal really certain npcs use too much electronic warfare and its too effective compared to the methods available to counter it or even compared to player electronic warfare capability this is especially problematic if you dont mission in a fof raven or an afk dominix fit because the ewar will ensure that even if you can tank the mission perfectly fine itll take you forever to finish it getting cycledisrupted by sanshas so you never have an optimal range longer than 10km with tachyons using aurora which just happened to me in a mission i couldnt use guns for 35 of the 45 minutes it took me to finish because i couldnt hit anything being jammed for five minutes by guristas and having your battleship sensordamped to a lock range of 12km are all things that are familiar to many missionrunners its no real coincidence why the most popular mission fits are those that are most resistant to ewarwhats further the ships that use the most electronic warfare are also typically the ones that are hardest to kill and their dps isnt too shabby either which runs counter to player ewar ability additionally npcs use the old unmodified prescript versions of ewar that are far far more effective than player versions meaning that theres more of them using a more effective version of it on tougher ships compared to what players are capable of they also never run out of capacitor and seem to have a far longer optimal range than a player and a much longer cycle time while being highly resistant to ewar themselves if theres enough of them they will cripple your ability to respondthis is more of an annoyance than a problem now but if the improved sleeper ai gets applied to these missions resistance to electronic warfare is going to be more important than dps tanking ability when it comes to running missionshow to modify this a few proposals mix and match them to taste1 reduce the likelihood of an npc using electronic warfare this reduces the odds of getting jammed disrupted or dampened for protracted periods of time2 remove electronic warfare from most existing vessels and add new npc electronic warfare vessels these vessels would use electronic warfare but would not have the same dps output or tank that the current electronic warfare ships do making them easier to kill and putting them more in line with player electronic warfare ships3 reduce the number of ewarcapable npcs in missions replacing them with more standard vessels that lack ewar capability but have similar damage and tank this keeps the incoming damage and difficulty consistent while making more ships more viable for running it4 bring npc tracking disruption and sensor dampening up to date reduce their overall effectiveness to be inline with unscripted modules or change them to affect only one attribute  either tracking speed or optimal range for instance but not both
so to boil it downinstead of adapting to meet the capabilities of your mission foes which btw as a mission runner you can look up ahead of time you want to make missions even easier to finishdont get me wrong im a mission  too  i love lots of iskies for little really labor or worry but the mission rats youre discussing nerfing are the ones that actually make missions more than just pointclickcollect cash and lets face it theyre not much above that anyway but the isk must flow as they sayi cant support this there are already ways to defeat the ewar capabilities of these ships which you even acknowledge in your opening post including one you failed to mention  friends friends in other ships can make short work of enemy ships that are busy target jamming your ultra tanked fotm
wts  sensor booster eccm tracking enhancer etc
dont want to stop you  but you cant counter rat jamming they have some unbelievable high jamming strength we tried it with a cnr and 3 remote eccmand the tracking disrupting is really sick same goes for the remote sensor boosting with 45 remote sensor damps you might get 20km with a sensor booster same goes for tracking enhancers dont really help against sansha disrupting in some missionsa little balance with the player ewar might be really nicenpcs also still have 90 webs wtb
npc ewar is also not stacking nerfed ive had a targeting range go from 120km to 6km theres pretty much nothing you can do in this situation except wait for your drones to finish the mission use fofs or bring a friendi usually bring a friend altliang
ill support this in one narrow sense i only want them to have the same ew capabilities that player ships have npcs have been cheating bastards for far too long but heavy ew in missions while annoying is fine if it really bugs you that much just fight angels
ccp needs to stop having its npcs cheat so much especially sleepers
sure why not
asset management in general could use some tweaks this is one of them
would be helpful
oo the description says electronic warfare webs and points fall under electronic warfare if info links dont include webs and scrams then they really should tbh
please kill this i never realized it auto does this until my broswer just crashed and i brought it back up instead of my hourly refresh also you people post too much
killed as requested
yes
would be nice and i cant imagine this being too hard to do
quit crying people are gonna vote for who they want to vote for how would you display the list
nice theory though it ignores that the last couple of csms only had unknown people with no real forum track records running due to the term limitsif you think previous csm candidates didnt have solid programs then you likely have only paid attention the last couple elections when the bottom of the dregs were running this election had all the big names running with programs that were reminiscent of the first csm and that is why weve seen a resurgeso your theory on why the turnout was low is not so easily explained by mere easy access etcand if you think null sec alliances are the ones that are counterproductive and difficult to work with then you havent read csm meeting transcripts much its invariably the independent candidates that are difficult to deal with while even alliances like the goons had elected members that were rational and cooperativetheres surprisingly little faction based rivalry likely cause people who live in 00 sec alliances are used to having codependent relationships with peopleits actually been shown scientifically that being on top of a ballot gives you a certain percentage more votes theres even a funny story about a local election in canada where someone lower on the ballot decided to enter a fictional person in the race so that her rival wouldnt get that bumpwhich really brings up the question why arent ballots printed in randomized order in real election to remove this advantage
normally i hate democracy but there are two things that caused me to vote in this csm when i had not voted in any of the previous ones firstly the advertisements on the login screen secondly the ease with which i was able to find information on the various candidates right on the voting page sadly many of them did not have any information displayed but i read through those who did and was able to make a reasonably informed decision on my vote only one candidate mentioned trade and the market in their little blurb infoim not a regular forum user personally i dislike forums for reasons im not gonna go into those two little changes made a big difference in changing my opinion about voting
i was going to just call you a troll and let it be but since this is going on evesearch for evah and others might find it some day and may wonder the same thing genuinly im actually going to bother looking up some proof for yougeneral information about csmmembers of csm4many other important linkscsm4 iceland meeting minutesxhagens blog about csm4future of the csm
see that little spike at may 10th that lasted a few days it could be a complete coincidence but may 10th was the day we did a big csm candidate roundup at massively in an effort to get more people voting maybe it had an effect
im pretty certain that the massively article helped with the increased voter turnout for comparison my site went from 3000 to 8000 hits per day for the three days after that article there was also a 3 day bump to about 4500 hits a day when the voting opened and a similar 5 day bump just before polls closedmany thanks for putting together the article
yup sorry i forgot to mention that in my earlier post on things that influenced voter turnoutyour article certainly helped i notice that my blog got double its normal traffic that day traffic then tapered off from that high over the next couple of days back to normal thanks
i already said it elsewhere but yes that probably helped a lot and i found it to be pretty accurate overall thanks for the effort
im just curious on the percentual outcome on casted votes per candidate in the days that the list was a static one compared to the casted votes when thy randomised the candidatesdid it prove my case or not
its been established several times that in rl elections the top of the list gets more votes simply because of them being on topwhether it carries over to eve i dont know but i doubt it will have made a significant impact on these elections results pending
ive definitely seen a very tangible number of hits on my candidacy page having massively as a referer so id say it did
wonderful an article that largely dismissed 2 thirds of the candidates brought in a sizable bump to the voter roles by dismissed i mean that the organizational method was to group candidates together was past members of the csm new people people with no informationpast csm members already have an advantage and by listing them first it gave them yet another one with information overload do to the high number of candidates the first few listed would be looked over and the further a candidate was on the list the more likely the reader would have decided to stopi made the same comment on the thread about the article to be honest its not like there is a better method of presenting such a large number of candidates in the future it should be easier ankh and the take care party are a sign of things to come political parties for the csm the parties themselves will edit down the potential candidate listi will also put forward the question why are candidates with no information even listed in votingwhile i have no issue with someone not making a major campaign effort it is somewhat confusing that you would have a candidate with nothing beyond a name these type of empty shirts got less then 100 votes in the last election that is a number of votes that tell me they attracted no one but their in game friendscontactsshould ccp enlist a slightly tighter restriction on the csm candidates i dont see how a candidate can garnish enough votes to be elected if they do not even post any candidate information at all if someone can not even put vote for me in the campaign info window how could they be a good candidate for csm if they can not tap their keyboard 11 times to post a message i dont see how they would find the energy to put for the the effort to be an effective csm memberon the flip side you have the slippery slope once you restrict the candidates where will it end well at least my prattling will end here
i seriously doubt that you will ever see political parties in eve remotely resembling rl ones take care after all is just ankh inc
internet tough guy talk from a npc alt
if you like i could say the exact same thing on my main and it would still be mostly correct and 100 applicable
this is why ankh is needed and will get the most votes dull jealous griefers frustrated csms like sokratesz who tend to forget to show respect to the paying customers the majority of paying subscribers are non pvp players and dont like your attitudei will make sure of you noobs gank her you will get ganked over and over by me and believe me you will not like it being ganked in a fleet battle or a gate camp by a blue player respect the industrialist and carebears i do that though i am a mercenary your attitude is childish and disgusting discrediting yourself
hi to all can you help me i am new to csm when will we no who has won this yes csm
hi chain flamethe results of the recent csm elections will be announced on wednesday may 26th
wednesday
i demand the exact time
0001 hrs eve time
lies everyone should vote for sok
but will it blend
not really lets take a look at the formulachancetohit  05  transversal speedrange to target  turret trackingturret signature resolution  target signature radius2  max0 range to target  turret optimal rangeturret falloff2lets simplify this a bit the part of the formula we really care abouttransversal speedrange to target  turret trackingturret signature resolution  target signature radiusa bit friendlier notation transv  range  tracking  sigres  sig radiusnote that the equations arent bounded by any piecewise functions such as minmax tranv  sig res  range  tracking  sig radiusholding transv range and sig radius constant as one would when seeing how the formula would be different for the same shot c  sig res  trackingof course the value of c is immaterial since it would be the same whether you had higher tracking or lower sig res and this makes tons of sense since high tracking and low sig resolutions both contribute to more hits so really lowering sig res 400  350 or something is exactly equivalent to an equivalent increase in trackingand since hit quality is determined solely based on hit chance we can see that increasing sig res would have no more effect on hit quality than an increase in trackinghope this helpslianged going back and reading goums post a bit closer hes right this is just another way to show ited it also occurs to me that a big part of your complaint was that everything was so self referential in goums formula this is easily solved by having a precalculated variable before doing the main calculation and really i wouldnt be surprised if someone told me it was all done by table lookup
grrr looking at it youre right god i hate this broken systemif it was broken into check separate check sums not only could you lower server load but you could make a more realistic system that would give hybrids an accuracy nitch like i was thinkinginstead of the current equations have something likechancetohit1  transversal speedrange to target  turret trackingchancetohit2  turret signature resolution  target signature radiusif its a hit thendamage  turret signature resolution  target signature radius  range to target  turret optimal rangeturret falloffmisses wouldnt do as much calculation i guess this is a simplified version of what i would prefer though as i would prefer no rangeup to 250km where sig res and radius are calculated properly based on distance rather than an object being the same size regardless of how far or close it is then gunnery would have an additional primary mechanic to balance the three separate systems witheach system with strengths and weaknesses but adding accuracy as a strength to hybridsrails at least would make them more viable while the others could be weaker in this catagory lasers the weakest because they are pretty much the best weapon system in the game and because from a story standpoint the minmatar were once renowned for the quality of their machineryanyways that aint gonna happen
if they dont want the field css to be super hacs then they should concentrate on making them a fleet cs for small gangsgive them the ability to fit a ganklink without having to gimp the fitting to do it also give them a bonus to the ganglinks effectiveness this would still leave the fleet command ships with the 3 links and uber tank for fleet engagements and let the field command ships deal with boosting subbs gangs
i shieldtank my brutixi brutixes and i enjoy my 11k dps astarte can power out 14k if i remember correctly 74k ehp is really paltry considering how damnned slow it is compared to a harby which will end up with more and cost less and more reach you will be instaprimaried and you still dont make use of the tempting repair bonus loot pinata indeedthis would require a revamp of the whole ganglink structure because even if this was implemented the astarte would continue to be worthless infowar lolwhut
intro some of you are aware that ccp wants to remove those but they are still searching for a solution which would benefit the most players so i meditated and figured out solution which is easy to program and implement and which will not make people angry solution1 add 10 points  10 to all characters attributes 10 points is the value of maxed learning skills 10 is a bonus to value gained by maxed learning skill2 remove all learning skillslike they never existed3 sp which player had been invested in learning will be redistributed through faster learning time lets say 10000 fasterlets say for example you have 4m sp in learning you will get bonus to sp accumulation with a same value so you will not lose any sp but it would be redistributed to your current skill plan in total value which would be exactly the same as the sp value in learningthat would of course would be different from player to player not everyone have all learning skill maxed so its only fair to receive as much as you had investednow the question iswould you be totally satisfied with this change
please ccp hurry up and do thissigned
good solutioni also think it would be reasonable to give all characters an extra 5 to all attributes and either remove the 15 implants or use them entirely for statskill bonuss like the current sets worksigned
supportedccp already has the tech in place to allow for accelerated skillpoint gains up to a set limit so it should be possible to implement thisproblem is youll still have people whining they you should have to do it because i had to mentality but then some people are never happythis solution deals with learning skills while at the same time giving a return to those who originalaly invested in the skills
what about the sp i would have gained had i had the learning skills from day 1 as new players then effectively would you forgot to account for thata better solution is just remove the learning skills and tell anyone who complains to stfubest solution is stfu about the learning skills
i support the proposal of the original post

not supportedone of the unique features of eve is specialization learning skills are part of it
supported learning skills were always bad game design better to remove them late than never i would also have no problems with those sp simply vanishing with no reimbursement
ive weighed in n the learning skills argument before and im still on the same side now theres nothing wrong with learning skillswhat needs to be changed is peoples perception of their neccessity but that would require changing the basic human nature of minmaxing in games where possibleso i will simply say what i have always saidyou do not need to train learning skills not even to be competitive especially in the short termlets face it if two characters are facing off against each other in combat and they both have a total of 5 million skill points in the points relevant to that particular fight does it really matter how long it took them to accumulate those skill points of course not  what will matter is how the points are applied  iow the players skill at effectively using those points to reach the desired outcome i would say that if anything the character that took longer getting there has an adavantage because he has had more of an opportunity to hone the skills required to effectively apply those pointswhat learning skills do is allow for a margin of error they allow your opponent to mis calculate instead of being able to look at a character and go oh hes six months old he has exactly x skill points you can still do that but theres a wider margin of error because youre not sure how much learning he has applied which shifts the total up or downnot supported
ccp needs to just chop the learning skills people who complain need to htfu if youve trained them youve already experienced the faster skill training and benefited from it if you havent trained it yet you are a noob and shouldnt be faced with a month of skills that exist for no other reason than to train skillsedit i will however support anything within reason that axes the learning skills
not supportedlearning skills are a love them to hate them set of skills you always want to put them in cue but they take forver by putting them in cue you are speeding up skill learning for lateri say dont add more  dont get rid of themif you dont want to skill them  then dontm
to those who didnt support do remember that ccp decided that those skills will be removed we dont discuss here should they be removed or notthey still are not removed because ccp didnt find solution which would satisfy majority of players
imo we should just cut the skills and htfu about it but ill support this if for no other reason than to get learning skills out of the game they exacerbate the sp inadequacy problems new players feelif they focus on learning skills they dont have fun for like two months in the game wtfm8if they dont im literally outrunning them on learning new crap and they feel like im pulling even further ahead by the dayliang
linki remember 1 dev saying once 4 years ago that he personally didnt like learning skills
learaning skills are stupid its an absolutely dumb game mechanic that drives potential new players out of the game the question i have been asked repeatedly by my real life gaming friends is spend money and how much time on this i fully support this or any plan that gets rid of learning skills
i dont think it makes a difference if one supports this or not ccp recognizes and is aware of the problem they simply havent come up with a solution its in their best interest to do so and it will probably eventually happen csm time is better spent on other thingsit has no impact on my argument but i think the skills are an absolutely dreadful game design mistake one which is understandable and understandably hard to correct which kind of makes them interesting for those of us interested in such things
a buddy of mine who is smart enough to fully grasp this idea says its a good solution so i guess im on board  i never thought learning skills made much sense of course i could say the same of many things in eve but this seems like one ccp might actually fix for a change

im going to quote you since its a lot easier youre simply misunderstanding me what im saying is this whole thing is an incentive to just simply blob each otheralliance a invades alliance b with say 10 people in 3 systems alliance b fails to utilize decent amount of industry and ratting within said systems and thus they are quite easily takenalliance b realizes that through using more ratters and industry in those systems they can withstand an invading force for much longer and thus does soheres the problem ok so you can roam with a few people and put a squeeze on their systems and it at first promotes small gang warfare however to offset the oncoming force alliance b decides to start spamming more industry and ratting with a militia of equal or greater size than the roam to protect their industry and squash the invaders alliance a can either at this point go home or continue with their planned invasion and thus start spamming more forces to counterbalance the defending alliance b either youre going have a huge incentive to blob or youre going to have a defending pushover alliance that will just collapse at an incoming invasion what choice do you think they haveso really you are replacing one blob with another however only in anticipation of the blobs that were planned to invade in the coming future the only thing that is changed is forcing corporationsalliances to use their systems more to an advantage or get stamped out if they choose not to sure small gang warfare makes sense however theyre going to defend themselves and so many pilots can only do so much not sure how only a few pilots roaming a system can take on an empire
youve clearly never pushed a force that tries to protect its industry before it doesnt matter who it is at one point people will be too bored to sit there for nothing defending miners and while theyre defending a mining op the skirmish force can kill people elsewhere making them whine that all the defence is assembled in one spot it also enables a skirmish gang to bomb the blob defending the mining op hell you can bomb the mining op itself and run away with no losses furthermore decreasing moralepeople need to stop using a blob as an excuse for everything and rather start thinking what one might do while being outnumbered its very easy for 10 people to take out 100 hulks protected by 600 military ships you just need to know how
but isnt this what we want what is fun it begins with a small force attacking industrialists another small force moves in to intercept them this then escalates to larger and larger forces until you have an all out war over the systemthis differs from today where all of a sudden you get a spike of 500 ships jumping into the system proceeding directly to the ihub and decimating it in a few seconds that force then has to sit there doing nothing waiting for either the timer to run out or the owners of the system to get a fleet ready which will take hours there is just no interaction which should be the fun partin my suggestion you get a trickle of people coming in from both sides slowly escalating the battle and at any one time the attackers can decide that their offensive capabilities are better used somewhere else and may withdraw to annoy another system or split out over several systems
yes i absolutely agree it shouldnt be an excuse but my point still stands they will use this as another means to blob a system the current suggestion sounds great in that at first will encourage small roams to clear front line systems in enemy territory since i notice a lot of systems are hardly used by large alliances however there comes a point where one group has to decide whether to defend it or not in terms of the proposed indexperhaps it is better to go more along with something like what has been suggested for fw sov where each ship is worth a certain number of points and you weaken the system given the losses of the defending team also have it so the more ships that blob the opposing force the less points are addedtaken to the teams it seems this way you still will see blobing however there is a better incentive to fight with less numbers and to be more careful with their shipsthoughts

supported anyway  but especially after the op changed
a big part of the frustration comes from the lack of communication for example solving my pet problem so far as i know would be simply changing some numbers in the db in twenty minutes am i wrong and would it actually involve days of dedicated work i dont know this so i see a simple change and an unaccountable silence for the best example of this see the supercarrier backandforth from last december why were the playertested changes ditched and replaced with ones based on obviously faulty assumptions nobody knows in the absence of information you get frustration and hysteria
i dont see how fixing asault frigates balancing rockets boosting hybrids which you have taken a personal interest in or boosting lowsec are pet peevesfixing the changed dominion sov system affects tens of thousands if not more fixing faction war affects a huge playerbase and a major part of the gamethese are not pet peevs laing these are former expansions that have been abondoned for the next shiny toy
in the grand scheme of things i think it says a lot about ccp that so many ppl have so many pet peeves and it aint something positive this game is one of the most bug infested pieces of software ive ever encountered and thats just one pet peeve
supported since incarna has been pushed back to 2011 let the next expansion be a fix expansionthere is more than enough material that needs fixing to be actually usable to make for a huge expansion we dont really need any more ships we dont really need any more space although i wouldnt say no if they decided to add a couple fo new npc sov 00 regions there is enough for any new player to do for years and yearsbut lets see them just finish the projects theyve started cosmos faction warfare tech 3 ships the corp management interface assault frigates and many many moreedit since ccp like biblicalsounding expansion names i propose that this expansion be called redemption
tyrannis  such as it is  is here incarna has already been pushed back well let me see now is it 3 years 4 there is a gap this winter in which a fix expansion could usefully be fitted
some of you may have clicked this link to the patch notes and been surprised to find that half the page is devoted to fixes when you read through the changes section you will also notice that a lot of changes are what many might call fixes instead im going to go out on a limb here and say ccp has put the majority of man hours in the previous patch and this upcoming one into fixing existing stuff reading through the patch notes the obvious problems havent been addressed but it looks like a lot of fairly major issues are being fixed being able to create two alliances at the same time i am kind of sad that i cant bounce around the inside of stations anymore when undocking it was mildly amusing
every patch has a rack of fixes but a lot of them are on the order of corrected spelling error in the description of dread guristas small smartbomb or some suchwhat we want is a patch that is focused on fixing bugs and finishing existing content faction warfare and cosmos arent that buggy as such theyre just terribly incomplete there is a vast amount of unrealised potential in the existing content that could be expressed before more unfinished ideas are jammed in5 complete coherent and deep gameplay concepts are worth 50 of the other kind
hear hear
indeed i believe planetary interaction is supposed to be part of sovfaction warfare so in a way you might be jumping the gun before the entirety of the solution has been put into place the big issue is the lack of communication from ccp on the issues that keep being raised occasionally we hear thats a great idea ie the dead horse but a we hope to get to that in xyz patch is what people want to hear
just so that people are clear on this i want incarna i believe that pi is necessary and useful for dust514 which i also wantbut i also want the updates fixes and completion of existing content that we were already promiseddominion lag 7 months5th subsystem for t3 a yearfaction warfare two yearsstations in wspace a yearassault frigates god knows  longer than ive been playingcosmos again longer than ive been playingmission fix yet another longer than i have been playing for the love of god heal this bleeding wound in your gameplay ccpthe list goes on but with what i have listed above there is more than enough for an absolutely epic expansion
out of your patch note linknone are related to ship balancingnone are related to fixing the new sov warfare problemsnone are related to faction warnone of them fix cosmos agentsnone of them are an improvement on the ui designnone of those fix completely broken shipsnone relate to a missing subsystem of a shipthank you for quoting the patch notes that completely supports this thread its better than any thumbs up you can give
thats pretty narrow view of the game really complaining about a virtually unused and unknown feature cosmos that wont actually help 995 of the people that play the game id rather have things like fleet lag fixed tbqfh liang
narrow is avoiding 95 of what you quoted cosmos are underused because they are unfinished
when did ccp say theyd introduce stations in wspace the official line was along the lines of you only have what you take in with you  no sov no moon mining

this is an awesome idea
bacon is that way 
flying bacon sammiches 
first of all thanks for reading my postnow that the pleasantries are out of the waylets begin why is it that this game allows gangs of people to camp on gates and destroy unknowing ships i dont mind pvp combat and i understand the game is built on it but its a real drag whenever you warp into a sector and there are four ships waiting to tackle scram and flat out obliterate you i think that the makers of this game should install platform guns at all gates leading into and out of a security sectors not all sectors of course but the ones in 04 to 01 in 00 space its supposed to be outlaw space so no guns are needed even if you dont want to put guns at these locations at least prevent hostilities at these pointsit almost made me quit the game the first time i lost a myrmidon battlecruiser due to a group of gate camping thugs in closing if you want more players to quit then keep on letting guys camp gates and see how many would be paying customers you will continue to loseelitestealth
first in a troll thread
all i can think is not very elite or stealthy if you struggle to sneek past 4 people on a gate
im ambivalent on the proposal itself im more inclined to think that low security space should be made more profitable but not less dangerousin the meantime however for low security travel i recommend flying either a fastaligning frigate a ship capable of fitting a covert ops cloaking device ii or forming a fleet with a friend you trust who goes through the gate first and tells you whats on the other side commonly called a scout your friend should be flying a fastaligning frigate or a ship thats fit with a covert ops cloaking device ii
it work both waysif gate camping will be impossible abt same qtty of pilots leave i am not saying i like them butbtw myrmydone can tank a lot of damage if fitted right if you have some friends following you it may work other way around for gate campers if you want to move around lowsec solo  use interceptor covertops recon transport  alike
im gonna have to disagree with you on this one i personally love the fact that there is no safe place in eve btw there are guns on gates from 10 to 01
why arent such things like countermeasure probes or jamming systems available that would block a probes ability to track a ship seems logical that with all the stealth systems such tech should be applicable if they can tracks us we should be ablke to jam their tracking signals or hide release probes of our own that could hide our location from probersseems only logical that if you can scramble someones warp and web their thrusters dampen their range jam cynos that the ability to learn counter probing skills should be just as readily available
didnt you start the same thread in features ideas aswelland the answer is cloak
cloaking devices do this job quite handily and are widely and readily available
yes because i had a gm specifically tell me to try suggesting it in the two areas now when you have a less robotic and a more intelligible and reasonable response id love to hear it until than that answer is not an answer but the response of someone who knows nothing but how to hide from an enemy
the cloaking device is the counter to probes you cloak they cant find you anymorethere is also the option of unprobable ships with eccm but for the general rule cloak does the job fine please enlighten me how cloaking is not hiding from the enemy
confirming that cloaking devices of any kind are the ideal countermeasure to probes
the counterprobing skill already exists cloaking hell it even has a low prerequisite electronics iv
already exists check out eccm effects and probing and stuff about non probable t3s you can also even cloak carriers and use them without probes getting younot supported as you didnt bother looking into what other jamming systems are already available on the market
low sec compared to 00  empire is unequal and seriously needs a buffi think losing sec standing is a bad thing if pirate syndicates exist then surely there must be ways to bribe concord i say pirates should be allowed to pay of the sec loss at least upto 200
there is already a way to up your sec status and 199 doesnt prevent you access to any high sec systems
yeah but i didnt want it so you could pay to have it 0 at least at 2 you will have issues after a killwe could have it so certain low sec agents do this
not supported you either embrace the 10 or you will have to work yourself up again buying out would be too easy
1 gank freighter2 loot3 pay off concord4 win5 do it againdo you not see how horrible this idea is
thats exactly what i want low sec needs to be lethal costs and such go on how often you do this and bribery isnt an uncommon thing
noits already easy enough to up your sec status whats the point are you a criminal or not if you are your security status should be low you just shouldnt be penalized for it by not being able to enter highsec if youre not then you shouldnt have a low security statusthis is not the answer because youve gotten the question wrong
do you have any idea how unreasonable that really is if youre down to turning off his hardeners from dual medium neuts hes long long since blown up your hurricane and 2 or 3 more just like it drakes are bad news bears also id like to see your barrage hurricane that doesnt do explosive damage just because you can switch damage types doesnt necessarily mean you really can or willconsidering that the nightmare is one of the best ships to mission in liang
you really have no clue what youre talking about have you ever looked at any of the battle reports from the recent ncsc war in every bs battle the apocalypse was the most used ship why is that i wonderheres an idea why dont you cross train to fly the ships you want to fly instead of whining about the ones you dont it really doesnt take that long if you already have your support skills trained up
missions i was talking about 00 pve  rattingplexing blob warfare is something completely different than smallscale pvpto get for example minmatar t2 guns  battleship iv it takes another 3 months of training bs v 1 month shield tanking skillsanyways lets end this without any support from the community for a lowsp amarr pilot i guess ive to either search for a low spfriendly nonrussian speaking actually pvp active alliance living in raiderssanshadrone regions without a killboard full of failfittings or wait another 56 months to fly a battleship of another race lets see what happens faster im so tired of flying solo pvp if anyone wants to know why i didnt join an empirelowsec corp yet its simply because i dont want to corp hopthread
as someone who flies a nightmare and has killed all npc types in onelaser are fine seriously i have never had a problem against anything except those damn guristas elite cruisers hell i used an apoc against serpentis and angels for like 6 months and never had problemsedit fit mwds on your pvp shipsedit 2 and cap boosters
disturbed lucy get your support capacitor skills in particular and weapon gunnery skills in particular skills up and i can almost guarantee that you will not be having cap andor dps issues with amarr shipsin terms of tactics though well thats a different story amarr are overall not very solo oriented ships the exceptions being the crusader arbitrator and both recon ships they are gank and tank fleet ships with comparatively even armor resistances and decent range on their short range gunsone last thing please post the fits of the ships you most commonly use yes this is a serious request if my hunch is right youre fitting them very very wrong and it might explain many of the problems you are encountering with amarr ships
yes because 2 medium neuts are going to dry out a battleships cap in time to matter the hurricane is a fairly good bc and it can beat a number of the others but id be hardpressed to think of any competent battleship fit it could beat reliably
this fit is for solo lowsec so no bubbles and engagements arent usually 1v1 more like 1vparty id not bring this to a fleet high5 hpl ii2 fmpl ii mixing pulse lasers isnt that bad because the fighting range is 124 km to fit 7 hpl awu v is needed along with a 5 pg implant with my fitmidmids are flexible because of the usual 1vparty engagements i get scramed anyways by tackler frigs so i dont use mwd id have to downgrade lasers to do so i dont use a cap booster because i run from armormortanked canes curses and pilgrims anyway the tracking disrupter would be my nemesis alone even without their neuts i never lost a fight with this ship due to capacitor problems yet12 eccm falcons rooks and especially ecm drones are very common and this helps a lot amarr t1 ships have the a low sensor strength and if you get jammed when flying solo you are usually dead i actually killed a rook in a 1v1 for example  scram andor disruptweb2nd web a tracking comp  ab instead of scram when using only 1 eccm  switching mids situationallow1600 rolled tungsten1x eanm iidcu ii3x hs ii drones5x vespa ec600 or 5x hornet5x warrior ii  ships using standard loadouts are not fitted against ecm giving me a huge advantage and them a huge surprise i had great success with this even while not being max skilled i run from basically every nonharbinger battlecruiser except shield canes which run from me d some bcs may be killable myrmidon brutix cyclone with maxed skills but im 2 months away from that damagewise awu v surgical strike v bcs v and even more far away from perfect navigation and passive tanking skills to see this in action i want to show you the youtube channel of the pilot swatyy who switched to a cane  logistic alt by now for obvious reasons but his solo harbinger pvp movies are still up
this is your real problem low sptrain to the same skill level in one of the other races you mentioned and you will see that you will not fare not better beside using a drake in missions the ultimate mission low sp ship
i alread know the damage output of an all skills v abaddon due to lancer implants in my mission clone
ok so not only do lasers have awesome damage use littleno ammocrystals  can swap crystals instantly have awesome tracking and range now you want to be able to pick damage types alsoyou may say  caldari can swap damage type with missiles this is true however think about it the vast majority of caldari missile boats have a bonus to kinetic damage only a decent skilled pilot would get 25 extra damage to kinetic this in itsself negates the use of changing damage type in most situations most not all also doing so takes atleast 10 seconds probably more taking into account ping timeslaglasers are fine for pve from what everyone says apart from yourselfand they sure as hell are one of the best weapons for a pvp hell look at any bs fleet big or small people want amarr lasers weather its short range gank mid range or sniper rangedefinatly not supported considering us caldari have wanted changes to lolkets rockets for such a long time and nothing has changed
no it cant a armor tanked hurricane dies quite easily to a properly fitted shield tanked hurricane i do it fairly often and i fly both and i prefer shieldcane most of the time bear in mind i have both hg slave and lg snake and i spend 99 of my time in the cheaper snake clone to nano drake if he doesnt have slaves to ham drake etc as well as a host of things the shield hurricane just kills on other hand shield hurricane has to avoid anything with lasers fitted you can only kill a really bad bs pilot with pve fit or fail fit with eitherif i had laser skills id probably fly the hpl nano myrmidon occasionally as well because its imo the best myrmidon fit and quite a nasty ship with both good dps good speed good agility solid buffer cap boosterversatility because of dronebay and well everything reallythose mwdless plated bricks work on paper for warp to covops alt fight if they bring too many people die die rinse repeat or for hugging station and deaggrodock games theyre not as such generic pvp fits worth a damn and when you fight competent pilots they make you sadwell yes you have somewhat of a point about pve but ships are not really balanced around pve well ok but mainly used weapons on gallente are hybrids the only drone bonused bs is the dominix myrmidon yes ok but myrmindon is not a focused droneboat because of 75m3 bandwidth and 6 turrets
it is not solo pvp when you bring an alt in a rr bs and even then his pvp videos are a bad example how to fly the harbmaybe look at the videos of prozacxx nano harb atrophocy kil2 how to use the harbinger solo atrophocys last video had a nice solo kill of a drake with a harbinger

ok folks ive to admiti was wrongthe problem i had in pve with angels especially was so simple i actually dont want to post it its so awkward but nevertheless here we go i used an abaddon for ae4 because i thought it has good tank and good damage it works fine for raiders etc but the problem why it took me 2 hours no blitz in ae 4 was because i ran out of capacitor with 4 hardeners 4 cap rechargers  3x ccc and no cap  no tank so i often had to wait for my capacitor to fill up now i used an apoc with only 3 cap recharger  2 ccc rigs but i had more than enough cap all the time and no problems at all and was even able to fit an aux nano pump and a tracking comp finished the mission in 54 minutes cleared absolutely everything except bonus pocket well the highest bounty battleship was an 800k one and it takes ages to kill it but i guess i cant have everything im sorry for everyone who raged reading this thread i hope you can forgive me regards dlthread
you can also do the bonus pocket solo with good skillsmega pulse apocs are a damn fine mission boatnote maybe fit a web instead of the tracking computer for angel missions
i admit i havent entirely thought through this system its a bit complicated and i dont have time but i supported becasue i do strongly agree that with so many candidates there should be some way we can voice our opinion that you are revolted by a particular candidate otherwise its just the most divisive candidates that get elected not the most representative i want people who actually represent the voters not people who are obnoxious crackpots
i think i speak for the majority when i suggest that furthur expansion be delayed until the current server is opperating smoothly many known glitches exist and the server has trouble enen doing normal restarts good luck out there
i think you think wrong
i like the idea of having to choose between joining an alliance or faction warfare so i dunno about 3however 45 sound fair and nice maybe we can have certain planet structures that can only built in faction placesfor example gallente space  storage size increased on everything amarr  faster couriering  routing caldari  cheaper structure construction and minmatar  a reduction in power  cpu needssomething on the lines of that as for 00 give them all of these facilities free based on what type of command centre they have i know theres no racial type just planet difference but lets make it different d
having the option for an automatic bill or a tax would save a lot of boring outofgame paperwork needing to be kept by alliance heads
almost every lvl5 can be done with a drake and basimoar alts is moarif the missions were not predictable and way way harder so it actually took a group of say 58 people then maybe as that wont happen nein
make the scan time really long then like 1 minute per cycle instead of 10 seconds so you can scan down the cloakers it just takes time ensuring that if their afk they will get killed and if theyre hunting with half a brain theyll be moving around looking for targets ensuring that the 1 minute scan time wont hurt them
so it takes 1 whole minute to scan down a cloaky ship then you need to warp to that location however far away it might be an afk cloaker with half a brain will be moving out towards empty space at about 300ms covops frig anyway even at 200ms thats 60x200  12km in the time it takes to scan them down bump range is 2km so you warp to the point youve scanned and 12km in some direction is a cloaked ship wooeven if the location you scan down is where they are at the end of the scanning if aligning then warping takes anymore than 10 seconds warping usually takes around 20 seconds helps with session change issues theyre outside bump range then tooeither way i dont see scanning cloaked ships working as it is easily defeated by the cloaked ship at least covops cloak anyway
when you warp to them they are burning off from where you are at that moment you bookmark that spot then wait a bit untill their about 150 away from you you scan them adn align in that direction and burn you mwd and you will catch and bump them
predictable response 1 heres some math for you ill ignore stacking penalties for the sake of conveniencei have two sensor boosters that give me a 50 bonus to targeting range each i activate both of these so my optimal range is 100 50 150  50  225 now i have two serpentis sensordampen me reducing my optimal range and scan resolution by 50 apiece my optimal range goes from 225 to 1125 with the first and 5625 with the second so im still only locking at a little over half my base lock distance and my scan resolution is down to 25 of its original since i cant boost both at once but they can dampen both now consider that in some missions you can get dampedtdd by 56 ships the situation is even worse with tracking computersdisruptors as a scripted t2 tracking computer gives about a 15 bonus to optimal range but a single tracking disruptor takes off about 45 ecm might be the worst though as npc ecm has a flat percentage chance of working that is not affected by a ships sensor strength at all  a raven with 3 remote eccms on it is jammed just as frequently as a golem with no eccm despite having dozens of times the sensor strength
predictable response 2as i explained in the post right above this one you really cant counter npc electronic warfare because theres simply too much of it i dont necessarily want to make the missions easier but i do want to make them less frustrating  having to sit and wait for the rare break in a 7 sansha cycledisruption as in level 4 blockade does not make the mission difficult it just makes it annoying for everyone not flying a raven or a dominix and while bringing friends does certainly work if i really wanted to sit there doing nothing while other people made money for me id still be mining p

this will only make sense to dutch playersto be fair isnt the pvv simply wilders inc if we would go to a point where you need 50006000 votes to be on the csm i think it would be quite likely to see some more parties form
not everyone who has isk is a worthy candidate just as not everybody without isk is a bad candidateif there was an isk cost it would have to be significant to have any impact many billions and the result would be that people such as myself wouldnt be able to take part
unfortuantely as you said there isnt really any other way to present that kind of information on so many candidates its not feasible to do them all on one page due to massivelys page styles and the fact that people will only scroll down so much so i listed the three pages in order of who i had the most information on and that meant putting previous csm members on the first page if it helps put your mind at rest we had an abnormally high rate of hit conversion from page 1 to page 2 about 90 of the people that visited page 1 went on to page 2 but few people went to page 3 so everyone but the relatively unknown players got a very similar level of coverage it was unusual because we usually lose as many people going from page 1 to 2 of a threepage article as going from 2 to 3 people really must have wanted to see all the candidates worth voting for
wow thats an incredible increase of voter turn out but the fact that only 1267 where involved is still a bit disheartening tt i cant wate to see the results tomorrow
yeah but he isnt a party in the classical sense and should be taken as serious as ankh too
i voted abstain all all 4 of my accounts as i have done every timethe csm is full of powerblocks making sure they have there reps in hell the nc even sent mails out to coordinate who was to vote for whomuch like in rl it doesnt matter who you vote for the crap still get in
if your reason for not voting is that the csm is full of powerbloc representative wouldnt the logical course of action be to vote for a candidate that is not in a powerblocselffulfilling prophecy and all that
even better vote for someone in a corp all to themself tamber
or better yet an npc corp
i too am in an npc corp but i didnt vote for ankh have corp tickers showing and im not a take care alt this makes me special in this thread
theres so much fail im having a hard time deciding where to begin withthis is why ankh is needed what to stop people from killing people in eve to make all of our spaceships become cute furry delectable forest animalsdull jealous griefers i live in 00 and kill people thank you very much i dont know what dictionary youre using to define griefing but im assuming its the one that says any form of killing another player is verboten in eve also i will fully admit to griefing hulks during hulkageddon ii and killing a csm candidates pod the other day note the semantic differencethe majority of paying subscribers are non pvp players and dont like your attitudeill let that statement speak for itselfi will make sure of you noobs gank her you will get ganked over and over by me and believe me you will not like it being ganked in a fleet battle or a gate camp by a blue playershivanis salvager i strikes my tempest perfectly dealing for 1 armor plate and 2 tangled power conduitsalso im pretty sure im not set blue to any tards like you so expect to feel a sharp and fatal pain upon jumping into my alliances territoryalso you do not gank people in fleet battlesalso you dont gatecamp bluesalso you dont know who my main is and to keep myself from having to deal with crapfaced evemails sent by the likes of you nobody will ever know who captain foivos really isrespect the industrialist and carebears i respect chribba and a few others namely the people i build capships with and pewpewlazor with respect is not given it is earnedin closingyour attitude is childish and disgusting discrediting yourself
i was going to bake bitter cookies but i see youve monopolized the vital ingredient
oh i am going to post with my mains plural if the others will do toofirst off my dear soontobe victim i have undertaken far more extreme measures than ganking some blue or ganking someone who was in the same gatecamp like me thats why mercenaries have various mains and a payment of 3 billion is worth the effort to invest some time to sneak into the alliances and corps ya carebears got that many isksecond you are only a cheap coward on an internetboardpost with your main but i figure you have not the balls
the majority of paying subscribers are non pvp players and dont like your attitudebroken downthe majority  more than half of paying subscribers  the implication being that players who do not spend money are lesser players  or that spending money gives you a greater influence and a more important opinion or that the people with an opposite opinion to yours are not paying for their accounts and therefore do not have an important opinion any opininion opposing yours would be a free opinion and therefore an unimportant oneare nonpvp players  interesting would this be an assertion that more than half of the subscribing players do not even pvp once or to be more fair on a regular basis and would this include industrial characters who carry out mining and industrial  research work for pvp groupsand dont like your attitude  so of the enormous group of players who pay money to ccp you know that they do not pvp and that they are united in their approval and disapproval of certain posters this is extraordinary and a triumph of statistical analysis
indeed id say rediculously so i call shenanigans
oh hi natana how are you doing still bitter about being banned from eveger
i think you should have enough bitter yourself to bake your cookies nao
i think you should go wash your vagina
do you think you just made the number of people who want to gank her less or more
0200 if possible yes im staying up late to get you all the results
condemned to the couch again
alas i am single im just looking forward to getting these results out its been a great election
0001 would be better so i dont have to stay up all night to find out who got in
im just interested to see how many votes cat got
are you cute just dont expect me to eat any of that hakarl
they paid to create a brand new font of a small size and ended up with that illegible messpointless reinvention of the wheel when there are already fonts out there that do the job much better that can be freely used proggyfontscom dev time could have been better spent elsewhere
well if statements arent nearly as efficient as people might thing when it comes down to cpu cycles it might just be that putting it all in one formula actually performs faster than checking to se if it is a hit but as you said  it is not as if it is going to happen anyway
support especially the nighthawk part give us one single gridslot more for gods sake please
a brutix doesnt get 1100 dps without officer gear a brutix with max skills 7x neutrons 3 damage mods and hammerhead iis gets 860 dps the same fit on an astarte gets 1035 for comparison for a harby to get more ehp than that astarte it needs to fit a 1600 2 eanm a damage control and three trimarks and even then it only hits 76k the fit is reasonable but it does a third less dps and moves slower even at max skills id still take the astarte in a secondignoring cost yeah its not the same as a tripleplate geddon but it has as much ehp as most sniperfit battleships any bc that can tank three races ofold doomsday isnt doing too badly on tank also no repair bonus is tempting on anything too small to use battleship reppers unless youre running l3 missions
in addition to the op how would you feel about either 25 more drone bay or an extra turret on the absolution without power grid change because atm with the additional zealot turret added and the much more useful range and speed of the zealot plus the other battleships and bc options theres still so many alternatives to the absolution that nobody will ever fly one
although i am losing faith in this section of the forums i support this matter
supporting this astarte absolution and nighthawk really need to have a role besides being expensive and sometimes worse than tier 2 bcs
learning skills were a design flaw imo at least the extended learning skills package having said that i dont see how you can reverse it in a way that is fair for everybodybasicly i dont care that much and as such i will not support this topic
exactly
qft learning skills are fundamental to the eve game mechanics you need them in the long term if you fail to realize that you fail at eve
learning skills are a long term vs short term investment by removing that decision you are hurting not only the old people who trained themby wasting their time you are hurting new players by removing what can be an incredibly deep planning moment in their characters life not supported you dont want them and the bonuses provided you are not in any way obligated to train them
yeslearning skills are in my opinion unnecessary and a deterrent to many people who want to try eve for just a few weeks ccp themselves have admitted that their introduction was a mistake and its never too late to clean up on them
this learning skills annoy people but theyre not a problem
rofl
i would like to contest that ive introduced several people to eve and every single one of them came back to me within the first few days asking what do i do with these learning skills i dont know howmuch of a deterrent it is to new players although i can imagine it is but in the least it causes confusion
confusion sure many things about eve confuse new players i know a great many things about eve confused me at first and took a long time for me to wrap my brain around thats not a bad thing that confusion is a lot of what kept me interested most longterm players i know relished the figuring things out process that comes with learning eve id say those players who become longterm are eves target market not the easily discouraged because things are confusing
not that kind of confusingmore the kind of i know what they dobut whyyy
i have a friend we can call a i introduced a to eve a enjoyed it for a few weeks but became rather frustrated with several parts of the game ultimately leading to her moving on to a different game these were her complaints you mean i have to spend more than a month just to be able to train skills as fast as everyone else why are there all these extra modules for almost the same price which are a lot worse than the modules people use talking about named stuff this tutorial is really long and boring why do i have to learn about mining why cant i click on something to attack it these quests are mindnumbingly boringa ended up ditching eve for hellgate london which died came back to eve briefly and reiterated how much repetitive action there was how much time was spent waiting and how boring missions were before leaving for tabula rasa which died couldnt convince a to try eve again after that considering how games she play end up dying perhaps thats for the best however she still made valid points that are likely echoed by other people who try eve then quit there is a certain demand for some linear content to get people into the game that eve lacks or lacked it has been a while since i last ran the tutorial ditching the learning skills would allow people to start working on their gameplayrelated training right away without any detours
every time ive introduced someone to eve ive explained it to them and given them the advice to spend maybe half their time on learning skills and half on real skills never heard any complaints
same here i just tell em that 43 is fine anything after that is a commitment for the really long term and to make that decision when they make that commitment one didnt bother with the advanced skills at all until hed been playing for over a year another trained up 55 before he even started playing messy divorce at 6 months of his life the rest ended up in the 44 to 55 rangeseriously the whole lrning skilz are evil thing is just people crying to be protected from their own weakness in being unable to restrain themselves from minmaxing they cant stand the idea that someone somewhere might be getting a whole 66 sphr more than them but they dont want to put in the time to get that last couple of percent
what depth defer dofunstuff skills at the start of your career so as not to cripple yourself later wow such freedom of choice good to see the ewang eve is not supposed to be accessible to those foul noobs its a game for real men brigade out in force
i was one of those foul noobs and i enjoyed the choice i actually didnt finish up my learning skills until well after 2 years into the game cripple yourself nonsense a level 5 skill is a level 5 skill no matter how long it takes to train it
your attitude is terrible and youre absolutely wrong i find it amusing that you refuse to look beyond your own prejudice of seemingly lol they week min maxer lol to wow we make people sit around for like 2 weeks doing nothing fun in the game it doesnt even make any sense because if they eliminated learning skills most of the people in this thread wouldnt even be affected we would all be exactly as we are because we already paid the piper learning skills add nothing to the game ive introduced several friends to the game and they have almost all quit in the time when theyre supposed to be doing learning skills and yes i told them to train up some skills to do something in the game first i mean god forbid that i have an interest in making eve not suck for new playersi mean seriously how do you justify me as an older player having an ever widening gap in capabilities because i trained learning skills in order to even slow that gap theyve got to spend damn near a month training learning skills a month that they could have devoted to getting some skills under their feet so that i dont solo their myrm in a vigil or somethingliang
the people who would be most hurt are this are the new playersfor example myself i am at roughly 5mil sp now in 3 months and if i lost my learning skills suddenly i would be set way back on both my accounts having wasted 21 days approx on two accountsmy extra remap on the second one for training learning skills so unless a system of bonus is put in your only hurting the people who joined in the past 6 monthspost dominion who have already put in the time to train them and would now train slower and have wasted 3weeks on learning skillsjust my 2cents supported as per opremoving with no bonus not supported
argh my browser sucks for quoting or maybe i suck  anyway thanks for the response so in return ill try to return the favor herei was thinking about your ideas and i think youre on the right track how about something like a new mission base for characters of nefarious interests such as missions for particular individuals living out of these stations i would prefer the station managers themselves with huge cash bounties and special single station bonuses as opposed to lps and security increases maybe even give them a negative security status requirement so as to prove to said boss that you arent a concord spy or whatnot and although i do see where youre going with mob bosses i have to still disagree mob bosses usually dont stabilize the regions ie mexico is not stable although that is a little what i think lowsec should be like we need to give the playerbase a legitimate reason why its there where is lowsec not high sec please bear in mind were talking immersion and rp here not mechanics i think giving lowsec more of a story to it will actually get more players involved anyway keep it up the more you hash this out with your critics the better your ideas get
heres another brainstorming idea it would be sweet if there were hidden stations in the middle of distant asteroid fields or somesuch that had to be scanned out theyd be pirate stations and you could only dock in them if you had low security status to keep out concord of course thats where youd find pirate agents and theyd give missions to attract the isk lovers lp rewards could be enhanced booster blueprints smuggling ships maybe a skillbook that makes wardeccing cheaper so on and so forth
somewhere in the depths of this thread is that very possibility pirate stations that have to be probed down to find there you would find the pirate mission agents and the black market pannellowsec pirate missions might send you into hisec with a timer that allows a certain objective to be attained without concord getting you or somesuch mission but as a control any deviation from the mission track gets concords attention so you couldnt warp to a station etc if your sec is too lowi will adjust the main post to rflect this possibility
im simply astonished someone thought that the removal of custom folders was a good ideawhat possible benefit does the removal of custom folders haveplease explain how we are to track the activity and movements of a player with several characters in different alliances andor corporations effectively without custom foldershow are we to at a glance ascertain whether a particular group of players is active do you expect people to trawl through largely unsorted collections of hundreds of contactsthis is going to hit mercenaries and wardec corporations hard adds nothing to the game only subtracts and complicates what is a vital intelligence tool that was available to playerseditpeople are now telling me in npc corp chat that they have just reset all standings they find the new system so useless they are having to set only a single corpalliance red at once
yeah this was incredibly stupid
trying to make noise about this before tyrannis resulted in tears from the fanboizthe csm cannot and will not be able to helpccp knew long before deployment this was wilful destruction and they got ccp prismx to just troll us instead of listeningthe contact list appears to be a tool for 00 space only now and i doubt its even any good for that
why the  did you remove vital functionality from your ui seriously what the  were you thinking
this is even worse than i expectedjust logged in all the individuals i set red are in one huge amorphous mass rather than in ordered custom folders denoting corp and known associationsthe new system is counter intuitive and not nearly as informative as the olddonotlikereally think of a few choice curse words i dont think highly of you tonight ccp this was not needed this has not improved the game
thank you i had all my contacts sorted into corp folders needless to say the number has grown quite abit over the timei cant believe it  still desperately hoping for a secret enable folderview button i just havent found yet
add 10 through 10 standings and im 100 suport
confirming that this lack of folders sucks hard what were you thinking ccp please give us the old contact list or at least folders again
finally my lack of friends has an upside
yup that and the ability to increase the perpage display count in evegateeven with olders its not that uncommon to have 3040 chars in the same group eg one set of war targets but to then have to page through these 10 at a time is just gah have fun trying to massremove people from your list once theyre not longer necessary to have in your contact list select all delete yes select all delete yes seleffs just let me nuke everyone at oncethis is made even worse since theres no way to sort these people into foldersyay i have three different groups of wts and four alt corps to keep track of and now were no longer at war with two of those sure i can filter some stuff out but its still a matter of doing it 10 at a time figuring out for each page whether they should go or not and not being able to masszap people who are no longer relevant to keep track of
fix it plz
i agree 100 with opgive us arbitrary contact grouping back
i used to monitor people buying and selling things via contracts by keep them as contacts it was so nice and tidy now theyre all just in my contacts listboo
useless broken and unworkablecurrent implementation is garbage
i just manually deleted all standings on this character im not dealing with this mess thankfully i dont need standings to stationtrade i have a notebook and a pencil to hand that i use for generating ballpark figures for potential profit etcguess i am now using that to keep track of potential competitors gg ccp
it doesnt affect me much but i find its lack disturbing also i recognize the usability of that feature so i agree with op 100however i really like that expansion pi just rocks
totally retarded thanks ccp
contact in address book before patch 400 past and future targets neatly ordered in per corp folders lets get real the address book was always used to keep a watch on enemies never to track friends by 90 of the eve populationcontact in address book now  0 no bug here i deleted them myself as contacts without ordering attached are completely uselesscongrats ccp youve outdone yourself here i guess in your rl address book the cutie you met in that club while drunk is next to the headhunter that wanted you for a nice job i hope you wont make any mistake this could get seriously wrong seriously quick hereedited to support those wonderful forums preview function unchecked it
i m game with this one sounds good
this sounds good at first glance but people dont need another reason to go after pve fit ratters and miners in 00 they are already significant targets and people get enough just out of the kms what stops them going after them is the liklihood of getting ganked themselves and the lack of targets due to good intelligence being passed to the ratters and carebearsyou need to think through the proposal properly and consider the true problem and how people might twist the mechanic ive been in 00 for a couple of months now and ive found one of the more irritating things to happen is where reds come into your system cloak up and go afk it makes it difficult to rat or mine you dont know what they are in or what backup they have it ties down a lot of players with a boring game experience trying to fruitlessly hunt them down or just being there on standby or you take a chance and risk it with inadequate backup after waiting ages for them to leave why do people do this at the moment just to spoil peoples game i think now you want to give people a reason to employ this routinely as it surely would beultimately this wont improve small gang warfare it will just harm 00 ratting and mining improving small gang warfare requires improving the safety of small gangs in enemy space by for example increasing the number of gates per system and the number of routes that small gangs can take in and out or encouraging the splitting up of large blobs by requiring multiple objectives to be siezed and held in surrounding systemsi would have suggested adding something to just dissuade people from massive blobbing but ccp tried adding massive lag and yet people still dont get it
100 agree
would be a great additionnow if only my modules would stop cycling
i suggest that the ability to hotkey more common commands examples include but not limited tosell itemdisplay market valuefit to current shipunfit modopen containerthis seems to me a simple change that could be done very easily
yes please would love keys for view market details for next order would work through the list of buysell orders in your wallet modify selected orderthe only reason i dont trade more often is because of the shoddy ui some hotkeys would be a nice start for improving it
im all for anything that makes us less dependant on the mouse while playing
hotkeys are good
well it was some time agoit may be more simplier nowand it cost nothing to say them we really want itthats a new market using existing things so its a good idea
i agree with this sentiment we can at least ask its been by my count 2 years since csm 1 and while i doubt the code has gotten simpler it does tie into the put more of the market into player hands manifesto
yes very very good idea
do want
the ui as a whole needs work but this one definately is one of the most frustrating parts of it

fix factional warfarewith 14 fwrelated issues raised by the csm in the past and almost all of these issues still being relevant it is time to discuss the future of factional warfare and propose a realistic approach to improve the future of this aspect of the gamewhy is factional warfare worthy of devtimefactional warfare acts as a bridge between playstyles and fulfills a niche pvp role within the game individual players can easily contribute and participating does not require a large investment in ships due to this low barrier to entry it provides a casual way for new players and carebears alike to get introduced to pvp and lose their fear of low security spacefactional warfare is not just beneficial for individual players it is a great platform for corporations as well soloplayers engaging in fw will quickly find and join fwrelated corporations corporations that tire of their playstyle often find the casual pvp of fw a nice temporary activity before moving on to another area of the gameshort term improvementsthese are relatively small issues in urgent need of improvement which will dramatically increase fw playability and enjoyment currently fw is broken at the core fixing these issues will provide a stable foundation to build on bug and exploit fixes detailed list will be provided to ccp encouraging pvp in fw missions and complexes balancing fwrelated npcs in missions and complexes fixing the complex spawn system to make complexes spawn at all times during the daymid term improvementsthese issues require some more commitment from ccp and help retain player interest in fw over longer periods of time running fwrelated live events fix above issues first adding ways for players to know when systems are being contested letting players find and fight eachother roleplayingalliances joining fwlong term improvementsthese improvements require considerable devtime some of these were originally on the table when fw was designed but never made it ingame these improvements expand on the foundation fw has laid and make fw appeal to more players and have more meaningful consequences in the game add more ways to contest space add pvprelated missions add consequences to system occupancy tie more playstyles into the fw system integrate pirate factions into fwyour input welcomeplease provide any issues i should add to the list or any arguments you believe i could use to convince ccp to finally commit to improving fw
good proposal fw has certainly been out long enough to qualify for version 20i feel that fw is missing the meaningful part of pvp sure you can take over a system mainly with intys orbiting a beacon at 10km apparently and you get what enemies can still dock there you dont get system upgrades or anything i love fw but most of the time you are hanging around a very few systems and the militias just try to gank each other i would also love to see a pirate fw faction that only accepts 100 members is at war with all the other militias even themselves but gets cheaper pirate ships from the lp store
i will support this if adding pirate factions is a priority
thanks ankh supported with all my chars at least emo tj has the decency to actually give ideas pso really i am supporting a thread that wants ideas
i dont have any experience in fw though ive always toyed around with the idea my biggest concern to convince me to join is having enough roleplayers and the support of capital fleets in lowsec being honest here im training up for dreadnought and possibly carrier down the road and would obviously want a home should i want to go into fw what i dont want is to be in there and then not see other capitals and it just be one big blob against new players it doesnt sound fun or fair for anyonealso id like to see more ideas on perhaps introducing more roleplaying to fw at the moment i really enjoy the pirate militias idea i recall seeing that mentioned in the 09 fanfest fw video sounds good for a first step in roleplaying and also i could see some great warfare come out of thatwhat are your thoughts on using capitals in fwps congratulations on the election
i dont take part in the fw however i can see its importance to the game and storyline and im glad someone capable is representing this
just as a police officer cannot handle a case against himor his relatives and close friends for that matter a gm should never be tasked with handling a complaint against them it may be described as unethical but i think more accurately it is a conflict of interestwell being of the gameplayer vs his own selfinterest
i have little to no confidence in gms or ccp t20 scandal from various encounters and this certainly isnt helping
supportedplease take a look at the hardener as well it cant be that the only advantage of faction stuff is to have lower cpu why does ie have a t2 kinetic hardener the same effect as the faction one
more valuable input op changed againplease guys traders need these changes and the more you support the more we get noticedeach of these changes require very little codingtesting regardsana
i hope this happens
hi there fellow capsuleersid like to draw your attention to the problem of sentry aggro mechanics for remote repping in lowsec especially where logistics are concernedlook at this examplelets say i am in a corp which is an fw member and organizes an rr bs gang our gang contains at least one member with outlaw security status we encounter a gang of wartargets and fight them at a gate the hostiles primary the outlaw so everybody starts repping him although we are only fighting wartargets everyone who activated an rr module gets a gcc and is shot by gate guns ok that mechanic may not make much sense but 350 dps shouldnt be too bad for a bs gang so except for some drones not much will die from sentry fire the situation becomes worse if we have say a bc gang supported by a single scimitar in that case the scimi will have a gcc in basically every fight and it will be the only ship with a gcc so the sentry guns will focus it forcing it to warp off eventually leaving the rest of the gang to its fate if gang mates want to share sentry aggro they will have to do stupid things like shooting the gate this is not only absurd but really really annoying for anyone who has ever tried to be a logistig pilot in a small gang of pirates even if youre fighting people that youre allowed to shoot at the logistic ship will get a gccso my proposal isremote repping or any other kind of remote support outlaws should not cause a gcc on the repper however if he reps someone who has a gcc he will still get oneplease discuss
what you describe was the initial mechanic they changed it for wrong reasons but will never admit so
yes most people are critically affected by a missing subsystem cosmos agents faction warfare most people live in highsec the sov warfare problems most people live in highsec broken ships that arent used and yet shipweapon balance is still pretty damn goodso that leaves the ui design yeah sure  redesign the ui but in reality this is probably a big enough thing to be its own expansionliang
so as long as few people use it a feature does not have to be finished or polished isnt that a very backwards way of determining the usefulness of a feature or are you saying that even if cosmos or fw were to be complete it would not make an impact on the majority of playersbalance is pretty good when it comes to the ships that are actually used in a game that heavily rely on non consensual pvp all ships should be ok to use and not as today where a portion is broken beyond comparability
ive got an even better idea than using the winter patch to finish unfinished content stop all future expansions until the content in existing expansions is finished and major bugs fixedto witfix lag againfinish cosmos faction warfare dominion tyrannis add the missing subsystemrebalance rails rockets assault frigates ewar frigs and largely unused ships bellicose anyonefix station gamesfully implement epic mission arcsonce all this is done expansions should focus on the followingmaking missions and pve actually enjoyable if this is even possiblemaking lowsec worthwhilecompletely redesign the ui literally burn down the existing structure and start over from scratch the new one should be modular and moddableredesign poses and make pi something more interesting than poses on planetsuntil these problems are fixed we simply do not need any further new content especially the kind of halffinished junk that ccp has been foisting on us for yearsi have said before and will say again ccp runs the risk of being annihilated should another company with sounder design development and management methodology and a commitment to high quality decide to implement an evestyle pvp sandbox
this is the main problem i see with evesince dominion eve has been standing still ccp starts massive projects but never completes any while there is no doubt that shiny trailers and bold plans draw in new players and cause current players to subscribe a few more months it is not a strategy that works in the long run a collapse will occur sooner or laterdoom and gloom whythe problems are actually quite comparable to those in the financial world ccp announces features launches them as a framework and then promises to expand on them nothing wrong there however smart financial managers realized something the subscriber base grows with every new expansion but when releasing an expansion that contains only fixes and no new content they do not gain any subscribers nor much kudos from the players thus why work on old content especially if it has been recently introduced in a shabby state when you can hype the new big featurethere are two major problems with this line of thoughtthe first one is debt by introducing an unfinished expansion and promising to have devs remain on this feature ccp basically builds debt it is an ioufortheseshinyfeatures they have to pay monthly manhours to complete the features and since there will be unforseen issues there will be interest as well ccp continuously miscalculates the monthly payoff in devtime thus progress is slower than usual and player interest in the new shiny feature starts dropping after a few months ccps reaction look finishing this feature will not impact many players this monthly devtime is not paying off lets reassign these devs to do something more productive ccp defaults on the debt and the feature remains in a broken state worse than that defaulting costs ccps credit rating by defaulting player goodwill is lost and the next time less players are going to accept an iouthe second one is that eve is currently a big player in the space mmo market it is quite unique and revolutionary but will it remain so if expansion continue to be released as they are unfinished features do not count towards the game this means that from empyrean age onwards eve has practically been standing still ccps business model only works where they are the sole player in their niche will ccps business model still work when there are four competitors in their pond the old republic jumpgate evolution black prophecy infinity will eve still be as revolutionary then will eves unique selling points outweigh all its flaws
i would venture to guess that while most live in hisec its not a vast majority when you take alts out of the equationmany reasons why lowsec and nullsec are under populated are because the features designed to bring people out there are unfinished and need workthats like saying youre too sick to go see a doctor
need for speed is ccps catchall for fixes to the catchall term players use lag because lag is not the correct term for 90 of the problems players term lagthe fixes for the ui is a wall of text they have made a lot of fixes it is still broken but theyre getting closerfactionsov warfare is screwy better than it used to be but still needs work i believe pi is part of the fix towards this so you might say the centerpiece of this expansion is part of a giant fix for factionsov warfarecosmos agents the low use of cosmos missions is more due to their fixed position in low sec systems making them prime targets for pirates i think this is by designwhat ships are completely broken i cant think of a ship in the game right now that doesnt function fairly well in a role assault frigates are good mission runners when you want to grind standing sure that might not be what people want them to be used for but they are great in that role destroyers work well for killing off incoming tacklers this is why the other fleet will kill them early on sure everyone wants them to have more tank and various other things so they arent a suicide ship i cant think of any other ships that are bad enough to be called broken by playerswhat is this missing subsystem nonsense what part do you want to add to a t3 an i win button t3 are dangerously close to already having that i fly one and feel guilty about how easily it sidesteps even the most elaborate traps set to catch it
just one man they could work for 2 years on this list and it would truly make eve a better game
its already been said elsewhere from a good source the reason the ui is hardly changed is that the art department has put its foot down on the look of the ui and wont budgefaction warfare is pointless even the lolrpers are getting tired of it pi is not meant to do anythin with fw its to substain dusties and give reasons to fighttheyre few and far between they are fixed they are shallow and overall most dont even botherany rocket ship with the exception of the heretic is essentially broken because of the weapons the hawk and vengence are completely broken as they have no actual useful bonuses which makes them almost as broken as black ops which are broken most black ops are fitted with the followingimproved cloakcovert cynojump portalcargo expandersthats all they are good for a pigships that are broken caldari rail platforms blaster setups on gallente ships the hel nid pilgrim deimos and crow to name a fewon to your t3 comment t3 in many setups are overpowered that is a balance issue that shows that more work needs to be done to improve themjust because a ship isnt useless does not mean theyre good part of devoting time to ship balancing also involves looking into nerfsthe 5th subsystem was promised by ccp the entire time and if balanced than it isnt like it makes it more overpowered they just need to adjust the drawbacksoh and the legion is nowhere near overpowered
wows warden doesnt workas someone who actually goes out and farms my own mats in that game im very much aware of how prevalent botting is in wow and how little is being done about it from the number of bots i keep running into and those accounts being allowed to bot for months even after multiple reports to gms from several playersif you attempt to scan for a program the bot program writers will just write a new program to route around yours and the kind of people who run bots are happier giving those programs higher security priviledges than regular game players are to their games and no im not a wow carebear im a dirty twinking b tUFFFDil
its all bull the only way is the same as they did with isk sellers if u cant beat them join themmake a t2 mining ship that auto mines same as a macro minerit dosnt matter what happens to the mineral price short term it will level offmost off the macro miners and peeps who do macro that iv met in game are low sec but most off the moaning seames to come from low sec is this just a smoke screen or a troll
quilty eh sorry i just really liked that 
you give all dutch people a bad name but ill support you if you enable carrier usage in hisecon a more serious note stay out of everything 4 and below your ideas are horrible
i never had a problem using my chimera in hisec
voting for ankh delivers all i wanted  pvp toughguys crying on the forums like noobs bing about learning skills

not sure if this has been brought up before it probably has as imo its a good ideahigh seclow sec consensual pvp arenas 1v1 2v2 4v4 you dock in the station speak to an agent under a new tab consensual pvp maybe these agents can be put into a couple of systems per regiontab opens up 1v1 2v2 4v4 you can get your mates to come along or recruit people from local once your and the opposition fleet is full you are loaded into an instance in the system or given a bookmark to warp toobviously ccp will have to do extra work so that neutrals dont get involved and people cant be added to fleet and warped to the instance players can put isk down winners take the isk or place mods down what you guys think
they have its called jet cansput 1 unit of ammo in there and get the other guy to take it allow him to do the same fight 2v2 and 4v4 would require more logistics but its still possible
what you are thinking of is an arenaif ccp did put on in the game then they would have to follow normal pvp rules and prolly make it so that outsiders can watch but not interfer via gank or reps
um why do you even need this in low sec just find a quiet area of space or a wh and start blasting each other
hes talking about a controlled fight not a gank off so called pvprs killing peeps with no or less skills than they haveit woud be good to have an arena to fight without the possibilty of other griefers interfearingif ccp realy want to fill 00 with players a training ground for the less able players to learn the skill to fit and fight would be realy usefullim an indi player and have limmited skills at fighting but would use said facility a lot to learn other skills
an arena basically yes i would like this i feel this would improve the game people who think this will ruin real pvp just dont have anything real worth fighting for
most 00 alliances have training corps some low sec corpsalliances have training programs slugging it out in a controlled arena would not be a good training tool for fighting in uncontrolled settings these ganks others in this thread are talking about are nothing more than someone realizing theyre holding the short end of the stick in a fight eve is an mmo you are supposed to fly with people complaining about losing a raven iteron whatever when flying through low sec is the way the game is supposed to work bigger is not better that is a core tenant in eve that people struggle to learn
i think i know what shubs is getting at let me see if i can refine the proposal a bitthe stealingfromjetcans method flags both participants to each others entire corporation which allows for too much possibility for interference in whats supposed to be a controlled fighti propose a mechanic by which two individuals or fleets can challenge each other to a duel in highseclowsec space1 one pilot in space rightclicks another pilot in space in the same solar system and from the context menu selects challenge to duel or if the issuer is a fleet commander or fleet boss challenge to fleet duel2 the recipient gets a popup with the options decline accept for self and if also a fleet commander or fleet boss accept for fleet3 once accepted a confirmation window appears for both sides that states the number of ships but not names or classe on each side of the duel present in the solar system when the duel was confirmed if both sides confirm the duel then both sides are flagged to each other for dueling which will be different for being flagged for aggressionanyone can still attempt to help or hinder an active duel participant but this then becomes a criminal act of some sort might consist of being legally shot by everyone andor a security status loss concordokken may or may not be too extreme if a nonduelist is just remote repairing a duelist i dont knowas duelists either dock up leave system go into a disconnectlogoff emergency warp or lose their ships their legal participation in the duel ends the last side standing that is to still have any intact ships remaining in space or the first side to have all their remaining ships in space be uncloaked not warping and not shot at for the past three minutes is the winner of bragging rights this second condition is to prevent someone from winning a duel by cloaking up at a safespot and waiting for the other side to get bored it may need to be tweakedno persistent flags for theft no security status loss no concord intervention no waiting for a war declaration if both sides are itching for a fight right now
i like
any pure pvper would argue this is against the sandbox nature of eve
this dumb suggestion is brought up every few months and it gets the same answer every single time
nogo to lowsec go to 00 use can aggression use mutual wardecsthere is no need for pvp arenas for you to have organized consensual pvp
i dont agree with the above statement but to make posts like this stop happening i would like to suggest something thats currently used on the test server simply make a warp to point next to the largest trade hub of each race and it would have ffa1 free for allanyone fights anyone and one for consentual combat people would still have to warp to the spots and drop cans etc or it could be like 00 within a 70km radius or something however it was implemented it would basically give people a place to meet and preferably let them take it from there currently on sisi fdlmj is full of such sites
double post from lag
hello csm and fellow eve playersin the wake of the patch notes being released for tyrannis there has been alot of complaints about the default privacy settings for evegate and i think it is actually a symptom of a much larger underlying problematic tendency in the development and evolution of eve online the trend has been with every patch and expansion to grant more and more visibility into every aspect of the game from the apis to simple added search functionality in the clientlets have a look at what i can find out about your character by simply clicking in the eve client race sex bloodline security status character creation date corporation membership alliance membership employment history of every corporation you have ever flown with standings to npc factions corporations and agents so i know where you do your lvl 4s and 5s every contract that your character has ever accepted so yes i know about your officer fitted faction battleship every contract you character has ever created so i can learn something from what you sell about how you make isk i can even talk to an agent and find out what system you are in right nowthen there are all the things i can find out about your corporation and alliance where you are based your numbers what wars you are involved etc on top of that we have these nice apis that allow us to monitor our characters with evemon and import our skillset into eft these apis are also being used against our privacy there are very few corporations today that do not ask for your either your limited or full api keys when you apply giving them access to pretty much everthing there is to know about your charactersand today we get evegatewhen i started playing eve we had the escrow system which was where people traded anything that couldnt be sold on the market the escrow system was regionally based and the interface was not very intuitive read nearly impossible to navigate the upside to this system however was that if one flew around space for a while you could actually find some good deals because it was not immediately visible to everyone what the current median price in all regions of a republic fleet warp disruptor was there was a good chance to get a better deal on one in the minmatar regions than in for instance domain dont get me wrong im not wishing for the escrow system back contracts was a big step forward in user friendliness but i would perhaps argue that it would be better with a regional limit for searching contracts that is just touching on one of the in my opinion negative side effects of the unrestricted access to information why should i have the ability to see every business transaction another character has ever made why should i be able to see which npc corporations and agents he does missions formy point is that i dont think the game necessarily benefits from everyone knowing everything about everyone else the world becomes smaller when you can search everything globally in a matter of seconds and while that can sometimes be a good thing in real life in a game world it potentially just makes for less of a game what we have to ask is this is there a reason for this continued disclosure of information about everyone and everything and does the game actually benefit from itany thoughtsargyle jones
so your complaint about evegate is that everyone on default can see everyone elses friend list because i dont see where you listed a complaint about evegate other than saying and today we get evegate like that needed no explanation your complaints centered around two things in game that have existed for years show pilot info and pilot contract history are those the things you are complaining about or did you have a complaint about evegate
im not complaining about anything least of all the evegate i am raising as a point of discussion whether it would be a good idea to look at what sort of character and world information should be publicly accessible to all players and whether it should be globally accessible or only locally to solar system  constellation  region the above example with the escrow versus contracts system is just one of many such things as another example lets say i am considering declaring war on your corporation so i go to show info on your corp and can immedaitely see where your hq is and how many members you have regardless of where i am in eve and regardless of my standings to you if i know the names of some of the characters in your corporation i can see where you do your missions and where you tend to do your contracts should that information be available to me anywhere at any time without restrictionsome possible ways of restricting access to character corp and world information could be localization so in order to find out about your corporation i would have to go to a station where you have an office or a system where you have sovereignty skill restriction so i would have to train a skill corporate business and human intelligence etc to increase my search range or functionality skill restriction as a ceo or security officer in a corp i could train skills infosec hehe that would obfuscate information about my character  corp standing restriction if you set bad standings on me i have less acecss to information about your character or corpso yeah dont get me wrong im not complaining that we get evegate i welcome the new initiative i just think that we and ccp need to have a discussion about the access to information in eve especially because we are now getting evegate and information is about to become even more accessible it seems like ccps policy for the past few years has been to just make everything visible and accessible to everyone without fully understading the impact that this has on the game worldargyle jones
we live in a time way before eve is portrayed as occuring with technology far inferior to that portrayed in eve if you know the name of a personcompanyorganization you can google it and get tons of information about them usually i think this is what eve is trying to portray the big difference is that people can meta game the system in eve which is the counter to the basic information gathering you speak ofagain meta gaming is the counter corps that list their hq as their actual base of operations are either incredibly confident or naive finding the names of characters in a corp isnt some simple thing it requires a lot of work you likely cannot find where an individual does missions unless they are grinding a single npc corporation contracts tend to be spread out all over the place however for someone not savvy with the system just like all meta gaming they can be giving out more information than they mean toi guess the point is that information gathering and deception is espionage both sides are alive and well in the game if you dont believe me you are welcome to try to find accurate information on the corp im in as an example

by far not all corps require api
interesting thread its something id like to see get some dev loveof particular concern to me is the api there is no list on the api page to tell players exactly what information can be read by the api and a lot of people give it out without understanding its implications espionage and metagaming is one of the things that makes eve special i dont do it myself because id feel hollow making friends with someone i intended to stab in the back but looking at goons bob and a myriad of other wars it could be classified as the single most powerful weapon in eve with that in mind its surprising that more hasnt been done to facilitate wars of intelligence and counter intelligenceone of the biggest ways to protect information is to spread misinformation so a few tools for spreading bull fertilizer could make life interestingkillboard alts an option whereby your killmails appear on the character sheet of an alt on the same account this could be used in espionage by creating a false identity as a pvper or in counter espionage by hiding the identity of your main on killmailsapi privacy options seriously i should be able to let someone see my skills and kills without giving them access to my wallet info api is seriously flawedcharacter history stuff like faction standings and contract history can be valuable information so why in a universe full of scumbags are we giving it away for free theres a whole mini profession waiting to be created by only giving this information to people who have sufficient standings with the relevant brokersagentsstandings bias why would a matari locator agent give information on someone who has high standings with that faction it would be fun if the agent sometimes gave false information and then warned the target that player xxxx was trying to gather information on themthose ideas are off the top of my head so theres no doubt flaws but i thought id chuck my 002 isk in to the thread
how about these then your ship is blown up 20 minutes later i pass by click on the wreck and i can see that it was your ship you deploy a jetcan somewhere i click the can and i can see that you were the one deploying it you anchor a pos youre not at the pos but i can still just right click on it show info and see that it belongs to your corp you pilot your internet spaceship into a new solar system and immediately everyone is made aware of your presence your corp is at war with my corp i add you to my buddy list without your consent and can now see by a little green marker whenever you are onlineeve is just overflowing with information freely accessible to anyone who cares to look if corporations and governments of our own world were equally careless with their information we would all be playing the diablo iii alpha right now only taking a break to read the latest and not yet published harry potter novel then watch the news and see a reporter listing all the cia safehouses in the middleeast on public televisionargyle jones
this is a game not real life privacy concerns do exist but not at nearly the same level that they do in meatspace if im going to worry about privacy settings anywhere itd be on facebook not spacebook
look at you and your meta gaming self you are listing a bunch of pvp characters though not sure how this would help other than to know you need to run if you see one enter local i have heard that people lie on killboards call me crazy but they tend to not be a very accurate representation of realityagain someone searching for information can meta game to find it someone trying to protect their information can easily put out piles of otherfalse information to obfuscate reality this is the way it works in reality as well as evethese two i will agree wholeheartedly with you on these need to be fixed
stop typing in all caps you moronoh i added a new item to the list too
supported
thank you gentlemen
however now that you have been reelected i hope you will support a wardec and bounty hunting reformreform by the way not nerf not removal not cripplingthe current wardec system is a joke the bounty system is so bad that it isnt even funny textwall incoming soon
having been welltrained by virtuozzo i am looking forward to your wot
this proposal shall address two issues the highly debated cloak system and the lack of support for destroyersnew role the proposed t2 destroyer will act as an anticloak and frigate boat with higher resists and increased powergridcpu to allow for more fitting opportunities and higher potential damage output than the t1 varianthow does workit uses a module in the high slot much like a bomber that launches a nondamaging depth charge this depth charge is fired in a spread pattern to the rear of the ship and explodes as an area of effect from the ship itself and decloaks enemy nonfleet ships within that set range eg an aoe of 20 km or smaller it should be minimal enough for it to work but not large enough to be overpoweredwhat things should be changed in regard to cloakships within fleet should be able to fly together without decloaking one another they cannot see each other and they cannot see other enemy cloaked ships afk cloaking should remain the same since this new addition is meant to search for the enemywhy does the depth charge not deal any damagethe goal is to reveal the enemy not destroy them like a spamming stealth bomber we dont want to take away from what was already given to the stealth bomber yes historically the depth charge was an offensive weapon however we want to use this to only reveal in order to discourage overuse and fairness for both parties cloaked ships already have the opportunity to make a decision once this t2 destroyer flies on gridwhat about afk cloaking and locali see no reason to change an unbroken mechanic in that means because being afk and terrorizing the enemy is still allowed and always encouraged removing local could have beneficial and also incredibly disastrous results for everyone and i would see no need to change itwhy a destroyeri chose destroyer because it needs a little love at the moment right now we have more frigate and cruiser platforms than the destroyer and the destroyer is rather limited in what it can currently do ideally it was created as an antifrigate platform and was merely an upgunned frigate much like a battlecruiser is to a cruiser and thus should reflect that historically the destroyer was used both as an escort for convoys and to eliminate small surface and subsurface contacts in this case frigates destroyers and cloaked shipshow is this prevented from being overusedsince it is a t2 ship you will undoubtedly be slowed by training time and the depth charge launcher module can only be used on this particular ship probing has been proposed in the past however it was noted by ccp that this was impossible to do so since the game considered the cloaked ship out of existence and to change that would allow for potential exploits and scriptingmuch like a covert ops ship this t2 destroyer isnt a necessity but is a convenience for anyone who chooses to use it and thus isnt required to bring along in fleet engagements it will negatively affect any cloaking ships that choose to disregard their own safety like sitting too close to a celestial object or a stargate this allows a party to have the opportunity to decloak a ship however it isnt guaranteed to work cloaking mechanics aside from friendly fleet bumping remains unchanged and cloaked ships still have the same opportunities they had before
same idea has been proposed several times before already
in regards to a new t2 destroyer absolutely howevernew module and combat tactic ideas  medium assault shiptrue t2 destroyersboomer class tech 2 destroyer sbnew t2 destroyera converted assault destroyer weird grappling beams and ramming using probes and another stealth bomber are not what im proposing
i have personally brought up the depth charge idea its somewhere in my post history
your first and most major flaw  smart area of effectit either decloaks everyone or nobodybut then again the idea is stupid to begin with  let me just give you an exampleyou run your resupplies in your little viator through 00 to your home system suddenly a gate camp on the ingate as normal you use you cloak and pulse the mwd to get out of the bubble and warp but bam  the decloak module fires your cloak drops the ceptor tackles you and you are toastskills required by them almost 0 chance of your survival also almost 0 chance of them farming kills close to 100 without the module i would give you about 23 chance of getting out and 13 to them to get the kill if they got fastsmart ceptor pilotswe really dont need to buff gatebubble camping more and your training time argument is kind of irrelevant  it is a one time gap once you got the skill everyone and their mother will have 23 of those decloakers in their roaming gangsand xtover is right this idea is not new at allthat said  not supported
so apparently if you have a double space in your alliance name your punished with a random alliance1432431341234 for a name ruining everythingput it back ccp
aww i wanted to name my alliance that 
yes
sorry ccp nerfed bacon several years ago i dont see them changing their minds now
we demand bacon
supporti luvs the bacon
well hell ya i want some bacon
did you know that 10 the rich of the population pay 68 of the taxes in the usyet people who make less money still insist on taking more from them even though they pay lesswhy does that transfer into eve where bpo producers who work hard to earn their isk and use it to buy super expensive bpos to allow us to have quality ship fittings at a cheaper price yet the ones who happen to make less isk complain that they arent in the same boat when they have not done as much to get do the same expect the in game governmentccp to take from the richer players and spread what they have to others so they can feel equal in game and make similar amounts for less the workwe do not need socialism in eve its a capitalist type economy and if some 10 year old is off in a distant solar system in some version of a sweat hangar working his fingers to the bone for pennies to allow me to have cheaper costing ships and fittings so i can go warring and pirating to kill innocent players who dont know any better and other skilled pilots for alot less isk then i for one say dont touch a darn thing  also tell that kid to work faster  inflation is raising prices and if he doesnt put out faster tell him he will get a pay cut
duel or triple rep myrm can have an absolute beast of a tank you get jumped on a gate just dont agress and run back to the gate myrms are slow especially when webbed but unless its a big camp you should be able to get back to the gate ok and ofc the agressors then wont be able to jump through after you or if its low sec and your tank is holding just point them and watch as the glorious gate guns of much victory give you some free kills this is dependant on you being pvp fit of course if you arent then dont cry emo tears if you get popped in low sec if you dont want thugs then low sec really isnt a place you want to travel to
the eve store sucks the products are scarce its like going to a covience store in the ghetto and all the stuff is expired and dusty and you know its really a front for a drug operation anyways back on topicthe shirts needs more variety there is about 4 shirts totalthe hats suckthe accessories what accessoriesthe ship models no scale and 1 picture per needs a jerkoff dev holding the model up in the picturedid i mention there isnt anything being sold in the eve store
so what am i considering my support on
i know its been brought up before i dont care get ccp to revert back to the old cynosural field graphic its so much better then the crap one we have atm
i think they have in the new expansion i recall reading it in the patch notes may be wrong
ERROR
full results can now be read in this dev blog
none of that is proof1 its marketting not pr pr was when hilmar promised a solution to the t20 problem in the new york times marketing is the csm2 ccp developed eve long before the csm they never wanted us to have3 i see youre in line for a free holiday and your bias couldnt be more obvious therefore4 thats why you think any of that is proof of anything which it absolutely is notcan the lies please stopyour ridiculous attempt at providing proof has missed out the following important issues that do not suit your new free holiday1 ccp never mentioned anything about csms until they got caught sponsoring cheating by a whistleblower who got banned2 ccp promised a strong independent csm that could and would ensure t20 could never happen again3 ccp introduced a weak marketing exercise called the csm and promised at release that it will never be able to force ccp into any action at all ever under any circumstances4 ccp have developed and continue to develop eve online without regard for what the csm has to say which is how it should bethus far the only thing we can say with absolute certainty about the csm is that is has actually enabled key people to cheat ironically the opposite of what we were originally told it would be forand before you start crying you seem to be good at internet searching but maybe now is a good time to start practising looking up information you dont like
i would like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all of the successful candidates in the csm electionsit was a very enlightening process and i would salute those candidates who put a lot of effort into their campaign win or lose and those rose above the mudslinging to provide interesting debate i may not be flying to iceland on someone elses dollar anyway but i hope i can help in some way with the csm process regardless good luck guys 
did i mention yet that you are wrong on several points no because you sure as hell are but dont let that change your view of thingsplease visit your user settings to reenable images
it used to be the first to say troll wins now it is attempted that the first person who says hater winsin reality both have always been capitulation thanks for conceding you could have done it in a way so that your less intelligent fanboiz could understand it thoughhopefully they can see itclaim victorysay haterrun like hellfeel free to look up and understand things you dont want to read try it some time it will make you more powerfulthough its certainly not a requirement to get on a plane to iceland and have long conversations about what colour toilet paper ccp should use or perhaps some topics that ccp will simply ignore anywaybye bye small fry
since you cannot be bothered to educate yourself about the topic at hand i feel no need to make any effort towards you your cheap shots at me and the csm are mere symptoms of your voluntary ignorance some people will just hate the concept of the csm which is fine in the meantime i will be trying to actually use the tools that ccp have handed us in order to improve the game for everyone contrary to ankh and her puzzle pirates i am actually relevant in eve
your assertion that i am not educated is incorrect to be honest if i had your skills and your bias i too would scream soundbites and hide from a clearly superior opponent since you have chosen that stance could you do it quietlyyou wont be improving eve at all its really that simple ccp will be improving eve youll be getting patted on the head and you will be told by your idols that you are doing really well but you wont be achieving a single thing that you will comprehendif you think different try changing something ccp dont want you anywhere near go on i know you wont ankh wont get her weird ideas implemented it simply wont happenunfortunately this tactic is entirely contractory to your blind insistence that you are now empowered you will not see your next year of utter pointlessness and failure as anything other than unlimited power to wield over eve there is plenty of counter to your bizarre assertions but until you have grown to the point where you can counter your own argument you will remain as weak as you appear todayjust keep it simple say troll say hater and walk away its pretty much all youre any use for which is ample qualification for the csmits clear you need the last word and frankly since youre part of ccps marketing machine now and i refuse to carry that role for them im the one about to be forum banned if i continue this any further youd better just take that last word and make it sizzle yeah you got a legion of csm fanboiz just waiting for you to burn the heretic publiclygo ahead small fry make me burn
le sigh wear tinfoil to fanfestor ccp might get into your head and make you think they actually mean well
after i posted the various links to what ankhs said i most definitely increased the number of people who want to gank her for being an idiot who could wind up as csm chair
ank came in second in the elections followed by dierdra vaal the 2 candidates i wanted in most made it with overwhelming support even that ol sourpuss sok made it in though barely dont think hell be able to bake his cookies now though
cough why dont you tell us whom came firstand that didnt require spamming trade hubs and evemails lying to other players about other candidates to get missionrunner panic votes and the likereally pleased the euni candidate got in thats the kind of balanced response needed on the csm that has wider views and associates with more than a monoculture of the players
look at you
i see you have already started the smear campaign for the next elections and why dont you tell us who came fourthsee i can ask pointless questions too
evacongratulations on not making chair it couldnt happen to a more deserving idioteagerly awaiting your next ed flash gameniraia
if youd look up the messages she was spamming you would find they were actually lies halftruths and scaremongering aimed at herding ignorant folk into voting for her
you are literally the worst csm ever and that includes darius im loud and drunk johnson
okay first things first everything i said was true legitimate criticism hurts huh better call it a smear campaignnow as for pointless questions you made a point of not congratulating the person that got the most votes and whom becomes chairwomanbitters muchbe magnanimous at what has been achieved and try and live with the fact someome thats obviously immoral and a real life sociopath because they pvp is the chairpredicting thread lock fairly soon
just so were clear does smear mean tell unpleasant truths about someone to you
and here are the results of the vote
we will have teadaze in csm this time to document all the amusing things ank says looking forward to the meeting minutes for this csm
and with td noone will be able to accuse us of being unfair or inaccurate in our transcripts
why would i be bitter if my 2 fav candidates got voted in with such huge support that was what i was pointing outyou asking me why i did not say who came in first is as relevant to that as asking me why i did not say what i had for lunch today that being said i would like to congratulate all elected members that includes sourpuss sok even if he is an alliance puppet
if you knew me youd realise that im probably as far away from an alliance puppet as possible i have been accused of getting in through bloc vote before so i will repeat my argument hereaaa is probably the least coherent alliance ingame when it comes to the csm elections the russian community is very tightknit so most of them will vote for korvin most of the bdci votes went to omber zombie a good part to other candidates teadaze was popular and most of the rest just doesnt give a  about the csm
im just yanking your chain m8  even if you did get in through powerbloc voting thats the way elections work rally enough ppl to vote for you
congrats on being the head of csm 5
chairmistress o7
it was simply a matter of time congrats hun and i expect to be smuggled in your luggage to ccp as discussed now go whip those devs into shape
congrats
congrats mynxeeim confident you will be awesome and give us plenty of reasons to grin from ear to earalready doing that  huggles
congratulations
gratz on the big win
ive always thought webs fit the bill better i mean the docking mechanic is supposed to be like a tractor beam webs are supposed to function in a similar fashion easy to reconcile the idea that you are preventing the station tractor beam from pulling the ship injust my two cents also congrats mynxee
thanks everyone that showed support i will not disappoint you
thank god no muppetshow
congratulations

congrats on not being elected
congratulations eve youve managed to hire the 1 person who wants to destroy your gamecampaigning on points like vote carebear and get their griefer ass banned other csm candidates want level 4 missions moved to lowsecdue to the sheer amount of outthere antipvp antieve propaganda you must wonder is ank just a troll is he actually just sitting there laughing at the fact he campaigned to turn eve into hello kitty online and wonoh god we could go on for hours but this isnt a forum to discuss this players many low points unless it gets him canned were here to discuss how to get him canned off the csm boardlet the plottingplanning begin
tbh its not that bad shell try to do the things she wants but pretty much everybody else on the csm thinks that shes a complete  all thats going to happen is shes going to be trolled and have fun poked at her until she criesi await videos please record videos
really done the research havent you
put a lot of thought and many points into your post didnt youi could have listed the many many maaaany reasons as to why the majority of eve think he shouldnt have gotten a single vote however you can just browse the many maaaany threads on here for those im not about to regurgitate them all i just wanted to give a few quick examplesanyhow im pretty sure we should be looking at his campaign trail that has probably left ccps mail servers full is it legal for a csm candidate to spam fear mongering evemails to noob carebears in order to scare them into votingwhat about other slydubious techniques like providing a link named cast your vote nothing wrong with that the link never took you to the page full of csm candidates the link was to directly cast your vote for ank yeah most smart people wouldnt have accidentally clicked accept but bundled into the eve websites login system it is fairly easy for someone to passively click accept without reading what the page saysalso seriously im pretty sure ank just trolled all of eve and ccp hes probably just waiting for his free trip to iceland before he announces it
dude start by watching the video
who is this he that ank will be taking to iceland
shes not going to get booted from the csm we get to deal with her fortunately we have a bunch of sane csms who will shoot down anything dumb she proposes and in her defence a lot of what she asks for is perfectly reasonable
just set up gank squads and kill her every time she undocks in eve instead
a csm actually playing eve heh
8 vs 1
please just stop sok i had some amount of respect for you till this csm campaignyes she can be annoying as hell and she makes some really stupid comments but alot of what she says makes sense and adding to the pve side of the game will remove nothing from the pvp side and tbh anything that makes grinding isk for pvp more fun gets a  in my bookshe got over 3k votes compared to the rest of you barely scrapping 12k apart from minxee so she must be saying something that the playerbase agrees witheveryone who plays eve has to pve at some point for iskies  well mostly  and making this more fun or less boring is a good thing not everyone pvps
which onethe one where you gives your fakes views on eveor the one where you support software pirates irl
most likely the one where it is clear that ankhesentapemkah is a she not a hefor op other than being so misinformed about basic well known fact about canidates gender the csm election is over someone you really do not think should have been elected did get elected maybe you can file a petition with gm
if this were so then the majority of eve forfitted their chance to vote for someone elsejust to be a tad clear a lot of threads about ankh were actually started by people who wanted to blackball her which in turn resulted in her increased exposure during the votesif you want to keep a certain candidate out of the high profile you dont do so by having a lot of people starting threads about this personcall it whatever you want she did manage to put up a campaign which ensured her a seat in the csm the way she might have or not have done it is a whole other matteras for people just bluntly clicking accept isnt that one thing you learn in eve to get over real fastthis last part clearly showed youre mainly hopping on a popular bandwagon in ankh bashing without even knowing what you are talking aboutatleast be a descent troll and get the gender of a csm delegate right
she got votes representing 1 of the eve subscription base i hardly think that shows that ankh is saying something that the playerbase agrees with youre extrapolating off of insufficient datathat said im curious if ankh would have made it had ccp used a more rational voting system like stv
i think soks point is not that the 8 will always gang up on the 1 just because but that if she proposes something truly stupid like jail time for criminals1 that there are 8 people who actually like the game and can play it on the csm that can easily override iton the other hand sensible suggestions concerning her very limited area of expertise can be discussed and supported just like any other im sure that she could make an excellent case that there are plenty of improvements that can be made to fw plexes for instances
malcanis uses common sense its super effective
thats the point i tried to make but it went over his head
she wants to protect the game from people like you
well as far as i can see the 1 if the playerbase cared more about who got into the csm than all those who didnt votebasicly she representes a larger chunk of voters than all but 1 currently in the csmwhen you want to extrapolate you should atleast be honest enough to say that a large part of the eve voters found her suitable for a place in the csmnext to that she is one of 9 people thereit might actually be so that csm communicate and as such come to issues to raise also voting is a right not a mandatory thing to play the game if so many people would have minded her to get in then why have only so little voted
the only reason that many bears voted for her and that they voted at all was because she spammed all the busy systems silly with lies slander and fearmongering she was going to ban all the griefers and oppose all the others who want to move lvl 4s to lowsec to name but a few slogans she used
you seem to be full of hatred is it your only concern and your only agenda of your csm candidature to spill rage and insults towards another csm who got more than 3 times the votes you gotif so and obsiously this is true you are a watse as a csm go on with that attitude and i am sure you will not make it next time
and i am 100 convinced that in your alliance nobody urged to vote for you and that you are a truthfull person with an open mind
quiet alt quiet other alt ps guys stop whining yes ankhybonkybonkers is manifestly unqualified for any role in eve more complicated than target so play the game like ccp designed it and prove your point we have altspies and locator agents for a reason
mistaken gender on the internets no wayyou throw in a harmless mistake and present it as a reason to discredit my entire post then you go and point out the obvious trying to make it seem like i didnt understand this to begin with and then tell me to do something pointlessstupiddo you work for fox news by any chanceanyhownot really see what happened was all the informed players voted for other people and ank harvested the votes from scared newbs in newb systemscarebear mission hubs if ank had not been allowed to terrorize the carebears with his fearmongering evemails hesheit probably wouldnt have even made the backup teamthat is not what im doing here before the votes finsihed i was encouraging people to vote abstain now that its all settled we can clearly see why csm is a bit of a sham i find it hard to believe even 10 of the eve population wants to ban pvpers to nullsec but ank gets to speak for 10 of evevote fraud lying in order to win your vote misleading you into clicking her vote button owell  lol i guess this is why us ended up with bush for so long ehif bashing ankh is a popular bandwagon perhaps theres reason for it i mean it couldnt possibly be all the dumb  shes said eh must be just a bunch of hooligans hating on poor little ankhand again mistaking gender on the internets ohnoes
im more concerned that a member of the csm is going to be more focused on trying to show that another member is inept rather than actually doing the job he was voted forif ank suggest something stupid it gets voted down as will any other stupid idea other people have shes not the only person to suggest something utterly idiotic during this campaign either and those people got seats too wheres the tears
the only one manifestly unqualified are you who are you anyway to make that call alt show yourself instead posting with your hateinfused troll character
quiet yet another alt
well the election results are in seems like the hate offensive did not work or even backfired as ank got more votes than ever b4 waits for etribune journalists to come and emorage about ank and her voters some more
emorage no were of course disappointed that such a manifestly unqualified and duplicitous candidate was elected but really the people who are going to be most screwed over by her election are her voters who will lack the effective representation needed to support their interests and that of the game
ankhesentapemkah is a qualified game designer
well all that came out of this ridiculous thread is the eve tribune can no longer claim to be unbiased or neutral within eve shame really
ah another person who isnt aware of editorials or political endorsements sad really but of course the tribune has never claimed we dont have bias most tribune writers would readily admit that they have a bias towards liking eve and that they want it to continue they also like how ccp designed it in general and they are happy that its a pvp based mmo and not a single player game the fact that pvp is possible in every system of the game isnt an accident nor did it just happen that ccp advertises the endgame content as combat rather than mining a really big asteroid its the reason why ccp sponsors a massive regular pvp tournament and not a lvl 4 mission jamboree its the reason why we have locator agents and war decs and why when you lose your ship you dont just get resurrection sickness and go pick up your ship and mods and go back out to fly if someone logged into a team fortress 2 server and complained that everybody else was a psychopathic virgin for shooting at them while they were playing a medic it wouldnt be an act of bias to point out that person simply didnt get it
when i got the email from ccp diagoras my first act was to check the headers to make sure my corpies werent punking mein all seriousness i was totally shocked to learn i had been elected i ran because i felt that it was important to raise awareness of some significant issues and i would have been overjoyed if i received more than a few hundred votes to get almost 1500 is truly astoundingthank you to everyone who voted for menow of course the hard work begins look for me to be very active on and off the forums helping to craft specific implementable proposals both large and small that will improve the gameps i have set up a special email address treborcsm at animeigocom for anyone to use when they want to bring csmrelated matters to my attention
2 hours till i can download the client youd better have fixed the ui and solved lag by then
didnt you vote sok
i tried but ran into a nasty case of lagfixing metalag
better luck next time matei pesonally have lost a great portion of faith in the community you must have gotten in meh
bad luck on not getting a csm spot m8 hope you stick around and try again next year
we actually got within 60 votes of being an alternate but whatevs hopefully the people that got elected will pay attention to some things we raised i think i know how to do it next time claim to fix lag and spam local

to all who voted for me thank you your support it is much appreciatedsorry i wasnt successful in getting a seat thanks again
id like to thank everyone who voted for me i cant pretend im not disappointed at the result but i promise ill attend the online meetings to try and tone down some of the terrible ideas that many of the full delegates have already put forwards as part of their platforms i feel that csm v will be a poor advocate for anyone who cares about the game and i hope that some of the more divisive elements can be neutralised quickly
good luck with that it sounds like you will need italso congrats on getting back in even though as an alt
lol i voted for you and tamber and you both came in 1 vote apart and as alternates at least the other person i voted for made it

please finally get it done ccp

in addition to the op christ no as an alternative the drone bay change seems reasonable enough though im not a fan of the second turret because its still a command ship and still ought to have a utility high to fit the warfare link i dont want it to have the same problem the astarte has in that regardspeaking of which if you want an astarte buff id like 1 high 160 pg 40 cpu would be niceeven though i know most people would just fit a medium neut  also 1 turret is a pretty big bonus especially on a ship with dual dps bonuses i dont think the absolution needs that much of a buff but a bit more drone space getting it up to harby levels is fine by me
i inflated a little but you are forgetting some stuff overheat your neutrons switch over to caldari navy am which is cheap and add a rofdmg rig and you sit pretty at just under 1000 dps flat doubleup the rigs and add a reactor control for fitting to push it over 1k yeah sure its paper thin but it goes the distance if noone primaries you for a tier 1 ship thats pretty smoking stack another 200 on for the astarte id admit barring cost id take the astarte but if someone gave me an astarte plus fittings id probably sell it off and purchase 4 harbys or 5 brutixsfor the astarte the wasted bonus is the repping amount im seriously wondering what ccp was thinking if they werent thinking its not a large hac giving it a full rack of turret slots fields werent really made either in cost or bonus to fit command links
i was assuming cn am to get 860 i tend to prefer trimark rigs to dps on most fits because dps are stacking nerfed against your magstabs which makes them fairly pointless1015 ehp  25 dps and i tend to standardize on allv skills and no overheating  since every ship gets roughly the same bonus from overheating it just makes the numbers confusing to include it as for cost efficiency yes the astarte is pretty bad in that regard but sometimes you want capability over redundancy and theres not much above command ships for capability
i did write up a few paragraphs here and just decided that i did not have enough room to continue that said i like option 3 it gives those character  players a massive bonus for spending the time training and planning their characters we get the benefit of learning skills faster over the past few years and we get one final thank you for the sp getting applied to skills to train them very fast all players now train at the same rate unless you have implants implants will become in high demand which will drive up their price in the short term new players will not be faced with useless skill training to train skillsthis allows those older characters to be able to look back and remember something else fondly or egregiously depending on your perspective ultimately ccp is a fool if they indeed ever mentioned any task and used the phrase what can we do that will not make people angry regardless the choice some will be angry some will threaten to quit some might even do just that but if a decision is to be made i think that this is a good one all new players train at the same speed as vets vets got a bonus for being here and working hard new players cant be angry about it old players should not have sold their account vets well we did our time and have to go slow like everyone else now but we were rewarded for our service
liang i can justify the gap widening because when i started a few years later than other players who had trained the skills the same thing happened to me several years down the line it isnt an issue anymore for me at all too many ppl view it as a game that you should be able to do everything fast like every other online game which is surprising to me because the main reason i like eve is because it is so radicaly different from all the othersjust my thoughts and i accept other ppl want different goals
i completely agree i am at 6 mil sps with 25 mil in learning noone told me that ccp was trying to remove them so i would be upset if they just disappeared however the proposed solution of essentially distributing the points to other skills sounds fairas a new character starting in the game i was faced with a choice have fun and learn useful skills now or sit and wait until learning trains up so i can be more useful later it was not a fun choice and it does hurt the new player experience the fast learning of the first 16 mil helps but is not nearly enough for those sphungry advanced skillsnow that i am done with about half the learning skills i am proud of them but i would be just as proud if i had that extra 25 mil sp in gunnery or spaceship command
i believe the op was considering that the 3 together would be the total solutionmax attributes that a character can have so that everyone would be equalized then all the learning skills would be removed finally the bonus sp used alreadyoften by people training using there bonus sp time would then be applied at a bonus rate equal to what was already learned
we dont make them do this you liarit really is laughable that in the very first paragraph of your attempted refutation you exactly illustrate my point in no way shape or form are new players made to sit around for any period of time doing nothing fun in the game it is only their own perception  or far more frequently the godawful advice of people like you  that leads them to do thisyou are implicitly assuming that they should do the efficient thing at the expense of fun that is the living definition of minimaxingnew players can and should be out doing fun stuff from day 1 this is perfectly compatible with training learning skills some but not all of the timei know thats a pretty complex and radical concept but once you understand it its awesomeim not even going to address your terrible restatement of the never catch up fallacy as it has been refuted so many times that i can only assume that youre trolling
original proposal supported 1your extra proposal supported too ive always considered the learning implants a huge reason people dont go pvp en masse its one thing to lose a ship but regularly losing 600 mil worth of 5 implants who can afford that yes you can always clonejump but if you have to do so every other day then its like not having them half the time after all 1
the competition was fierce but liang takes the failure at eve prize for this threadentries still open howeverbtw how do you justify me as an older player being able to fly a battleship just because i trained the battleships skill
ccp are no longer looking to remove learning skills it is true that they regretted introducing them but since ccp have introduced the skill queue neural remap and learning speed bonus and since there are so many players strongly for the use of learning skills they see no reason to do so not supported
dont give them any ideas the next proposal will be since we all pay subs why dont we have every skill maxed as standard because its an unfair advantage to only be able to fly rookie ships when we start
semantics liang is absolutely rightnobody is literally forcing anyone to not go do fun stuff yet the very existence of the learning skills will cause any reasonably sensible person to gravitate towards doing the learning skills first simple as that yes a newbie could go train battleship iv at 1320 sph sure but only an extremely shortsighted person will keep that up for very long most folks grasp that doing learning skills first so you can afterwards train at 2772 sph is probably everso slightly more efficient so only a masochist or a blithering idiot will purposely train at way too slow speedshence liang is right learning skills make you do learning first however loud you decry the fact
so paying to play a game playing in a way which offers you no fun and boring yourself out of said game ie the noob who is driven out by the learning skills story is reasonablestraw man a noob will not be training for battleships day 1 furthermore bses are so far down the line that many levels of the learning skills will actually speed it up rather than make it take longeronly a masochist or a blithering idiot will minmax at the cost of enjoyment of a game
yeah it is actually its like being in school sure its always more fun to go outside and play baseball or go to the mall and hang with your friends sooner or later most students get it though a little less fun in the now will increase it manifold laterso if you find that unreasonable then youre actually saying the learning skills system is unreasonable but within the learning skills system yes learning first is the sensible reasonable thing to do which is why it should be changedsemantics again replace battleship iv with any skill that takes longer than a few days because thats the issue nobody is gonna feel the slowtraining of say frigate i but people will feel the impact when it comes to longer skills and even when noobs will be training many short skills first their falling behind catches up with them rapidly theres just no way around it dont do learning skills and your initial fun will turn sour pretty fastif by enjoyment you mean instant gratification then yes its a good thing most people can look beyond that though which is why the learning skills are a bad thing
did you see the part where i italicised game think about thatin rl you do unfun things for a longterm benefit thats life if you do that in a game you are probably doing it wrongso noobs doing early skills who i say should train little or no learning skills will feel no loss in not having the learning skills until they start training longer skills the point at which i suggest they do the learning skills and the point at which they would start to feel the losswow i think the phrase working as intended pretty much sums that upfalling behind whatthere is no raceengage brainattempt to comprehendrace no there isthere race is nono race is thereetcalso i didnt do the learning skills straight away on any characters except dedicated research alts and the like and my fun never turned sour in fact the only people who seem to have that problem are the people who do do them straight away so stop talking false dichotomy there is a gray area between instant gratification and pure minmaxing though i wouldnt be surprised if you cant see itfurthermore you assume a scale from instant grafication fun to minmaxing not fun when an individuals idea of fun may actually be located anywhere in that spectrum
sighyoure making exactly the same unproven assumption as liang that one must be efficient and youre also employing the fallacy of the excluded middle by implying that theres no middle ground between doing no learning skills at all and doing nothing but learning skillssince i specifically mention the concept of training some learning skills mixed up with other skill types i can only assume that youre being deliberately dishonestits just as bad for a new character to train nothing but learning skills as it would be for the to train nothing except engineering or nothing except social skills if theres one thing a brand new player should not be doing it is focusing exclusively on any one skill groupgiven that seemingly obvious i say seemingly because apparently its not obvious to you principle how on gods green earth can you possibly assert that new players are made to train nothing but learning so far from being made to its seemingly obvious they should do nothing of the sortunless youre a helplessly obsessivecompulsive minimaxer of course the only significant problem with learning skills is griefers and i use the word deliberately like you telling new players that they must train learning skills first you should be ashamed of yourself because thats a mean thing to do to someone who doesnt know any better
um yeah  because to stake a position that one should play a game deliberately inefficiently is just plain edand youre just pulling that out of thin air or more likely from a place where the sun dont shine because nowhere ever did i say one should only be doing learning skillsin fact theres a whole nuance to minmaxing learning skills that is no doubt entirely lost on you for instance its not efficient to spend your entire 16 mil sp on learning skills exclusively the extra gain you get from getting a learning skill to lv v during the doublespeed bonus time does not outweigh having learnt a regular skill at double speed instead also for the advanced learning skills getting them all to lv v on a single remap is inefficient too as each of these advanced learning skills takes itself as main attribute as it were for example clarity adding 1 additional point to your perception attribute per skill level requires perception  willpower likewise presence adding 1 additional point to your charisma attribute per skill level requires charisma  perception etc so getting these advanced skills to lv v is really best done the moment you do a favorable remap towards their individual attributesinstead of saying one should only be doing learning skills at first i said yet the very existence of the learning skills will cause any reasonably sensible person to gravitate towards doing the learning skills first and i chose gravitate towards with great care as its exactly so sure when i got my learning skills to around 3 or so i trained some other stuff a handful of support skills some missile skills and enough ship skills to fly my drake but i nonetheless kept being drawn back to doing learning skills as they simply are a priority for a newbie i did not invent that system i just saw it would benefit mesee this is the thing youre uncomprehending on learning skills are not the same as any other skill group they are a meta set whatever you train with learning skills positively affects all other areas of your training hence they should get priorityyes im sure theyre much better off in your hands being told learning is for nerdy ocding wimps and that they should just go have fun not worrying too much about their future because its just a game after all sarcasm
nothing you say will be of any consequence as long as it is predicated on this sillinessalsoplease be trolling
1theres nothing deep or meaningfull to these learning skill you have to level em as early as possible or else you simply miss outgiving the spend points back is needed though someone mentioned correctly that a low level 6 mil point char will be gutt
this guy has a right to complain about removing learning skills the thread actually is for a plan to remove learning skills but compensate people for them so you will likely be better off with the change than without because you would gain the attribute equivalent of max learning skillsit has nothing to do about wasting time or falling behind it simply is a time sink people are basically stuck with a month of subscription time training skills to train skills it is like sticking a required skill between frigate and cruiser that has no other purpose in the game but to allow you to train cruiser sure you dont have to train it but you are going to restrict your capabilities pretty badly if you dont
in all sincerity i genuinely think you should stop playing mmos for a little while if you think that advice needs a sacrcasm tag
incorrectall skills are simply a time sink and these ones actually reduce the size of the sink
this seems like a good idea but why not just give people who have learning skills the sp to put where ever they want whats with the 1000 increase in speedthe only potential drawback i see from this is that we may all be able to learn skills too fast maybe only give everyone 7 accross the board and reimburse all the sp spent in learning
i mean obviously we cant respect the choices people have made for their characters right thats out of the question
huh
you and malcanis are probably the biggest failure s ive seen in eve recently what really do you think that learning skills add to the game the simple truth of the matter is that learning skills add nothing to the game except an unnecessary grind that prevents a large number of people from more fully enjoying the game how can you deny the game would be better if people could just start training skillsalso there absolutely a race first you will race to get into a ship which you feel will be fun second you will race to get into situations which make more isk  such as doing l4 missions third you will race your friends to be able to do something you will also notice people end up setting mileposts that they want to accomplish downloading evemon and training a bunch of learning skills the time spent training these learning skills is time that they could have used to become more proficient more quickly they make the game unfriendly to new comersthe funny thing is that id love to see learning skills removed from the game purely for the sake of making the game more approachable i dont even care if you credit my accounts with the sp in any way and three of my five characters have significant learning investmentsliang
not supported learning skills are meant to be trained extensively when youre ready to train other skills extensively catching up is impossible so dont even try lastly i understand excactly what other people are saying here about the unfunness factor people have in eve we call it ship spinning it should be a sign that you need to go find something to do you could train into a assault frigate with tech 2 guns before you even reach your 16 mil cutoff so again im just not sure how you wouldnt have something to do while the skills are trainingmakes me wonder how many of you will want other skills dropped because you cant be bother to train themalso this isnt a i had to do and so do you post its a go find something to do instead of watching your skill timer and stop sweating the small stuff post
what do they add variety complexity admittedly only a modicum of each but apparently even that is too much most importantly  choice sure they add a timesink there is no grind  just like every other skill although they are unique in that they actually reduce the timesink of other skills and they take nothing away  because no matter how many times you say it noone is forced to train them nor do they prevent anyone from doing anythingif you choose to use them in a way which makes getting to whatever it is you want slower in the interest of longterm efficiency  thats your choice there is no race not even if you put race in quotes your first and most asinine examples  racing into a ship and racing into a situation  are even missing a critical element of a race who are you against most people at least mistakenly assert that you are against the other players or some imaginary potential total sp but being an imaginary race i suppose it doesnt really need an opponentas for people who choose to race their friends or set any other timesensitiveskillsensitive objective once again that is their choicesee what i mean about them adding choiceif you choose to use them in a way which makes getting to your current objective faster a request to remove them is just a whine about how long training takes you can harp on about nonlearning skills making you proficient as you go but really how does racial frigate ii make you more proficient with the tier iii frigate you still cant fly how do half the support skills you need make you more proficient with a fit you cant fit yet they dont and lets not even get onto prereqs where you have to become more proficient in things you dont even want if the thing you do want is higher up the ladderas you say yourself most people break down their training into milestones  and no point between here and that milestone is of any interest whether it is the completion of a learning skill or a nonlearning skilland if you really really just want immediate benefits and have no plan  you can choose not to train the learning skills to fit them in some time when you are not concerned with what you are currently trainingsee what i mean about them adding choice
i wuoldnt mind if they just delete all learning skills or at least advanced ones and throw the sp invested in them away and obviously increase attributes to compensate learning skills are just terrible game design that does not add anything to the game
if it is a choice who has chosen to not train them the choice is when they train them rather than if they train them that isnt really a choice i chose to not train mining i dont suffer a penalty compared to others because of this i can make isk in other ways i can buy minerals there are other things i can do that is a choice
contradiction i believe you meant to say it is not a choice i like therefore it is not a choiceyou cant mine

ok this is the petition put quote these lines and you name under mine i will send this on to someone of importance to ccp i herby sign up for folders to be placed back in the ingame contact list in eve online namesaylana emberlust
this new system confuses and infuriates me
not to mention that if you set a corp standing to bluered if you happen to have any of their corpmembers on your list they are still neut supported
10
give us please back the functionality we had  foldersalso give us back our folders it is a result of work  time spent in eve as we had it before tyrannisfolders allowed to sort within them alphabetically which was goodalso each folder was aside its name showing how many chars are in  or all of them or online depending on checkbox checked  uncheckedif my fc asked me how much ppl has our opponent online and who they are i could act and provide him with intelnow i can do nothing and only thing i can do is to say i have no cluethis is not an improvement this is  i believe everyone can make a conclusion for himself here
i do like the new system but i dont like you cant group nore that 10 contacs has become 10i have about 120 contacts what a mess special when i cant even trust the standings as an alliance ceo contacts are your best tool i belive until a solution are found an external contact list are the only option as i see it
gimme old characterlist or gimme dead
the reasoning behind all this stuff is that ccp was too lazy to fix it before it went live too lazy and too greedy expansion days get lots of new subs and ccp is totally willing to ship completely broken unusable halfassed crap as long as it means meeting their deadlines and getting more subs so instead of extrapolating the new labels system that will probably vapor away like every other halfassed mechanic they put in the game from the old folders system they gave a big screw you to everybody effort it would have taken to leave the old system in none effort it would have taken to leave it in until the new labels were in place none effort it would have taken have a popup to notify people to apply the new labels to the old folders an afternoons worth of programming and they already put 1 afternoon into the building the expansion it would be wrong of us to expect a second
everything was already said above
i support thisthanks ccp
a lot of people contacted me in game and this is a serious problem this needs to be reverted to give players back their folders the way they werethe cap on contacts is also a huge issue 300 simply isnt enough
supported 100 contact list without folder  unmanageable mess

how the heck should i now keep track of my war targets you are very funny guys ccpnow there is no difference between my corpmates in the adressbook and my wartargets they are all the same because they have all neutral standingbut half of them are blinkys and half of them are not how should i now seperate themnext funny thing what is the difference between watch list and all contacts  looks always the same to mei like the standings system cause its easier but the other changes are crap

really ccp just what where you thinking at the time
yay you good job you were the only onethis must be not true how can it be true the csm is the uber overriding force in eve democratic powerful unstoppable and yet it appears we didnt need it to get ccp to listen hmmm i call shenanigans
if theres anything at all the csm can do to make these concerns heard it would be highly appreciated these updates crippled a once very useful tool  and it was being used by so many people that i cant believe anyone would willfully destroy itedit well thats good to hear gavjack bunk  but it would have been great to have this functionality ready when the patch is released at least we can voice our concerns and hope that a vague plan becomes a priority because this is a real issue for people who are at war a lot
dam stupid idea makes the adress book near usless and from a previous post sounds like ccp intends to add them back in when they do the labeling makes me wonder if there still an intended feature why they where removed in the first place10 for usibility thread fully suported give us the ability to organize the contactsedit get rid of the watch list just add contacts to the list ungrouped and let us move them to our own groups then we dont have to scroll through a list with every single contact in it to find the new one we just added we would need the ability to duplicat a contact in this case if the need arised to have them in two groups just a thought

wow dear cpp you just achieved the highest ness awardreally what the  you were thinking about did you were doped up when you came up with this ed up and ed idea to take perfectly fine system and replace it with something as useless as pile of dog  i think everyone should start spamming petitions on daily basis until ccp will get their heads out of their asses and fix thisps as you can see from above im so impressed that i had to use a lot of french lingo to express my feelings
making my first post on eveo forums to say i hate your new idea ccp bring back the old contacts list contacts that go offline still dont update properly so what was the point
although i completely agree with the posti think all this whining is laughablei bet most of you didnt even look at forums describing this issue when it was in testing not to mention actually experiencing it on sisi
im sure its just a bugaccording to this web site people and places window should look like this
fixed that link for you also thats what the people and places window looked like two days ago before tyrannis havent you used it before edit forgot my thumb
how many of your subscriptions are members of alliances with logos waiting to be put into the game count them thats how many unhappy customers you have todayafter years of not implementing alliance logos into the game ccp offers alliances a new carrot this new carrot is the latest method for submitting alliance logos alliances assumed that with this new method we would see our logo in the next expansion we were wrong againccp we are your paying customers and while many of us will continue to open our wallets and enjoy the game for what it is we do expect promises of service to be followed up by implementation of said service this is a common expectation in any businesscustomer relationshipwhat are you going to do to create more satisfied customerssquizz caphinator
emoragehe has a point weve been waiting on our logo for a while now would be nice to at leatst hear something from ccp about itemorageshmak datash
i support this where is everyones logo

it was very disappointing to not even have mention in the patch notes this at all it feels as if we were intentionally blown offyes im sure you had bigger issues to work on but sometimes its the little things that make customers happyplease give us some kind of insight as to what happened and what can be done to resolve the problem
why would you do this to us ccp why
all we ask is that you do what you say your going to
logos
i support this
indeed im sick of ccp constantly adding new features instead of fixing the existing ones how hard could it possibly be to put a tiny little pic in the gameeither give people the logos you promised them or remove the feature from the game
there is this mediocre star on our tcus it was supposed to be replaced months agogtr done
there are loads of alliances with the same logo its just like there all the same as each other to a new player get it sorted ccp

i want the logo i need the logo

ill raise this issuethis has to be the 5th time i see bull the past 2 years with ccp always claiming to have a new system of sorts and that players will see their logo in the game soontm no more excuses
i have a company in real life and i do have a logo a logo represent my company my work my team and all we do in this game works as the same way of course in eve world and without a logo we lost our identity and everything weve done so far we lost our flagso i am preatty sure this is a tyrannis situation and ccp is going to fix as fast as possible i hope sos xn
this has to be one of the most expencive mmorpgs on the internet  give them a reason to keep paying you and make good on your promises ccpsupported
yes ccp allow us the dignity of having our own logo its just a little tiny picture that you put in place i dont think we will need to shut down the servers for 18 hours to do that
give the logo
give me logo or give me podded
are logos that hard reallysigned
i agree and support this thread please accept our logo tell the logo worker enabler to work harder abit hard work benefits everyone including businessthanks
as i already stated in my other csm thread on this
i honestly cant say im surprised ccps good at a lot of things but following through with what they say is not one of them
add logo is waste of time for ccp staffi think you guys should have to pay irl  to get it perhaps usd50 or eve more depends on how much time ccp staff must spend on itedit get free if get top 3 placing in alliance tournament or have ccp dev in your alliance

introductionwhile pve is not everyones playstyle a lot of players still rely on pve as income source to fund other activities whenether it is by grinding missions or running the same old exploration sites over and over ccp released notsoepic mission arcs in their attempt to create exciting pve content but these obviously do not solve the problem as they just add more static content in 2009 ccp answered that players like the grind and dont want surprises which is a pretty stupid excuse for failing at creating interesting pve contentdynamic contentpve content should be dynamic andor modular missions and exploration sites should be generated from components randomly put together spawns can be dynamic and unpredictable as well with a budget to select rats from to ensure players arent dropped in the middle of 50 battleshipsmissions and exploration sites could have multiple acceleration gates leading to new pockets similar to worlds collide with players having to find their way to the objective secondary optional objectives should be included as well similar to the extravaganza bonus room or the secret meeting envoy etccompetetive missionsanother complaint is that missions are mostly solo content and that it scales into infinity with agents offering unlimited missions to every pilot that visits theminstead minievents should occur in the game world which spawn a hidden site agents will drop clues to the existence of this site however multiple players will soon learn of this minievent players or corporations will have to compete with eachother to complete the objective first and claim the rewardif players do not complete the minievent in a set timeframe the event may escalate and worsen and more players will be informed of the situation and called into actionan example of such a mission the guristas are building a base in a remote lowsec system some players are informed that something is up in that particular constellation ships disappearing and so on if the players manage to destroy the base the threat is countered and succesful players rewarded if nothing happens then the base is completed rats start appearing in the belts and on the gates word arrives that the guristas have seized a caldari industrial full of military supplies and hid it in a deadspace pocket in a nearby system to unload the goodies players are urged to act quickly destroy the guristas onsite and reclaim the empty industrial and fly it back to caldari navy base x the corpplayer that brings back the industrial gets a sizable reward if the industrial gets destroyed a small reward is granted to players on the killmail if they fail doing either the guristas base receives some annoying turret upgrades and so onless is morecurrently rats lack proper fitting and intelligence and are generally just carrybags full of loot as a result missions often rely on swamping the player with many weak rats to make gameplay more interesting ccp should consider having much fewer rats which use more realistic fittings and bring at least some degree of intelligence with themrealistic objectivesat the moment killtype missionsexploration sites are just that shoot everything that moves instead pve objectives should rely on realistic mechanics such as scrambling a target to prevent it from warping off or providing objectives where the player has to use webs or electronic warfare intelligently or use piloting skilluseful linksdynamic events in guild wars 2it cant get more dynamic than dwarf fortressmissions under review 2008dynamic missions 2009
as long as these can be probed out normally also rewards for helping out the guristas from your example would be pretty cool
sounds generally good one thing that i have long been keen to promote is a move away from the idea of pve scaling purely in more dps  more tank vs bigger rats with more dps and more tankthere should be missions that need probing skills tackling skills speed stealth more than just i have a xtype xl booster so i winand the rats should be much less predictable properly fitted and far fewer in number killing a bs class rat should be a significant challengein short fighting npcs should be a lot more like fighting pcs the benefits of this would be multiple1  much harder to macrofarm2  missioners would be much better able in both skills and equipment to deal with other players3  pveing would be much more exciting and fun as you say it is simply inexcusable for eve to have such poor pvp the only players that like missions being dull predictable and repetitive are the isk farmerscan you incorporate these concepts in to your proposal
was a bit short on characters but got your suggestions in there i think
i had a similar idea but you have said it much better tamber
anything that livens up the isk farm is a good idea
while i agree with most of your suggestion competitive missions has a problem who will be informed how heshe will be chosenany system you implement will benefit someone more and some less and run the risk of people claiming that someone get a preferential treatment support for the general idea
i supported this when i proposed it albeit much less artfully two years ago i support it noweves backstory has lots of opportunity for a dynamically evolving npc system that can be directly influenced and profited from by player activities and in the long run its cheaper than humanled eventsheh  players like the grind and dont want surprises  correction ccp  mmo exwow addicts dont know anything other than the grind and suffer from conditioning to it those that dont arent playing current grindy pve mmos gw2 would not be doing what they are doing if they didnt think there was a marketitll be interesting even just at the pure technical level to see where gw2 goes with the concept anywaya good concept to throw around and develop on
agreedi like all of this but missions scaled to the gangfleet size when accepting the mission would be a nice challenge as well if you are going to integrate dynamic spawns this could be added as well
definitely a step into the right direction even if a lot of it sounds like the public quests in waor or what has been proposed more recently for gw2 but might you consider implementing thisdynamic mission quality spawn more rewarding missions the less missions are taken and completed in a certain systemconstellation and vice versa
first of all i apologize if this is a repeat topic however i saw nothing in the list of existing csm issues that matched thismy proposal relates to launching jobs remotely into player owned pos labs and assembly arrays currently this can be done only if the blueprint in question is based in a corp hangar at an npc station in the same system as the tower with the labsarraysi would like to propose the following additions to this systema blueprints based in the storage of a mobile laboratory or assembly array can be used to install a job into a slot of that arraylab onlyb blueprints based in a corporate hangar array can be used to install a job into a slot of any lab or array anchored at the same posc research jobs that produce an output copyinginvention can have their output directed into the storage of either the lab the job was installed in or a corporate hangar based at the same pos as the labthe current system as it stands has several shortcomings1 the requirement for a corp to rent office space in a system for no other reason than to permit remote research this is an additional and imo unnecessary cost thrown on top of the expense of buying and fueling the pos and arrays2 hisec systems that contain no npc stations such as ahtulaima in the forge are a wasted oppurtunity for research poss yes you can set up a tower and labs but you will have to physically be at the tower every time you want to install new research jobs3 the need to constantly shuttle research products from tower back to station hangar breaks the production continuity and makes remote research not really that remote here is an example involving tech ii invention and manufacturingi have a pos in system x with 1 mobile laboratory and one equipment assembly array anchored and online i have done my homework in advance and loaded the lab and the assembly array with all the required datacores data sheets if required and manufacturing materials for my intended end producti have a t1 bpo for item y based in an npc station corp hangari am physically located in system z 5 jumps away where i like to run missionsi install a copy job remotely from system z using the bpo into the pos lab it produces 20 copies when the job is completed and delivered the produced copies are deposited into the specified output tab of the labs storagei must now fly from system z to system x just to remove the copies from the lab and place them in the npc station corp hangar once done i return to my mission running homei remotely install several batches of invention jobs using the 20 bpcs into the pos lab those jobs that are successful are again delivered into the lab storagei must now fly once again from z back to x just to move the tech ii bpcs from lab into station hangar after i again return to system zi can now remotely install manufacturing jobs using the t2 bpcs into the pos assembly array when completed the products are delivered into the assembly arrays storage i return to x for a third time collect my product and profitnot very fluid is it and with the proposed development of eve gate one day becoming a tool for researchmanufacturing management it needs to change installing jobs form a web browser certainly seems feasible and cool i love the future intent of eve gate but youre certainly not going to be able to fly your bpcs back and forth through a web browsercontinued in next post
contso having just covered the above real world example of how things currently are lets go through a theoretical example of how the system should workas before i have my tower lab and assembly array i have done my homework and everything is stocked correctly only this time i have flipped the bird to the npc station lords and kept my 40 million per month in rental fees ive already paid for and fueled my own interweb spacestation why would i pay more to someone else to use theirs again i am living several jumps awayitem y t1 bpo is based in a corp hangar array anchored and online at the posi remotely install my copy job from the pos corp hangar array into the pos labwhen the job completes the produced copies are output not into the labs storage but back into the pos corp hangar arrayi remotely install invention jobs using the t1 bpcs from hangar array to lab again the jobs output t2 copies goes back into the corp hangar arrayi remotely install manufacturing jobs using the t2 bpcs from corp hangar array into the pos assembly array when these jobs complete they output either into the arrays storage or into the corp hangar arraywhen this whole chain of production has run its course which may have taken 2 days 2 weeks or 2 months i make one single trip to system x to collect and sell my product and restock the labfactory for the next months work apart from this one restockandprofit trip i have not had to leave my home system several jumps awayto me and i would hope to many of my industrialist colleagues this scenario is the proper definition of remote research and is what i would like to see made possible by having this proposal implemented to anyone who is not familiar with remote jobs or thinks this is currently possible its not try it place a blueprint into a lab hangar at a pos and fly to the neighboring system open your si interface and select the corp blueprints tab a list appears of your corps station offices but nowhere is the pos lab blueprint visible youd certainly think it would be its in corp storage it is therefore corp property yet you cannot manage it in the si interface unless you are actually floating next to the lab in questionso i think that fleshes out my issue pretty well if youve read this far youre likely already an inductry fan yourself so im going to add a few other common requests on in support of thempersonal posplease create a launch for self option when anchoring poss in conjunction to the existing launch for corp option anchoring in this way would mean the standings requirement to anchor would be based off the individuals faction standings not the corps and the facilities anchored there would be usable only by the individual why have a personal filter in the installations tab of the si interface anyway if theres no such thing as a personal labfactorywhy because youre a member of a large 100 member spaceopera warwaging corp with 00 standings with every faction but you also want a hisec research pos of your own currently you either have to quit your corp which you love and go solo or beg permission from your corp directors to anchor your 1b worth of pos equipment in lowsec for you where it will quickly explodebatch install researchmanufacturing jobsi know im not alone here i do invention a lot of invention when at work im sneaking on every couple of hours to install ten new jobs doing each job one by one is click intensive and extremely tedious please allow us to shiftselect a group of installation slots and install blueprints into all of them in one go youre responsible for my organizations loss of man hours ccp ability to hack and then unanchor offline pos towersthis ones old as the hills come one let us clear up that real estate already thats all from me folks thanks for reading and fly safe o

introductionduring the past two years the csm has raised dozens of minor ui fixes while a small handful of these issues have been implemented ingame it remains obvious that the eve ui is fundamentally flawed ccp has stated that they intend to revamp the ui at some point but as we have seen the past years they never get further than bandaid fixes rather than raising another dozen specific ui issues which will either get ignored or are just bandaids i would like to ask ccp to just revamp the whole ui once and for allwhy commit resources the ui is one of the major turnoff points of the game from the perspective of new users improving the ui positively impacts all playstyles and all areas of the game much less subsequent resources required to make changes and additions ui improvments will render certain existing content in eve more accessible science industry pos management etc a lot of players do not bother with this content due to a needlessly complex ui the current ui gives eve a very dated and inaccessible appearancewhat is needed more contextsensitive oneclick buttons to replace the dropdown menus modular functionality so players can customize their ui edit this is not moddable ui so no third party addons clipboardlike lists where players can put links solar systems bookmarks locations people items so they dont need to have lots of windows open at the same time to access these no needless functionality duplication example having a reset camera function in the rightclick menu when selecting your ship when there is a oneclick button in the main interface doing the same means to tell items apart bpo from bpc meta levels factionofficer modules type of item a readable font which scales properly better hotkey supportfeedback pleaseplease provide general ui improvements you believe should be included arguments to convince ccp to commit to a ui revamp are particularly welcome
sorry not supported in my opinion too much work for too little rewardsome of your other proposals are more important1 fix factional warfare2 address lag we all know it is technically impossible for the system to scale up smoothly ultimately there needs to be a mechanism by which having many ships in the same system is either actively prevented or somehow discouraged via some other mechanism like weakened sensors
too little reward are you serious this is why nothing gets done because of comments like thisthe ui is outdated and does need a change but yeah it is a bit of work but so whatif not then allow the ui to be modded then ccp dont have to revamp the ui
ccp cant make a ui allow player modification pleasebut yeah a good ui needs less drop down menus and with the menus you keep only show on default the most used ones most of the right click options are never or barely used and clutter the important ones and when busy also remove the ones that cannot even be used like renaming ships you arent in bookmarking stuff on directional scanner etc
there was more than enough threads about ui one of most recent ones
 lots of posts on this subject most of them goodaslong as there wouldnt be anyway players could get an advantage over others ie mods and macros etc im in like everyone else will be unless theyre ed ccp knows we know they know and they know we know they knowtamber
obviously i support ui reform though i disagree with tamber about the mods but not about making sure they cant be abused
the ideal would be a moddable ui i know ccp has already said no but push them for it anywaysinformally it would bar none be the single best change to eve that could be made failing that do what you can to get them to improve it large amounts of data always devolve into spreadsheet form sooner or later but there are spreadsheets and there are spreadsheets also some of the little things that are just appallingly bad  eves text chat for example makes me pine for the yahoo messenger client i had in 1997 theyre working through these  the new mail client is actually pretty good and the new igb is at least somewhat usable  but theres still a lot that need work
supporting this but you should also push for a moddable uiliang
not supported or rather i wouldnt mind ui improvements but like some of the others im against allowing player mods keep the playing field level for everyone thanks
whoa there you seem to be under the impression that the same team which maintains the eve ui are also the same people who would be tasked with improving the game play and server designperformance aspectsi honestly doubt this is the case so i dont think your fear of time resourceproject time dilution is realisticap
considering ccp completely sucks noodles every time they touch the ui the general ui revamp proposal is not supported seriously 1 out of 20 things they do with the ui is actually good and its never their own idea the reason it needs to be revamped is because they flunked their interface usability classes in college whos to say theyll make it any better instead of completely breaking the functionality thats still there the only thing i would support is letting it be completely customizable so people can make it not suck on their own problem with customization is easier macro access which is another problem ccp fails at dealing with
eah i like the option but it would take some reworking to make it work i like either removing it or giving option i approve
following that logic they should add some amarr and caldari storylines sending people in the solitude region
have not tested the missions since i am caldari though by the sound of it i would rather not be subjeted to such storyline missions
having sat in one of the mission systems with a recon waiting for mission runners to come along i at least feel that the mission locations should be spread out a bit more it just seems too easy

supported fullythank you
anki like allot of what you propose but some i dont its hard to tell what i would be supporting if i supported this under short term improvements i agree with everything except how exactly do you intend to promote pvp in complexes and missions i think we can promote pvp in complexes by removing npcs and simply letting the players know when and where a complex is being run is that what you mean to do but missions not sure how you get the pve to pvp there i think missions are fine the way they are they can currently be used by players for great pvp and are being used that way to some extent but i agree that can be improved for example i sometimes take a level 1 mission in the opposing factions main system since level 1s only allow frigates or destroyers in i can kill most of the rats and wait for enemies to come in i know they cant all warp on top of my t1 frigate because they must go through the gate they will know what ships i am in based on the scanner i hope to do this with some level 3 missions and a group of bcs i think it will lead to some good pvp i hope ccp doesnt mess with missions and make this impossible but without knowing what you propose how can we tell under mid term i also tend to agree but not sure exaclty how you want to let alliances in you had made a proposal on this before that i thought were pretty good if memory serves but i have also seen several proposals that were bad as far as long term goals i used to want occupancy consequences now im against it we dont need more people piling on the winning side which this would encourage we need the opposite the rest is a bit too vague live events like a fw tournament similar to the alliance tournament would be great though the way this proposal is written it seems like some sort of carte blanche to have csm do whatever in fw i tend to like fw as it is now and would not be in favor of the csm proposing changes unless we first have a somewhat detailed proposal that we can actually discussfix faction war is not really a proposal if i recall you had some decent detailed proposals please give them to us individually so we can know what we are supporting

supporting the principle id point out that as far as specifics go this has been debated to death in plenty of threads veshta yoshida had a good one a while back in this very forum if memory serves and there have been several in fimuch as i hope to be proven wrong i doubt this will receive much support  the majority of the fw community seems to have accepted they are destined to be ignored planetary interaction was the first feature ever where ccp actually bothered to publicly consider followup work
 this i especially would like to see but all are good points
omg yes please
when you say as far as specifics go this has been debated to death what are you referring to the specifics as to what issue i have been following these threads quite a bit and we generally get 3 types of ideas1 very vague threads where someone says fix faction war and everyone agrees but the ideas they post on how to fix it are various and often contradictory i mean why not have a thread that says fix eve and then if anyone wants anything in eve changed then support the idea you end up getting allot of people saying yeah i want this change but at the end of the day you have no idea what change people are really supporting that is what this thread is 2 threads that involve correcting exploits or quasi exploits or bugs i would also throw in there things like obvious imbalances between races eg there is no good reason the caldari npcs should be 10s more difficult to fight than the gallente these proposals are specific and usually well supported3 then there are the other detailed proposals these would include things like mechanics to allow alliances to be able to join add certain consequences for occupancy add back the automatic decline for missions change the mechanics of how the complexes spawn and occupancy  remove all npcs from plexes change how lp are awarded etc etc these proposals have met with widely varied support by the players some were strongly supported some were mostly rejectedwe cant expect ccp will just redo fw based on vague ideas its fairly popular as it is i still think they could add some things to help fw players earn more money and of course i have a few other ideas but each of these ideas needs to be considered on its own merit by the players at least if you want the csm to do things that the players want as opposed to whatever they see fit
10meh i dont really see this as a problem 0how would you suggest doing this the biggest problem to me is that the npcs are so  hefty its very very hard to pvp in a fw plexmission also the fw missions very quickly become much much much much

as of the deployment of tyrannis evegate now is in game and has the expected default settings of contacts of excellent standing as defaultit is known to be good game design outside of ccp that is to go with the concept do no harm as the use of contacts can be abused and since players at this point actively have to remove the access that concept is broken in tyrannisi would like to propose that eve gate profile settings be set to default to no pilots
i am obviously going to be in support of my proposal surprised
no brainer  silly  silly greedy ccp
good idea i hate that you have to go around every setting just because ccp dont follow normal guidelines and set everything as off as default
supported
i too support this motion
couldnt agree more 
well its kinda late for that  it already launched but better late than never its not like every newbie gets a message hey that person youre about to set to 10 will be able to see all your contacts on evegate  it is a part of the game according to ccp devs right so game can tell that your setting is default riiight ah whatever theyre hopless
100 fully supportedyou guys have heard of the fuss mark z has found himself in over on fb havent youzallende
csm is nothing but a pr stunt that let ccp claim to be listening but ill support this if it fixes this privacy glitch

no brainer ccp is ed for using open privacy settings
100 supported exposure of potentially strategic info by default is an appallingly bad idea
i too agree that the default should be none
there is already mechanics in place for this you can request the escalation of your issue to a higher ranking gm i have asked for escalation once because i thought the first answer i received was not sufficient i had an update in a day from another senior gm and they discussed with me the issue and came to the same conclusion i do agree that a gm should not handle a ticket about himself ever i do however question what you requested i find that it is a valid question and information we should be made privy too least we get caught up in this whirlwind of emotion to hang ccp i have filed many things with ccp in my time here in the game some i felt did not make sense or that i simply did not agree with each time i tried my damnedest and coolest to prevail in some cases i was successful in others i was not and in those rare occasion just joking around when exposing a flaw in a billing system or a bug gets one rewarded i have found ccp fair and just they have rules in place and an eula that guides the service they offer with rules for our side as a note when i was a much younger player i bought isk i was punished oah man was i punished a negative 1 billions wallet was horrible and took a long time to repair i think i worked on that for a good 6 months my god was it horrible but i did something i had fair warning about i thought i could sneak it in but they got me to this day i am glad they did only that when they could have been much harsher

signed signed and more signedwhen i first saw the trailers for dust i was ecstatic being a relic from the bygone age of planetside and wanting something more meaningful than 2142then i saw it was console only i was both confused and ed thats on par with sony deciding to announce that theyre making a sequel to planetside console onlyi dont begrudge ccp the opportunity to make money on all the console kids but for those of us already involved in eve i have to agree with earlier posters in both threads that shelling out for xbl isp eve and possibly dust dont know if an mmo sub would be rolled into xbl especially during a global recession is just plain silly or unrealisticly greedyalso i agree with many that have stated that this decision is very much a slap in the face to the existing eve playerbase im all for expanding the accessibility of the games and the setting but ostracizing your existing fanbase for the chance to make an extra buck from microsoft on a platform specific release is a surprisingly dense marketing decision simply putgive us cross platformspeaking not only for myself but a group of 8 some eve players some not that i game with on a regular basisif you release on pc we will all purchaseif you do not release on pc none of us will purchasei say this not out of a desire to be ornery but simply as a statement of fact
if you have ever used the ingame eve map and tried to plot a route with it you may have noticed that the flattened map looks terribleccp make the flattened map look something like this
i prefer spaghetti tbo
flattened map is just that  flattened 3d map which shows the stars where they are but with no zaxiswollaris map totally lacks the information on star relative positions in favor of readability
star relative positions is generally worthless info on the flattened map if you are in a capital trying to figure out if you can jump to a star you need to use 3d mode anyways or eve jump plannerif you are in a roaming gang and you want to look in the nooks and crannies of the eve star systems have fun with thatusing a 3rd party site just to figure out where i want to go sucks
the current map really isnt all that hard to read imo i dont think the time to change it is worth the reward also i prefer the current one for rp sake id like to keep a little bit of the feeling that im actually in space rather then looking at another spreadsheet
supported if and only if they implement a proper ruler on the map it can be star colouring and a text box where you input a number of ly but it should be graphical and it should be accessible without needing to be physically inside a jumpcapable ship at the timethat said minor issue wiollari ombey and serenity have already done a pretty fair job of this players can work from there
yeah but the problem with their maps is that you cant right click and set destination to the systems in there and you have to tab out
ingame browser also using the search function in people and places works better than right clicking in the map search for your first waypoint add waypoint search for second add second etc
dude how hard is it to learn what your looking at is it really that hard to read the lines and figure out what color lines mean what or hers is an idea use the f11 map to look at constilation info or right click a spot near you and do select constilation or region figure out the area as all the lines will connect and you can see what your looking at as well as read map data the pdf maps and such are great for what they are but all in all they are not that needed and without the current map data they are worthless when your loking to plan arotue or last but not least learn were you fly i mean my god the time it would take to figure out a few things about were your roamn  hunting so some home work  the map has been pretty much the same sense beta and its worked just fine thus far why do you think it should change becuase it has fetures you lack the understanding in learning how to useas with most forum crys do some home work or ask for help people are so quick to ask for change before they take th time to learn or ask hwo to do something everyone else seems to be able to do just fine if everyone else can do it and not you maybe th eproblem is you good old mirror take a look you might notice something familar
it is terrible but its not so much about the looks it mostly about having hard time selecting solar system you need out of two systems that are few pixels away from each other because of feature of previosly selected solar system staying in focus if you move cursor away  that results in pixelhunting most quests would envy
what we need is a 3d map that can be freely rotated as it used to be years ago so the flattened map is once again redundantmaking the flattened map change star locations any more than it already does would make it impossible to find my way around on it
i agree with maz i find it incredible that anyone uses the ingame map to find their way around in its current implementation
yes this is the reason its terrible the criss crossing lines arent a big deal but if a line happens to go over a starbut not connect to and when stars overlap with landmarks or other stars is the problem i dont necessarily mean that ccp should turn the eve map to look like something out of a spreadsheeti think it should remain in the same art style but something where the connections to the stars make more visual sense would be great i want to be able to look at the flattened map and see oh there is a deadend constellation and oh there is another route to the same place
the map looks a lot like the ombeve 2d maps which ive found to be just a confusing as the ingame map not supported although i do understand your frustrations using a 3rd party website to determine locations 3rd party stuff always makes me tense im always just waiting to log in an find my account hacked with all my junk gone however for immersions sake big deal for me personally id prefer something that looks a little more high techso  not supported until maps looks more awesome and keeps the immersion going1 for the spaghetti pic though
current situation we can go on eve gate and manage our contacts but theres no way to see more than 10 at a time proposed solution let us see more than 10 a page perhaps an option to show 102550100300 per page somewhere off to the side benefits we wont have to click eight billion ing times to do any sort of mass change to our contacts drawbacks nil
agreed dont need to say more
yes please ps also raise the max for just me to 3000 please and an invite all button cheerstamber
supported but not the invite all button for tamber p
a nobrainer
smashing idea and while at it allow for a list type view without the portrait icons  needless waste of bandwidthspace if you ask me so want to be able to remove them
one of the frequently stated intentions is to spread out players in high security space and prevent large clusters of missionrunners to occupy a systemunfortunately ccps approach has been to add more agents for overused corpsfactions this gives these corporations an advantage over others causing more players to flock to systems with agents beloning to these factionsin my opinion the correct approach to this problem is to make other corporations more attractive for mission running and balancing the agent distribution between the factionsthis can be done in several ways bringing agent quantity and type inline between the big four caldari currently has an absurd advantage over the other factions due to the overabundance of good combat agents adding agents for factions which are not the big four sisters of eve khanid kingdom ammatar mandate interbus changing the standing matrix to make factions such as thukker tribe and intaki syndicate more attractive adding more lp shop incentives to run missions for lowsec00 factions such as ore mordus legion intaki syndicate rebalancing mission hubs players should have to choose between either a single highquality agent or multiple lowquality agents not both
your ideas arent bad in themselves in fact i quite like them but theyre putting lipstick on a pig the fact that the missions themselves are utterly predictable boring virtually all the same and onedimensional
missions would at least be alot better with sleeper ais and some randomnessi would like to see dynamic agent quality does not need to be fully dynamic but partially at least so one agent can be q10 but when used alot it drops to q0 while the other is q5 but when used barely it increases to q5 serious it cannot be that hard to implement that and that would really help spreading mission runnersand when busy upgrade quality of all lvl 4 agents in low sec to at least zero if possible while keeping their old standing requirements but that is probably not possible it is ridiculous that if you want to do lvl 4 missions in low sec there are plenty of q17 agents
i was getting to that
supportedthink one potential fix to help spread out mission runners would be a complete overhaul of the lp store systemat the moment theres a lot of duplication between the lp stores for corporations in the same faction meaning that theres not as much point running missions for those smaller corporations as the items you can get there you can also get from for example the factional navy lp store as well as a lot of other items that you cant get at the smaller corp storesso to make it more worthwhile to run missions for the smaller corps there needs to be a lot more unique offers if i wanted to get a hold of an hardwiring  eifyr and co gunslinger ax2 for example i should need to be running missions for eifyr and co to get a hold of one or be willing to pay someone who runs missions for that corp to get one for me alternatively it should be more expensive in lp and isk to get a hold of lp store items from corporations other than the one who produces it making it more worthwhile to go to the manufacturer if youre looking for something specifictldr  make the lp stores less generic
yeah ive been saying this for a while that said one buff caldari needs when it comes to missions  can we get some cn l4 q20 agents in lowsec like the other empires have i know they dont see a lot of use but they should exist
agreedi also support missions receiving sleeper ai and lp store diversity
it would be nice if the agents did some traveling once in a while to some of their other corp stations too
spreading missioners out will nerf ninjasalvaging but otherwise you have good ideas lowsec needs some love and missions are quite boring your idea of dynamic missions is pretty new and would make ninjasalvaging more challenging
looks good although id like to see some sort of dynamic agent quality and available mission balancing ie the amount of players utalising an agent reflects on the amount of overall available missions and the quality of the agent although there would still be base qualities to work atthis idea would help some server balancing but it may have an adverse effect on some mini professions and possibly raise item prices for regionstamber
this way i can provide some tackle supportretribution currently has 1 med slotall other afs could use one extra med or low slot as well this is really not asking for much just to make them pvp viableedit move the 5th high slot to the new med spot
if i had to buff the retribution id give it a fifth turret not a second mid not every ship needs to work solo
i have yet to find a corp that would allow me to fly this ship due to the lack of a second mid slot
it has nothing to do with solo it has everything to do with not being useless if you only have one rifter as a tackler in your fleet and that rifter dies your fleet is rather useless that is why you need as many points as possible most pvp fits fit a point even bs and bc ships because you never know when youll be the only one in position to tackle a juicy targetcommon scenarios in pvp are bouncing a target between two gates belt bombing a system and tackling multiple targets if you have multiple targets you want to point as many as possible right im sure many people fly retributions and love them im also sure that the people in your fleet make fun of you and ask you when you are training for a real ship
in the previous expansion dominion 00 received an overhaul i think it is a good idea to discuss the current state of 00 with ccp and see if dominion accomplished its intended goalsin particular i believe the following issues are worthy of discussion barrier to entry new and independent alliances find it nearimpossible to take and hold sov supercap blobbing what role should there be for smaller gangs incentives to make players actually live in 00 space no real empirebuilding means to develop space is very limited and expensive megaalliances still holding too much spaceplease provide your views on these issues or bring up issues you see as a problem in 00 this post will be updated to incorporate your feedback
dominion feature called lag kinda fixed that now you need less people to lag the hell out of the system
 barrier to entry new and independent alliances find it nearimpossible to take and hold sovthis is where renter alliances are actually awesome despite all the hate they allow corps to get out into 00 without having a field large cap fleets once youre there you can build up your strength make the contacts you need and get in a position where you can take space and keep it supercap blobbing what role should there be for smaller gangssee providence end of the day though theres plenty of room for small gangs anyway if youre roaming in a small gang and getting blobbed by caps youre doing it wrong incentives to make players actually live in 00 spaceyou mean apart from the huge piles of isk we can make post dominion lol no real empirebuilding means to develop space is very limited and expensivehuh you can build empires just fine you just need to have enough people making use of the systems youre claiming the old predominion thing of vast swathes of empty sov space was ed anyway megaalliances still holding too much spaceyes but the renter alliance thing has actually had some pretty good benefits the main concern now is just that the big alliances are building up isk reserves that may make them untouchable in future to anyone but the existing rivals how could an alliance coming through now ever get hold of the r64s and space to ever take on the titans and supercap fleets of the big guys eve needs a top level money sink that doesnt provide the top alliances with more combat power something vanity based would probably work
about the amount you make with lvl 4 missions in high sec and then only when you are in an afk wasteland alliance not if in one of the few places that are actually populated like ccp wantedonly will change if the large alliances get a reason not to steamroll them good fights apparently isnt enough of a reason it would help if travel took longer so they dont want to bring all their bffs from across the universe to smash one small alliance since that would leave them vulnerable while now you can cross the universe in around 20 minutesi like the idea proposed earlier that it becomes harder to take a system with higher development indexes although in the end many probably still rather just drop a super cap fleet on itmore reward more abilities to deal with the risks gonna get flamed for this but yeah i am looking at afk cloakingon the reward subject npc 00 does not benefit from dominion yet but for starters it would already be nice if way more of the anomalies would be havens and sanctumsmore upgrade posibilitiesrelated to 12
you can make enormous amounts of isk in 00 if you set your corp up the right way a system with pirates 5 has a near constant supply of havens and sanctums and entrapments 5 gives you awesome plexs on top one system can keep a group busy and the mining upgrades give you access to the best ores seriously theres very little excuse for people not raking in cash in 00 incidentally i agree with you about the need to nerf cloaks currently a cloaker can be an invulnerable intel source for enemies thats not on everything in the game should have a possible counter move even if it requires a lot of time and work to do it
this is not entirely true the crippler is on grid  there have been nearly 1500 people engaged in hostilities in a system postdominion they had multiple locations with ongoing fights until everyone got sucked into a fight on the same grid and the node killed its hamsters in frustrationthe problem remains that passive moon income which makes up much of the income for a 00 alliance and is spread out this rather than allowing others access leads larger alliances to hold a moon here and there and allow friendly alliances to hold the space around their moons to slow down an invasion long enough for them to assemble i think the best solution is to directly tie alliance income to the income of the members allow alliances to tax this shifts the income source most alliances have per member taxes and such already in place to other infrastructure that they have more control over than the moons they holdthis or some variation of itthere arent enough already the barrier is a learning curve wall like many other things in eve in this case developing connections that allow you to join an existing alliance or get set blue to other alliances out there it isnt exactly a good ole buddy club because alliances in 00 constantly have a need for more manpowerthe entire game is designed around trying to make it difficult to go it alone forcing players to work together it is an mmo after allthe problem is mainly that alliance have little reason to develop their space other than to pacify or attract members tie alliance income to infrastructuremegaalliances do you mean coalitions or are you simply talking about the most well known alliances in the game again the space being held is not the issue they hold space to hold moons alliances need a source of income equal to or greater than their moons before they will focus on something other than grab more moon gold the domino effect from this will break apart naptrains as they no longer need them as much to protect their farflung moons
fypseriously find a way to nerf the nap trains 00 should have at least a dozen or more separate conflicts going on at once not this team a vs team b  that we all see right now
shouldnt this be in features and ideas
i also think that is a good idea
you just need to fix the lag first of all worry about everything else once this is done
while this issue is obviously important this probably isnt the place to start ittamber
lets see how much the capsupercap insurance nerf fixes this
the only real barrier to entry is not being willing to fit a ship and jump through a gatesome alliances that work around small gangs are still doing quite nicely tyvmdo you live in a cave or are you that far removed from whats actually going on in the gamewell weve seen how well thats worked for megaalliances such as goonswarm
thats a player problem not a developer problem its our fault not ccps
planets are currently seeded randomly according to some arcane algorythm as are their properties while this promises realistic placement of unique planets the algorythm seems to be broken as it is you will find 300k oceanic planets at 15au far outside the orbit of gas and ice planets in the same system in attyn just to name one example and temperate planets with oceans at less than 100k or more than 8g of gravity this clearly needs to be fixed eventually if we have any interest in a universe that keeps up some illusion of realism this is science fiction after allhowever time is getting short to address this since players will start deploying planetary structures in a couple weeks and changing or moving planets about thereafter will likely cause enormous problemsi had hoped this would have already been addressed with the tyrannis upgrade as i believe i read a dev stating they had hired an astrophysicist to come up with realistic planet data i seem to have misunderstoodthis is probably a minority issue that will not find impressive support but maybe one of the new csm members will pick it up seeing that it makes some sense
bring back the old sun instead of a drawing done by 2 year olds at least do not make them all yellow with abit of orange i dunno what sun they have been looking at but real suns arnt all yellow they actually are more orange and you can actually see the flames and lava pits and such p
no the old suns were ing terrible the new ones actually resemble what they are supposed to
not all stars are orangeheres a nice page that will teach you about stars
like this that color comes from this filter focused on our sun not the actual color of our star let alone all stars
i appears that jita has been limited to 1000 ships this has created a massacre at the gates ships are being ganked by pirates because they cant jump the gate this attempt to limit players into jita will ruin jita as a trading hub a lot of players economy revolves arround this hub
hint dont use perimeter or sobaseki to go to jitathere is a highway around jita so you can do 12 jumps more and find systems with totally empty gates towards jitaand the pirates cant be everywherelast but not least  the limit is now 1300 people iircthough there is nothing that needs to be changed
haha this game is so great
oh no people might need to find somewhere else to trade the horroryou go to jita and then get surprised when you eat a gank really
you realise that this is a shortterm postpatch measure like disabling the api server and that ccp did it the last two patches as wellanyway dont hold out on us bro  link us to your lossmail what did you lose
do your part afk in jita
now with evegate live there are no obstacles to have mafia wars farmville texas hold em poker and other games integrated into it so we can have some qualitytime while staring into black screens of loading or waiting for our modules to start working

if it comes to that id like the option to optout of evegatethe various flashgames that are also used on farcebook are pure infoharvestersi pay enough to ccp and they get the added value of a huge database of marketdynamics researchdont need another privacy discrepancywant to pass the time read a good booknot supported
take a look at autocanons the medium gun effect is awesome  sound of burst and shiny effect now take the 800mm repeating artillery you have an ugly puff of smoke its the same with missiles the light missiles makes a flashy bang that look like an explosion and the torps make a dull low res textured thing so 
i would just like to take a moment and congratulate every pvpr both in game and in out of game publications for providing such a total storm of publicity for ahnk anyone who has ever been popped podded scammed duped or deprived of the godgiven mission goods knew exactly who to vote for im just surprised that she didnt end up with the chairmanship good job guys
you have to let it go people she has been voted for and that is thatjust pray she doesnt get near the vc sec or vsec chairsnb no votes  no seat the bears must love her
disagree with your beliefs  unfit for csmkay
currently she is flooding assembly hall with idea gathering she is unaware of the difference between features and ideas discussion and assumes this is the correct place to ask others what she should doon top of that she is once again contradicting herself and it is worrying that alot of her supports are simply to support idea discussionstbh her current threads should be moved to feature and ideas discussions and the people supporting should actually find out what they are supporting
so if mynxee all of the sudden has to step down as chair person does that mean you know who steps inwatch your back mynxee
i fully support removing her from the csm she should be banned for spamming as well
i honestly laughed when i saw she got in some how in politics the scum always manages to rise to the topanyways i wouldnt worry about it too much given that her attention whoring and mindless use of the platform as her own little personal soapbox will soon tire her out and shell cryquit csm again just like she did the last time
she was elected in a democratic election process and represents over 3000 customers only one other csm was able to collect more votesdo you want to fraud all those 3000 electors then go on and i presume an massive uproar at ccp and the whole csm programm looks like we have to deal with iranian election rules hereyou dont like the outcome so you just ban the winneraside that a lot of csm spammed channels forums and emails not only ankh get them all banned
welcome to democracy you cant unvote someone just because you personally disagree with their idealsonly a complete idiot which ccp are not would end up changing eves core values from what they see and have always seen them as why is it such a big deal that out of numerous csm members one happens to be propve and industry half the sodding game in case you hadnt noticed we got mynxee as chair didnt weboth pvp and pve have their place in eve and ccp have demonstrated they acknowledge this time and time again stop being so childish
reading the full context of the post u are linking to i share her statements and tbh i would state it probably a bit more aggressive and i work in the management of a big international companyand i communicate with higher and equal managers in the same way as she did to these people and basing something that u stated here on 2 quotes would say more about u then about herusually those with a big mouth can get a lot done in a small time spawnbut then again maybe your are not used to the dutch method of just saying the truthcome over here and enjoy our freedom of speech and tought
it is inevitable that there are some rough edges in the initial release of evegate i thought it might be useful to have a thread to collate a list of things youd like to see tweaked note that this is a list of proposals not necessarily things everyone agrees uponinitial listset eve gate profile settings to default to no pilotsmore than 10 contacts per page in eve gatenext  previous mail when displaying a message
where does it say in mmo that ure supposed to fly with ppltell that to the blobs im sure theyll agreeoh wait
i would like ccp to give players more tools to do this themselves i dont like the idea of ccp being involved in this so if you wanted to buy a space arena you could they could also buy sentry guns to attack unruly audience members who enter the arena unauthorized but if the neutrals tank the sentry guns well thats eveit would be nice if the players had their own types of tournaments and didnt have to rely on ccp to come up with them i think the idea of an arena is too barbaric for high sec so they should only be in low sec or null sec they should also cost allot of isk  a new thing for industrialists to build corps could get a good reputation for holding professional tournaments in their arenas and start asking admission fees it could be another business avenue the arenas could have varying sizes and they could have timers or what have you the cost of sentry guns would have to be quite large so you would have to pay a  ton of money if you wanted a really secure arena the arena itself would really just be like a balloon force field that indicated if someone went out of bounds it would be great if bets could also be accounted for
i am in low sec i want to be immune to danger i get a friend duel him we both happily sit there because by ops proposal we cant be attackedno
noyou can do this by can flagging actual risk of getting it dishonoured existing is fine and good a instanced arena would not teach anyone anything about pvp it would instead teach people how to fly pimped gay fits which theyd never do in real tq pvpthe idiocy has been brought up many times before and has always gotten the same answer gtfosisi exists if you want riskless duels wout interference
im glad im doing pve for a while because this would bother me change supported
i support your doing pve
dont really know why this was nerfed tbh the wide screen is superior to the standard for pvp i would like it back as an optionedit removed because of issues with new cameras can we look into fixing those issues
ive been wondering if it is at all possible to do id imagine one could as one can already use an api to view its content what i want is the ability to fit stuff from containers more specificly station containersvaults i have for some time now had the maximum numbers of items allowed in a single station 928 separate stacks or something like that basicly it got to the point where it started to take a very long time to open my items i did a petition to see if the problem was the number of stacks or just the number of total items thousands of itemsstack i did a petition and ill throw in some of the messages hereafter this i got told to try and manually clear all caches in each seperate folder that a gm linked me this didnt do anything so i sent thisi then got asked in what stations this happened to wich i said it only happens in my primary station i only have about half as much is secondary stationsthis is then the advice i got so after this i divided stacks into containers with main focus on drones ammo salvage faction etc now while this works fine with roughly 450 separate stacks and roughly 20k separate items still unsorted its still a bit slow to open and a mess to use when fitting shipsive had more items than this without having any load delay before so im wondering if its something that happened somewhere in dominion this put aside its just a bit anoying not gamebreaking so im not gonna whine i have to wait id like the ability to fit a ship using the very nice fitting screen you gave us ccp  but to do so without having to move items out of station containersas i said initially im not even sure if this is possible but if it is i would absolutely love it this would be beneficial for those that fit ships for the corpalliance aswell as they could simply just move cans with stuff into a station and get ships traded and hit fitan even more advanced feature would be to select which cans the fitting option would draw items for but that is just wishful thinking at bestso im just putting this out there i dont see how this could be negative in any way but how it would be benefit the players and the game i can only presume that having people stack items in cans will reduce server load as you only have to query so many items at any given time
5 minute post delay ftwnow this of course leaves us with the question how am i going to find stuff thats in cans from a remote location as is the only way ccp let us do that in game afaik is to do a contract at which point it lists everything inside the can however there are tools that make use of our apis in such a way that one can see the content of your containers even out of game so im a bit fuzzed as to why ccp wont let us do this in game enable this maybein any case ill leave this for debate ill say again that i dont see how this would harm anything only benefit the game players and the servers but thats just a mad mans talkhalsoy
would love for fitting from cans to be implemented as well as being able to remotely view cans if the api can do it why cant the clienthave wanted this for a while but been to lazy to write up something for it 
this
you got podded in 10 space after saying it was impossable your opinion is invalid fail
ok yeah this is clearly a metatroll
so ccp where are the alliance logos its been voted on and put forth by the csm we have yet another major expansion to the game with nothing about alliance logos where are theyits not that hard give me access to the code and ill do it make it so we can put them in ourselves and police it ourselves or if its really something that you dont want us to have take away alliance logos all together its not that difficult

when you are in combat and spamming ctrlclicks sometimes it can change your align point and end up getting you killedthe proposed change is that when you are holding ctrl or any other modifier key while you click in space it has no effect on your speedalign as it would if you had normally double clicked in space

nowar decs kill corps that wont protect themselves if there was no wardecing without the other party agreeing who would wardec this separated the wheat from the chaff those who can lead and made a good corp will prevail those who dont well they dont last long and that is fortunate
i am not sure if it is in one of the chronicles or in the eve apocrypha novel that i read this but as the story goes all wardecs are looked at by a concord official or group of officials to see if they should be allowed or notnow it seems to me that the current officials are either asleep with their foreheads on the allow wardec button or they arehave been bought off to allow all wardecsso the fix is simple replace the current officials with new ones who must pass a revised test to see if they are fit for the position as the current process for selection is obviously faulty and appoint an oversight committee to further guard against corruption of this specific groupcapsuleers are demigods not gods they have limits and those limits are imposed and enforced by concord wardecs were never intended to be the free pass they are nowbefore anyone pipes up about the socalled fee that fee is only to submit your wardec and to continue hostilities assuming hostilities are permitted it does not guarantee that your wardec will be allowedbut considering how big the hole the quality assurance department must fill in courtesy of the tyrannis dev team i doubt they have any spare personnel to fill these roles so even if my idea is workable im not expecting it to be implementedwell ever
i dont mind it as long as concord is removed along with nonmutual wardecs
look did it ever occur to any of these care bears that some other care bear group wanted to care bear in the area you guys got to first and so they hired someone to make your life a pain im sick of people crying about war decks and anyone that says this game is not a pvp game truly does not understand the overall driving force of this game everything in this game form the market indy side of live is driven by the pvp demand in one form or another look i have a few friends that care bear all day and i felt bad when they got stuck in a crap situation and had no way to defend their stash but ya know its hard to be too sympathetic considering they all have billions and the thought of paying someone else to defend them or spending money on anything other than there miner stuff is just not acceptable to themyou need to figure out how to do business this factor has been around for quite some time and others have figured out how to deal with it is it really that hard to try and work together and practice some pvp to defend yourself you have so much money compared to the avg pvpr and while 1vs1 you might not be as well most indy groups are far more organized however their lack of experience makes them panic and the factor of loss is just too great to themlook crying in the forums about how you cant stand getting killed because chances are high that the first few times you got targeted you cried and became a favored target by many mercs learn to read between the lines and figure out a tactic crying about it just makes you look bad  weak and now i hope more mercs will come find you and hunt you out as you have placed a giant bulls eye on your name like some others said join an alliance figure out how to find like minded people who have figured out what you have not basic pvp skills dont require months upon months of training or practice the time it took you to write your posts you could have been reading a few pirate guides on pvp and tactics and target pickingthere is so much you can do aside from cry so try maybe asking for help on concepts such as hay guys i have been decked so many times and i really dont know how to stop from being a target or move find a better place thats not in super care bear area but ooo you might have to find a different way to do things and hay you like were your at why should anyone else have a chance to do what your doing you were there first screw them  o wait they paid someone to run us out of town  screw you cry baby

type sorting does not work in listdetails view only groupbut either way it sorts them alphabetically in a completely arbitrary waythe easiest way to fix this i can see is to tidy up the nomenclatureor introduce the type option to listdetailsi like my method better because it would look better in listnot everybody wants to memorize every icon in evesome of us like to do the extra reading
the mechanics skill group has been cluttered by skills that dont quite feel at home theresuggestion  all rigging skills and all shiptypeoutpost construction skills should be moved to different or new groupsthe science skill group could use a cleaning as well perhaps moving some inventionspecific and t3 reverse engineering skills and of course skills for item usage such as the doomsday device and jump portal generationthese changes will not take very long at all and would improve the overall quality of the skill groupsthanks for your time
i think thats a good idea reorganize the skill list and where neccesary add some more skills navigation some higher level armor and shield skills specs for the xl guns more mining skills to improve speedyieldetc
op supported
why not scrolling through 30 skills isnt too convinient having smaller groups or more balanced ones will make setting up traning queue faster and less cnofusing
seriously even the default windows calculator have digit grouping ingame calculator is useful to anyone whos in productiontrade business in eve and it would be much easier to use it if it had digit grouping
i agree another simple easy change that would add to the players experiance
people use the ingame calculator
this thread is a rehash of a previous csm proposaldescription here
you already passed this why are you trying to pass it again
it never got implementedthe courier missions are still being redone but theres no talk about making the dropped loot valuable only bulky
not supportedif only cause every post ive seen from mazzilliu has been a waste of my time
i agree as a camper my self on my main i have to say many people dont understand the tricks involved with gettn to a cloaked pilot adn its very doable orbiting the gate at 12 with drones out is not the trick but with practice and skill its pretty easy there has to be some way to get by cloaking is nothe problme so it falls back to tactics your idea is old and dated and has been denied for very good reasons by ccp who is far smarter at considering everyone before making a change if they say no there are some reasons for it and i sugest you learn how to fly destroyersthey have plenty of roles and fw for one really gave them a bumb sadly only one of them gets a dps  which is why its the most feared by many frig pilota bt that doesnt mean the others are worthless everythign in this game for pvp falls onto the world of tactics who you fly with what you do there is something for everyone if youw ant to decloak people be an inty pilot and figure ou some tricks other then ships that can warp cloaked and even them at times back in my inty days almost 99 of the time i was able to bumb the cloaker proper bubles etc are key as well but again thats were tactics and skill come into play destroyers are fleet rides they have fleet tactics figure them out
i personally would love for ccp to put in and auto detect and ban system in place to get rid of these people who spam the jita chat with scams via macros and miners who use them with all the additions being put in place like new features ect im sure the removal of the macro users will lessen the server load not to mention the market prices stableize do to the fact that the real miners who spend real time mining ect will not be rediculasly under bid by those who just run a macro and collect
dude  do some home work ccp bans many players and they go in large waves as that is the most effective ks yway to sweep the problems out 2nd of all sadly most of the scamers and such in jita are simple cut and paste live players just like you and the game is buyer be ware they have changed somethings in contracts to amke it harder but people keep thinking of new tricksu want to stop scammers and put them all out of buisness then figure out a cure fo greed and lazy people because without them scamers would make nothing from scamn
make it so you can be targetted while emergency warping in all casesmake it so you cant warp out of bubbles while ewarping and you stop ewarping if a bubble is dropped on you in all casesalso cut your agility by halfor double it whatever makes you
1 only insofar as you can be targeted while normal warping 2 obvious yes 3 why this seems crazy 4 tentative yes ewarping should have the same game mechanics as normal warping except that youre logged off
3 if someone logs off in a belt instantly when someone comes in localeven robotically you might say then the increased warping time gives the attacker a chance to scan them down in the belt and maybe catch them if theyre fast enough or lucky enough this change means that logging off is not any better than warping off in any possibility
i see what you are trying to do but the same arguement will apply  those players that genuinly lose connection shouldnt be penalised not supported
bad ideas this will hurt people with bad connections more than help people wanting to gank players in gate campsall ccp have to do is make logging off take 510 seconds if you do it yourself ctrlq will prompt a 510 second timer at the end of which youll get a confirmation box are you sure you want to log off or something along those linesedit on second thought theres nothing stopping people from just unplugging their router instead of ctrlq so it would be pointless and a waste of time making the log off thing just deal with the cowards tbh
what athena said i some times lose connection and we all do i have never logged off to avoid a kill i have the kill mails to prove it lol cry but i shouldnt die when my fn isp drops me either
if they log of in a belt cuz they were ratting then they are agroed and can be probed out and killed while not logged on pretty easy the main warp changes were becuase of a log off trick  exploit that was abused big time to change warp in points when a target was getting hunted they could just log off and on a ton of times and the waiting hunters would never know were the target would land and more often then nto land 200  away from the max warp point a cheep tactic
just a little usability issue here the assets tab information need to be sorted into columns so you can say sort your assets by how many jumps away the system is or sort by how many items you have it also makes it easier on the eyes
minor but sensible
ummtheres already an option to list by name of system number of jumps and quantity of items its in the upperleft hand corner there are also options in each dropdown menu to sort by name group quantity and slot and then there are 5 tabs to look for things everywhere in the region in the constellation solar system and station theres also a search function strangely enough though theres no option to sort by meta level ive already posted a thread about that though
i just have to say thisquit being a ing dumbassediton the most likely false assumption that this isnt a troll uh huh sure file a petition you idiot
reported for shouting excessively and trollingwhen is ccp going to muzzle this noob
m8 you lost a dramiel to a badger your opinion is invalid
i am typing in all caps that means csm and ccp will know im serious and do as i say and the community will support my proposal cause its how you shout in text lololololactually no
if you are not happy with your alliance name please let your alliance leader create a petition under game playcorporations  alliances category
right now lowsec income is pretty terrible so heres a few ideas for making it better1 move dark ochre and hemorphite to lowsec exclusively and make it available in all lowsec systems currently dark ochre hem isnt mined very much because the vast majority of nocxium comes from mission loot but with the mission loot nerf people are going to have to start mining it dark ochre is the main nocxium bearing mineralwith hemorphite trailing closely behind with a few other minerals bearing only trace amounts of nocx nocxium is also the most transportable middle end ore there is this should bring miners to lowsec because if the majority of the nocxium needs to be mined the price will stabilize to the point where it becomes worthwhile to mine in lowsec despite the ship lossesnocxium will still be available in 00 though crockite jaspet and hemorphite the issue is that you will need to import nocx to get a balanced mix2 boosting ratting right now lowsec belt spawn profits are somewhere between the profit gained between highsec and that of 00 the problem is that lowsec is more dangerous than 00in that it is more crowded but it also has the advantages of being easier to deal with logisticallymany npc stations closer to empire safe gate passage for small ships that dont dawdle i think that the ratting income of lowsec should be increased so that it is about 5075 of the income of corresponding 00 systemsto 01 sec is 75 the income of awesome 00 space 04 sec has 75 the income of terrible 00 space3 more 00 entrances add many more 00 entrances so that you can enter 00 any time you want if you are simply willing to take a few jumps extra currently in some places you have to spend half an hour to an hour flying to get around a single gatecamp and thats bullmore entrances means more people entering 00 through gates and that means more passers by for lowsec pirates to kill
1 i dont think you got a single fact correct in that whole proposal the most nocxheavy mineral is hemorphite followed by jaspet and hedbergite all three of which are lowsec minerals dark ochre has a decent amount and crokite has a bit both of which are 00 rock nocx is supplied for the most part from the drone regions it is actually the second leastdropped mineral in missionsonly zyd is lower so the t1 loot nerf is secondary the drone metal nerf is the relevant one also having a material available at a higher sec but not a lower one is just plain weird and i see no good reason for it this part of your proposal is bizarre and stupid 2 not crazy but your numbers are off is bad 00 ratting really 75 as good as good 00 ratting if not and im almost certain its not youre proposing to make 01 better than bad 00 which is again odd and probably unwise also this got buffed in the fairly recent past im not sure theyd go for another 3 this one ill agree on space should be closely tied together close to empire and stringy and disconnected with lots of bottlenecks further out
1 alright by volume hemorphite is the nost nocxium rich mineral the details are going to be tentative anyways because ccp are going to be changing mining and minerals in the future anyways the important idea is that nocxium is made into a lowsec exclusive mineralthe place i am getting these numbers from is this eveo post
lowsec is pirate territory if you wanna make more isk in lowsec start pirating or you could sun lvl 5 missions and sell faction mods there are so many ways to make isk in this game i dont think ccp needs to waste time catering for a relatively small percentage of the player base
the title says it all the new cyno soapbubble effect stinks bring back the old awesome effect raaar rabble rabble rabble

wouldnt it make more sense to bump the existing proposal for this that already has 708 replies and 541 supports than make a duplicate proposal
change the eve patcher so when it shuts down eve to patch it only shuts down the one instance that is currently patching instead of all of them
i cant see this being worth the effort
as someone with eve installed 4 times i can rabble rabble raaar rabble
im sure you can that doesnt alter whether or not this is worth ccps time though
dear god yes
i declare this idea mine
since when is it full results when you dont list the votes for those candidates that didnt make csm or alternate slots kinda weird just saying
at the left of the forum open up eve insider  csm  results need to be logged inwould be nice if the link was in the devblog but they were at least released
took me a few minutes to figure that out yesterday p
thanks to everyone who helped vote me into the chair position of csm5 i was pretty shocked but you can betcha youre gonna get your moneys worth if i have anything to say about things let the stakeholder games begin
gratz on the win kid have fun in iceland 
glad to see my vote counted for a win this time congratulations mynxee
congrads mynxeei know you will do a fantastic job representing the players in iceland remember if youre only leaving scorch marks you need a bigger guntribe
well see about that
nice double post there isslertoo bad your voice will not be heard on this csm but i dont consider my vote wasted maybe if your campaign managed to get a little more into the spotlight but i guess the pvenonalliancetraderindustrialistcarebear spot there was well occupied by someone else no poison there that was mostly due to her detractors work and she does have some serious merit too beyond her unfortunate susceptibility to trolls and propensity for unpopular comments ah well i hope you will not give up eve politics now  there are a lot of other ways to influence opinion and policy outside the csm and thats where id like to see you diligently increase your infamity until the next election 
i would like to recind my vote for elise and cast it for ankesthasdhfg these threads are awesome if this keeps up for her entire term i am so voting for her if she runs for the next one you guys are too funny
translation who are you to have an opinionand ankhs supporters say were arrogant
this is actually a pretty good case study on how tea party candidates are doing so well in the us
its pretty pathetic but i blame it on the propaganda the tea partiers have been eating up since they were born
resonanza and shivani are both alts of natana who got banned from eveger from screwing up my csm 5 promotion thread there hes german and has a hot fetish for ankh
of course i did but due to the nature of the players in aaa i do not expect to have gotten more than 3400 votes off of that since most russians will have voted for korvin a good part of bdci for omber zombie and the rest was mostly divided between me and several other candidates and not giving a flying  about the elections altogetherwhy is it that someone is full of hatred and other abnormalities the second they quote unpleasant thruths about the candidate you adore why are you staring yourself dead at the amount of votes while im much more satisfied with the quality of the actual support that i receivedthats what the haters said last time
first off this is not about not agreeing with someone but you cant respect a legal a democratic election result you are trolling and even harassing a candidate you dont like period post with your main finnbonkyhonky instead of your editorial alt  sitting duck in a station for years and trolling and flaming on the boards at least have the balls to post with you real mainits fine to have  an opinion but please respect that over 3000 players have another opinion than you and their opionion is as valid as your opinionfirst off id like some proof backing up your accusations and assumptions second id like something of the stuff what you are obviously smokingfor the record i am italian not german have not visited a german board ever and the fetish prize goes to youyou are obsessed with lust for ankh obviously and you are a bad copy of hers you spammed each and every board i have visited so far with your promotion and each and every language channel ingamefinally i understand that you want to call everyone who supports your nemesis an alt or and alts alt but i am a person on my very own and not an alt of someone live with itwait now i get it you are finnybunkyhonkys altdude your hatred towards ankh and her supporters is scary it puts you in the same corner as the mummylover in psycho
no seriously troll post with your main
post with your main finnyhonytrolly seriously
this is pathetic and im part of it
wouldnt surprise me these threads have been thick with some very very obvious alttrolling and some of them seem to have a pattern by which they feign mental ation in order to make certain claims i must admit its a novel strategy a bit like urinating in your pants in order to embarrass the guy youre talking to
the pattern is easy to see really they all speak in exactly the same manner using good english but occasionally slipping in a german or italian word order or strange translation he also started posting in my thread on eveo within hours after he got banned from eveger all characters have at some point been affiliated with a certain corp in xelas and last but not least they are all spewing the same bull over and over again in exactly the same wording its not rocket surgery 
lets just call him natana he hates that
this please do post with your main i mean i understand that you hide behind your editorial alt but it is not hard to post with you main believe me i do it too i mean all guys and lads with enough courage do thatok i am older than both of your trollalts my toon is over 5 years ingame but i promise i will go easy on you post with your mainthe story with your sokrateszalt gets really old though
dun dun
seriously troll honest question since youre obviously very bad at trolling and your attempts to make people annoyed really are just well embarrassing for you personally why are you doing it youre an obvious alt no kills and only three losses a handfull of posts in 2005 and then a bunch now all supporting ankhybonkybonkers or her ideology youre in an npc corp and have been for 95 of your time in eve and your sec standing and relationships show that youve never even spent an hour on pve either youre not fooling anybody and its pretty obvious that youre hiding behind your alt meanwhile sok is a csm candidate and aaa pilot with a long standing history and im a razor pilot with a long standing history both in and out of the game and more than 1000 kills with rzr during my time here nobody believes that youre really stupid enough to think that either of us are alts let alone that an aaa csm delegate has a rzr alt that hed risk burning by posting to the same thread with it so why feign such a level of stupidity and act so dishonestly as to make accusations that everybody knows you dont really believe and make you look like theres something wrong with you why dishonestly complain about nonalts from your blatantly obvious alt account using the threeyearolds taunt of i know you are but what am iand all in order to annoy people who arent annoyed by your trolling whats your goal and why wont you post with your main what are you afraid of im honestly curious are you capable of answering honestly or at least of stepping up the quality of your trolling
she was voted in due to a very efficent campaign and by kicking her out youd be invalidaing legit votes regardless of why you like or dont like her why not wait and see what she does firsttamber
what is pathetic csm hm
thisplus i expect that any and all candidates actually do as they said else i am gonna start a petitioning campaign to get a csm removed for voting fraud good thing about representatives is that the voterbase can hold them to their word and can start up a large roar when they dont and act opposite as they were voted forso look how representatives do and talk then
csm is irrelevant why does it matter if this person was elected or not wont make a difference either way
depending on how you view it p
einsteinyou know there are other occupations in eve outside pvp and missions do you ok in case you dont i am a trader and industrialist i do not need to leave my station to make up for my living in evei sit behind my beloved excel sheets quite similar to my real life job and manipulate the markets and earn hella isk the war for example was really a great opportunity for me 182 billion isk and countingnow have a good day dear finnahonkywonkytroll one day i buy your alliance and sell it to mollebtw who are you now finnahollywolly oder sokratesz your alt posting confuses me
i really do find this hilariouswether or not you agree with ankhs policies is not relevantshe went out and campaigned to the public and convinced over 3300 people to vote for her  take into account that most delegates did not have to campain or convince people to vote for them  but simply got gifted the position through an alliance block vote  its a pretty good achievementthe opposite end would be mazzilliu  who tried to gain the lowsecpirate vote  on the basis that her corp was in the distant past a lowsec pirate corp the reality was that she may have once over 2 years ago shot a neutral in lowsec knows very little about the mechanics of low sec  her alliances interest in low sec appears to be dropping super carriers  blobs into low sec for risk free pvp  now understands that posting cheesy look at me i am a girl vids does not get men reaching for their voting equipmenteven with her alliance supporting her she raised about 13 of the votes that ankh did strip out the alliancemate block vote and i suspect she convinced far less then 10 of the amount of people to vote for her then ankh didthis does not mean that i agree with all or any of ankhs ideas  but i do know who i think is more deserving of a csm delegate position
wich is why i want to find a valid reason to remove her from the csmbarring we are unable to find a way to remove her we should at least put up stricter rules on how csm candidates can campaign such as no fearmongering spam evemails
cool so lets get half of all elected csms banned they all have spammend and promoted in various channels and on numerous boards
no posting in other everelated forums with a single ad or having a legitimate topic is finethis however is noti spoke with her in local after this spam and she admitted to just finishing up her tour of spam to all the highsec hubs
quite aware thanks and im very happy any other pointless remarks you like to say
crime and punishment called they said youre posting in wrong forum and the tearcatcher isnt setup yet to handle multiple boardsedit cancel that youre already in there too lol
thanks for the reminder i hadnt noticed that miya had a contract out on ankhybonkybonkers in cp
as your alt i order you to stop posting
most of the people elected have a nice clear nondestructive except one path and deserved to be on the list props to mynxee for getting the top spot alot of great views and hope to see them all in the game soonit is worrying how many people fell for ankhs lies but over the past few weeks i did tend to see her unfortunately campaign more than others anyway good luck to all csm and hope some of your ideas get implemented
it was my first time that i voted for any csm candidate so iam not sure where i can read about the progress of your work in the next month
the main csm page on evelopedia gives links to where the minutes of formal csm meetings are posted realistically until after the first f2f meeting in iceland im mostly going to be in listening mode getting up to speedwhile i am monitoring the assembly hall threads if there is a particular issue you want me to take a particularly close look send me an evemailbest treb
sad to know how few people really appreciate pvp like you do i thought youd easily make it in but guess ya cant compete with alliance blockvoting missionhub localspam or boobies

tldr add to the tactical overlay a representation of ships speed in the form of speed vectors a segment originating from the ships of length proportional to speed well visible at any level of zoomthis feature should be an option of the esc menu to save on client cpu in case of need big fleet fightsthe overview should have a new filter to decide what ships show the speed vector out of fleet reds dramiels only  and the segment would be of the same colour as the top corresponding overview colour fleetsame militiasame corpetcwhen doing a 1v1 i usually look at my target to see what hes doing and anticipate the reaction time when the numbers grow i switch the look at between the various enemies but it becomes impossible after a little number of targetsresorting to the overview with its lagged and sporadic changes is not enough and also the overview is hard to follow when theres more than a handful of ships in the encounter a graphic overview  in addition to the table  is neededsolution ships show a vector that points in the direction where theyre going of length proportional to the ships speed a speed vector zoom level does not affect the vector length this permits at a glance to see where everybodys moving to even if zoomed out a shortcut key to turn on and off the tactical overlay would be welcomepossible variants smoke trails the problem is that smoke trails disappear zooming out i want this to be visible at large zoom levels to help small gang warfare the two dont exclude each other anyway also a vector causes much less performance issuespossible problems lag server side lag none the vector is a client only thing the client builds it based on info it already gets no new server coding is needed client side lag possible to avoid it completely add an option under graphics in the esc menu to remove the speed vectors crowded overview possible the overview filter should accommodate a new option to extend filters done for the overview to the speed vectors you could then show or not the speed vectors based on the friendlyunfriendlyin fleet status of the shipsplease support me i am for small gangs warfare
great idea thought about that toonot really sure about this one tho imo vector should represent distance ship will travel in a certain timeframe with speed it has at the moment so you can predict its location more or less using tactical overview girdalso vector should be projected to tactical overview gird similiar to ship location to make it easier a bit
tldr bring back trails
do want
1 it should stay the same size with zoom otherwise you wont be able to see it at either end either off the screen or too small it should turn onoff with tactical overlay
thanks for the support 3its important to see them when zoomed out because even small gang engagements can be at fairly long distances maybe change the vectors when zooming but not so much as the zoom would make them as a compromise
great idea
your suggestions would be a useful addition to the tactical overlay
do want along with other tactical overlay upgrades

signedjust look at the quantum rise trailer and imagine the gallente armada getting in with the new effect  totally ridiculous
bumping this because it is important and needs to be addressed
bump to express my support for most of theseeven if ccp doesnt do a big ui overhaul right now many of these can be implemented relatively easily
for christ sake stop trying to wowify this game plenty of mmos out there where you can slay boars for days on end and gain xp
i have no idea what exactly you are trying to compare with wow but i have a feeling you are trying to say that boring learning skills that dont serve any purpose besides sp sink is the opposite of wow in which case i think eve can use some wowifying
what im trying to say is that eve is harder to get into then most mmos and a lot of people are constantly whining about everything that isnt in an arms reach in the game learning skills do serve a purpose its not because you think theyre useless that they realy are
if i may remind you that we dont discuss about should learning skills be removed or not or whats your personal opinion about them this topic started as something that have in its base two blocks1 ccp wants to remove them2 ccp didnt do that because it didnt find good solution which would satisfy majority of eve playersand until now all people who didnt support are against learning skills removal and its nice to have opinion but as i said consider theirs removal as something finalnow its time to help ccp to find great solution and discuss with those two factors on your mind
can you link to this statement please im pretty sure ive seen it but i cannot remember where
wait what kinda overlooked that part in your op they seriously want to remove them cant realy see any good reason right now will give it some thought
dev blog  link  proof please or this is hearsay im not considering their removal final because you say it is sorry
supportedi feel that the learning skills are outdated and better use of your time would be spent on actually learning a skill rather than learning a learning skill
linkage
i think ive changed my mind one of their suggestions is that new players earn the learning skills by doing things  completing epic arcs getting x kills in faction warfare having the learning skills turned into an actual grind by people who apparently havent got a clue how to play eve in order to solve a problem which doesnt really exist would be such a fantastic achievement i cant not support itwhile they say themselves they wont actually do that i hope whatever solution they decide on is equally entertaining
tying the learning skills to player kills in fw might be amusingwell for about 4 minutes until people realise how easy it would be to exploit
welcome aboard

eve online tyrannis will be deployed on wednesday may 26  in tyrannis we are delivering a vastly improved contacts systemwhat kind of brainless driveling imbecile must you be to dare put this in writing ability to remove multiple or all contacts from watchlist at once  personal standings over corporation standings  all 10 set chars are now neutral but show as 10 when clicked with a corp standing of 00 are you pulling my leg this is beyond stupidityi demand my money back

please fix
this was a poorly implemented change to say the least as the op and others have said the lack of folders all but eliminates are ability to track friends customers wartargets etc effectively surely this turned up in your useability testing before releasei struggle understand why leaving the folders was an issue  surely it didnt add any complexity to the source code is this just a step towards a granderbetter tool than foldersregardless please restore the folder functionality
give us back our contact folders nowthe fact that this was broken by this patch is completely ridiculous was there no quality control testingalso the autopatcher is not working and i really dont feel i should have to download a 2gb patch yet again ccp please step up the qc quality control is more important than adding new features there are countless bugs that have been going on for months and years that are still not fixed i dont want more stuff i just want eve fixed 1 bring back folders for contacts2 fix the increased lag since apocrypha that is still a problem3 300 people in contacts list is way too few try 3000 4 our pos is shooting at blues not acceptable support
i want my folders back
we agree
proposal supported please reinstate the folders for contacts
im all with youthe new implementation is basically uselessthey might as well have removed it altogether wouldnt have made such a big difference to what theyve done to it
fix it
they wont do it itll go all vaporware on us because ccp cares more about marketing and sales at the expense of reduced functionality to quote one of the devs in a different threadso yeah once they fix every last tiny bit of lag that we can throw at the game then maybe theyll start thinking about fixing the removal of the contact folders folders screw up sol guys sol

hey ccp perhaps we can do something about this hmm i mean i pay subscription fees and you do your job seems like a fair arrangement
cmon ccp this cant be that hard
it is not a waste of time it is called customer service and even if they did charge 50 per logo alliances would be lining up for the service considering that any alliance worth the name has at least 50 members who would throw a dollar down for a logo

i support this idea

this is a good idealiang
love this idea you should callthe proposal making missions fun perhaps the ideas could be integrated with the live events somehow
who really need any interesting mission running or ratting those are just for grinding iskif you really need interesting content try to interact with other players there is lot of ways to do that in eve
im for this but you could leave some grindmissions for n00bsthat way once your agents feel youre ready they could gradually introduce you to this xp basedthere might be a need for a separate chatchannel that only gets accessible once you are referred by the agentsthis would allow the n00bs learn to interact with other players on these missions maybe this could wean them off carebearedness yea i know thats what corps are for and fw but alot of us would rather first team up against smart npcs and gradually get used to pvp is it too far fetched to maybe tie this in with fw in the future
or of course you could make that grinding isk interesting and fun instead of a stupid boring part of something that should be fun a game
the general proposition is good i do not do missions nor plexes that much simply beacause they are boring when i do its nullspace complexes beacause of the distant feeling of pvp when somebody comes to my local and shoots hesher combat probes out trying to finish the complex before being probed is a generally fun thingie ofcourse it ends up in a exploded ship every now and thenm but thats eve i know that i will be butchered for this statement but  wow has some good multiplayer pve content instances they really need tactic they need a wery straight battleplan and they need wery good cooperation of players big part of wow pve is purely grinding but there is those instances that are wery easily compareable with deadspace complexesnow take the basic idea of wow instances to eve deadspace complexes add dynamicity and that would be the ultimate multiplayer pve content of mmos it really makes me wonder that doing a gurista mace with bss needs about 35 rr bss to accomplish but is easily doable with two drakes so i would like to see also the deadspace content to change in more intelligent direction so that it has some means to make them unsoloable or unduoable i would like to see that if a single drake engages a 1010 complex all the sentry towers would be neut and web but if coming with a fleet there could be a little jamming or sensor dampeninghowever i do not like the fact that there is only two deadspace complexes that are not soloable with a single drake in a cheap deadspace hardener fitting and this is not ment to be a challenge to nerf drake but to make those complexes more intelligent so that they would recognize their enemies better i do hate the drake and i do not fly it by any means ive been forced to train a tengu to that pve isk content beacause of my principles of nbot flying a drake so make my 90 day skillplan useless and do more intellect pve contenti would like to add that the missionrunning intelligence could be a good way to add lowsec uniqicity spelling leave the highsec missions alone make completely new set of intelligent missions to lowsec and make those 00 deadspace complexes even more intelligent and fleet orientated all this would ofcourse need a little buff in the reward department ericedit spelling
in that case supported
why shouldnt making isk also be fun
i really like thisit would be great if npc faction fleets of varying strength would strike out into the heart of eve so that every planet moon and gate was attacked camped and then the pve community had to go destroy themor just small roving band or just anything besides these idiotic missions

seems to be an easytoimplement update which can save some hassle
unless theres a nonobvious showstopper seems like an excellent idea
this ui is beyond fixing it needs to be burned down and rebuilt from scratch with a team of competent ui designers and hci specialists in charge
need for a scalable font is a big one for me its tiny to the point of unreadable when playing at 1920x1200more customization would be nice too move things around etc
by renaming the bpcbpo as outlined in
rolling too many items into a single proposal like this makes it tricky to support  so i wonti support many of the ui fixes i do not support attaching the modular ui into a fixes proposal modular ui should be a totally separate proposal so it doesnt cause the other ui fixes to be rejected it certainly cant be left as a single bullet point in a list of fixesi will outline my objection to the modular ui right now and why i cant support this proposal whilst it is includedit creates a huge opportunity for exploiting see belowit needs some kind of limited scripting support using python whilst bits of the ui already use it could end badlyif ccp have to vet all modules then it requires a significant effort from devs who would be better utilised elsewherethere would be continued pressure on ccp to vet new versions of modules  they cant even find the time to put alliance logos into game let alone hundreds of random ui modsmodular ui is a gateway to exploitsyes ive used addon modules in other games but they were either pve or pvplite no consequences to dying other than waiting up to 30 seconds for a respawn even then people came up with hundreds of unique ways to game the addon systemin eve where ship loss has consequence any module that gives somebody an edge over a player using a vanilla client is damaging to the game as a whole yes anyone could use the same module but then you get into a cycle of having to upgrade modules every few days etc ive done this with other games and it was annoying as helljoin fleet make sure you have ctafleetassist v1234 and ctaneedarmour v234 installedshudderother people with detailed ideas on a modular ui have suggested that ccp could vet all addons and only allow certified ones to load thus reducing the possibility of exploiting this would take a significant amount of time from technical staff at ccp and would have to be repeated for each version of each modulethe next question is what you could actually do with a modular ui it is pretty clear that modules shouldnt be able to take action on your behalf so no automatically shield boosting when you get to a certain threshold and then turning off the booster again at another threshold but without the ability to take action in your scripting what are you actually addingeven if a module can only modify  filter ui elements you can get an unfair advantage over a vanilla client for example one of the suggestions made would be to add grouping to local chat so making it easier to highlight wartargetsreds in system sound reasonable unfortunately it makes local even more powerful as an intel tool add a likely ability to popup a warning message and youve just built a replacement for bacon which was deemed an exploitof course you can argue that such a module would never get past ccp vetting but again that kind of checking implies ccp spending hours of dev time on it then the inevitable forum threads calling out ccp for blocking itccp have already rejected a modular ui a number of times dont try to shoehorn it into a general ui fixes proposal if you must raise it again please split it into its own and sufficiently detailed proposal
modular ui has nothing to do with moddable ui the major difference is that with the first ccp makes all the elements and with the second the players run off to make their homebrew uimodular ui would be that players can pick from precreated ui elements what their ui looks like so combat pilots end up with a totally different ui than a miner if they so wish players can also say if they want dropdown menus as they exist now or a totally different type of interfacethe reason why this proposal is very general is because there have been dozens of ui fixes proposed already and they are just bandaid fixes i can reraise 50 issues or just create one issue that covers it all your choicethe proposal is a request for tearing down the ui as it is and building it from scratch with hopefully including as many features as listed in the proposal
crazy supporting all that has to do with fixing stuff that is broken o
poasting in a lol ankgjfkdfsdhfhdsfs thread ha hai have one major gripe with the proposal which is no moddable ui thank you there are two or three if you allow third party addons problems with this1 added complexity with the goal of making eve less daunting adding ui customization makes it in fact more daunting particularly if the default ui is not very usable and it should be said default ui layoutsettingsoverview settings are as of now very unusable and require you to practically spend 15 minutes whenever you reinstall to get to workable level2 it offloads fixing usability problems from ccp to the players as much as customization is on one side nice making players do ccps job is not making people unable to play wellcompete without special uifoo is also very bad and ties into problem 1 adding fix the ui as something a new player must do in addition to learning the numerous game mechanics eve has adds extra complexityannoyance factor 3 if you allow thirdparty addons you get something which is exploitableprovides a unfair advantage some addons eg sorting local by standings automated intel gathering from local automating many many tasks etc would not only become completely mandatory but would also imbalance many game mechanics which work just fine now having to download 56 mods to be able to compete also adds to annoyance factor reallyin addition to this ccp has a certain vision of how eve should visually look like and if anything that is a major reason why they wont go for moddable uietcso while general ui improvments are good and nobody can really argue that they are not which is why its very popular to propose ui fixes among wannabe internet politicians i cannot support the original proposalit would be nice if first and foremost ccp made the default uietcoverview settings more functional explaining to newbies how they should set up their ui for the 100th time gets boring fast improving the coverage of overview customization in the tutorial would be good as well as making overview customization less clunky tabs im looking at you here
not supporting the interface although it has its ups and downs is the least important when i install i import my oldalliance overview setting join some channels and im seta modular ui would take time and resources away from truly important matters such as lag reduction both traffic and grid
agreedand dual screen support 
the problem i see with this distinction is that it is more a matter of degree than of kind just rearranging the buttons and menus a bit isnt going to put bandaids on many of the potholes in the ui to do that requires being able to rewire what the ui elements do and that shades into addon territoryi am totally in agreement with teadaze here since the perfect is the enemy of the good csm has to keep updating their list of potholes that need to be filled and make building the hyperspace bypass a separate issuei further agree that the biggest concern about addons is the potential for exploits one idea that came out of the election campaign discussions was thisif ccp is going to refresh the ui anyway then take a little extra time and build in addon capability the official ui is thus the official set of ccp addonsallow player addons only on singularitythen people with ui concerns can build and test potential fixes which makes it easier for csm and other players to debate and refine them even if no player code ends up in the official client the utility demonstration and implementation skeleton should be useful to ccp and i think you will agree that it limits the potential for exploitsthe questions are a can a business case be made for such a proposal ie will it save them money and b will such limited addon capability be a useful tool in getting ui changes implemented
i think theres quite a few different ideas as to what these words mean and it may be confusing the subject a little making the ui modular and creatively dynamic would then allow it to be modable and so would be the first step i think this is what anhk is getting at and allow much easier changing of existing problems making or allowing ccp player mods would and should be a later development although im still of the mind that player made anything that effects the game shouldnt give anyone an advantage to those that dont code or cannot use these mods properly and would need intesive ccp scrutinytamber
agreed the ui needs desperate fixing its far too clunky
i dont understand the fairness objection to a moddable ui basically what youre saying is that ccps ui is so markedly inferior to what players can create that anyone who uses it is at a significant disadvantage how exactly is that an endorsement of the status quoi agree that moddability is rightly a separate proposal from the more smallscale fixes you dont want to conflate the two when presenting the idea to ccp because theyre fairly different but moddability would be good ccp has already said no and i know that reraising issues isnt the best use of time but if you can ask around over lunch or something id appreciate it
as much as i would like to have moddability that opens out a whole can of worms and ccp seems to be unwilling to deal with that would be nice to have but elts get back on topic i would like to have a ui that is as adjustable and personasible as possible so yes i would like to have new ui i would like for one expansion cycle to be commited to it or for it to be done gradually full support it needs to be done sooner or later ccp will need to bite the bullet
how many rightclick menus should i have to navigate through to advise my fleet to warp to a moon
an example of unfairsomeone makes a mod  scripts to make mass bpo researching capable at a couple of clicks of your mousethis tool isnt released or released with full functionality to the rest of the communityi cant see how this would be fair to people who have no programming skill and i believe everyone should have the same advantages ingame if however every player submitted mod had to be vetted through ccp and then downloaded from one of their sources then everyone would have the same chance although this would probably cost significant ccp resourcesif however youre just talking about making the ui skinable with no scripting or macro functionality or support which is what i think anhks post is actually about i cant see any possible issues other than ccp saying theyre not going to do anything with the gui eve gui skins available as ingame items would be awesome skins for each race pirate faction rare skins i have a whole post on this somewhere in these halls probably on page 128 or somethingmodular ui to me means something more like thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagestamber
yet rts games which can also be pretty hardcore can have custom uis without everyone ing about that it would be unfairmodular ui would add more work for people to get right and i would agree more options isnt always better but then ccp could just make a feature to exportimport xml of ui and people can just take some standard onesfully moddable ui is however the only thing that will result in a good ui and if ccp would make a reasonable ui themselves the advantage of other people wouldnt be too large besides that it is just a matter of downloading the ui yourself if you also want that advantage i dont see anyone here complaining that if i go to a belt to pvp with normal overview settings in a fleet i might as well self destruct there it apparently is okay for people to customize it
a possible solution for the fairness issue is that all addons be public opensource digitallysigned by ccp and revokable by them so no secret iwin buttons the halflife of an abusive addon would likely be days but the issue of the cost to ccp of responding to abuse complaints is a significant onevery pretty skin btw
fix some of the damn factions too edit 5 minute repost delay sucks  why is everything created by ccp designed to be as unpleasant to use as possible
would love to see some attention given to fw but cant support the proposal for these two reasonsa fairly large proportion of fw players are experienced pvpers who dont care for politics and occupancy we just want a fight with out the bull of null alliances and time consuming logistics these older players often provide a link between fw and null sec while also passing on their experience and enthusiasm to newer pvpers fw needs to be a place where the jaded and cynical eve crusties can relax in a t1 cruiser while those who are fresh and eager from the null sec fights can learn to fcim worried that thinking of fw as something for new players and carebears will turn it into a mini version of null and consequences to system occupancy stinks of alarm clock ctas the biggest strength of fw is that its a melting pot of people from all round new eden and that is the thing that needs encouraged the mostthe op is too vague to be able to say how much of it is a good idea so ill respond with a list of things that i see as the bedrock of fw and the reason ive spent more time in heimatar than null sec consensual pvp that is open and available to all interesting mix of people abilities and fleet sizes no consequences that are important enough for ceos to call an alarm clock ctas ie no station ping pong or economic repercussions for the losers other than ship costs no rewards that are big enough to attract the attention of null alliances low logistical requirements no tcus poses or other requirements to spend a billion isk and play anchoring onlineedita number of alliances and individuals have bankrolled militia corps in the past and it only works when both sides have the resources to fund capital ships otherwise you end up with two groups of bored pvpers who wont engage because of the inevitable hot drop while its nice to have the occasional cap battle the last thing i want to see is the fun little groups of 5 or so pvpers dying out because theyre worried about alliance blobsanyways grats on getting elected and good luck in getting some dev time for fw theres some good stuff in there so i look forward to seeing the proposal when its more fleshed out
faction warfare on war for occupancy is mostly dead if you look at plexing stats you can find that from every militia there is only total 50 chars who take more than one or more plex  day and if you know better about those chars you can find out that almost half of those are pervs members or their alts there is also couple of known gallente plexing altsso total number of actual active plexers is quite low ccp does not fix fw plexing because only about 3050 actual players play it on dailythere is no reason to take plexes or fight those so there is no fightning plexing happens mostly when you can do it without resistanceso i do support that ccp should fix bugs because exploiting those is bad for overall attitude for exploiting some players thinks that it is all right to exploit those bugsbut as fw is dead it is just waste of time to fix those it is just better to end this war or change it to working one fixing bugs does not change the fact that no one want to plex there is no reason and there is no way to force or encourage people to go in the plex and fight to the endonly thing that people are happy is roaming with blob from oms to tama and back blob  the thing you can do better in 00 sofw is dead
supported in full
i think that fw not just need some bugs fixed rather than get build up from scratch again but as far as we know that will never happen just like most of the stuff in csm
ha ha posting in a ankkerwjnrjw threadanyway not supportedsure bugsexploits need a fix nobody rational will oppose thathowever plexingsystem occupancy stuff has no tangible benefits really or reason to really fight over itbut on the other hand if this has a major impact and really hurts the losing side then you have the 00 sov warfare reloaded with mandatory ops  blobbery and crap and i suspect most bored 00 people who tried fw got away precisely to avoid that crap only having sense from a roleplaying perspective means it belongs in the  nobody cares about cathegory financial incentives for winning side do make sense somewhat but on the other hand if its not significant it again belongs in the  nobody cares about cathegory and if it is it will get farmedexploited naturallyalso tons of fw action really boils to form blob roam a pipe like tamaoms or area around amamake fight some other blob rinse repeatwhich adds just more of the boring type of pvp and has only really had negative effects on the whole from increased blobbery of fw peoples to forming of supersized pirate corpsalliances which blobhotdrop left and right basically reducing small scale pvp action in fw areas to practically nonexistent and driving people who do anything productive out of fw areasmost old lowsec denizens have gotten to really despise fw because it has brought a few good things and a lot of bad with it
whats with all the melodrama fw is the single most successful low sec initiative ive ever seen and its a solid base to build on as for your argument that theres no fighting because everybodys too busy blobbing i hope you can see how youve just shot yourself in the footpeople do not join fw to orbit timers they do it to get fights so forcing people to participate in pve activities like plexing will drive them away from fw sure you get blob fleets but theres plenty of smaller fights if you want themfw is as dead as eve is dyinggeneral support for op added but with reservations outlined in my previous post
there is no fix to fw since it is fundamentally flawed it needs to be rethought and redesigned from scratchi made my suggestion as to how to go about it a while ago but anything similar will do  as long as focus is on pvp solosmallgangfleet with rp as a backdrop it will worksupported if only to keep pressure on the beeroholics
yes there is pvp but fw itself is dead no one fights for occupancy
and that is exactly why its successful
signed
i agree with much of what yani says fw has some truly awesome game mechanics the fact that you can get in a plex with only certain ship sizes means you can go in there and pvp without gettting blobbed just move away from the warp in gate and if they come with huge numbers warp if they come with something sensible you have some of the greatest fights in eve why doesnt this currently lead to great pvp in plexes 2 reasons 1 npcs in the plexes ruin it who wants to fight with your ability to win gimped by some intangible amount of rat dps and ewar from rats its lame fighting when you are under fire from npcs get rid of them in plexes and 2 militias arent informed when players enter plexes when someone from fw enters a complex gate both sides should know who entered where and ship types this is intel should just be provided via a seperate channel after all if a system is contested that means both sides have spies there giving info here i mean not player spies but just npc spies that will post in the channel that way the players could get a gang out there to fight them if they want before the plex runs no npcs but information about where you can find pvp if you made those two changes i think plexing would make fw the absolute best pvp mechanic in the gameedit i added this idea to features and ideas if you want to discuss it i dont want to derail this thread
some good points well made there and others that seem a little irrelevantthere is one gripe i have with fw at the moment and that relates to faction standings after the initial faction standing bump you get through promotions there is no way in fw to actually improve your faction standingsthis presents difficulties in a few situations including rr gangs where one or more of the pilots have 5 sec status not only do you take the sec status hit for remote repping the pilot but you also take a faction standing hit for doing so this just seems so wrongthis could be fixed by adding a small faction standing bonus to capturing plexes this would not only help those who need the standings but would also encourage a lot more pilots to take part in plexing which seems to be something that is desired
heres an idea get rid of the plexes altogether theyre an awful idea and should go
its annoying that now we have to brief every new player in how to fix evegate privacy

minor but good tweak to the interfacestill not fixed in tyrannis surprise
this is our universe and i damn well want to be able to play my role in shaping itpc will always trump console for fps playabilitythats not to say i hate consoles own a 360 and love it
cool opinion broa fun fact for you is that console players are different than pc players dust 514 is meant to bring in the console playersif you want to be part of the eve universe and have a pc you play eveonline if you have a console you play dust 514 if you have both a pc and console then it is just a matter of what aspect of the eve universe you want to help shape at the timewhat part of this concept do you guys not understand
this is a combination bumpextension the extension isthere should be a way to set a nonfirst waypoint to a system that is adjacent to the one you are currently in without opening the map for exampleim in aunia i just got back from a mission in agrallarier which is adjacent to aunia i need to go to eglennaert where i left my salvager ship and then back to agrallarier i go to assets find my ship set a waypoint no problem i go to right click in space go to stargates agrallarier set waypointand for some reason it sets the waypoint to aunia not to agrallarier so i have to go all the way through the map to set the waypoint this is less annoying than the op but still annoying
so ccp can give us back the old 3d map then steal the 2d maps from dotlan or that 2dmaps site and put those in everyones happy
its impossible to get a dotlan style map for the eve universe as it isnt planar ie there will be overlaps
the whole point here is to remove overlaps yes itd have to be done manually yes it wouldnt look exactly like it actually does but then again if dotlan could do it why cant ccpor maybe an option to show a symbolic map rather than just flat map
it may be possible to do nooverlap maps on a region by region basis but its not possible manually or automatically to do a universe map that doesnt have overlaps because the solar system graph is nonplanar
when the fleet number reach over 100150 pilots the lag is horrible because the fleet window refreshing every single seconds when a pilot join or leave the fleet or a client got a member loot  voice history message the fleet fights lags become worse than before dominion patch for this reasoneasy to see it check the little round icon at window frame every time when a pilot joined the little icon starting circle around and refreshing the fleet member numbers and the client get lag just close the fleet windows or drop fleet and voila the lag is gone or decreasing in a bigger fleet fight but someone closing the window he wont see the brodcasted commands because the ccp merged the broadcast window with fleet window when dominion came outso need a solutionsome timer setting need for my fleet window1 ccp default settings2 manual refreshing  when a user click on button no more server requests just when the user click button for needed datas  need for speed mode3 timer settings delayed mode  10sec30sec1 min5 min etcfor history windows like  voice member loot history1 ccp default settings2 manual requesting except broadcast history  request button for history displaying no more server requests just when the user click button for needed datas  need for speed modeother solutionsplit again broadcast history from fleet windows and the user can close the fleet windows but see the broadcast messages without lag

seriously you should not be hiding this if you want people to use it put a prominent link on the front pageor is evegate going to turn into more abandonware
regardless of
good ideas on top of whats been mentioned this change from tyrannis needs to be redoneit should be changed so high sec agents always give their missions in high sec likewise for lowsec and nullsec the current effect of this change is that missionrunners who dont want to go into lowsec will just move to a system surrounded by highsec effectively negating the assumed intention of this change in the patch because those systems will become more crowded
figured since all my post get rolled i might as well serve this one up and get it shot downif you are in a 05 system or higher you can not give any remote whatever to anyone not in your corporationalso in before someone complains that i stole their idea from themme winks at marlona sky i also did not use my signature writing style even though i still get much fan mail for it
can cause some problemsfor example corp a is at war with corp b and c if remote reps are forbidden across corps corp b and c cannot effectively assist each other against a common enemy
not only that if someone has multiple chars that are not all in one corp for whatever reason he would be unable to use them together in missions for example also it would hamper cooperation between friends so i think this is a bad idea
so nerf neutral rr why yeah it sucks when you have it happen but eve isnt supposed to be fair if you want fair go play an fps or something oh and give me all your stuff when you leave
i agree neutral rr is fine the way it is like i said in the op it is not my idea
i actually think this is a good solutionif you whant to run missions with your alt get him in the same corp or alience if you want to declare war on your common enemy together get in alience tough luck if concord kills my bs because my smart bombs hit an asteroid where peaceful civilians live sure as hell they should blow up someone for unauthorized remote reppers maybe you can give an exception and only make it for pvp or you have to be at war with the party attacking the ship you are repping or just ban it in hihg and  it i support not a bad idea imao
so why post this thread if you dont like the idea
emo tj was killed by someone with logistics althe also lost dramiel to a badger
my senses tell me that he must have lost a machariel to two rr badgers now or something
he is actually trolling the idea posted in features  ideas
however i do support the fact that retribution needs a second low there is a problem you cant give it to it if not taken away from somewhere else or without buffing the other afs aswell the other afs could live with a little buff too but to many of them a extra slot would make them kind of win for free cardsso therefore i would take one highslot from the retri and move it to the middle that would make it a lot more useablei too do not like having ships without point in my fleets the retribution is allowed shipclass thou but if any else ship is without point the pilot gets yelled atso basically i do support but not alone the retribuotion or if only the retri take move a highslot to midsloteric
the its not a solo boat argument comes up every time and tbh its got nothing to do with solo at all yes an extra mid would make it possible to use it as solo boat but the fact is that in gangs you can never be usefull apart from doing dps makes it pretty useless
i agree with this remove a high slot and put it in med
the problem here is that you seem to think that anything thats player driven has to be stopped by the players but thats not really the case  if the players are taking the game a direction that ccp doesnt want theyre absolutely free to nerf it in fact it may even be the right choice to nerf it to save the players from themselvesimo ccp should nerf nap trains because having 00 effectively owned by two large naps is bad for the game even if the problem is player drivenliang
nap trains arent really a mechanics issue theyre emergent behaviour we see them in rl for exactly the same reason we see them in eveedit im not saying i like nap trains only that i dont see how ccp can do much about them without radically restricting player freedom add smallgang objectives sure i guess that will help some but it will only make small groups a little more attractive not actually disincentivise naping you will need a very strict mechanism to penalise large groups concord charge alliances 1 mill a day for every blue thats 10 yeah all that happens is we get resets and people use oog apps or temp blues some such any conceivable system will get gamed its a player problem we have huge nap trains because we collectively want them
the thing about it is that using oog apps or temp blues or whatever is inconvenient and will discourage its use i think ultimately its easier to just get on the nap train and blue people youve never even talked to than it is to risk any sort of incidenthaving a hard number of blue slots not terribly high and not terribly low and an arbitrary number of red slots might at least encourage the behavior ccp could also use the treaties system and force people to only be blue in certain regions or something they could also eliminate the need altogether like they did with wormhole spaceim beginning to think that wh space is what 00 should have been outside of the fact that i really dislike sleepers and the inability to do anything solo in a wh i think its where i rightly belongliang
 barrier to entry new and independent alliances find it nearimpossible to take and hold sovdont agree on this renting is a great way to learn the 00 way of life and subsequently after this you get a feeling for the amount of isk that is required to sustain 0 presence you can scout for unused territory supercap blobbing what role should there be for smaller gangsthere is enough small roaming stuff to do supercap blobbing is cta wise usually combined with sov  pos warfare incentives to make players actually live in 00 spacei rat roam die and awake in 0 no real empirebuilding means to develop space is very limited and expensiveholding space shouldnt be a walk in the park with a blanc check about developing space you can upgrade your system ratmineinventproduceroam what else is there in eve megaalliances still holding too much spacefix the gridtraffic lag  once that is tackled large fights will happen and space will start to change ownershipnow with all due respect do you even life in 0 because im under the impression you are trying to carebear proof it 0 is for the big boys dont like mean and grief stay in 5
i think limiting blues with ingame means will just lead to out of game apps to track the redsblues of course you might have more upsets for accidental friendly fire but i doubt it will solve the problemup to c3 you can do site solo even in a hac zealot or cerb for me or a t3 cruiser for stuff above it really helps to have a good numbers in your timezone
the issue with alliances making money is seriouscurrently the pirate detection array does add anomalies but most pilots will avoid half the anoms generated because they are the low end and not very time  benefit effective the sanctums and havens at the top end are okay as are the hubs being reasonable but it might help if as well as generating better anomalies each level of pirate detection array biass the generated anoms towards its top endso when an alliance has managed to freighter out the pirate 5 rather than simply getting 2 sanctums and 2 havens almost permanently the numbers are more like out of 20 anomalies in system 45 sanctums and 48 havens with a few hubs and lower mixed in then the pirate 4 would out of 16 or so anoms generate 23 havens 36 hubs and a mix of the lowersthis would help make it more viable to have more and more people in a single systemthough some will complain that bounties in anomalies arnt high enough as well to compete with level 4 missions but id personally just like to see more of the usable anomalies per system that would make a one or two system holding alliance more viable
why is this thread in this subforum we have a features  ideas discussions subforum for this stuff
i too approve of wh space i think the great thing about it is that it demonstrates that we can have more than one set of conditions for nonempire spacei dont suppose you recall a thread of mine from long long ago some very nice ideas were put forth in that thread in fact arguably it kicked off the wspace concept in the first place bonus points for spotting the surprise originator of that ideamore discussion along those lines would be more fruitful than asking ccp to impose arbitrary limits on how many friends or enemies players can have
i think there should be more interesting ways to improve your space the current upgrades only improve the way you can make money granted you might have to first nerf 00 to make some of the more interesting upgrades viabledisclaimer these ideas are not final ideas still personally id like to see something like connect local to an upgrade first remove local from 00 and in turn give 00 alliances an upgrade to reinstate local in a system give us defensive upgrades maybe gate guns an upgrade to do a scan sweep once in a while to sniff out cloakers maybe an upgrade to give you info on what ships are in system for us rpers a propaganda upgrade that automatically sends a welcome message when a pilot enters the system give us some windowdressing upgrades that let us display the sov holder logo at the gatesstations maybe make some upgrades unique meaning that you can only have one kind of special upgrade per system give us the option to let neutrals use jbs for a fee and without a pwbasically alter the way a system behaves think outside of isk per hour make the different empires the players build differentand again those ideas where just from the top of my head and not proposals that should be taken literally
id like it if they did but its incredibly minor game balance  realism also ill pass
not nearly as minor as you think not about realism either but about keeping up a believable illusion of it things such as this seriously break the immersion for me and i guess for many others too if it is not changed now it likely never will and this will hamper later efforts to expand eve in this direction
ccp now is the time
ccp already consulted some scientific experts at the behest of many people on the test servers i doubt they will give those guys another call

i went and checked 4 random systems in my current neighbourhoodattyn channace tourier and annanake spattyn and tourier both had barren outermost planets at orbits of around 23 au both showed temperatures of around 300k id expect ice planets around there with temperatures close to 20kchannace iii is a barren planet too this might surprise as it is 82000km in radius about twice the volume of jupiter iirc of course its surface gravity is  0g last but not least its orbit distance is peculiarly 0 too further planets in the system show very similar valuesnumber 4 was okthat is 3 out of 4 with problems one of them outright broken they wont be the only ones if planets are colonized in this state i expect some odditites might be found that do not just have immersion related cosmetic for a certain mindset issues but actual balance problemsreally not sure what these astrophysicists did there
maybe its hollow
unfortunately i dont know if we can expect ccp to go and fix all those planets in timebut i would support fixing whatever they can to create more illusion of realism
the new icons for corp logos may be nice in a way but for some layouts they just look crappywould be nice to get the old ones back in so we are able to restore the corp logos to their original lookfly safehb
you are talking like a two year old so i wouldnt be talking
no
also binary systems i know that somewhere in evelore it states that technically all gated systems are binary but it would be cool to actually see the other star especially if they are different eg red dwarf  blue giant
there is only 1 sun and its not in new eden oo
new suns are a step in the right direction but actually dont look as good they need love
heres a nice animated gif that will show you the awesomeness of stellar objectsplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswhy dont we get to see that kind of stuff in eve
simple idea after coming back from a four month vaca and having to pack my ships and have all the gear pooled together being annoying it would be nice to have the gear packaged by ship name and then have the ability to drag that package onto the ship to have it auto fit when you get to your new homethoughts
1 save fitting2 repackage ship3 haul stuff to new destination4 assemble ship5 go to fitting screen6 load and apply the fittingthis works alreadyalso when you have been gone longer the limits for courier contracts got increased from 120000m3 to 981000m3 that means you can carry even rigged battleships in freighters now when you are using a courier contract might save you some isk on the rigs when the route is somewhat safe
in the overall scheme of things this is a rather minor issue but it happens enough to me to be rather annoying id like to see the period that you have to wait to reconnect to lost probes be reduced to say 2 minutes from the current 5its happened enough to me that ive forgotten to recall probes within a system but i may not realize it until several jumps later and im not entirely sure where the probes are i usually know the general area though as such im often stuck waiting 15 minutes just to check the three systems where my probes could beim assuming this is some kind of server issue but i dont see entirely what a 5 minute cool off accomplishes that a two minute timer cant i for one cant imagine that all that many people really spam the reconnect to lost probes button as such and for my ease of mind next time i lose probes id like to see a reduction of the timer or at least an explanation for why its so long thank you
add a reconnecting status with a countdown on the probes tab of the scanner this would avoid any possible leaving dead probes behind to probe out people in a short amount of time while allowing people to know if their wayward probes are actually in system with them
even with the nerf to t1 bs insurance you can still make a ton of profit off smartbombing the haulers i keep my freighter alt on the gate to scoop all the delicious loot
i will gladly afk 7 accounts in jita to get closer to the limit and assist the ganking at gates the op had me rolling about laughing ok not really but it made me chuckle
im not even going to offer a proposal here im going to just explain why im so edyou create a patch without thorough testing pi comes in and now its so ing borked large towers that used to cost 400 mil cost 40 mil million to make outpost that cost 15 bil cost 4 bil not because of player driven markets but because of poor testing on the npc seeded  that can be reprocessed for parts its not even about the money its about what used to be vs what is now the unintended effect people are literally building 100s of large towers atm because of your  up theyre building tons of outpost because of your  up and quite honestly how do you fix this mistake wo a rollbackabout the only blessing i have shooting any pos atm is that i know some dumb  probably gtcd 400 mil to buy it along the chain of isk in this game but now theres not even that saving grace of the disaster that is 00 obviously this was unintended obviously something needs to happen but i dont even know what to do do you unleash banhammer hell on people because your own sorry qa department couldnt see the issues one things for sure its day 2 and this is already 1 of many things that are obviously wrong in this patch sort your  ccp
i was actually looking forward to pi and was going to go into p4 product manufacturing but now its absolutely pointless
what you dont like outposts at 5 bil a piece or fully equipped large deathstar poses at 100 mil  and what do you mean pi should bring in more than 10 mil isk per day with two hours of daily work screw pi we never wanted those planets anyway nah just kidding fix this asap
no even better gallente vs caldarior maybe we could just put solitary on thereoh those are both on my computerif you want those games just go to facebook or myspace
opensocial should be on evegate from the start its the norm for any modern social networkccp are in bed with ms so they probably cant install apache shindigwith opensocial tools such as killboards mining apps calendars and all the extra stuff could be community developed without us having to wait 23 years for ccp to come back and finish featuresclunky api keys system would be a thing of the past with oauth
1 grats and good job with the first place toofollowing your advice i reposted the proposal i spoke about earlier that you found good
finally im on the csm i mean sok is on the csm not me thatd be silly im so going to enjoy the free ticket to fanfest
this tbh
shes really pushed your buttons hasnt she
i am guessing its his first crush
she must be doing something rightalliance tears more intoxicating than pirate tears
terminal insanityspecially for you the caldari civire housebandthe bald sexy guysenjoy
its funny to see that virtually the only people who are defending ankh only post with their alts lolanyway no i dont have anything against ankh specificly as a person but i think its just obscene that someone can campaign on such an antieve platform and win
most of the threads been alts pro and conthe campaign against ankh is using a lot of conjecture and digging up posts that are over 2 years old peoples perception of things changes they wisen up and opinions can be alteredanyway my points from 26 stand
this is pretty funny actually most of this antianhk stuff is pretty bsdid anyone bother to see the fw fix propvp assembly hall thread proposal by anhk sounds like yall got seriously trolled
did you bother to read the iceland meeting minutes in which ccp responded to our question of will you ever fix faction warfare with no ankh just started three threads there on topics as genuine as possible and i doubt not that if any of them ever gets addressed by ccp she will claim to have had a hand in it
did it happened  and if yes i wait impatiently the meeting minutes regards
the meeting was postponed i was hoping it would be rescheduled but i suspect it is unlikely now that the csm5 delegates have been announced the next meeting will therefore be the handover from csm4 to csm5 shortly after june 3rd
game designer is but one of many qualifications for csm you would also need interpersonal skills and the realization of the purpose of eve which is to meld pve into pvp in such a way that it attempts to please everyonei believe it is that last part that the tribune is againstbut anyway any news source can be unbiased and be biased at the same time it all depends on who rights the articles the tribune offered for anyone to write a counter article to theirs it isnt their fault no one took them up on the offer
quoting this because lol
this thread just reinforces my belief that ankh succeeded in seriously trolling jps
its a great ideathe programmers need to get away from their anal attachment to drop down tables this isnt a hobbit cave anymore guys get into the 21st century it should all be visual tip copy the us and uk armies on how they fly their drones nowadays
instead we get overview refreshing every 3 seconds now anyway supported
like one of the posters said we did have this at one time as trails and they should definitely be reinstated
great idea yankorion shadowmaker
good lord this would be awesome
do want
this is a great idea as people said the trails are wanted back
i agree that if its just velocity vectors not proportional to tactical gird its better to leave them more or less intact while zooming but if possible having more information than he goes that way and looks faster than the next guy i know you can check actuall velocity in overview but still would be nice something like distance traveled in 10s  should be visible enough i think that really depends on ship type ofc but doesnt really matter as long as well have somethingi just hope that if its ever implemented vectors wont be white or at least visible enough and having small icons for every ship hull like the one we have for capsule would be nice too
great idea supported sadly i dont think anything will ever happen its not the first nor 25th time it was suggested and every single time it was greeted with unanimous player supportplease ccp make useless tactical overlay useful
great idea
oh hell yes
yes please 
yes the font looks nice and all but its just too hard to distinguish some of the letters 
i find myself leaning forward to the screen compared to any other game please let us change anything in the font at all
currently i have to come up with workarounds to do the sameand manual piloting will still have its place especially when fighting more than one shipsupported
supported
actually a very good idea
either make it a 10 or 15 bonus to kinetic to compensate for racial resists or change it to something else like the suggestions from the op
im for laying the skills out like the kestrel it gets extra damage to kin but still gets a boost for outer damage types as well so it encourages you to use kin ammo but doesnt make your skills uselessjust tack a 3 bonus to all outer damage types to the current skills and see how it pans out
points at nano  ecm sensor dampstitans remote dd titans aoe dd stackable mwdsyes wines never did anything
supportedthese ships really need a buff to make them at least better than tier 2 bcs
find me a sane field command fit thats worse than an equivalent tier2 fit at anything okay the absolution loses its web but other than that
many good specific suggestions in this proposal and good job linking to associated threads for easy reference
support every ui chance suggested and would encourage you to continue adding to the list
right clickselect ammo on a cycling module the ammo will load after the cycle is complete many threads suggesting this
supporting all of these
worst expansion eva
what are alliances supposed to do  we can mark everyone thats an enemy as redfix this
agree want back folderspitty i did not see this post earlier post about folders
if you bring folders back please do it right this time if i move something to a folder the only copy of this item should reside in that folder not in the root and the folder
totally agree with the op ccp please bring back the ability to create folders for our contact listactually as things are at the moment the so called contact list is now acting simply as a standings listas such this makes evegate imo pretty much useless evegate also needs more filtering options eg  onlineofflineall not simply in the watchlist but by a persons onoffline status there is bound to be other filtering that others can recomend also please ccp fix the contacts list
folderswant back now
fix it
supportedplease fix it quick
supportedplease fix it so fast as possible
gimme back my foldersplease
my alliance has been waiting a bitquite a morale drain to get your hopes up hearing that itll be implemented next cycle just to log in and not see itbump
bump totally how hard can this behow many alliance members want their logo on it id hazard a guess at pretty much all of them
we followed all the rules and still no logo if your process is still broken dont go telling us its fixed nowand if its not broken wheres our logo
seriously i have never understood what takes so long in the first place this stuff matters to people ccp come on
theyre too busy rushing together their next crappy incomplete gamebreaking expansion
hallan told me to support this
supported alliances have been waiting way too long for this
supporting the idea of getting our identity 
noirdot also want to know where the hell our logo went fix it
kind of indicative of everything else ccp try in this game half assed then neglected 
first impressions from tyrannis regarding sound  jukebox seems fixed artillery seems fixed incomming fire seems fixed issues when entering a mission seems fixednot much detail regarding most of these on the patch notes but stealth fixes are fixes nonethelessso for me 2 big issues have been fixed  not hearing artillery and incomming fire still a big issue is still open  not hearing explosionsi just destroyed a slave pen which had an explosion so big that my whole screen was filled but could not hear a thing so i am still advocating for an option where we can turn off positional soundi will update the op later on after some more testing
i like that and what if the npc could be played by players just like in lotr mmo
so by your logic the riskless profession of afk macro mining should be jazzed up too how about we take out all tanking ability of mining barges hell exhumers too just to keep them on their toes sounds great and ill definitely have tons of fun
i dont see why not
awesome mining ships never needed a tank since theyre meant to mine not tank anyway
uh what what are you even talking about here please explain how you got that from what i said im not seeing the connectioni mean are you seriously opposing making part of a game more fun
note that i was agreeing with the jazzed up bit not the remove tank bit
apparently
u just dont get itthink about it mining is boring and riskless thats why im talking about making part of a game more fun in same way u want it to beby removing all the tank from exhumers that way risk vs reward applies and there will never be a dull moment for the miners call it an addition to this topics proposal if u will do u understand now but as u can see its exactly what will jazz up your eve experience
i agree the ui is often cumbersome annoying quirky nonintuitive difficult to use irritatingly fiddly and unnecessarily redundant i agree it needs work to correct those things however revamp the whole ui once and for all is too nebulous to support that nebulosity is reflected in your needed list which ranges all over the place from redesigning global elements menu replacement with buttons to new features customizable ui and clipboardlike lists to changes to specific features hot keys support font redundancy on menus to things ccp has already said cannot be changed differentiating bpo icons from bpc icons and yet is not a comprehensive list by far a revamp of the whole ui would need to cover much more territory furthermore the categorical changes you suggested dont address the need to streamline all those cumbersome tasks in eve that involve too many clicks too many steps and too many showstopping obstacles that are completely unnecessarywhich i believe any comprehensive ui overhaul would need to address to be truly beneficial for those reasons i suggest its better to break out ui fix proposals in a more modular way with each proposal covering a given area global fixes market window overhaul pos management overhaul contracts overhaul etc focused discussion for a given area of the ui is not only likely to yield a more coherent ontrack discussion it is more likely to attract experts whose feedback is very valuableof course all that involves some hard work first it makes sense to find related proposals so you dont duplicate effort however finding them in the turbulent quagmire that is ah is a chore then it makes sense to research evelopedia to see what csm has already proposed and what has disappeared into the the mystical backlog of infinite holding so a good wellresearched informed proposal takes a lot of effort but without that effort all we do is end up doing is spinning the same old  in nonspecific threads like this ccp demonstrated with the fitting window that they are capable of wonderfully functional ui design that also looks cool and is fun or at least nonfrustrating to interact with id love for the whole game to reflect that same quality but doing so would be a monumental task and in lots of cases require touching code that no one wants to go near not really an excuse for avoidance but given the crushing weight of other stuff in the fix list understandable status of ui fixes in the backlog will be on the discussion list for the csm5 summit in june if we can get some insight on that i think we have a better chance of assessing a realistic approach to proposing comprehensive ui overhauls meanwhile there are a lot of smaller fixes already proposed and active in ah that could use and should get support many related to the list provided in the op
i dont think you get good results by making lot of small changes you need some large changes to entire ui
unfortunately mynxee the problems with the ui have as much to do with its poor architecture and code layout and no ive not seen eitherbut having seen the state of the ui i can deduce it so it seems plausible that to actually redesign the ui would also require a fullscale refactoring of the entire ui code which is frankly already outdated theyre better off just burning the thing down and starting over
mynxee bringing small issues to ccp has proven to be ineffective in the past two years when ccp does not want to touch the fundamental problems they rely on ccp also stated repeatedly that they want generic big picture issues where they can fill in the technical details and not dozens of specific small issuesthe ui is fundamentally broken and needs to be reworked from the ground up raising small specific issues will not work as those are bandaid fixes and will have to be torn down as well as soon as ccp realizes they need to redo the entire ui from scratch
i like the idea of making the sisi client freely moddable with players then being able to submit those mods to ccp for approval put proposed mods out there for the dogs to sniff and if they pass the how can i exploit this test then incorporate them into the options for the main client
the only thing i want changed about the ui is i want a bit more flash and fanfare
fo schizzle
agreed id like to get a bit more information about how contested system x istoo exploitable wed find a way eventuallyconsequences to system occupancy losers would just quitswitch sidesno thumbs up this time too much too soon
this is the most important thing regarding fw i can live with or work around bugs as annoying as they are i can live with no real effect occupancy quite well and as unfamed noted effects can easily lead to the wrong reaction incentives to make the losing side more attractive need to be there all of that i can deal withbut as it is pretty much mandatory to control postdt plexing i can pretty much ignore any possible participation in fw outside of long holidays dt is during my working hours i can not be in the game thenits the source of endless frustrationquick summary for those who dont knowwhen a fw plex is captured it respawns in a given area like exploration sites except that say an amarr complex that spawns in a minmataroccupied system can not be found anymorein the situation where there is only one amarr system in the middle of a number of minmatarcontrolled systems  say they capture a single system in minmatar space  that would lead to an empty amarr system until the plexes expire from age to prevent that ccp runs a script every downtime to reshuffle those inaccessible complexesthat means that every dt such island systems will be repopulated with plexes but likely remain empty as soon as those are captured until the next dt this means that if you cant be there postdt you wont be able to participate in most of the key fights and battles of fw
the actual plexes are great  and can be a great way to get pvp the reason they currently suck is that 1 they are full of npcs so people often use a pve fit and 2 is the other militia doesnt know when you are doing them so people tend to try to do them with the hope of not being found they fit a fast ship and if the enemy happens to stumble in on them they will warp off instead of fight if there were no npcs and you knew the other side was put on notice as to where you are doing a plex people would use actual pvp fits and do the plex with the intention of getting pvp right now we do get some pvp in and around plexes but the npcs tend to ruin it and of course since you dont know when or where people are doing plexes you are just flying around with your fingers crossed hoping to find an enemy which is just a waste of time that could be better spent in pvp then when you do find them in the current system chances are they will just warp off because they were hoping not to be found i dont blame people because the mechanics are set up to encourage this behavior but if you do away with the npcs and just let the other militia know then people would do plexes for the pvp the missions can be left for pve but the actual plexes should be taken by pvp
1 for op to do a thread like this some things you say about the fixes to fw just doesnt make any sense or it just wrong and dont even fix the main problemfrom what i hear from other players gallente or any other faction is the blob the major uber
fixing plexes so that we can  pvp instead of primarily pve in them have them spawn equally in all timezoneswould go a long way to solving the abovea plex will a force a certain hull size a great way to split up blobsb get people off stationsgatesc they are most efficiently run when you can do them with one person each  that splits up blobs like nothing else if people would actually care about capturing plexessystems hint give rewards
supported but i might make the menuview market detailsmodify orderlocationshow infocancel orderreasons when youre going through your orders you almost always first view the details then modify the order so this reduces total mouse move distance since you dont always change an order and is an operations order hintadding a menu separator would be a good thing too lots of eve menus would benefit it increases the distance to the dangerous menu items and is a visual separator between safe and dangerous option
seems reasonable
up
1fix the lag2fix the lag3fix the lagrepeat 500 more timesnrevisit ship balancing so there arent so many useless ships for example anything that uses rockets or blasters
they all but stated that stations were there to be found
skotia i believe your issue is that when you set a waypoint to the gate to b in system a youre setting a waypoint in system a not b a bit confusing but expected behaviori support this proposal its bothered me in the past that there isnt a semantic difference between set destination and set waypoint a very common use for waypoints is pick up stuff in systems a b c and d and get them to system e and often you cant do this with the current system for example if your destination is your current system
a few minor graphical issuesokay id like to bring to the councils attention three small graphical issues that could be easily fixed as far as i am aware and would make a great deal of differences to the beauty of the eve universethe first issue is ships overlapping as they exit stations in busy areas such as in jita where youl often undock to find your ship inside another this phenomenon could be reduced significantly just by having two or more starting points for ships to leave the station from to clarify at the moment everyone undocks at the same spot and so you see a streight line of ships leaving from a specific point if there were two of these points you would have two queues leaving the sation but less overlap between shipsthe second issue is one that has been bugging me for a while now if two ships are stationary and firing at each other then the point of impact of the projectiles is constant and always hits the same spot over and over this just seems unrealistic to me if there were some variation in where the projectiles hit on the ships hull it would make battle look alot more realistic the new tyrannis tailer has some footage of fighter bommers bombing a titan and the bombs hit in multiple places to show some beautiful explosions cascade across the titans hull which just doesnt happen in eve thus far they all hit the same spot it seems to be the closest point on the ships hull to youthe third issue is a very minor one and i would hardly call it a priority but i will talk about it anyway stark shadows cast on the ship are currently jagged and obviously pixelated i dont know if this would be easy to fix but it would look alot nicer if it wasthats all i really have to say please respond so i can get other players views on this topic thank youarduemont
and give us antialising
small things but good point
sorry ccp i had tooplease visit your user settings to reenable images
on that note dear god the sidebar should have actual text not images i searched for eve gate and didnt find it also what in gods name is that link doing all the way down there if you want people to actually use it
i think i qualify as an active and engaged eve player who spends a fair amount of time on these forums it seriously took me five minutes of looking to find the link buried at the bottom of the  menu wtf put an evegate link at the top of right hand sidebar above the doesanyonereallyuseitmorethanonce search box where it will be easily visible and accessible
wow i didnt even notice theyd added the link to the menu one would think a big addition to the latest expansion would receive more priority than third from the bottom
this is a thing that has been bothering me for a while when i want to train a new skill i need to look though the skill and find the highest level for each skill in there because it is listed about 3 times and verys the level for each onefor instance torpedo specprerequisites tabit needs 4 skillsstranded missiles 3heavy missiles 3missile operation 4torpedoes 5however missile operation is listed 4 times at all 4 levels and on skills and with more required skills the redundancy gets confusing for instance large blaster speculation has the skill gunnery listed 9 times at levels 25 all i want is cutting off the lower levels and repeats of skills so we get a neat and orderly list of required skills rather then searching for the highest level of each skill
i partly agree with you i dont think that ccp should remove all the instances of missile launcher operation in the list because it helps show the prereqs to the prereqs at a glancehowever they should clean up skills like that one under primary skills and make the whole thing primary there is no point to it being there as it is a prereq to the rest of the skills and it is already shown but it doesnt show that at this point
personally i like seeing the tree but id be fine with an option to view it in tree mode or in list mode
here are some things that might help to spread out mission runners in highsec and at the same time get those people or new ones in low secin highsec  agents gives missions 13 jumps away never the same system this approach will lower the load on a given system and probably load at ccp servers payout is 10 increased because of that from reward to bounty seems fair enough you can talk to your agent remotely just like in the epic arc missions this means go to a dead end system where theres no one and do your mission there as long as its in the same region as your agent isin low sec  agents gives mission in same system no travel increases chance of getting more mish runners here rewards are increased 30 including bounty that seems fair but it could increase you can talk to your agent remotely no need to go in stationagent standings  from 20 to 10 all the agents level 4 and 5 lvl3 will be in high sec and mission destination will be in high sec  from 11 to 20 all agetns will be in lowsec lvl4 and 5 will give missions in low secthe isk payout from highsec to low sec will have to be changed and since we now what agents gives x mission and x system it should make ccp easier to say this agent gives better payout for those who are in low sec and less in highsec that seems pretty straigh forwardthat was the quick fix the long fix which i would like to be implemented is the new ai in every mission but if thats the case the isk payout would have to be increased because of the risk involved
i have done a bit of a survey today using cribba eve agentsgallente have 89 l4 q20 agents in low sec00 caldari 5 all from expert distribution btw the fun part is that the 81 out of 89 galletne agents are from division giving out a lot of courier missions and only 8 from combat divisions and some station get four level 4 q20 courier agents all in the same stationcaldari get 1 combat agents out of 5 in and the best station has 3 agent 2 courier 1 combat gallente low sec mission hubs seem custom made for isk farmers working for rtm rings and probably is the reason why most of the courier missions are done for gallente corps the whole distribution of agents need to be redone sadly i agree with malcanis that it will be mostly a cosmetic change we really need someone in the csm to push for changes in the pve part of the game i think that the guys saying working on pve horror ccp should work for pvp first and exclusively are damaging not only the pve players but themselves too as the current implementation in missions mission scanning npc behaviour and so on train player to avoid any chance of doing pvp while doing pve as it automatically mean failure note necessarily destruction but at least sharply decreased efficiency the problem is that especially when doing something about pve ccp first decide what is the source of problem then what is the solution then search for the proof that the source of the problem is the one they have already chosen disregarding any different dataso the solution always fit perfectly to the perceived source of the problem but rarely to the real source of the problem hoping for some better development in this part of the gamesupported
i also believe that if ccp makes mission runners in low sec a bit harder to get probed out only in low sec that would encourage them to go in low sec not impossible but just harder that isfor example you would need more than 4 probes to successfully get a 100 scan strenght instead of the easy 34 probes like now this method takes less than 2 minutes with good experience

we should punish the wealthy and reward the lazy and useless i am a pod who doesnt wish to do any work and instead get paid via a yulai policy which takes isk directly from the filthy rich 00 alliances who have made it far and instead pay me and every other person who doesnt wish to obtain his  her own iskthis game is no longer about warfare and barbaric grudges nc and sc have decided that since both coalitions are identical in both skill blobbing and power napping people that they will band together and form a ec eden coalitionthis new change will affect everyone so i propose we introduce a tax that only affects the wealthy and rewards the poorthe following new features should be implemented based on this idea1 new and poor players to get free pod and medical upgrades2 new and poor players to get isk on a weekly basis depending on how much they earn3 all expenses should be cut by 50 for new and poor players4 rich players to have 40 of all their income stripped from them to help poor players5 equal opportunities in 00 meaning alliances  corps are at risk of getting banned if they harm people not in their coalition6 benefits and tax breaks for those who wish to reproduce in incarnai will add more to this but know this would be an excellent addition to the game i am certain ankh would agree too
i like the idea of the weekly pay for newer players but 00 space is the corpalliances own area if someone comes into their territory they have killing rights i think and taxing the older and more wealthy players is not right if someone wants to help another person with their isk problems they would but most people will be very unhappy with that type of taxmork
lol its another emo threadthis is eve online not communism online
i know this is a troll but i cant help it  this one actually made me laugh for that it gets a thumb
i have contacted ankh and asked if she can ultimately share her wise and industrious thoughts on this idea i understand she doesnt enjoy giving ideas and will happy for her to steal mine for she has already stole my heart
i support the redistribution of wealth
sorry but ill only support socialism if it involves redistributing sex from those with the greatest means to those with the greatest need
socialism  freedom to get knocked up do you really want every 16 year old eve player pregnant like it is in the uk
given how many eve players are physically incapable of getting pregnant its a risk im willing to take
is there a way to make this thread receive more attention
not without attracting a lot of unwanted attention im afraid if you want a constructive discussion just wait a bit andor personally talk with other people who have experience with the ship
1 high1 midmini zealotjob done
firstly i dont think ccp has any real desire to kill largescale fights and complicated political power plays like some individuals in this thread might believe if they actually did prefer smalltimer pvp and operations they would have divided this server into parts and given us battlegrounds just like the other awful horrible disgusting mmos out there otherwise why put everyone on one server also driving the current 00 alliances into poverty by forcing them to spend even more isk on empirebuilding which would also lead to more barriers of entry or nerfing passive incomes is not going to get other smaller alliances into 00 space lastly naps are always temporary and very fluid and extremely exaggerated
another fi thread by ankhit is pretty obvious that empire can easily claim 00 the cycle on how this game works is lost on some thoughi cant stand blobbing however with the insurance changes on supercaps people will be affected by the loss of one it is still easy to build an empire from empire and working your way upto 00the only thing i see going wrong is people rushing from empire to 00 they assume some success in lowsec means they can handle 00 warfaretheres so many examples but so far the only alliance that ever was lucky enough to succeed was pl when they beat bruceall that needs to be changed is management and lagg napfests can easily be created in lowsec  empire and while experience is limited any alliance can make in work in their favour take a look at goons for example worst alliance ever full of useless pilots however they achieved alot more stuff than any other allianceif you want 00 just think plot and plan do not change the mechanics pos warfare was changed to add a isk sink on sov and i guess limit repetitive warfare dominion despite its problems has made it easier for people to conquer space in 00 sadly everyone wants to go against the most skilled alliance if any and get demoralised instantly00 alliance leaders are pathetic tbh none of them have balls todo anything with a nap so your best bet is to stage a coup using empire to purge ty alliances they are some really great alliances that dont deserve to be called pets and some ty blobbing ones that could easily be nukedtldr  you want 00 go for it plan correct and assault it is as simple as that but who really has balls and intelligence to do that
my idea is to make a lottery system like in real life the first level of the lottery can be a small ticket not needing slot of money say about 50000 isk is the max you can win with 1 ticket that costs 10000 isk you have the same chances as a real lottery with this one ticket you can earn between nothing to 100000 100000 being the max you could win it can go on like this for how ever many levels as you want it to go but the extra money that the players losses goes into a bigger jackpot depending on how mutch isk comes from the state and the normal taxes that are sent to the jackpot every time it resets also as ive said earlier extra isk from the lottery tickets determans how mutch the players can win in the jackpot for the jackpot players may only buy i ticket for 5000000 isk the jackpot will automaticly choose a random set of numbers and which ever player guesses correctly will win the pot but if no one wins the pot then it will roll over to the next jackpot the jackpot drawings will be between 12 weeks apartthanks for reading and please leave your coments i may or may not make changes to thismork
um great go do it you dont need to bring this to the attention of the csm or ccp there have been player run lotteries going on for years
well the way im looking at it it wil be universe wide and i just dont know if players can go to that type of scale
i get what youre saying something that is ccp run so that its trusted and lots of people buy inbut that would potentially kill the mini profession that is sleezy player run lotteries although that could be a good thing seeing as theres hundreds of themi like the word evewidetamber
at most there should be a way to advertise your lottery more currently its forum only and spamming local the ability to buy slots on the login screen and bilboards would be nice but no ccp ran lottery plz
what if ccp made a item that players can buy in bulk to where they can do their own lotteries for their corps that way ccp will have a way to be apart of it yet it is still player run hows that and for the jackpot the players that are running the little lotteries can use like a corp bank or just another bank to store the isk if they are trusted and have it go that way there are many different ways this can go
hmmm

great idea
this is a proposal to ask ccp to evaluate their attitude towards eve development and truly commit to developing excellent features instead of halffinished onesthis years slogan of ccp was excellence they made posters and videos about it and proudly displayed it at fanfest but for a company claiming to be dedicated to excellence their evedevelopment does not reflect this in fact excellence is sacrificed time and time again to the big god of the release schedule and new featuresthere are several examples of this lack of commitment to excellence ccp introduced factional warfare but introduced it full of bugs and with game design that was shaky at best and ever since introducing it have given it almost no extra and much needed development time and after care dominion and treaties dominion introduced a scalable iterative system that would allow them to extend it and improve it no improving has happened in the past 6 months even worse the treaties we were promised seem to have vanished and reliable sources indicate the treaties development team was reassigned to work on planetary interaction  the tyrannis introduction poss shooting blues and a complete screw up of the pi materials market both problems were predicted weeks before the release by players and i would honestly be surprised if nobody in ccps qa department considered it yet nothing was done in time resulting in the massive screw up that happened post releaseso what is excellenceexcellence is to go beyond what is merely good or adequate in game design it means adding features and extras that arent stricktly required to make something playable but make it more fun this is illustrated by the following graphicwwwmindsouporgstuffexcellencepngas is common in software development there is a subset of features that is sufficient to make something releaseready some features are more important than others and the core features are usually identified at the start of development as must havesif it turns out that the development team may not have enough time less important features could haves and should haves mostly get cut this way you can still meet your deadline with a functional product however as we established above the minimum is never the same as excellence because excellence is more than the bare minimum by definitionunfortunately it seems ccp are content to stop development on a feature when that feature is released even though parts of it got inevitably cut due to time constraints this means they have not yet reached excellence this proposal requests that ccp establish at the start of develpment at which point that feature is excellent this by definition includes more features than the core must haves to make it releaseready although they can still release it when it reaches releaseready they should continue development until that point of excellence is reached this does mean features will require more development time and therefore money but if you want to be truly excellent that is the price you paymaybe some ritalin tooin addition to ccp being willing to settle for stuff that is just adequate they are also easily distracted by new shiny things we can see this when the treaties were shelved in favour of planetary interaction and when factional warfare received no attention after it was released the planners of ccps development seem to run from one shiny new feature to the next like a kid on adhdccp will need to reevaluate how much time is spent on old content and making that excellent and how much time is spent on new features because due to eves competitive single shard nature small problems in various features may cascade and amplify eachother into big problems across the game cont
cont it is important that old features are excellent before it is too late and were covered in a huge pile of broken half finished contentis ccps frantic release schedule to blameare 6 months really enough time to develop new features and improve old features and fix bugs while it is awesome to get two free expansions a year isnt ccp risking quality in order to maintain quantity perhaps a release schedule of 9 months per expansion so 2 expansions every year and half will give them more time to develop existing features into excellence as well as developing new features into a good releaseready statetldrwhat we would like ccp to consider continue developing features until they reach a predetermined excellence level reevaluate the amount of time allocated to fixingdeveloping old content and reduce the nonchalant attitude towards reassigning teams to shiny new content reconsider the total release schedule time is it really sufficient to produce excellent quality game design
yes please
supported but i really will be surprised if ccp pay any attention to itthey claim to be 5050 split on developing new content and expanding old content but its getting increasingly hard to see where and what they are updating
supportedi would even go so far as to say push all existing unreleased content back unless its a part of previously released content until existing previously released content is up to the excellent or finished levelof course im an extremist but im an eve extremist
supported its hard release dates and rigid schedules that have caused companies like ea to scrap quality assurance testing in favor of well patch it after release and they never doto be honest i didnt want pi i wanted an industry updateyou know what i mean

i will miss awesome expansions like tyranis that allows me to make a quick easy isks but supporting for a greater good

certainly supported
yes pleasestop ting on quality in order to increase quantity
of course pushing back new content till everything is 100 is utopic at best and rediculously insane at worst but dedicating time to actually fix things from the past is imperative an expansion can be absolutely fantastic even without all too much new content as long as it brings the outdated and faulty parts of the game to a shipshape statekeep your promises ccp this game is godly by default but even gods vanish when the worshippers turn awayoh and just to note it i like the tyrannis expansion a whole lot things on my poses now actually move as theyre suppsoed to be the tower graphic and jumpsgate graphics beeing ed up randomly even when both screens show the same scene still happens though eve starts loads logs in and closes as fast as never before and it seems to run a lot more smoothly ingame also the idea of pi and henceforth dust is jsut great keep that momentum ccp
quality  quantitysupported
this lack of excellence is right now the most urgent issue within eve
definitelyeve is reaching the point where product maturity and excellence becomes more and more important eve has always occupied a niche but as it grows the current lets bolt on more features and see how it goes attitude while forgetting what you already have is not responsible compared to 9 out of 10 other mmos eve is lucky to not have had subscriber numbers decline please ccp make the right choices to keep up a sustainable growth on the long run by making an excellent product
100 supportedif ccp want to have 2 hey look headlines a year which is a perfectly reasonable thing for an mmo company to want then they should have 1 big new stuff expansion and one smaller review expansion where they fix update and completeedit ankh was right in the other similar thread here ccp are drawing on their credit with the playerbase with these continual halffinished botched feature releases soon or perhaps already people will stop giving them the benefit of the doubt and they will have no credibility left they will cry wolf once too often
agreed we need this much more than any new features anyway buffing afs eafs and rockets would practically count as new content since it would make a bunch of relatively unused things viable
i have a feeling this should be brought up in a csm meeting too tbhdefinatly supported oh and you diddnt even mentioin the terrible ui and general cleaning up of it ie setting multiple jobs still not possible after nearly 7 years
some features are more important than a release schedule and for the long time players its always these that get cut to meet the target dateplease finish what you start ccp
i canceled my account today because of the broken status on everythingcombat missions broken  lvl 4s in 05s will always send you to lowsecmining broken because ccp wants to let the macro miners set the price floorposes broken temporarily fixed but will probably break againpi probably broken since its so flat and bland and rookies can do it as well as a veteran it will likely pay rookie income not veteran incomecorp activity broken by spacebooks leak information default settingscontact list folders removed and wont be replacedrepaired because the label system is not robust enough to usetrade didnt suicide ganks spike after tyrpvp hooray for nerfing the deep safes that helped us get around game breaking laganything else not broken expect it to get broken sooner or laterill be watching dev blogs and the associated discussions but i no longer expect anything positive out of eve

i could post a quote of the ccp dev promising to fix rockets last year in october or november after dominion was released it never happenedsigned
1 fix rockets jesus
yes
thank you d
i strongly support this proposal
from all ive seen this is the root cause of every fight that the csm has ever had with ccp they want more we want better its natural given the incentives  we care most about having a game we like more they care most about increasing the subscriber base  but its not healthy i think the csm has the right side of this more so than ccp does because subscriber retention is a massive sticking point for eve but yes this has always been eves biggest failing lots of coolseeming new stuff but the 20 that doesnt work and the 30 thats just crap leaves a pretty bad taste in our mouths even when we think about the other half this needs to be solved and its probably the single most important thing the csm should e pushing for
yes
absolutely positively need to be able to make the font larger this has been my single biggest gripe about the ui to date
if ccp fixes hybrids they fix most gallente and caldari gun boats hybrids use both cap and ammo to top it off with a 10 second reload and a fixed damage type on top of blasters having shortest range in the game and rails having the lowest dps or close to it if they are bonused for damage though blasters do deal 10 more dps and range bonused rails got more range but are limited by the 250km targeting range which the apoc can match these strengths are not enough to justify the weaknessespsgallente drone boats and caldari missile boats  gun boatstldrhybrids suck and need a buff
heal the hybrid
as a main gallente driver id like to see this evened out
yep
ive taken this into account yes id like to see a slow repair rate which uses nanite paste or any other fuel to repair the drones out of combat and a faster mode in triage which gives a bonus to the repair rate making it viable for combathowever keep into account that the fighters are the carriers main weapon and that those last on battleships forever as well unless you overheat them
yes please

supported if only to have my normal 3 implants suddenly act as 5s in regard to the side discussion of should learning be first ill weigh in that i spent my first 15 days taking the base skills to 4 the queue helped tremendously here and then moved on to other things for awhile this is despite urging from my friend who got me into this to head toward 55 when possibleof course when i got a donation that would cover the book costs i grabbed the four adv versions those until recently were in various stages of 34 i just squared away all of those to 4 almost a year later i have no interest in l5 on most of them for the amount of time involved i can use it better by filling out orca and rorqual support skills
yeah this new system sucksi want my folders and i want them now
supportedbring back the folders


def needs to be fixed
have not played much to use it but not having folders is silly back when i did wars i used them to sort them into corps all the time
i support the op wholeheartedly
i quite like the new contact system standings viewable in the address book and notifications for changes but i am also puzzled about why custom folders were removed i would support the reinsertion of custom folders for contacts  at the very least for those who are members of the watch list
need those foldzors
support op
i got lost and confused trying to delete old contacts 
i support this i want my custom folder well i loved it the way it was before i love the filter feature though
seriously what were you thinking ccp
seems the patchfoldersettingsdelete daemon we know from apocrypha and revelations has finally grown up please give us our folders back without them contacts are barely usable

i support this more than supporting sustainable life
one of the pilots in one of our war target corporations has a neutral alt with an orca now appropriately neutrals who remoterepair a legitimate target become legitimate targets themselves however that does not hold true if a war target utilizes the ship maintenance facility on an orca to switch ships with no docking lag midfight i propose that if you have kill rights on a target and that target uses the ship maintenance facilities of an orca or carrier i suppose but its more moot in lowsecnull kill rights should be given on the orca pilot in the same way they are currently given to neutral repairers
supported
not the first time this proposal goes around still supported
if a pilot supplies assistance in any way to a valid target they too should become valid targets
supported but with the addition that they and neutral rr receive aggression as if they legally activated a hostile module so no concordokken but they cant dock nor jump for a while
seems sensible
well this could apply only to higherlevel missions level 1 and 2 could be entirely unchangedim actually enjoying the epic arc missions due to the fact that they are completely unknown to me i mean since i never did them before its like they were dynamic or at least they give me that feeling worse explanation ever hope you got my point lolcompletely supported
the current pve in eve is so bad it oughta be taken behind the shedso yeah supported

yes please
i also would like to see big picture but it is hard to find the fonts and other ui elements are too smalljokes aside lack of font scalability is a major ui issue there is no workaround it will get worse with time as screen resolutions increase and eve players get olderplease keep bringing the font issue to ccp
voted
confirming complete ui overhaul is very much needed
so some ccp noob dev has 5 minutes to spare before leaving work one day and decides to screw over one factions missioners i think thats how this came to be
for the certain hull size i hope you mean only frigs only cruisers that would be strange and i dont know if its a good idea but i admit its not badbut your idea doesnt get people of gates and stations wanna know why  you dont have control while in a plex you got an advantage if your at a stargate if its too big or too strong order your fleet to jump and poof there gone but in a plex if you go there and your screwed you stay screwed you die and lose the fightthats the first thing that will fix the main problem the second about your so called pve content is probably that caldari ships are jamming the enemy thats very easy to fix you know in other words that part is not even a problemthe third and last is the thing about the timezone its false they just have a number of spawn inside a systemthats all dont want to insult you but inform yourself a bithell talk to a dev with a petition first before posting those false facts
thank you for even more relevant input

yep ive tripped over that supported
right lag specifically refers to a high ping latency not on the fact that the server is unable to handle more than 700 players in a system at once so one group of them gets toasted before they even load grid call it what you like  in a game of this scale its still an utterly unacceptable performance issueand i still find the old softimage3d interface to be friendlier and easier to use cant speak to that since i really cant be bothered with fw  i find it that appealingthen its a ty design because taking a pvefit ship into losec is tantamount to just self destructing it as soon as you undockoh where to beginhyperion eos astarte brutix myrmidon  all so broken that people shield tank them so they can even compete in their intended role and they still fail horriblyoneiros exqueror maulus navitas lachesis arazu never used except the last two which have some utility as heavy long range tacklers of course they have to be shield tanked as well in order to compete sin ares enyo kronos diemos maulus navitas are widely regarded as awful awful ships with ed bonuses any destroyer you care to mention celestis eaglethats just going through the market picking off ships ive rarely or never seen people fly im sure there are many many many morethe list just goes on and on of useless ships mostly active armor tankinghybrid ships mind you that have their biggest bonuses ignored because they are so badly designed or their specs have remained static whilst the rest of the game has evolved or they were just given junk bonuses to begin with in order to provide a wide range of tactical options that just happen to be completely ineffective

my full support fix what is in eve before making a new part of eveits ok adding new small stuf like a few more t3 ships or parts but make it so it is more for fixing what is dead in eve
i support this thread although a lot more than what was mentioned needs fixing like the horrible ui
yes thats whats happening and i understand why thats whats happening i just dont see why that should be whats happening i dont know how easy it would be to code an exception to that though as you are technically setting a waypoint to an object that object is in a systemso most of the time this being pretty much the only exception you would want the waypoint to be the system where the object is only when the object is a stargate might there be a difference
i support this
concur
poke
yesif nothing else please let my coercer have a tank roughly befitting its sig radius
ccp will be reminded once were there 
pokingsupportedpoking again
as a mostly minnie pilot im fairly happy with thrashers as they are being streets above the other dessies but to be fair there is a current of problems running through the dessies due to the large sig radius and poor fittings1 thrasher not enough speed to speed tank boost speed otherwise just fine2 catalayst not enough grid drop one high gun slot and boost grid to 70mw3 coecer one midslot is too little drop two high turret slots for one extra mid otherwise would be op as it can fit a solid tank with 4 lows4 cormorant swap turrets to missilesfairly minor changes but should make dessies interesting for noobs and for beginner fw stuffwhat would be extremely nice would be another category of t2 dessies dessie stealthbombers instead of frigate stealthbombers how the hell do the frigate sbs fit the torp and bomb launchers anyhow

how about having support for multiple font sizes  dpi for the user interface on a high res screen in full screen mode the font is so small its hard to make out at a comfortable viewing distance
have a one off 31 day ghost training ability so you can get all your alts on the same day for billing limiting it to 31 days one time then back to the three would not cause too much of an issue i would think where as unsubbing and re subbing 10 times over seven months due to the 3 day timer now is a pain and thats only on 3 accountsplease dun flame me too hard if theres some easy way to do this if i dont know its just something i figured effects a lot of people
and you show why ccp rightfully dropped ghost trainingnot supported if you want the training time pay for it
i would happily pay for it but as of right now there is no way i know of that you can pay for a partial month if one of my accounts getting seven days free over 1 month instead of 3 and the other get 20 over seven months it works out the same either wayedit in the 25 years ive been playing my accounts have something like 60 billing cycles ive never unsubbed another option would be one account that cost me 45 dollars and holds all 9 heads where any three can train at once
there are better solutions to this problem  for example the ability to create a petition to change the billing date bringing back ghost training isnt the right call here because i can guarantee that it wont be used for this by more than 1 of the people who use it
you can do that im going to go do that now then i dont remember ccp saying you could do something like that anywhere which is why i started this
right now its a toy that hides in a corner only to be discovered by someone who pokes around new interfaces and toysmost common joe pilots arent going to see this let alone use itborrowing from a concept in microoft outlook i propose the following if a ceodirector makes a event on the calendar have it send a notification to the appropriate group offering a choice to accepttentative or reject so that the members are notified by evemail or notifications of new eventswhats the point of having a calendar if no one knows its thereif this has been proposed its likely it didnt specifically point it out sorry in advancefeel free to flesh out ps im hopping this is role based or were gonna have a spamfest of events
 make draggable to chat from top left icon calendar and event lists add labelsgroups to contact system allow bulk event invite to contacts groups
also would be nice to have localeve time toggle with some red text saying that everything is displayed in local time so people wont get confused recurring events creation adding various holidays to calendar something like submitting your online time so that you only be notified of events you can participate in you should always be notified about personal events tho also might be nice for everyone or people with appropriate role in corp perhaps 510 contants or contacts with some label if those will be added at all to see it to help with events planing
supporting my own proposal
remote repping someone who is aggressing another player that you do not have shoot privilegeskill rights against should have the same penalty as remote repping an npc pirate concordokkeni wonder if it is as simple as remote repping triggering the same logic as aggressing my targets target lets seeno more neutral rr in empire wars love it still able to rep the ship shooting the ship thats shooting me thats okaystill able to rep the ships in the noob fleet im running missions with even though were from different corps thats okay tooidiot im repping shoots a neutral and gets himself concorded along with me shucks oh well you get that on the big jobsmakes sense to me
i got a simple fix just make it so people who used rr cant dock or jump for a minute or something like that sounds like a easy fix
yep aggro for rr is a long overdue fix
i have a counter proposal rr should not effect badgers or any tech 2 industrial derivative of this hullas industrials are obviously not combat ships and anyone that gets killed by one is so terrible they should just quit the game remote reps should not repair them
webs are pretty bad when combined with a warp disruptor even with 2 of them they seem to be barely effective at stopping ships and the rapier and huginn are abysmal they should get a small strength bonus a small boost to webs is in order and a rethink of the webspecialising ships wouldnt go astray too
makes scramweb even more powerful at producing full stop results but i agree disruptorweb fits could use the minor help of a 10 web boost
i disagreeif anything they should remove mwddisabling effect from the scramber replacing it with efficiency reduction one say applying a scram reduces your mwd speed boost by 50 shutting it off completely basically brings us back the old zone of death ccp whined about
rapier huginn and keres should get a x105level bonus to web effectiveness would make a 60 web in to a 75 web at level 5
i would agree with this as long as it came with a slight boost to web strength especially as dual prop is now 100 more usefull than web scram on frigs and also some kind of bonus to interceptor and af usage of them as so many cool frigs only have two medsit seems every faction ship and his sister has 90 webs now anyway
i love my rapier and personally think it needs a little love 70 webs are not overpowered at all especially in the day and age of dramielssupported
id say just the keres and huginn not the rapier the combat recon needs to be more effective than the force but yeah thats the only web strength bonus neededaside from the serpbloodmarauder ships that get the 10 bonus ofc
i would prefer having racial webs over this
i see you bolded the funny parts kewl story bra

i am proposing that ccp bring back the super capital insurance to what it was before tyrannis deployedwhat you have done with the super cap insurance in the last expansion has murdered the use of them add that with dominion and that is the end of titans leaving pos towers for anything other then bridging super carriers although though as hell now can be easily killed by a battleship gang with neuts many super cap pilots are out raged with this new change we have been taking the long grind to be able to afford to buy and fit such ships and if we lose them we get 110 of base value titans worth 8 billion isk fitted will be lucky to get 6 billion isk back cuper carriers buy thier ships for 20ish billion on market spend another 510 billion fitting them to only get max 3 billion back what is the point i will past another link here so u can go through the 23 pages of people complaining of the problems of this last expansion among them you will find many super cap pilots in there speaking on this subject
or the market will autocorrect

do not support eve is turning into where is my mom online we need to reduce the number of super cap pilots in eve its stupid getting into fights that have over 20 titans and 30 motherships
a lone titan is a dead titan a lone motehrship is a dead mothership thats what it should be like you thought you ship should be a megaunkillab le solopwnmobileconclsion working as intended
not supported the change was a good measure against the proliferation of supercaps and for adding more weight to the decision of fielding supercaps
not supported this will give the capitals back some loving if you havent ccp seems to be slowly nerfing supers to death its a good thing
how about rearranging the right click menu actions along the following guideblock 1 navigationblock 2 camera menu  ideally a submenublock 3 harmless relatively actionsblock 4 harmful actionsreason easy to misclick and select trash item instead of make active when boarding ships managing pos modules inc the tower has offline immediately below etc

hellohere is my proposalcreate a new region of contestable space which would have security ratings of 10 to 05all missions will be pve basedall rewards and ranks to be the same as the pvp based fwany other good ideals that others might have would be welcomedthank you
so you want fw rewards without the fw risk of pvp
nice troll but whatever ill bitefw mechanics is other then the big happy wardec entirely pve based much to its detriment so basicly all you want is to move it to high sec where its nice and safe are that afraid of low sec or are you just some sort of mentally challenged hunchback
this is a genuine proposal ok for the achievement of gaining ranks it could a ratio in favour of the pvp fw from my understanding of fw mechanics you accept a mission from a npc agent but your opponents could be real players when they find youmany people say that eve is a pvp game but it does have a pve element why not increase the pve content
haha no
i think its workable but your all rewards and ranks to be the same as the pvp based fw butchered it hard
i subscribed to eve a little less than 15 days ago so i have very little skin in the game and very little to lose should i decide to leavewhich is something im mulling over at the moment those that wish to tell me if you dont like it leave save your breathi decided to subscribe to eve on the promise or expectation that the game was openended and that a player could do whatever they chose i thought i could make a living ingame as a salvagerexplorer it was only after having subscribed that i found out salvaging is not considered an honorable profession in eve and so why it may be so heavily penalized but heavily penailized it is why am i here i filed a petition and along with the helpful response from the gm was given two links one here and one to the designersdevelopers they are next below is an excerpt of the petition filedone of the definitions of salvage most appropriate to eve issomething extracted as from rubbish as valuable or usefulit does not make sense that out of 7 of 10 ship wrecks i would receive the message that my salvaging attempt was successful yet there was nothing to salvage that is what just happened in the last few days ive seen this message pop up 50 or more when salvaging wrecks im not sure whether it has anything to do with the training of the skill but as i have just advanced that skill im finding more occurrences of coming away completely empty handed which seems backwards to what one would expect if they look at it logically in fact if one has the proper equipment and training every ship wreck should be salvageable and only the time it takes to perform the task and what is being salvaged tied to the skill level itself every ship wreck should at least yield scrap metaleventually that is regardless the skill level it is becoming very annoying to have a skill trained and not be able to benefit from it as i said this message suggesting the salvaging was successful but nothing of value remained is one i never saw until just recently and if not tied to the advancement of the salvaging skill then it seems likely there has been a game algorithm change to address some other issue ive recently become aware from reading old posts that there has been some controversy over salavging wrecks so maybe the game designers are trying to address that issue i would like to have explained to me the purpose for this message and whether the salvaging skill level is supposed to affect its occurrencei just spent 15 hours salvaging 14 wrecksmy wrecks and to my discouragement not only did i get the ridiculous message for 7 of those that the salvage attempt was successful but there was nothing of value i also had a messagea message i hadnt seen before for 4 of the 14 wrecks saying the salvage attempt failed because the wreck had already been salvaged there was no one around to salvage the wreck but me so out of 14 shipwrecks created by my hand 3 yielded anything of value i use the term value loosely because it was all crap this game is obviously tailored to those wishing to mine do combat missions or haul goods decent living can be made doing all three a player can go out and mine ore from an asteroid that is right in front of them not unlike a shipwreck yet never have to worry about receiving a message you successfully mined the ore but the ore was of such poor quality you got nothing such a message would at least be equitable to what a salvager faces the mining profession even has tools safeguarding against mining depleted asteroidsonly allowed so many characters here so quickly 2 suggestions1 revise the code so that successful salvage attempt  salvage failed salvage attempt  no salvage increase the  of failure if it needs to be more difficult 2 provide tools to prescreen shipwrecks tools exist for all other professions why not salvaging too
maybe lets keep the discussion in the features and ideas cross post it isnt really an issue that the csm has to push
also cross posting is bad mmkay
how about ask the mission runner if you can salvage most people ninja salvage hoping to get the mission runner to engage in pvp with them and lose or doing it to bug the mission runner but alot of mission runners do not salvage and would not mind you bookmarking then returning to the mission site to salvage
per ccp mitnal per gm faolchu  per senior gm ytterbium  per ccp prism x  per ccp incognito  these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleetcomthread
this is not new this is what happens when you have multiple salvagers on a single wreck the ones that cycle after the successful attempt gives you that messagesalvaging large wrecks are where the money is at medium wrecks are ok salvaging is the most profitable profession for a new player as im sure you have been getting millions of isk while all other professions at that skillpoint level receive much much lessnot sure exactly what you are whining about if you dont like to salvage then dont do it
i admit i didnt read all that wall of text but i think you say  this this is worthless no isk in this taking too much timeblah blah blahhere are things that will make you a good salvager1 use a destroyer2 fit 4 tractor beams and 4 salvagers on it add a cap recharge and a cargo expander as well3 after your done with a mission salvage it4 if its not fast enough use salvage rigs those rigs will give you more chance of success5 dont forget to train salvage to level 4 at least so you scream less at your computeroptional in my opinion only salvage wrecks that are from blood raiders sansha or the angels the rest are worthless in my opinion unless you buy the blueprint and make someif you want to know more about this stuff contact me ingame and i will gladly help youfor your post only thing i agree is if theres nothing just say it dont say its succesfull but with me i dont even look each time i succeed or not
ships in certain missions yield little or no salvage buzz kill is a good example of this while others yield quite a bit ive salvaged almost 50 titanium bars from ae4 a few times judging by your post youre probably only doing lvl 13 missions atm these are not worth salvaging imo get into a bs and start running lvl 4s or find a system with lvl 4 agents and salvage theresalvaging is not a great money maker unless youre willing to put the time in theres nothing wrong with it currently so just find another way to make isk if youre not happy salvaging

ok before we go off the handle here about modifying the ui lets take a minute to think about itplease read my argument im not asking for mods to be introduced im asking for ccp to allow the community to develop the ui for themargumentplayers who can modify their ui will have an advantageif the uis are housed in a central place which can be controlled and monitored it would allow for nobody to have an advantage a central place for players to download other uisthe current iteration of the eve ui is dated and needs a lot of work its not customizable at all and is clunky if you look at most other mmos who have a functional and user friendly ui they have an api for the user to interaction with and allow for the user to change the ui completely the developer then takes these changes and implements the good ones directly into the game other mmos have benefited from this by allowing the players to assist in the development of the game instead of focusing on changing one problem and putting a team of developers on it you can put the entire user base on it and ccp can just develop an api for players to interact with they ccp can then strip the ui down to its bare essentials leave a very basic ui then provide the community an api to make changes to the elements which each person whishes to see you could also implement a way to add images now by using evegate to show off the ui youd attract players to use evegate and youd further keep the game fair a basic upload and repository would be added to evegate this would be monitored by ccp engineers to ensure no executables were added or scripting which interacts adversely to the new api

hello new edeniUFFFDm here to tell you a little story about the true mechanics behind the formation of the csm council let it be known first that iUFFFDm not claming hax devs or ccp for anything iUFFFDm going to reveal every vote was as far as i can tell submitted and counted as intendedthe storyback in 2008 after the first csm was elected i was wondering if it would be possible to rig the election towards a certain candidate when csm 2 elections where anounced i cheked the applications and wondered how the thousands of voters who know none of the candidates would decide for a candidate when browsing the assemly hall it hit menobody would read all candidate topics they would rather read the ones on page one and the ones with the highest read and repliescount as it wasnUFFFDt possible for me to use 10 alts to answer to a topic as ankhesentapemkah did i wrote a little prog to raise the readcount of my chosen candidate vuk lau btw when the results rolled in it turned out my candidate had won with 101 of the votes he became chairmannow i know you are all going to scream but heUFFFDs the leader of a big alliance he was bound to win because of the northern block giving him all the votes i thought about that too and tested it by using csm 3 and delaying my readingsession until voting had already started this time vuk got only 73 of the votes also the nc had grown and despite vuk beeing the only true nccandidate this time vily of rzr was a candidate for csm2 at csm 4 i supported elvenlord also late but i still wasnUFFFDt sure about the actual impact i made than something wonderful happended for csm 5 all candidates where allowed to run for csm againnow i could simply not support vuk thus making the actual drop in votes visiblewithout my support vuks results plummeted to a meager 42 less than half of his first results despite the larger numbers the nc can muster in game atmand even more important i found somebody else using my principles while f5ing the eveo forums i saw ankhesentapemkahs topic getting a few hundert hits in less than a minute and she had a super high reply count coincidentally a load of peeps who never post on the eveo forums except when itUFFFDs csmtimea missed the chairmanposition but that might be because of all the less friendly comments in her topic and she still more than doubled her results from last time despite being an annoying spammer in jita localconclusiona lot of people vote by popularitya lot of people who donUFFFDt know whoUFFFDs popular make their decision based on the answers and readcount of the candidates topics in the assembly hallpeople have used this to rig the election and will use it againeve players are like a herd of sheepwhy have i written this wall of textto amuse myselfto make isk send isk ingame pleaseto ensure that next time every csmcandidates topic will have a few 100k reads it doesnUFFFDt even matter if my assumptions are right people will do it or have already done it see atldrto get into csm write a little prog to up your readcount or destroy your f5button use a few alts to up the replies of your topic and stay on page one and spam jita localbest whishes from spacecamp and a happy csm term
it amazing the lengths that people are going to to try discredit ankhi think i will now always vote for her  simply for the tears whine and lulz she generates

as in what the results would be if we only counted users older than 2 years and so onunfortunately giving such information is not possible the csm elections are anonymous  who someone voted for is not logged at all in our systems when a vote is cast a vote is added to that candidates tally and then the account is flagged as having voted to prevent it from being able to vote again we have no way of looking back and seeing who voted for who all we can see is who voted and who received the most votesany ideas for further demographicsstats on the users who did vote would be appreciated though
how about completing a questionaire just before voting next time ie 5 quick questions which could incl answers to question to get insfo not readily available
i dont think its up to ccp to find out who voted for whomif the eve playerbase would like to know more about what kind of player voted for whom they have the option to start something of their own and add a poll in itccp gave more than enough information about the average age of the account and suchfor more detailed information just do your own footwork
you can capture whatever demographic information is available about the voter at the time the vote is cast and store that anonymously with their votethen you can mine the data all you want i wrote the anonymous survey such as employee feedback surveys etc software at work so i kind of understand the pitfalls and the user concerns about privacy you give up nothing and gain a lot statisticwiseit just takes some prior planning is all
you did a breakdown of times votes were cast how about a percandidate breakdown of these times it would only really be interesting for me this time to see how many a certain candidate got before the candidate selection page was shuffled

i see what you mean but i think that seeing the vectors on all levels of zoom is a bit more important the information you seek can be more or less understood by comparing your own speed and your own velocity vectoron the other hand an idea if the vectors show also a knot 1 pixel wider or something every say minute of flight youd get your information perfectly may be a bit too much to ask perhaps

i cant even stress how much i support this issue
i saw at least one csm person support here does this mean that well have this come up in the minutes can you bump this thread with the resultpleaseliang
not just one csm supporting it liangthe issue has been discussed before but never pursued by the csm since it was an issue raised by ankhesentepemkah they preferred to argue with her about wording rather than discuss the issue at handid settle for finishing rather than excellence ccp commit to finishing what you started rather than jumping to the next new thing and building up a huge technical debtthis thread is a duplicate by the way bracket urging ccp to work on current issues next expansion ccp and implement now develop later
agreed quantity seems to be how they want to lure new players in but quality will help them retain players if you get people here and they find that everything is halffinished they are just going to leave
fix destroyers and assault frigates
yes and yes
i fully support this proposal
strongly supportedit makes sense that releasing new content helps to market the game and invite new players however i think that if the players are happy with the game marketing through word of mouth can be just as or even more effective and unlike other mmos this game doesnt need to release new dungeons just to keep the existing player base pvp plus improvement of existing content would work just as welllook at blizzard a hugely successful company some of whose games released 10 years ago are still being played today there are not known as leaders in innovation but every one of their games is very very polished i think that is what really helped to set them aparti am not trying to pick on you but i think that this overly pessimistic attitude is not helpful i see this from many people on the forums overdramatizing things makes it easier for the devs to dismiss the issues as just grumpy playersthe new pi content and dust does sound interesting and there were of speed improvements lots of small fixes and tweaks in the last patch a lot of work went into the patch and it made the game better we should be trying to convince ccp that they should strive to make an excellent game not tell them that everything they ever do just makes things worse

ccp is spread too thin and its really begining to show players have been calling for a slow down of new features releases and a reworking of older content for the last few years now it seems the penny is dropping with alot more playersthe timescale for getting stuff polished is shocking and devs should really stop using the soon meme coz its going to backfire soon
supportedleaving a lot of the core features unfinished will cause a lot of problems for ccp in the long term as more subscribers leave not just because of bittervet but also because they kept getting frustrated by the game ccp will then be forced to attract more subscribers by adding new features neglecting the other parts of the game even more this can lead ccp into a vicious cycle of having to chase new subscribers while losing slowly the long term subscribershigh subscriber turnover a poor quality game and developers with short term ambitions is not what i want to see

now a reply with content releasing expansion just for the sake of adding something new is a terrible way to go there have been issues that the player base has been complaining about since i started playing this game ccp really lets the player base down when they continually put off actually fixing and improving the game to instead release so called new content so they can introduce new and even less exciting bugs to this game i havent had the opportunity to enjoy the majority of the bugs however my current favorite is how the overview stops working that one is awesome way to be pro ccp how about you folks actually start caring about game play a little more as opposed to focusing on the newest way to cripple this game unless you have no idea how in which case own up to it so i can stop looking forward to fixes

also the wyverns small size allows it to shove around any other ship in the game like its not there being one of the heaviest ships in the game and so tiny makes it a mean bumping machine

i too support the size boost this has been proposed so many times lets hope this works this timemy aeon is so small it can hide behind a machariel that is just wrongfix it ffs even if the textures are stretched just dooo it
i support this increase sc size or change their names
quoted for truth
an epeen should look like an epeen not something that needs viagra
seems good
both supers and carriers
they would need to add a function to tell how much the drones a damaged while they are inside the ship
some people seem to exaggerate a little however a myrmdrake will give many of these a run for their money the point of this thread however is that they are at best marginally better than the tier 2 bcs while massively more expensive and have no role in small gang warfare or any other warfare for that matter as they should have add in the fact that a bs is still better and just as agile while still cheaper and these ships have nothing no other ship can do better for cheaper the changes i proposed would make them a lot more viable in small gang warfare which are what they are designed for and in no way would any of these be overpowered with the changes either they would still be a little on the weak reallyby the way drake 18k less ehp than nighthawk and only 67 less dps 200 mill cheaper and better overheat stats comparativelyballistic control system iiballistic control system iiballistic control system iireactor control unit iij5b phased prototype warp scrambler i10mn microwarpdrive ilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iiheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missilesmall unstable power fluctuator imedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender ihobgoblin ii x5to compare the nighthawk fit nighthawkballistic control system iiballistic control system iiballistic control system iidamage control iireactor control unit iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivephoton scattering field iiinvulnerability field iilarge shield extender iiwarp scrambler iiheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missileheavy assault missile launcher ii terror rage assault missilesmall nosferatu iimedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender ihobgoblin ii x5
mea culpa  caldari is the one race i dont fly so i forgot that the nighthawk loses a mid compared to the drake stupid ferox hull so yeah the nighthawk actually has less ehp than the drake at least if you expect it to have the speed mod and point that the drake can carry mind you if you ditch the point a heavy missile nighthawk has 6k more ehp and 11 more dps than a ham drake not to mention 4x the range the ham fit has no range or missile precision advantages but it beats the drake by 66 dps instead of 11 im not going to pretend that ditching the point isnt a serious failing  it is losing the sixth mid hurts and i suppose it does wreck my previous claim but the nighthawk is the worst field command anyways and my objections to your changes were primarily based on the three good field commands i mean boosting the nighthawk is a reasonable thing to ask for the csm already passed that one but boosting the sleipnir really thats the part that made me laugh at this thread as for cost efficiency arguments just ask yourself this does the dramiel need a boost after all its 200x as expensive as a rifter and its certainly not 200x as effective
small gang pvp which these ships are designed for means hams work perfectly fine actually the astarte in my opinion is even worse than the nighthawk and the absolution barely better i agree the sleipnir is decent but it is definitively not good it is simply the better of the lot which really does not say much it cant fit a half decent active tank with mwd and a point 808 dps tanked cap lasts just above 1 min with mwd off needs a cpu mod as well 830dps or it can do a bigger vagabond kind of fit which brings it to same dps 71k ehp aligns slower than a tempest but a gang mod actually fits now  a tempest does the bigger vaga thing better thats saying something if you play around with fits and consider my proposals and we cant really give some of these ships slots and not the others you will find that they are very balanced in comparison to what their niches are supposed to be 2 each staying power in small gangs and the ability to give gang bonuses while utilizing a proper fit astarte being a pure dmg dealer instead in no way whatsoever would any of these ships become overpowered and as for the last part the dramiel and the daredevil are what i always have considered the lvl of efficency pirate ships should be at i find those 2 ships perfectly balanced the others need a little buff 90m fitted vs 3m fitted  30x as expensive btw 
i didnt say that hams were bad i said that a nighthawk with lowdps weapons outdpsed a drake with highdps weaponseven before you take the explo velocity bonus into account as for the case of the sleipnir its not a vaga theyre kind of similar but not really with similar fitsambitrigged autocannons designed to hold orbit out of web range in this case the vaga moves twice as fast and the sleip has 3x the ehp and 50 more dps plus a gang link how do you compare those as for the tempest i really dont know wtf youre talking about putting the tempest into a similar fit it moves 300 ms slower than the pest and takes 50 longer to align though it gets about 50 more range 20 more ehp and 30 more dps did you put a 1600mm on a sleipnir or something as for the dramiel i agree that its a fine ship though im more of a daredevil man but on the cost side ive seen plenty of rifters that cost under a milbecause really why are you putting t2 on a ship that cheap and a few dramiels that cost a whole lot more than 90t2 rigs and rf gyros do that fitted cost is a function of how much youre inclined to pay but if you agree that even an x30 cost bump should get you x2 capability what should a x4 or so cost bump like a field command ship get you
you do realise that that was sarcasm and that that video only highlights that this is only seen as a problem by people who desperately fail at eve devs or not

this whole alliance logo thingy is again and again quite a sad thing to see even the new version doesnt include any feedbackmechanism it seems nor some status tracking for the whole submission process it is a very sorry way to show customer support if you call it support when you just not initiate any communication or respond to requests made within months even gm requests are getting responses faster than this  and in them are mostly singleplayer request whereas in the alliance submissions you actually have to fear not to dissatisfy a single customer in one go but many many more

no it should just not allow him use it after aggressing imo it would be annoying to have a mining op or somthing with friends that arnt corpies and them have a war and use my bay then get be flaged
while i see and agree to your point imho your execution of the idea is wrong because i can see a big loophole in this to target unsuspecting orcashave a friend in a 1 person corp and wardec him then have him along with you and your ganking buddies fly up to an orca he accesses the orca bam orca is a target and you can freely nuke itzeriels idea is much better disallow someone who has the aggression counter active from using an orcas hangar maintenance bay or corp bays this way if its a mining op youre attacking they can fly in and grab their guns to combat you but you cant stow your ship and get a new one if it threatens to be destroyeed by war combat
realistic objectives eve online pve developersdesigners should take a short sabbatical get copies of xwing vs tie fighter  xwing alliance play them through several times and learn what good pve content involves convoy interceptioninterdiction strategic strikes against specific targets defending convoys against interdiction preventing key targets leaving the battle all of these ideas can be incorporated into missions to help pve content train up mission runners in the use of pvp fittings and tacticsdynamic content is good  players should not be able to refer to cheat sheets mission survival guides for example to succeed in combatcompetitive missions sounds like a great tiein for live eventshaving npcs using fittings similar to what pvpers would use makes sense to me no more chance to webify  an angel webifier will use its webifier end of story the angel rogue will use it warp scrambler end of story it would be nice if ewar such as neuts worked effectively against npcs too so missionrunners could gradually learn to use the tools of pvp
i agree most of the pvp equipment should be usable in some missions for example having a mission where you need to tackle a rat fast before it disappears would be awesome

shield tankers are already at a disadvantage since the best armour plate is almost double the hp of the best shield extenderif people are worried about passive regen on anything other than a drake they really need to sit down and do the maths hint peak regen is 25  shield hp  recharge time thus a ship with 3000 shields and a 2500 second recharge time gets a regen of about 3 hps or 345 hps with a fleet boostas for the drake  just keep shooting it if you cant kill the drake find the command ship boosting it and kill that first
full supportto the naysayers armor already gets the bigger buffer slave sets work on capitals crystals dont shield xfers are stupidly hard to fit compared to rr and now you want this bug to stay cause shieldtanks on fleetlevels are totally overpowered
supported we do quite alot of roaming in small mobile shield gangs having your bonus disappear every time you go to a new system is really annoying and should be fixedthis along with the stupidstupid cpu reqirements on shield transporters is probably why this is not as popular as armor buffering

mission load balancing woesin tyrannis ccp corrected load balancing which should have resulted in mission runners being sent into lesspopulated systems unfortunately the feature renders many agents invalid and negatively affects lowsec missionrunners the following problems are a result of this featurebeing sent into lowseca disproportionate amount of players are being sent into lowsec from highsec systems several jumps away this results in players abandoning agents near lowsec systems and balling up deeper into highsec overloading the few good agents that are leftlowsec runners sent out of systemlowsec missionrunners are being sent out of system much more often increasing risk considerably or forcing them to decline too much missions and running out of agents in addition they are sent to highsec more often where players with low security status or faction standing cannot gosolutions highsec agents should never pick lowsec systems as destination as lowsec missions will always be declined anyway lowsec agents should strongly favor the current system over neighbouring systems as lowsec missionrunners will likely decline missions out of system
what makes you think they arent monitoring lvl5 mission runners they monitor everything elsethis idea makes a change heh only makes missions worse than they are when people decline missions they have to decide if its worth it for example they may have that boring mission coming up within 4 hours a courier mission or something that sends them into lowsecyour idea just allows more rejects plus as a lvl 4 mission runner i hope that ccp make it so that 50 of lvl 4 missions do take you into lowsec but also increase bounty  meta item drop ratenot supported as a temp carebear i am already shocked at how easy mission running isoh and if you are in lowsec you know the risks anyway limit to the system wtf theres no bubbles in low sec making it impossible to get paranoid dockers
load balancing should only be applied if there is actually significant load thus agents in systems such as dodixie motsue and emolgranlan will end up sending people out of the system more regularlyas it happens vir honn in emolgranlan is sending me to ammold more often now which is a good thing there are around 80 people in local when im running missions during australian peak time ie two hours beforeone hour after downtime apart from being sent to ammold more regularly i havent noticed any change in mission locationsi dont feel that level 5 agents should ever have given out missions in hisec
agreed this is going to lead to more concentration away from lowsec bordersl5 missions is a sad casualty most of us were running them as a break from the tedium of the never changing l4s and as they take longer to get and run the rewards are not that much greater over time if at all than l4s an unnecessary nerf imho the infrequent highsec l5s were also a viable option for less frequent players with limited hours of play
i agree that there should be some limit in how far afield the agents expect you to go but highsec agents never ever sending you to lowsec even if its an agent in a pocket thats just absurd put 90 of missions in a 1jump radius and let people use their cancellation on the other 10 the bit about lowsec missions being concentrated more strongly in the same system does make sense to me but thats not enough to make me support this
do you agree that the issue bears further discussionthats what support means  you support the discussion going on if not the idea enough people supporting the discussion means the csm get to pick it up as an item for one of their meetings
all l5s should be in lowsec exclusively they should never be allowed in high sec eversecond all lowsec agents should never send a mission runner to a high sec system everthird if mission runners are balling up around agents that are so deeply embedded in high sec that they dont send players to lowsec then simply move all l4 agents around so that theyre evenly distributed near large sections of lowsec so that every agent will send players to lowsec equally well
if low sec agents should send you to high sec then the other way around it should also be trueload balancing should indeed only be active in high load systems
can the usual suspects please for once just stfu we get it you hate anyone who plays differently than the way you feel the game should be played and want everyone elses style of play nerfed got it now go awaysupported
this change need to be discussed yesall the proposal ankhesentapemkah has done in the op are good noso support for the csm asking to ccp what really they think they are doing to and for pve and how they are reasoning when they implement changes like the gallente experimental storylines or making agents bordering low sec less interesting that those in already crowded mission hubs
you really dont get it do you if people are missionrunning in highsec they will not go into lowsec with their expensive pve setups because the risk then is far greater than the possible rewards you will never get more players in lowsec by force it has to be by choiceso to correct your third point all highsec agents should never send a mission runner to a low sec system ever if someone running missions wants to do so in low sec they can easily find themselves an agent thereon the topic of l5s i think it would be a good idea to have l5s available in highsec so players looking for just a pve challenge can find one without having to deal with a significant pvp challenge on top of it make these agents q20 for all i care just give us the challenge
this is common sense now to figure out a way to teach ccp this most beneficial of skillswhen two different security rated systems are used why not let reward for a given mission be based on the lower of the twowould make hightolow missions a lot more viable ie less need to decline while having only a minor impact in highhigh and lowlow scenarioslvl5s to highsec should be a big no no huge oversight if they do indeed exist
well im going to support this since missioning is something of a cluster  right now but l5s should never have been in high secliang
no more safe l5s
in theory perhaps in practice ankh is a csm and can raise whatever issues she wants to i dont think she has ever created an issue and then not raised it at a meeting in the year she was on csmthe same as most other csms so i assume itll go on and get discussed further no matter what i say hence ill just throw in my two cents on the topic generally
im supporting this because as it is now it makes the game less fun also im not particularly against lvl 5s in highsec my attempts to get highsec lvl 5s resulted in 6 days of farming an agent and it only turning out a mission that requires a rattlesnake supported by an basilisk or a good sized fleet maybe more important than lvl 5s in highsec whats needed is some interesting pve and no making it require an interceptor and throwing you into camped 00 does not count as interestingi want to throw in a request for a dev blog documenting how many missions of what type are run for each faction including the epic arcs
i think its completely fair to have all level 5 missions be run in lowsec highest mission and if im correct they have capitals in them anyways it makes sense for them to be run in lowseclevel 4 agents now kinda suck if they are anywhere near lowsec if my border agent doesnt send me to egghelende it sends me through egghelende to odette or stegette it just isnt feasible for me to take my ships through egghelende i know the pirates there and know what they are capable of people sayingget over it and get protection are full of  it is very difficult to run a mission and avoid pirates who have probes out at all times or at least a probing alt in system they will be on you in no time it may be possible to successfully defend against pirate attacks in lowsec but its much more cost efficient to just go further into highsec with that being said the risk goes up but having to either split the reward with other pilots or hire help causes the reward to go down risk vs reward there is borked much more efficient to just go to highsec do them solo and get it all to yourself
i support this partlythe load balancing in lowsec is total crap if 14 people in local is considered to be such heavy load that i get 8 missions in a row 3 jumps away then there is definitely something wrongl5s should only be in lowsec they were designed to be a boost for lowsec and if it was intended that there where highsec l5s then there would be agents in highsecfor high agents 12 jumps from lowsec border i think they should still give you some missions in lowsec and not only missis in high
stop trying to piggyback badcontentious ideas onto otherwise innocuous proposals while some parts of what you want are reasonable your proposals are insufficiently granular the complaint about lowsec agents sending people out of the agent system is somewhat justifiable but i will not support highsec l5s and while i can see a case for highsec agents primarily giving out highsec missions people go to agents near lowsec in part because of the superior lpisk payouts associated with running missions for agents based in 05 and 06 systems if these agents will never send you into dangerous space its rather hard to justify those superior payouts no
i keep getting this fw mission couldnt they at least reduce the frequency this mission comes up at least 3 out 4 times its getting frustrating constantly receiving a mission i have no desire to do
agree totally the pve department appears to be dysfunctinal atm they seriously need to play the actual game

if youre using personal contact lists for standings of strategic nature theres obviously something awry with the standings system itself not with eve gateperhaps you need to think about the overloading of the standings feature for use as an indicator of friends versus people i wont kill versus people allowed to hang out near my pos without being shot versus people allowed to dock in my station  but those lists controlling pos and stations are based on corporate or alliance standingsif you dont trust people enough to let them know who your friends are dont set them to excellent standings use abandon wrecks instead of setting that friendly neighbourhood salvager dude to excellent standingsbetter understanding of the issue will lead to less fear and panic having said that id prefer it if ccp had implemented the contact list tags first then allocated certain privileges to be granted to certain tags such as spacebook friends can loot my stuff taisy roadhouse friendsin the end just remember there are two values for blue

im asked to do thisissue with eve skill training model  too rigid there are only so much you can do to minmax your training speed none of which would make you feel involved  too linear everything else considered equal you shall never catch up to a currently titan pilot if you just joined in the year 2005  too slow this is very objective i have played korean games where they have 6 digits behind the comma on their  to next level counter but no one complain thus i make the assumption that the too slow feeling is caused by the frustration of not being able to do anything to catch up a combination of eve training being too rigid and linearthis suggestion would solve all these issues at once as well as open up many interesting endeavorallow us to use plex to double training speed for a month instead of extending subscription applicable only if you are not one of the 10 characters with highest amount of sp and if you are not already receiving any kind of skill training bonus such as the new character bonus or an already existing plex bonuswhy plex  plex can be used by anyone not just people with a fat bank account  plex is already equal to one month game time you are already paying for sp with your subscription it makes sense to be able to pay double in fact by paying for boosted skill training you are already missing out a whole month of watching roid spining red  flashing or your freight aping its courier contractwhy does it make skill training less rigidyou now have an option that isnt free to be active to speed up training the extra consideration of taking this option stack on and go along with other existing options to speed up training making the whole process more flexiblewhy does it make skill training less linearnot everyone will andor can tackle on this option thus your skill difference with your peers will no longer stay constant especially if you are one of the many people borderlining the 10 highest sp markwill training feel less slowcasual players wont feel a thing and most likely wont bother most harder core people will still take forever to get anything trained but they will definitely train faster and make them a little more happy i guessbonus points  boost the plex market more money to ccp  keep people logged in many will have to log in twice as often to play the game from time to time now cause of the increased training speed  the snobs of 100m sp club will quickly find themseves not very exclusive  encourage people to skill their char instead of buying from the bazaar  ccp get to ban bots more frequently
if you want faster training buy implants anything beyond that  no goif you want to know why search through the similar thread in the features and ideas forum and the assembly hall forum we dont have to discuss it againand yes  you are useful in eve long before 100m spnot supported
not supported for several reasonsit puts a  value on your sp people with more  will have more spit involves deliberately nerfing individual peoplesp isnt all that important i have millions of sp i rarely ever use its nice to have when i need it but its rarely the deciding factor in any particular instanceit would remove the aspect of the game where you actually do have control over your learning rates thats what remaps learning skills and implants are foris the current learning system fun i wouldnt call it fun no but it does involve anticipation for unlocking new shipsmodsabilities which is about the only thing it has going for it and which your proposal would break
if you want to pay isk for sp you already can dont reinvent the wheel
not supported
ffs not this againno just like every other time this damb fool idea has been proposedyour proposed exchange rate of 300m isk for 19m sp is laughably low why not just propose that the skill training rate be doubled then at least it would be balanced because at the moment your proposal runs foul of malcanis lawmalcanis law whenever a mechanics change is proposed for the new players it is always to the overwhelming advantage of older richer players
ill reply to your points instead of just giving you the lol gb2wow you deserve1 too rigidtry not to worry about minmaxing so much and try to actually enjoy playing the game instead you might find you like it better that way2 too linearthis is just flat wrong you can catch up to any titan pilot in the game in terms of actually effectively using a titan because there are only so many skills that actually useful to that situation will you ever have as many total skill points no  but in reality that doesnt matter since in any given situation only a fixed number of those points will ever be of any use3 too slowthis is not an objective argument no matter how much you say it is a feeling of too slow or too fast a subjective measure and has no business being in a logical argumenttldr no not only are your arguments just flat wrong none of them are even new all of them have been brought up before and shot down just as rapidly
i think that this is great idea which will have my supportpeople who are against it are not able to comprehend why this is really great ideait offers players a choice to make theirs own characters twice as fast and while it will boost plex price and will be great isk drain which will increase the value of iskit shouldnt be booed by fossil players who are scared that someone newer who are ready to spend more to invest more in this game will catch up with them whatever support for this idea will bei believe that if it is implemented that many many players would use it and be happy with it
people who are for it are not able to comprehend why it is such a dreadful idea
character limit killed much of the quotesedit wow im tempted to thumb up my own idea never noticed that tickif you dont pay you cant play past trial the more you pay the more sp you can accumulate  already has obvious value in evewhoyou are one of the casual players i have mentioned doesnt mean no one shouldnt have the choice because you dont use itplease first read my proposal it stacks on those methods just like playing one more month does hows playing one more month hurt your control over your learning rate this feature double learning rate is available to new characters you are free to ask the newbs if they anticipate new unlocks paying for the game is already paying for sp character bazaar created later thus is a reinvention of the wheel in your own logic maybe we should remove itwhere was it proposed beforelycosa rabidas law 90 of the time people read less then 10 of your post before replyingthis is not an objective argument no matter how much you say it is feeling of fun or enjoyable are subjective measures and has no business being in a logical argumentin all given situations a titan pilot does not always fly a titan thus while its possible for a new character to perfect titan piloting hed fail flat in any other situation not involving the titan comparing to the older titan pilot its like when an ambidextrous person and a right handed person both get the right arm chopped off then have a duel i know who im going to bet for in reality more sp always give more options and that mattertry not to play on eve so much and try to save money for more logical meaningful endeavors you might see your pension sooner that way
roughly once every 1015 days for the last 4 years some bright spark has come up with the idea that players should be allowed to buy sp the posts have 3 things in common they always seem to think theyre the first they always propose a incredibly low isk price and they are always by people who just cant understand why anyone would hate their wonderful ideasearch out some examples for yourself there are plentyand no before you say it the fact that quite a few people have posted the idea on these forums does not make it a good oneto cut to the chase your idea would allow rich highsp players to convert a small fraction of their wealth in to have an even greater sp advantage over the new players plus it would devalue the achievement of playing your character for long enough to have high sp plus it would create the classic mudflation scenario where new players would have to spend in short enjoy your yearly stat respecs cheap implants initial training bonus and all the other nice things that new players get that older ones didnt they are enough and more than enough
actually more sp does not always give more options and thats why your argument falls flat on its faceunfortunately based on your other replies youre obviously not here for reasoned discussion on the topic so im not going to waste my time trying to explain why
on the other hand a bunch of noobs flying ships they dont know how to fly and cant afford to lose would mean a major buff to lp values and mineral values
been proposed before it will never happenthe only thing that should be added is bonus xp to doing things such as mining but even then it would not increase training speed by much you should not be able to fly a titan in less than a year like this idea would alow
oppose this offers no actual reason and does not reward strategic patiencethis doesnt belong in my eve

i just checked the market in essence and found that the federation navy is seeding amarr caldari and minmatar tower blueprintswtfi presume this hold true for all other factions so my proposal is to remove the seeding and keep only the towers associated to the own faction gallente should sell gallente towers caldari should stick to their tinfoil towers edit forgot about lamenting that it was all about bpos 
towers will be player build soon anyway
of course they will and this is fine by me but i am strictly against all factions seed opposing faction stuffwhy should minmatar sell an apoc bpo
on the one hand this would be a pain in the arsebut how much bigger will the eve universe feel if you have to make a run to another empire to grab some bpos i quite like it from that perspective i remember a proposal a while back to seperate all four empires with sections of lowsec imagine the two combined would be madness then it would really feel like four big empires dividing the universe
yeah this is silly factionspecific stuff should only be npcsold in faction stations sometimes that means a creodron station in the forge but it should be limited not just cn selling gallente tower bpos
yeh doesnt seem to make much sense having minmatar corporations selling the bpos for the tower of their arch enemy the amarr
theyre not useless but they should still be more useful than they are now
destroyers are years overdue for fixing make this happenid also add that the warp speed should be increased to 45 ausec
i thought the goal of such a fix was to make dessies better not make them useless
the static onescontraversial and yes i know these have been used for a long time and yes i am sure there will be alot of non supporters who dont think about this logically or reasonablybut seriously warp bubbles are just damn lazy we have 2 ships that have bubbles dictors and hictors if you want to camp a gate etc then you shoul d be made to work for it not just stick up a bubble and then thats iti mean you need a pretty fast ship now and now with the the nano nerf even fast ships cant get out of the bubble quick enough before your targetted and killed especially when you have silly large bubbles that cover like 40km here you have effectively create a no win situationalso drag bubbles wtf is that all about lets stick a bubble 90km off gate and ppl get dragged into it what how the hell does that workon another note dont allow pods to get stuck in warp bubbles thats just crazyagain you want to use a bubble work for it at least you want to camp a station then use the ships not lazy ass 40km bubblesand before you say it no i havent been suddenly a victim of it and whining no i havent been recently station camped blah blahthis has been bothering me for sometime especially since the introduction of dictors and hictors
if youre looking for sympathy youll find it in the dictionary between  and syphilis but you wont find it here
lazyass 40km bubble takes some cash to buy a lot of cargo space to take it with you and 2 month of skill training to anchorand they are nerfed already btw they used to be bigger before nanonerf
how am i gonna tackle a titan if i cant use bubbles not supported
bubbles make nulsec dangerous drag bubbles allow you to snare those pesky covops just flying through they function as keep out signs in wspaceif you really want to avoid getting caught in a bubble fly an interceptoror stay in empire
no its not controversial at all controversy implies two sides who disagree theres no second side here everyone just thinks youre an idiot
harsh but true alas the truth is often cruel
i meant static bubbles not hics dictors
wow you two obviously have need issues doesnt mummy give you guys enough attention that you have to post on forums needlessly and be negative and actually have not contributed at all im glad you feel that you belong to society nowwell done
what is there to contribute your idea is bad it shouldnt be implemented theres no germ of a good plan here no solid core that can be fixed with a tweak or a rewrite i try to partake in constructive criticism but thats impossible when theres nothing to construct
anchoring bubbles on titans is a very viable way to get them
oh my godyour personal attack on me has done what your reasoned argument couldnt  convinced me that youre absolutely correct and that this idea should be advanced as rapidly as possiblewheres the tick mark for  you
i must agree that its rather  well  lazy to have a bubble on the undocking ramp of a station personally i dont think they should be allowed within a certain distance of the undocking ramp or even a certain distance from the station it simply doesnt make sense to me from an ic point of view in my opinionsling bubbles though i see no problem with them they can easily be circumvented with proper scouting scanning directional scanner or the use of tactical bookmarks if you jump through a gate and find yourself in the middle of a bubble reapproach jump back and find a route around simple enoughthat said you seem to be focusing on the offensive use of bubbles and have neglected to touch on the defensive use eg anchoring a bubble on a gate or wormhole to give miners  plexers more time to react when an enemy enters local
lazy they do take effort to put up and effort to take down unlike a hic which is press button and wait a couple seconds as long as they are up they need to be guarded otherwise you risk ensnaring your buddies and getting them killedno anchoring a bubble implies commitment so it cannot possibly be considered lazy
ok so i had a wacky idea last nightwhy not do it so when your in warp to somwhere you can stop your ship so you end up out of warp in middle of the 2 celestiels its basicly same as stop ship when your moving or before warp but its for when your in warp your ship will slow down like normaly coming out of warp not just stop dead in spacethere are a few rules for this 1 you cannot stop ship 2au away from each celes this stops pple from warping and hitting it asap to get as close as possible to celestialrest i dunno yet lol xdiv forgotten most of idea but that weas basicly it and i know it can be overpoweredoverused but at same time your fleet needs a prober at all times to find the ships just stoping but at same time it can help you very wellallso another idea was that since warp scramblers block your mwd why not have bubbles stoping cloaks or hics points stoping cloak allso that way if someone is caught in one they cannot cloak but if there in a ship designed to cloak it may be able to get away still and if the ship warps to ass from belts or from a gate or whatever they can still cloak because they canot be found straight away if they just cloak so it doesnt break the mod but in my eyes the cloak is abit overpowered as there isnt anyway to stop this mod part from 2km away which as we all know is sometimes if not all by luckso i just thought of something that uses ingame item allready here more usefull and its just for 00 for bubbles but you can bring it to lowsechighsec by using the hic point maybe make a new script for it for just cloakers or something like that allso for the stop in warp idea do it so that even if there is a bubble up on gatestationwhatever you carnt stop warp so your auto pulled into bubble from moment you start warp
that way dont slam the door on the way out
ow my brain so if im reading you right you want to change warp mechanics pretty fundamentally for no apparent reason and you want to make it so that covert ships cant run bubble camps any more because at present theyre hard to catch no no a thousand times no
well the warp change doesnt have to happen just a random idea but if you thought for a sec the helios and all other ships designed for cloaks like curse and such could be given another bonus that stops there cloak from been affected there for they can still scout and sucheasy fix
reposting my reply from fi1 i am not sure the cancel warp works rp wiseand for me it seems a bit like they took me my logging of mid warp now i want another mean of avoiding gate camps and you can do that already a good job on avoid drag bubbles and such with bouncing on planets so you get a slightly different angle2 you can lock a ship suddenly it cant cloak anymore just in case you didnt know about that yetso  just a thought  put a can on the side of the bubble where you expect people to it your bubble voila they get decloaked or a shipcross posting is bad
true on both parts but most ships can just cloak before you get a lock that arnt meant for cloaking and with a burst of mwd you can be gone from spot fast as hellbut yea i posted in fandi because the first person said it goes there pfgyi i dnt live in 00 or travel to 00 anymore and its no whine just clearing things up just a wiered idea i had lol
why would you want to be able to stop people in midwarp you can already make the ridiculously powerful slings only restricted by grid size if i recalla midwarp interdiction would just spawn a whole new school of risk averse pvpers and general griefers they are at least semivulnerable when forced to operate near gates and ther celestialsmy hijack steal if wantedwith the new 20au limit to bookmarking something should be offered to make safespotonthefly a little easier to achieve space got a lot more crampeda warp command in the context menu that goes 510au in the direction of the cursor limited by the imaginary wall to prevent floating deep safespotswould open up a lot more options for safes if they could be created abovebelow the plane which is now impossible as the warpbug has been squashed
erm you should learn to read tbh i never said stopping pple in midwarp i said stop your ship meaning your own ship at any time in midwarp lofl read first
i propose anyone that has asked where the command centers are or when they will be out should be banned from any sort of pithis should apply to questions on the forums and ingame channels
as of now in auction contracts you are forced to place a minimum bid of 10 of the starting bidi think it would better if the person who sets up an auction contract could choose what the minimum increment bid would be some people right now set starting bids to a very low number to attract more poeple into bidding on it but this means that it could sell for below what the auctioner wants and there is very little the auctioner could do about itthere could be a cap to what the auctioner can set like 15 of the starting bid and an always present minimum of 15 for bidder to prevent 01 iskplay
supporting own topic
smallest amount on contracts is 1 isk anyways but supported would be a nice addition to contracts but integrate it into one of the existing windows i dont want to end up with yet another useless click
supporting with same reservations as above
yup its always confused me why this wasnt the case also the ability to set a hidden reserve and a sniper rule would be another pair of welcome additions to auction contracts
problemcurrently i believe eve gate is too focused on receiving updates from eve while out of game in my opinion eve gate needs better access ingame this proposal isnt about introducing new features to eve gate per se but increasing accessibility to eve gates current features from within eve itselfcurrently there are two main features in eve gate broadcasts and the calender currently only one of these two features can be seen ingame and that is the calender to make a broadcast or view the broadcasts of other characters you must log into eve gate via the igb or an oog browser i know several people who do not use the igb because they dont trust it for security reasons so theyll never be able to access the broadcast window from within eve given the current setupideabasically i would love to be able to log into eve and check broadcasts from members to quickly get a glimpse of what theyre up to or what theyve been up to yes i could ask in corp chat but sometimes it would be nice to skip the formalities and get straight to business imagine if you could send a corpalliancewide broadcast telling people what youre up to egmaybe id log on and see a broadcast sent 30 minutes earlier sayingas people log on they could pull up a broadcasts window and quickly get an overview of what the active members are up to see whether anything is going on locally and then ask to join in i believe this is in part what broadcasts were designed for to allow people outofgame to see what people are doing while ingame the problem is that its currently too cumbersome to send a broadcast from within eveon a side note i guess this would in effect allow broadcasts to be used to advertise impromptu events while planned events would be advertised in the calendersolutionwhat i propose is that a facility is introduced to allow players to read and make broadcasts from within eve without having to visit the eve gate website this could be done through an expansion of the calender window that currently exists within evethe calender window could include a second tab at the top for broadcasts from this tab a player could send a new broadcast or view existing broadcastsfurthermore the button in the bottom left corner of eve that is used to open the calender could be highlighted blink or pulse when there are updates be it a new broadcast or a new event on the calender at the moment the only way to see if there are new events is by randomly opening the calendar or by logging into eve gateto expand on this in the future possibly allow people to create broadcasts that expire and link said broadcasts to fleetsedit formatting and colours
supporting my own proposal

i like it this seems like a good extension of the original idea
supported seems to be a good idea 
no i dont believe you can im just saying that would be a better solution than what you propose
i know that it is currently available as a podacst via itunes but its cut at the endmy proposal is that ccp sell a full version of this absolutely awesome song via itunes and donate all proceeds minus the apple cut to childs playthis is a fantastic track clealy a lot of work has gone into producing it and i would love to actually own an entire copy on my ipod to listen to in its entiretyin future fund raising events ccp could simply point ot this track im hopeful that ccp could get apple to waive thier costs on a charitable donation argument but wont hold my breathplease support this notion
interesting idea i like it
yes
also make the calendar light up like evemail icon if you have new events
current sov systemok currently it takes almost 6 days to take a system with a station ihub and tcu i personally think this is way to long especially now with they decreased costs in building stations soon 00 will be riddled with stations everywhere the current system requires a 23 day timer on the initial taking of system or when it is put into reinforce so this means you half to individually shootrf the ihub tcu and station then you must come back and put it into reinforce again then wait another 23 days for everything to come out of rf again then you can blow it up problemthe problem with this in my opinion it takes way to long to take a system a defend has week to come defend it and does not half to come defend it till the very end and if you screw up while taking a system and have a bad day it starts all over again so you could fight for weeks and never accomplish anything yet you have put this particular system in reinforce like 8 times just werent able to finish the job due to lag or the other side just had the upper hand that daysolution lets get rid of the double reinforce timer if we did so it would1only take 34 days instead of 68 days to take a system2would make it easier for smaller alliances to take sov from bigger onesalso in other thought reduce the the over all size and hit points of any ihub1 by reducing the size of the ihub it would make it easier for smaller alliances to get an ihub to 00 instead of using current method of getting a freighter and then praying it doesnt die on the way up2reducing the effective hit point it would take smaller alliance less time to take down the ihub and wouldnt require dreads to do so or sitting there forever in bsdiscuss plz no troll
suggestions welcomeokformatting is a good thing you should use it
this invasion if anything has taught us that we should be allowed to join pirate factions and conquer empire not just sansha but all of themi believe we should be allowed to physically conquer space currently owned by other factions on behalf of another factionthis would certainly make fw more attractive and a little less like bgs from wow it will directly affect everyone too and would promote rp who imo are the most creative in game
i agree pilots should be able to join the milita of pirate factions not just the four empireslowsec should have claimable sovereignty in effect being an npcclaimed nullsec lite infrastructure hubs maintained by the militia with limited upgrades available cyno jammers but no jump bridges or outposts for examplenote this is a feature suggestion not an assembly hall issue see the thread pirate faction warfare in fi forum
not sure about the sov modules but yeah this would be an excellent and interesting way to groom people into 00 living it will also increase lowsec populationit is a follow up on an old suggestion of mine a while back which i sadly lost but no matterpeople in empire dont have much experience with sov related stuff in 00 fw is a brilliant way to get into the mechanics ofc with sov being limited to a few powerblocs
to get more people out into lowsec we need more security how much fun is it to deploy a pos and invest a few billions in reagents for reactions only to have some fool from the pandemic legion rapid response team take your pos down by force with a dozen dreads and supercarriers while youre desperately trying to man the guns and rep the shields with a couple of basilisksthe step from hisec to lowsec needs to be more graduated sovereignty agents ie folks who invest in the infrastructure to claim sovereignty for the npc faction should be able to control whether capitals or supercapitals are allowed in their various lowsec systemsso we might have carebear empire who decides to build sov up to the level where they have sov 5 in the hiseclowsec bridge system with no cynos allowed at all then in the neighbouring systems they allow capitals so jump freighters can get from eg vuorrassi to taisy but no nalvula and in systems surrounding them they allow supercapitals but also have a heavy hired police presence to ensure that any hostile supercapitals will be met with 25 police squads  laughable i know but the police will remote rep each other and keep the supercap infinipointed while broadcasting notice of the attack to the respective channel eg carebear empire police notificationsaggression police forces in system name have engaged player name who is piloting a nyxultimately getting folks out to lowsec should be driven by more opportunities for entrepreneurs vigilantes and pirates alike the biggest opportunity for carebears is security while pursuing profitid like these sov upgrades to be available for everyone thus every hisec system would have tcu and ihub in place mission agents would be controlled by ihub upgrades with folks living in hisec able to influence their local governments to determine the mixture of industry vs military upgrades strength of local police force etcthe difference between hiseclowsecnullsec would then be a who hold sovereignty hisec and lowsec npc sov nullsec player sov and b who polices regulations hisec concord lowsecnullsec players  hired npcsthen we could have players working with guristas for example to upgrade guristas systems and expand guristas sovereignty claims fighting against big nullsec alliances at the nullsec border and other npc alliances at the lowsec borderslets get the chance to play the bad guys 
yes was promised but never developed
i sincerely hope this is a troll because otherwise its one of the worst ideas ive seen in a while
so i have a couple characters ive been playing eve for a couple years got a couple billion isk in the bank couple dozen ships laying around ive always thought that i was an average eve player that is until today just moments ago i warped into a belt to find two unsuspecting angel frigates floating about some roids so i took it upon myself to bring safety to the verse and lock them down after initiating the afterburner on my ishtar as well as my active hardeners i checked that i was within my optimal range for my turretammo and began to fire in mere moments the armor of the first frigate was melting away not wanting to waste my time launching a flight of drones i launched another salvo at the first frigate to see it lit up in a flash of light now i can focus on his i thought to myself as i locked my guns on my next target wait what it was charging out of my optimal fast i fired a quick round at the target and it glanced off the shields loading up my long range ammo i continued to fire but alas the frigate had turned and escaped making good use of its mwd and pointing directly away from me i chased it until it was around 300km away and it then warped away or maybe despawnedobviously as of today i have become such a fearsome opponent that common npcs are rewriting their own code as to flee from their own imminent death or its a bug i propose we either install the npcs with a hearty dose of courage or fix said bug and overall i would like to propose that this thread be used to discuss the idea of new mechanics for our npcs and that ccp and the development team look into making more interactive npcs i for one would like to see the big boss of a mission run away with your mission loot if you leave him for last or npcs that launch drones npcs that use varying strategies etc
i like your thinking ankhesentapemkahreducing the variety of items sold through any one corporations lp store  reducing the proximity of highquality agents for any corporation should be enough to spread missionrunners out to some degreeimproved possibility for trade is good too by creating scarcity of items the need for trade is generated

most fps and the like use a cheat detecting app like punkbuster and while im mildly annoyed with such applications they do server a purpose i would however have to say no on using something like that there are creative alternatives that do not involve scanning anything most of which are advanced data mining techniques that could be performed server side many of these are used all the time by law enforcement and intelligence agencies for similar things im not going to go into any detail in case they are being used no reason to give the macro miners real money traders cheats or other various scum that muck up the game for the rest of us any tips on how to avoid getting busted if anyone from the csm or ccp would like to have a more detailed breakdown on my idea please send me a message in game
im all for canning macros but running software on the end users computer is not going to solve the problem in the same way that draconian drm doesnt stop people violating copyrightif you dont trust the end user how can you trust their hardware the more sophisticated hackers will just disable the warden and mock up a program that sends the server the all clear messagethe less sophisticated people eg those who are just playing the game for fun start finding that their computer runs slow the disk is always active the machine never enters sleep mode random software crashes for no reason and theyre banned from eve because they ran adobe cs5 which warden didnt recognise as being legitimate softwareno the way to crack down on macros is multipronged first map out those pilots who have incredible stamina and can repeat mundane tasks with unerring accuracy for hours on end second remove the mundane tasks that have to be repeatedturn mining into something a little less predictable asteroids that spawn in different locations are identified as barren interesting rich etc on overview and require scanning with a survey scanner in order to identify which one is the one we want to mine todayperhaps require the pilot to enter asteroid view scan the asteroid for resources and target the mining lasers at the appropriate part of the asteroid to extract the richest ore we do this for planetary interaction already after allthen remove the clicksink allow the orca and rorqual to run cargo links which vacuum ore out of the mining ships cargo hold at some rate dependent on meta level of the cargo link and cargo transfer skill level of the orca pilot for example removing click sinks will reduce efficiency of a macro compared to a humanso mining then becomes survey asteroid field for interesting rocks analyze asteroid to generate mining laser targets start mining an asteroid might consist of eg patches of barren no minerals large patches of veldspar or scordite smaller patches of the richer ores etcas we progress from hisec to nullsec the asteroid gets bigger and contains a higher proportion of the richer ores this replaces the current system where every ships computer can tell the difference between rich and poor ores and the random respawning will reduce the efficacy of having a bookmark near an asteroid that one mines on a regular basisfor missions id prefer to see smaller fleets of harder npcs with npcs always using their racial ewar along with webs and scramblers  right from level 1 missions teach folks how to use pvp tactics the moment they get into their capsule so pvp isnt so scary for them

yes thats item d i reworded it to make that more clearalso updated items a and b so that links point to evelopedia entries which summarize the referenced lists
for a you have in your mail the correct issues list passed by csm4 with links for prioritization and discussion with ccp as evewiki is not updated fully
possibly the first person i have gotten annoyed by due to some seriously bad ideas anyway it turns out i have been a little mean to you unaware that you are a brilliant trolltherefore i wish to put our past dealings behind us and form a pact if you wish sharing excellent ideas i have already consulted my predecessor emo traderjohn and believe we have a contract suitable for youi look forward to hearing from youmusical fistcfo of leaving eve psychiatry
interesting theory but i have to say correlation does not imply causation
back on topic agreed it would be however nice if prior to the next elections you picked a candidate at random on which you will unleash the exact same methods you did previously the name would of course be kept from the public but stored with a third party for verification and then show whether you can actively influence the outcome of the elections
i think annoying  no publicity  lower votesoverall there were more votes trying to correlate votes from previous csm and this csm is pretty hardi think drama  hits  benefited a few candidates probably people rallied behind certain candidates to contra as well basically the net loser would be candidates with low visibilityits possible that some of the votes come this way  popularity only  but most wining candidates have multiple avenues to garner votes i reckon a strong campaign and broad appeal would be most important factor imo highest votes in this csm was garnered in this manneras for the impact of long long threads alot of it is garbage so unless someone is  a  forum denizen   b  actively posting in said thread  c  vested i doubt they be motivated to read all thatpersonally i am unlikely to read up on a csm candidates with a thread with low hits i just look up some site that would summarize stuff like the csm comparison thingy etc but thats just methat might hurt those particular candidates with low visibility if said candidates have no developed base  track record they would definitely have been impacted in this particular raceif someone starts garnering alot of attention they could also leverage that to speak out to their base fear is a great motivator the apathetic ones would then probably be inclined to actually vote if they feel there is a threatthe irony would be delicious hereherd of sheep could be based on perception  it could be construed as voting for someone because everyone in your block  alliance  gameplay  is voting that way it might not be true 100 but the perception remains or are you talking about sheep in another locale 
the guys that are roleplaying girls vote for female candidatesjust my 2 cents
i know and i would have waited another term to perform some more tests but as iUFFFDm not the only one who does it anymore if i ever was i think bumping your own threads with alts is something many of the candidates do i just took it to a somewhat higher level it wouldnUFFFDt be a real test anywaystill iUFFFDm going to compare the view counts of the upcoming csm election to the view counts reached this time and if there is a big difference iUFFFDll know i had some impact on the serious world of internet spaceships
i agree beeing invisible is the worst thing you can do as a csm candidateagain i agree the chairman of this csm won because he is popular in game performed a good campaign and got some kind of block vote and is a girl irlyour second point is exactly what iUFFFDm talking about you are unlikely to read a low hit thread as you are not reading it you are not going to vote for the candidate in question so by rising the hit count i raised the possibility for the people in question to get a voteiUFFFDve cut something of your post away herei was talking about a sheep blindly following the herd aka the threads with high viewpost counts iUFFFDm far from claiming every eve player votes because he is in block a or becaues candidate bUFFFDs thread had the most views but iUFFFDm claming that a significant amount of votes can be influenced by simply changing the viewpost count of the candidates threads
anhk had highest readsmynxee secondand me thirdkorvin fourth i thinkwheres my seat or am i just especially edtamber
sadly i havnUFFFDt written down all read counts before i posted so it might actually be possible that you permaf5ed your own thread to prove me wronganother possibility is the use of coloured writing in your candidate post after playing eveforums for years you should have learned that this is a foolproof way to get people to hate youedit to clarifyiUFFFDm still not claming that a high readpost count is everything i just claim that it helps looking at my op you can see vuks relative share go down against the developement of nc numbers in game with the read count of his csm threads he still made it because of the block vote i guessthe only things i actually know are that i did what i wrote and that others diddo it too and the only thing i want is to imagine a bunch of nerdy evegeeks mashing f5 the next time the csm is elected
it was probably the colours i didnt change my read amount or even click it to raise my count i posted the stats in the jita speakers forum under irrelevant statistics or some such nametamber
capturing demographic data and relate it to a vote would lessen the anonymity to my mind it should not be implemented within the voting systems if you want demographics poll them outside of the vote on a voluntary basis
this is a game guys its not iranian politics where you have a risk to be hanged
blasphemyeveryone knows internet spaceships is serious business
nope but internet privacy is even if it only relates to a game
i worry that doing this might remove some of the support the csm has among players partisans of a given candidate are already annoyed when that candidate loses but how much more annoyed and bitter would they be if the results come in you finished 3 among oldtimers but didnt get a seat it seems likely to be nothing but divisive

even though apparently i messed up my allpication and the email i sent never arrived i was never added to the election and i just saw i lost by a wide margin to say that i am crushed beyond recovery i shall endevor to carry on the crusade for truth just and freedom for all or at least the right to arm bears yet again a pitafull small voice caling from the wilderness of the oppesive man is drowned out by the establishment and crushed like a bug  on the plus side is that i avoid what is likely going to be a lot of paper work and chattingi would add that hose who did not vote for what ever reason dont get to complain about who did or didnt get elected if you dont stand up and be counted then things will never change all it takes for evile to prevail is that good menwoman do nothing cant remember the author of that quote and i aploigise cause it isnt minewell done and good luck to all that did run and to the winners good bad or indifferent at least you all stood up tried to be counted and took your best shot that is and of itself commenable again well done fly well fly freeelf lordps some of you have noooooooooooooooooo sence of humour at all and need to learn how to chill out personnally i recomend ludes or xanax maybe a valium or 2 or with your favorite taste beverage minus the pills what ever floats your boat but realy folks you need to lighten up before you give yourselves a stroke if there was an olimpic event for tight asses some of you would clean up on the medals back to mining have fun and good luck all
tldr once the poor abused platitudes are stripped away youre too dumb to fill out a simple form properly but its the establishment keeping you down and anyone who calls you on your idiocy is an olympicclass tightass who needs drugsright
thank you ever so much for proving my point for me what no one seems to understand is that i asked and asked very nicely for a simple answer to a simple quetsion the moderater could have settled the entire issue simply by answering my question i also sent an email as asked and that went no where i was not the only person saying they had problems with the apps and email there was no need to turn this whole thing into a flame war but since you started it i figured what the hell i was bored just mining so i defended myself and my beliefes you and your pals instead of droping the subject and letting the moderator of this disscusion settle the issue you simply went ahead and contniued insulting me and just ing me off are you wrong i say hell ya am i wrong i say ya i suppose since i could simply have let you and yours bully me into going away are we both wrong damn skippy is the moderater wrong for failing to control hisher forum damn straightand if you loooked at what i wrote all of what i wrote you would have seen that unlike yourself i was gracious in my congradulations to the winners pointed no figures called no names made light of the mistakes we all made in this and simply was willing to end things then and there and wished everyone well in their endevors you on the other hand simply see that yet again i am not fitting into your mentality and so attack me with no regard for the truth or letting sleeping dogs lay god bless you and yours because i know there is a special place in heaven waiting for you and yours of course since i am jewish i allready have a spot reserved in the hecklers section so i hope some day we meet in a bigger universe than this onefly well but fly freeefl lord
and so did the voters
