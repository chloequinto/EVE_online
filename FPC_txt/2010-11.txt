more bumpingthough black ops is fine as a weak deployment vehicle hell if you made it both weaker in combat terms but made it a better deployment vehicle it would be much more awesomestep 1 remove all turretbay hardpoints so top slots can only equip probesutility stuffstep 2 remove drone baystep 3 double the base jump range maybe more cut fuel costs to 10 or so of currentstep 4 add a bay to distribute bombsammo to other members of the fleetthere fixed black ops is now the raft that carries in the special forces for covert missions rather than an orangepainted raft with two machine guns buckled to the sides for no apparent reason doesnt need a covops cloak really bonus to velocity is fine from what ive seen from the guy that runs ours
noand not because im a dinosaur or afraid of change eve is not to be measured by the standards of other mmorpgs it would make them all look bad keep it that way keep innovating ccp dont borrow a halfarsed business model aimed at prepubescents presumably incapable of addition
nooh please no
no microtransactions games are generally free to play giving transactions a reason to occur eve is far to be free to play 
no
no
no a strong no to all this nonsense
no frackin way
no
cosmetics only
nopeople play eve to get away from that garbage there are plenty of microtransactionwowpretty pony games for people who like that keep eve uninfected
no
not that this thread necessarily needs it but i feel a bump is in order
supported motherships should have been half the size of titans at least carriers should be equal to or slightly bigger than dreads in size
supporting the second idea would make it easier to uh compare things
compare tool would be 1337
sounds sweet much easier than opening every ship from the market or auto linking and messing with the windows so you can see the stats
capital idea chap
oh come on the malefemale split in eve is bad enough as it is do we really need more testosterone meh supported edit actually im going to suggest that the increase be provided by resists rather than by a straight increase in hp its not like remote hull repair is going to get a sudden boost because someone has 80 hull resists instead of 60 and itd save some very remote repair pilots a few hourstaking a leaf from the slave sets bonuses we deriverambo alpha 1 bonus to hull resistsrambo beta 2 bonus to hull resistsrambo gamma 3 bonus to hull resistsrambo delta 4 bonus to hull resistsrambo epsilon 5 bonus to hull resistsrambo omega 15x bonus to rambo set bonusesfollowing the slave bonus pattern that would give a 3404 bonus however as im suggesting a resist bonus instead of a straight multiplier we have to take the reciprocal account for diminishing returns  after which it corresponds to approximately a 516 bonus to hull ehpokay yeah values would need to be tweaked still awesome idea p
more stuffgood stuffo
eves not about being fairbut it is about providing a full sf background for our silly pvp and pve shenanigansso im not going to complain too much even if concord passes new rules of engagement and the orca providing the hotswap now goes blinky red even though i never mine and trained up two orca pilots in different alliances just to hotswap andor move groups of ships in high sec if i whine because concord now treats me like an accessory to an incident when i actually am one then im just being silly and i agree with the point that people shouldnt be able to continuously swap out ships in the middle of combat without being instapoddedso though it may be unfair to some piwates to close this loophole id not whine about itbut id really really love it and consider using the trick if the orca only went blinkyred aggressionwise if it were on the same grid and was able to hotswap with impunity elsewhere in the system 
yes lets wardec federal navy academy rightseems like risk averse wardeccers at work here eve is supposed to be harsh and all that so if you directly aid flagged people in your mining support ship you also should be flagged and not be too scared of combat
not supported ooc alts need a nerf especially in hisec wars
i support the original proposal in part 1 also support this sentiment
while youre at it make giving fleet bonuses pull aggro too and cap bounties on npcs killed in highsec at 300k so that griefer decs and thus development time spent on aggro mechanics become largely unnecessary
i wouldnt be surprised if this could cause clientside graphical lag during busy fleet fightsbut thats hardly reason to remove support for the feature entirely just have it be one of those performancetweakables in the options menu 1
1if it indeed causes clientside lag make it optional but bring it back
yes but thats hardly an excuse to deny them a proper damage bonus as wellconsidering that legions dont have the powergrid to use a beam laser configuration i hardly see the relevance in comparing their longrange tracking characteristics besides who ever heard of a covert sniper this discussion is about the covert ops subsystem stay topicaland yet missiles can as well when 50 minmatar caldari of eve can change damage types the inability to do so is a significant disadvantage to a given weapon systems this is made worse by the fact that the laser damage is so variable in effectiveness utterly useless against armor and t2 minmatar resists whereas kinetic and thermal are always at least moderately usefuland yet when ships have powergrid and cpu to spare they opt not to use the supposedly better laser weapons systems instead going with autocannons doesnt that strike you as odd it is absolutely relevant when ships lack compelling damage bonuses to their racial weaponry they consistently choose autocannons you see this not only on the myrmidon but also on the punisher the maller and the prophecy  all ships which get a 50 capacitor bonus and ignore it entirely i would wager that you could take capacitor out of the equation entirely 100 bonus and they would still opt for autocannons because of the improved tracking easier fitting requirements and selectable damagei was obviously being facetious the fact that you seriously thought i was suggesting nerfing the omen makes me question whether you have the grounds to discuss any turret platform laser or otherwise
i mean precisely what i said the legion has 5 effective turrets the proteus has 625 thats a 20 loss in damage output relative to the other covert strategic cruiser platforms its basic algebra your inability to perform it probably has something to do with your position in this debate when something lacks a 25 damage bonus it has a 20 loss in dps take the reciprocal of course if you want to compare to the loss of a 25 rof bonus then then its actually a 25 loss in effective turrets however given the disadvantages of a high rof capacitor use ammo use reload time i felt it more reasonable to compare it to the proteuss bonus rather than the lokis or tengusand while you may certainly argue that examining effective turrets ignores the variations between turret typeshavent i already established that in the absence of any other determining factor such as meaningful shipspecific damage bonuses and abundant powergrid and cpu autocannons are the shortrange weapon of choiceif i havent then let me make it abundantly clear the punisher the maller the prophecy and the myrmidon all use autocannons indeed you will even see autocannons replacing blasters on caldari platforms like the merlin the moa and the ferox they do it because their mediocre weapons bonuses dont give them sufficient reason not to projectiles offer superior tracking and range combined with lower pgcpucapacitor costs and selectable damage type when people can use them without giving up vital ship bonuses they dolet me now remind you that the covert legion also lacks compelling ship weapon bonuses doesnt the earlier comment about the myrmidon seem awfully relevant now yes i believe it doeswhat makes the covert legion subsystem so unforgivable is that all these other platforms have some other bonus provided to them  typically a resist bonus that is a ganktank tradeoff something wholly inadequate for a covert strategic cruiser as such the covert legion needs some laser bonus that compels it to retain its signature weapon type a range bonus would let it use higher grade crystals and give it the dps advantage necessary to make lasers a compelling alternative to autocannons
the funny thing is that its not about the range anyone who thinks that it is completely misunderstands the amarrian weapons systemfor lasers more than any other weapon type range is damage  because with an instant crystal swap you turn turn any excess optimal into a higher damage multiplierthe choice of a range increase was threefoldprovide a unique bonus that differentiates the covert legion from its counterpart t3sremain consistent with the amarrian tradition by adopting the offensive bonuses of the armageddonlimit the scope of the buff to make it more psychologically acceptable heavyhanded buffing is bad projectiles
completely irrelevant produce an autocannon fitted covert ops legion that out performs a pulse laser fitted legion and it becomes almost relavent even then the relavence of such a fitting pattern is to prove that the legions bonuses do not need to be changed if the problem exists on more ships than just the legion it is not the legion that needs fixing it is pulse lasersif you want to prove your point then produce a viable comparison that shows an autocannon legion out performing a pulse laser legion otherwise compare full fittings not contextless bonues the 20 difference that you cite is meaningless you need to apply those bonuses to actually fittings for any comparison to have meaning provide a comparison of actual dps tracking and range if you want your comparison to be worthwhilealso remember the intended role of pulse lasers if you want your turrets to work at bumping range then you picked the wrong race to train for if you want them to work at web or scram range then you will find pulse lasers are at their optimal while the others are falling off fast
very well please allow me to do precisely thatconsider the following legion fitting it has a relatively impressive 102k ehp and boasts a 2218 ms speed under mwd however due it achieves only a lackluster 319 dps with faction multifrequency reaching out to a paltry 86365km range tracking is 032 rads and the high powergridcapacitor requirements of lasers force two compromises onto the fittingit has insufficient pg to use the augmented capacitor reservoir subsystem and must instead utilize the power core multiplierit has insufficient capacitor to fly without a capacitor booster even before you consider the dangers of energy neutralizationlegion covertlazorlegion defensive  augmented platinglegion electronics  dissolution sequencerlegion engineering  power core multiplierlegion offensive  covert reconfigurationlegion propulsion  chassis optimizationheavy pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mcovert ops cloaking device iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivewarp scrambler iitrue sansha medium capacitor booster cap booster 800tracking computer ii optimal rangetracking computer ii tracking speedarmor thermic hardener iiimperial navy energized adaptive nano membraneimperial navy heat sinkimperial navy heat sink1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump i
i dont use because i dont think its a good choice given its lack of zazz however id be willing to try it some more if you are implying it is more useful than it seems aside from the obvious tactical advantage a covops cloak grants pilotsi honestly would rather fly a stealth bomber from a cost effectiveness standpointedit 1 wordingedit 2 stealth bomber comment added
now consider this fitting due to the ludicrously low powergrid requirements of autocannons the engineering subsystem can either remain allowing for additional plating or be swapped for the augmented capacitor reservoir as i have done here i opted for this configuration so that the tank and number of damage mods would remain identicalmoreover the lack of capacitor use nevermind the addition of the augmented capacitor reservoir allows the legion pilot to forgo the medium capacitor reservoir even after doing so the setup remains cap stable at an astonishing 506 microwarpdrive and all note that the use of capacitorfree guns makes energy neutralization less of a threat as well in exchange the empty midslot can now be fitted with a stasis web all the better for striking at small targets the legion would otherwise struggle with no drone bay in any decent subsystem configurationfinally note the scripts in the tracking computers despite the fact that both are fitted for optimal range this autocannon configuration actually achieves identical tracking to the laser loadout what it improves on is range accomplishing an incredible 20197km range with barrage it strikes out to 39295kmfor all this it need only sacrifice 104 of its dps output dropping to 286 dps do you really mean to imply that lasers are still the weapon of choice under the covert subsystem configurationlegion covertautolegion defensive  augmented platinglegion electronics  dissolution sequencerlegion engineering  augmented capacitor reservoirlegion offensive  covert reconfigurationlegion propulsion  chassis optimization425mm autocannon ii republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii republic fleet emp m425mm autocannon ii republic fleet emp mcovert ops cloaking device iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivewarp scrambler iistasis webifier iitracking computer ii optimal rangetracking computer ii optimal rangearmor thermic hardener iiimperial navy energized adaptive nano membranerepublic fleet gyrostabilizerrepublic fleet gyrostabilizer1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump i
 op you know something is wrong when you get better effectiveness fitting autocannons to an unbonused ship brings me back to the bad old days when projectiles on an apoc was considered correct
as a reminder id like to point out that these fittings should not even be close a t3 offensive subsystem provides tremendous bonuses to its pilot using the tengus accelerated ejection subsystem as an example a level 5 skill literally doubles your damage output with missileseven the more modest covert configuration derives a 33 damage bonus from training the relevant subsystem skill to 5 these fittings should not even be comparable  the laser setup should blow the autocannon setup out of the water
sadly thats almost universally true  and moreover the legion the punisher and the maller are not unbonused ships in the first place they all benefit from the 50 capacitor use bonus and you can see the effect or lack thereof in the use profile of their turrets
i also ran a comparison of those two setups to ensure a more favorable assessment for the autocannon setup i dropped one of the tracking computers on the lazer setup so that both setups had a statis webifieri agree that it is fair to switch the engineering subsystem and cap booster for the autocannon setup however i disagree that the change will decrease the threat of energy neutralization the lack of cap booster would increase the danger of energy neutralization while your weapons would continue to function without cap your mwd web and scram will fail if you faced a real threat with energy neutralization the result would be your death or your opponents retreat keeping the cap booster would shift the resulting conclusion further in favor of the laser loadoutthis is not an increase in range over the laser setup the autocannons perform best within their optimal range as the range increases past the autocannons optimal range the advantage of pulse lasers increases at point blank range the lasers have a 113 damage advantage over the autocannons at 9km scram range the lasers have a 214 advantage over the autocannons at 24km disruptor range the lasers have a 536 damage advantage going past that range lasers retain their advantagelooking back at your specific proposal how does giving the legion a range bonus improve on the current balance given that it already has significantly better range than is needed for the role you are describing especially if that range bonus comes at the cost of the capacitor bonus that it already has there might be grounds for a 5 to 10 boost to pulse laser damage across the board but there does not appear to be any grounds for the suggested range bonus to be added to the legions covert ops subsystem
not supported horrible ideas leave learning skills in just as they are if people cant handle it eve is not for themnobody forces you to invest time in learning skills to 55 just like nobody forces you to train racial cruiser to 5of course if you are not an idiot and want to get the most out of your character then at some point you will spend the time and do itthere seems to be some hidden implication in all this that learning skills need to be trained to 55 as soon as a character is created while doing nothing else but thatwhich is so dumb its not funny that is supremely flawed logic and i find it reprehensiblei see this thread a microtransactions thread and a plex for remap thread on the first page alone wtf is this cancer ccp do you think i have spent thousands of hours and thousands of dollars on this game over the years because i thought it was subpar and didnt like the way it workedgive it a rest you jokers ha ha ha ha ha
you should read the press releases ccp has said you dont matter as much as new players
very supportedsimply put the learnings are a fossil of an era long gone and place a huge burden on new players not only this but the arguments for keeping them often come from trolls with 3 or 4 accounts and titanscarrierswhatever already trained that would like to share their grief and misery about the bad old days with the world and that hate on every change that would make the game more accessible anywayit sucked for me and it should suck for everyone is not an argument nor is the false you dont have to train them have fun lulz derp choicebegone with them refund skillpoints and let the bittervets be bitter about one more thing
supportedthis solution makes a lot of sense people who have learned the skills already will be reimbursed accordingly by having accelerated learning to regain those sp and newer players wont feel so daunted by the really horrible choice of being stuck in a frigate for 2 months while learning them or suffering diminished skill gain rates in the future for ignoring themits already daunting enough coming in to the game as it is and making the realisation that itll take 20 years to max out all learning and that there are players out there already with 7 years headstart on you also knowing that to keep pace and not lose further ground you effectively cant play as youd prefer for 2 months adds salt to the wound so to speakthe system is a flawed design it needs to change
dear piloteerstldr wardec prices are too cheap raise them to reflect current isk inflationi know this is an old discussion but i personally believe that the wardec mechanic for high sec needs many revisions nevertheless as 90 of eve makes its money by either scamming ganking or destroying then old game mechanics need to be updated to the current market of todaythe overall goal of this thread is to mention that there needs to be some kind of change to the wardec pricing mechanic 2 million to wardec a corporation is just pennies on the dollar in eve anyone can fart out 2 million if they know what they are doing so an increase towards wardec pricing is due this is because of eves inflation and needs to be taken into considerationpossible proposalsincrease the base cost and stacking costs for wardecs using this formulab  c  w1  c  wowhere 100 million is the base cost for corporation on corporation wardecs 200 million for the restc  25 million for corporation on corporation wardecs or 50 million for everything elsew  wars that the wardecie is currently in including the one starting at the wardecwo  wars the wardecd corp is currently inprosincreases the cost for wardecs to current market inflationwill reduce the amount of grief wardecs and afk freighter wardecswill make wardecs seem more reasonable compared to cheaper rates from beforewardecs are still cheap enough at these costs per week for novice corporations to be able to pool funds together and fight for a causesignificantly decreases the stacking penality for the new proposed cost while not increasing the cost for sustained alliance wardecers too mucha reasonable change that hopefully is not going to kill anyones pocket pvp side and a much needed update for the wardec mechanic for carebearsa simple code change that can be implemented in a matter of minutes tested in a few hours and fully incorporated within a day or twoconsthis will not eliminate grief wardecs entirelynewb corporations can not wardec for the lulz anymorewardecs are still cheapnot a significant cost for many alliances to stop wardecing smaller corporations similiar to first pointwill not stop corp hoppingthe sliding rule conceptchange the cost based on members in a corporationalliance total amounts impose maximum and minimal boundaries for cost 2550 million for corporation on corporation wardecs no matter the size and maybe 50100 million for alliances stacking decs still occurprosincreases the cost for wardecs to current market inflationwill reduce the amount of grief wardecs and afk freighter wardecswill make wardecs seem more reasonable compared to cheaper rates from beforewardecs are still cheap enough at these costs per week for novice corporations to be able to pool funds together and fight for a causeconsa very time consuming measure that is not apart of the current game mechanics instead of modifying a line of code this becomes a new module etc etcsecond biggest flaw corp hopping for the wardecers will happen on a weekly basis to keep costs down thereby skewing the resultsgrief decs will not go awaydoes not stop corporation hopping
add one more thing if 20 or more people from another corp aggress the corp that started the wardec they should be able to wardec the people who aggressed the corp with the 20 rrers instantly no 24 hour waiting period this would make it harder for rr to unlevel the battlefield
it does strike me as a bit odd that concord sanctioned combat is cheaper than a competently t2fit rifter
supported very needed
not supportedif anything wardecs should be made cheaper the fees should just be a token administrative fee not a barrier to declaring war so long as high sec remains a major isk faucet it should become less safe not more so
not supported this is pvp game and pvp should be cheap
cant really support it for any serious corpalliance the suggested raised fee is still nothing but pocket change heck a couple thousand players could probably pay those fees out of their own private pockets for a good while thus too pointless to make such a marginal adjustment
to those who do not support the ideatowards pvp yes eve is a pvp place but for the majority of people in small corps who live in high sec pvp is not profitable towards the more industrious corps nevertheless the wardec mechanicis useful to heavy producers for ships that many high sec lovers use destruction does mean sales but 2 million per week is nothing and it leads to the point of less tactful wardecs to lets wardec as many idiots as possible hence grief engineprice  200 a week is is still cheap that is less than 30 mil a dayeverything else ssdd
gb2wowkthxbai
pvp is cheap in fact its completely free is vast swaths of the game universethat said just making war decs more expensive will not fix whats wrong with them at your proposed prices 30 million a day etc i can pay for a weeks worth of war dec in an hour or so of playing the game
so its been the norm for a hell of a long while possibly since eves inception that when in warp ur able to and im sorry for the fps phrase here noclip through practically everything in eveas a professional commercial computer game i could understand this feature in an end user design environment but not in an intended final productbuuuut as i know eve is constantly evolving from a product built an age ago i know theres some deep routed things that will get recoded eventuallynow to the detailed issue i wanted to bring upeve onlines warp feature seems to an end user to be almost indistinguishable from another space simulators faster than light flight featureanyone familiar to the independencewar series of computer games by infogrames and particle systems will understand the stark similaritiesthe differences are the ftl warp feature in iwar was discretely controllable as well as having an autopilot feature particle systems warp function in iwar 2 could also navigate around obstacles without dropping out of warp as a feature of the autopiloti do not know if the coding behind it is similar to ccps coding for the warp feature in eve online i could only assume its relatively similarwhat im stressing is that the warp around objects had been achievable since the sequel iwar 2 released 2001to recapwarping through planets moons stations and ships makes eve online seem inferior in quality and breaks the feel of a physical interactive universeother developments from the same time as eves inception with the a similar feature in form and execution had solved this issuecheers for reading i know this doesnt impact gameplay and such things should be prioritized before this but a solution as far as i know should be simple easy to implement and very much achievableit would help with the quality and immersive nature of the gameflame on
supported would make the immersive nature of the game as you put it alot better warping through a stationplanet does kinda kill that a bit hehe
i think this would involve more resources to implement that it would be worth consider how many celestials there are in eve youd have to warp around the load on resources would probably be extreme we already have problems with lag in the game lets not add things that could add to peoples performance problems that arent really necessary
i have no problem if ccp wants to take this on after several older and imo more pressing featuresissues are looked at with the added requirement of allowing us to initiate blind warps of which we can set a default possibly with a max range of a few thousand kilometersif you are going to prevent us from warping through stationsshipsclutter in space then we need to be able to get away from those that would make use of this new feature to keep you from warping

heyyas far as i know planetary systems have huuuuuge bodies of matter and because of that the effects of them should reflect on eve onlines day to day activitiesim unsure if planetary bodies in eve actually orbit or if thats just a non functioning property of planets at the moment what i am proposing are more areas that have not unexplained phenomena but phenomena that can be explained rationally for example1  warping to 0m on a sun although i know u dont literally do that should cause a continual thermal effect and thermal damage to shields etc high radiation near a huge fireball caused by a fusion reaction should also have obvious effects on other sensor systems2  certain planets gas with very low orbit moons should exert electromagneticelectrostatic fields between them point in case would be jupiter and its moon io this situation could be a point in case to have warp points in such situations to have em damage fields in those areas others can be brainstormed but the idea is therethese and other system features can provide different tactical opportunities as well further enriching the end user experiencebtw im not a pvp wannabe thats looking for ways to gain an advantage just a logical thinker that realizes if ur gonna be diving into a stars corona u should at least feel a bit hot under the collarflame on muhuhahahaha
it wont fix anything
as a same account hauler alt of alara i aprove this messageseriously anything will help at this point this should not be allowed but here i am resupporting a cause
pointless idea without some way of also preventing people doing the same thing over multiple accountsbesides in serious discussions rare they may be here reasoned good arguments remain reasoned good arguments whether posted by a main or an alt and posting for or against such an argument with a dozen alts doesnt change a good argument to a bad one or a bad one to a good one

well the forums are already crap because of the people who post in them i dont see how this would hurt it can only get better from here so i support itonly make sure that you only implement this in sections of the forum that have debates ie leave character bazaar recruitment etc open to alts alsoedit i would also make it so that anyone who posts off topic or something that doesnt add anything to the discussion at all ie a random this is a pointless thread or this is in the wrong section and simply ending with that should be deleted and the account be warned
just limit it so only the char with most sp on the account can post alt posting fixed
so for example if verone got a character on his account with more sp than him verone would never be able to post on the eveo forums again more sp does not equate to main characteras i always say with this argument if i can use an alt ingame to spyscoutstealscam the four ss of great justice then i should be able to use an alt to post as well either get rid of all alts or allow them all getting emo over an alt that got you riled up on the eveo forums is pathetic htfu
people should read the proposal it isnt about forcing the use of a main character by sp or age or anything it is about limiting responses to a thread to one character per account ffs there is even a tldr versionyou want to force mains to post make your own proposal and i will gladly rant at you with how you are wrong and ignorant of why people dont want to be forced to do that
im just pushing it to the limit to show what a stupid idea this is
fixed
so you are taking an idea you dont like and suggesting things you or the op and no one else in thread wants to show that if you dont agree with the idea tell people why instead of coming up with magical not suggested scenario to show how a different idea that has nothing to do with this will not work
ive got six accounts to troll from so sure go for it
the irony that exudes from you is so strong you could bottle it
oh my god the stupidity hurts its not about forgetting its about providing a mechanism to update your queue when you are otherwise unable to access an eve client when your computer breaks and you only have access to public terminals without program install privileges itd be nice to have some mechanism to update your skill queue my laptop stopped functioning two months ago and i had to struggle through redownloading and reinstalling eve onto a public terminal every day quite unpleasantproposal supported whiny elitist not supported
this makes sense so if it can be done it should be donesupported
bumping this because it would really help my argument with ccp if i had numbers to back it up share this thread with your friends
look at it this waylast time they ccp worked on sovereignty it brought us to the current state of clusterf now you want to ask them to top their previous performance u mad not supported like hell id rather have the old pos siege grind back tbh or can the whole concept for good and come up with something different that isnt such an utter pita on the other hand if they just wait long enough and proceed on the current roadcourse they might just succeed in depopulating 00 and solve the issue that way
sorry to be offtopic here but after reading 5 posts by this person and also taking their name into account i have come to conclusion that they are a pratto add something useful to the conversation i agree with reviewing sovcarry on
1 even as someone with little experience or interest in sov endgame players approach me all the time about the terribleness of sov as it is now at the direct request of some of them i have posed the question to ccp on our internal forums about how th
this i dont think what theyve come out with is terrible i think it is just not complete and needs to be finished
i think my reasoning for this to be looked into has been remarkably similar to ccp greyscales reasoning i guess he must be trolling too
btw to rehash because you have dragged this so far off the original point this is a small summation of jumpbridges and the problems they create1 they promote extremely large scale fights which the server will never be able to handle2 the larger a coalition gets the easier it is to move numbers encouraging people to move towards this unplayable scale of conflicts3 this doesnt even make sense on any other model rl or any other games i know of because it is illogical4 even should it not be just bad logic which i assure you it is it promotes an unfun style of play and i use the unfun definition provided by you and your coalition ie long load times lots of lag 3k man gangs trying to fight on the same nodewhat would looking into jbs do probably1 promote smaller scale conflicts still large just not as large2 create more value to regions of space eg closer to empire will be a more valuable safer to travel too3 benefits of holding space will be directly related to the act of actually holding space for yourself  this isnt a super strong point i just like the idea of being able to justify use of your space by actually holding it as opposed to just pretending to be friends with another entity so you can get all the benefits they do for holding their own spaceyou say i can make a choice adapt or die well i say there should be a choice and that choice should be to either be in an alliance or to not be in it this middleground where you can just use blue alts  corps to derive benefits of not holding space circumvents consequences which i think is a bad thing for a game like evein the end i think if it really came down to it more people want their actions to actually count ingame being as ccp greyscale said just another cog creating lag is not what i believe eve was ever intended to be despite what you might say and i think it is not the right way to go on to continue encouraging and rewarding the style of play that will lead to more and more unplayable fights
vuk lau wanting to change something lol like the same way he and the rest of csm have been against blob warfare for years but refuse to talk about iti think ccp should give you the ability to travel freely to iceland and not require you todo any work because right now your transparency is making ccp look bad
according to patch notes for quantum rise released november 11 2008 this is one of the changes important multipart storyline missions have had their expiry timers increased to one month to allow for completion i searched through all the patch notes posted after that and did not see any retraction or changes made to itit took a while for that to be implemented and as of now when offered a multipart storyline mission such as the 10 part kidnappers strike the expiration timer does indeed show 1 month however after completing part 1 the expiration timer shows 1 week and continues counting down from that for the other 9 parts the way it stands now have 1 month to accept and complete the 1st part of a 10 part storyline mission and then only have 1 week to accept and complete the other 9 parts a lot of those parts are long missions and some players just dont have the time to complete all of those within 1 week also the 1 month timer for part 1 isnt really helping much considering that the mission part 1 can be completed easily within a few hoursi propose that the 1 month countdown timer continue counting down for all of the parts of the multipart storyline missions meaning that when offered you have 1 month to accept and complete all the parts not just part 1 i dont know how many parts in a storyline mission offer is required to be included in the 1 month expiration timer maybe its set at 6 or more parts however i do know that the way the timer is set up now its just about worthlessthank you all for taking the time to read this
seems like an arbitrary change that wont help to many people and a week does seem like plenty of timebut having played through the kidnappers strike and had a blast with it i could see how real life can get in the way of the larger more fun arcsit isnt like it would hurt anything
this is not assembly hall material this is a petition material
i would like to see if is possible in account management to add another option that include adding multiple accounts single payment optionsyes it looks like the power of 2 package that ccp is promoting in they newsletter but there is a problem is only available to new accounts why this can be added to old players and their old accounts too
new word for youconsistencyconUFFFDsistUFFFDenUFFFDcy noun knsistnseconformity in the application of something typically that which is necessary for the sake of logic accuracy or fairnesslearn to use it properly in everyday communication so people can actually understand what you are trying to tell cant understand what exactly you are trying to tell here mate
ok thats fine and is supportedbut what does power of 2 being unavailable for extending existing accounts has to do with it it wouldnt be a promotion then it would be subscription cost reduction
i approve of the idea 
this is good
why would you want arrows like that im not sure how those would improve the system all that much honestly i think the biggest problem with scanning is just the clicking over stuff all the time and things getting all jumbled upid rather just have it so that on an xy plane wasd controls will move it updownleft and right and then have e and q be up and down on the z axis instead of sitting there and messing around with the arrows select a probe and start movin it
can i suggest two additions1 that the arrow pointing directly at the camera be unclickableall too often i try to move the box by clicking on top and it grabs the arrow handily in the centre of the area im supposed to click and shoots off vertically  i then have to spend ages moving it back down to the plane2 that the plane not cause the boxes and arrows to be dimmed if theyre below it its often twice as hard to scan below the plane because you either need to squint to see the arrowsboxes or you need to flip it upside down and move from underneath the plane
i like iti can not tell you how many time i end up clicking a celestial or resizing my scan range
low hanging fruit
its just my opinion im just not sure how large 3dimensional arrows on the boxes would help at all if anything i would think it would make them more bulky and more difficult to control at times
betting on pvp fights has become somewhat popular and would likely attract a lot more interest if there was a secure escrow system for itperhaps before a fight the two players create some sort of public contract which anyone can chip in on and the pot would be distribuited proportionally by bet amount per participant to those who bet on the winning player of course the mechanics of this could be tweaked a bit but this is the general ideacomments and suggestions welcome

escrow style with a day calendar combattants take a 15 minute slot in the afternoon the books are a simple database affair and players bet on whatever odds are offered i like the idea itll certainly give purpose to pvpwardecs outside of gratuitous violence 1
this does have hints of the upcoming call of duty game coming out where u can bet certain things on the outcome of 1v1 and other multiplayer team orientated engagements
this would be way better then black ops which starts all players of with the same stuff when betting bleh

i have a proposal for a way for players to create skillbooks this would add to the sandbox aspect of eve by increasing the number of items in the game which are created by playersa new skill would be added to the game this skill would be teaching im a relatively new player so maybe some more experienced members of the community could suggest appropriate prerequisites for this skillin order to create a skillbook you would have to have the skill you wish to create a book for at level v and the teaching skill the level in teaching would determine how many books for that skill you can create with v being an unlimited number andor how long it takes you to create each book the books would have material components which would be various electronics components perhaps salvage items since the books are digital and not paperso for example to create a skillbook for mechanic you would have to have mechanic v teaching skill and the appropriate materials
there are two problems with this1 who creates the teaching skill book think chicken and egg2 youre going to have a hard time preventing abuse of new players  there is nothing really stopping me from making say minmatar cruisers and then charging 5 trillion isk a copy for the book yes i know someone else will make that particular book but its an example bear with me effectively this means that no one who doesnt have that skill will ever get itim a big supporter of the player driven economy in eve but there are some things it just makes sense to have supplied by the game not by the playersnot supported
1 the teaching skillbook would have to be seeded which is no big deal considering all skill books are seeded at this point2 although that is theoretically possible all it takes is someone to undercut that person you seem to assume to use your example that youll be the only person making that book obviously that wont be the case additionally the skillbooks could still be seeded until there are enough players with the ability to make them to make the economy of those items stable
1 sort of defeats the purpose if youre going to have on thats still seeded you may as well leave the system the way it is2 the pos fuel market would like to have a conversation with you about the inherent greed of the players in this game
a lot of money is spent on just having sov forget about upgrades and all that but just to have your name on the system there should be a perk to having that other than just text in the top left of the screen by just having sov the following will happen if you are in the alliance that has said sov of the system5 to all hit points5 to top speed5 to capacitorthese are just a few of a list to get you started any other suggestions that is not op over powered to add

is it me who finds it very disconcerting that i can never really tell the size of certain items in the eve universe without having my own ingame item next to itim never sure if the small light features on ships and in space items are meant to be windows or other apparent energy based systemsi know effective scaling on a game is a partly modeling and partly texturing issue but when i look at a kilometer long battleship and the same small light detail is evident on small items the size of a house it begs the question of are the texturing artists even in touch with the modelers and do the texturing artists eve have requirement of scale they have to fulfilla little note though is i understand that creating efficient models in eve means the polygons used are never of uniform size so u have to be relatively creative to get textures to not seem odd or stretchedsomething that i believe would help is if the system lighting features on ships and space items had dynamic patters that showed theyre part of running systems and not crew quarter lights etcsummaryproposed rescaling of textures used on inspace items to more accurately reflect scale of itemshelpful quick fixapply dynamic lighting patterns to light sources on inspace items to more clearly categorize them thus helping in clearing confusion on scaling issueflame on p
ahahahahahaha oh wow thanks ccp for resolving situationok then nerf gallente  redesign it all in such way to feel gallente even better  
yep ccp were f and they liked it words of praise for their selfestimate
1st place  tornado2nd place  narukami3rd place  tsunamithe two minmatar ships do fit imo the gallente one meh maybe there were better maybe not at least those crazy op defense ships didnt make it to the final cut i like the look of the tornado dont like the stats so much though the only problem i have with it is some of the wording like calling it a tier 3 battleship smoogle  because no minmatar ships look like that naglfar maelstrom tempest that would mean that it actually fits as being another minmatar ship with top and bottom wings

i find myself also wondering wtf was ccp thinking a art contest  judged by non eve playing people i was looking in the rules and stuff they had you didnt have to need any knowledge of the game at all just had to make a ship wtfso many good designs by dedicated members of this community got overlooked because it wasnt edgy enough didnt spark the pro art guys intrests what a bunch of bullgets my votethis contest should have been judged only by ccp devs and only way to enter to be a paying eve costumer

frankly i wish ccp had never brought this up if only because im sick and tired of seeing fraking threads on it
easy  betterits borderline too easy to scan as it is
its already not that hard to tell where they overlap they are much like a venn diagram after allthis is really unnecessary
i think its just fine as is you can see where they overlap already with the different tone and you can rotate the view to get a look from any side you want so it doesnt seem like much of an issue
someone post pick of what it used to like i wanna know what ccp did to you
supportedthere should be visual indications of things like thiswhat things were before apocrypha has nothing to do with anything that system sucked and thus it got changed this system needs refinements and thus should be refined
of course this isnt the biggest issue in the world but honestly it cant be that hard to implement this and it would just make scanning look so much nicer and make it much more user friendly
they should implement one good looking ship for each race that fits the game from the contest
the idea is simple and probably has been brought up before as it stands pos are difficult to use at best this is widely regarded as a fact currently tech 3 cruisers have no means of changing subsystems at pos if an array was introduced that allowed players to dock but had limited capacity like the ship maintenance array and the corporate hangar array i feel that it would make it easier to use the pos fitting and storage mechanics and allow tech 3 cruisers to change their subsystems if some other workaround to the subsystem issue is developed there would no longer be any reason for a docking array apart from the aesthetics of dockingedited for clarification
if youre having trouble refitting a ship at a smadocking is not going to solve anythinghint its not that much different than a station hint
im not having trouble fitting a ship its mainly for the t3 subsystems that im talking about editing the op to be clearer on that point also supporting my own idea
ccp is already on this one

lawl im sure ccp get a lot of reports of players accusing the other side of having an unfair advantage investigating something like that would be time consuming and theres no reason to allocate resources on the word of some players with a clear agenda and no proofthis disqualifies you as a csm member in my opinion  ridiculing and ignoring that issue especially that you come from alliance whose member was cought and was proven to block packets that are resonsible for local chatpsdont give my the sphere crap we all know that it is was just a damage controll to acctually cover for the real abuselike this one sphere damage control
this disqualifies you as a csm member in my opinion  ridiculing and ignoring that issue especially that you come from alliance whose member was cought and was proven to block packets that are resonsible for local chati beg to differ i dont think it disqualifies really the person in question if you took care to look into the general stance and style of campaign preelection you might already have gotten an idea about what was to come and im pretty positive nowhere in her campaign was it ever stated she would refrain from ridiculing and ignoring that leaves us back with the proverb that every people get the government or csm in this case they deserve at most id say it disqualifies the voters of aforementioned person only question remaining is what it disqualifies them from perhaps from seriously discussing matters ccp wont care about anyway
id suggest some restraint considering how manylittle of eves playersaccounts in total voted it might be a good idea to not pester people at fanfest who dont want to be bothered with anything csm it might have some comedic value if say csm delegates ran around with big questionnaires in order to get player opinions on important topics survey it might as well aggravate people who didnt come to iceland for the csm might even lead to a facepunch or two under most unfortunate or most comedic circumstances do whatever you want behind closed doors aka seperate area for those interested but avoid making people feeling being swampedstalked pretty sure you well most of you do not want to build up some negative synergistic effects do you
are you kidding cataclysm is going to be awesome i am in the beta yeah it will never be asinteresting as eve can be but who doesnt like giant scarey dragons torching the world epic though im surprised anyone would want to resign from csmthe voice of the people isnt that what we all dream for oh well good luck

so as bad as it sounds i think hybrids in general need a gimmick sure you could play with the base stats of range or tracking or damage but then you run the risk of just making more of the same when you run into the other turrets instead give them something that is still of direct benefit but without homogenizing the turrets still furtherjust as an off the wall example take all the dedicated blaster ships like the brutix deimos etc take away one turret slot and upgrade the damage bonus from the hull to compensate same damage but now you use a little less cap have a little easier fitting and your ship is a little less expensive you also have a spare utility high always handy but wait this doesnt address the main problem with blasters which is putting damage on targettrue so maybe that extra utility high can be migrated to a low or a mid now that blaster ship has the spare fitting and slot for a speed mod or a web if you really want to go overboard reduce the cap usage of blasters a little more to offset the requirement of high usage on the mwd and scramwebnow youve maintained a unique close range niche for blasters but still boosted themobviously this isnt a panacea but i think this type of solution is far more promising than simply adding 10 more tracking or damage
10 more tracking and damage  is the simple possible solution all other solutions look pretty complicated without braking existing gameas for gallente ships it looks strange 1 armed with extremely short range weapon you should approach to enemy as soon as possible but ship bonuses and slot layouts tell you to use armor tank that means mass increasing speed penalties because of armor rigs2 first there are less low slots comparing amarr ships and there are active tank bonuses on some ships so it supposed to fit active armor tank if not letUFFFDs switch to 5 resists UFFFD it significantly consumes cap second mwd is highly recommended module for extremely short range weapon UFFFD it significantly consumes cap is it logical to fit cap consuming weapon on such ships 3 lasers pulse shoot farther than projectiles ac lasers have slower tracking projectiles have faster tracking ok it is logical mega pulse on abaddon  004219 800mm on maelstrom  0054 but nowUFFFD projectiles ac shoot father than blasters why blaster tracking  projectile ac tracking 800mm on maelstrom  0054 neutron cannon on hyperion  005412 it is logical shorter range  more tracking is needed
i actually agree on most of this blaster range causes a number of other problems that are only compounded by being on armor tanked hulls if you go active armor tank you have no cap stability at all between the required mwd tackle and guns trying to run any sort of realistic active tank is out of the question in many cases however running a buffer tank slows you down significantly making it even harder to put damage on targetmy point is that simply adding some random boost to tracking and damage isnt going to help blasters primary downfall yes blasters could benefit from tracking and damage but thats just a bandaid fix to help the symptoms of poor damage application rather than addressing the root cause that is caphungry slow armor tanked blaster boats this stew of various problems has all now congealed into a general hybrid failure and 10 of x variable is not really the cure the weapon systems and ships need a large overhaul
support the idea with the dmgand bumping the thread
i do agree that something is needed to address the poor performance of hybrids but i agree with herschels assessmentlook at the gun stats look at the ship bonuses if the guns match up properly but they fall out of line depending on the ships they are fitted on fix the ship bonuses and not the gunstweaking ship bonuses is a bit easier to live with than adjusting baseline guns that can be applied on a shipbyship basis but guns as you say 50 of the races favor hybrids for their weapons the potential oops of adjusting the guns is far higher than fixing the ships they are fit on and such adjustments could be rolled out over time instead of a gun adjustment to optimize how the ships use their weapons

im all for the ego trip most players are on about how good the comp is and how bad the other persons is but past that i want more people playing eve so there should always be the option to turn off shaders thats why every game has that option even a pentium 4 3 gig has problems with it and eve lucky mines much more monster than that lol people shouldnt have to buy new computers to support a game thats ment to be for everyone eve can run on a 56k connection so why not have the shader option get over the egos of not caring about the weak comp players lol and support this vote

hello csmi cant take this anymore we need to be able to probe out ships without mission runners seeing the probes  i dont care if stealth probes cost a billion each  ill buy emwhenever i see a tengu in low sec doing a mission and we probe him out and he sees the probes and warps off i then need a new keyboard for no good reasons as there is pirate drool all over the current one  i then go on to log off unsatisfied 
i second thisdrlove i use a plastic rap to cover meh keyboard for that one reason
if you need more than one cycle to get a warpable hit youre doing it wrong and deserve to fail
wait for the rage when he runs into the first unprobable t3 cruiser that just keeps running missions with him probing in local
paging angry german kid to the threadalso no
lmao great idea with the stealth probes though maybe the prequisite skills can be all the astrometric skills at 5 or something
just a thought bout the physics ur talking about in here although there are systems and ships that can cloak and still recieve information about items in the game that are on the same grid as itself probes are inherently not on the grid that whatever theyre scanning down liesplus if youve not noticed how the scanning system works its much the same as a sonic ping but epicly hyped up u cant have a cloaked thing send out a pulse of energy and still not be noticeditll be like u dressing head to toe in black with a black mask and shades etc and running round in the dark lighting up flares above ur head thinking no one saw you theyll see u cause theres a massive flare above ur headyour absolute best bet in this endeavour are probes that can warp to location cloaked but scan uncloaked and if ccp ever put out suuch a thing u can guarentee theyre gonna slap a decloak penalty onto it whether its scan time duration or a delay before a scan can occur
cloakers dont need to be made any better than they already are they honestly need a bit of a nerf due to how people use them to grief entire solar systems with impunity

i lold nice tldr there
agreed lets start handing out ships and fits for free from now ontimes have changed and mechanics should keep pace with it grief engine seems to be an acceptable term for the current system
i support this i am tired of free wardecs
it is supposed to be a healthy even mixture of pve and pvp i prefer this scenario i also like it to be fair not easier towards one side of the spectrum right now with the prices they are easier towards the agressorwell thankfully not everyone can afford to throw away 200 million a week per wardec towards a war i didnt say the mechanic fix was a perfect system but at least with this fix itll be somewhat more balanced towards both parties this will also help to prevent afk tradergank wardecs ie where the agressor is in a 2 person corp and only comes online to see ya come into jitadodixieamarr to gank ya like i said 200 million is still nothing but it amounts to something after a while
agreed i can war dec 190 corperations a corperation war should cost you a bit more then it does so a corp has to pay for it and not a personedit forgot the thumbs up thingy
not supportedhighsec already is safe enoughthere is already a 48 hour delay till a war can start this is also to be considered a cost  which is pretty high in my opinionif you want to increase the wardec fee make it optional but for the agressor to pay for that option the war should start lots fasterid pay you 100m isk if i can dec a corp instantly after 15 minutes or so for that so how about that huheditbtw a corp can only dec 3 targets at a time one could argue that after the many years eve is out there might be a change needed to that too as there are so many corps around the limit should be raised so one could dec maybe 10 targets which id like as well hehebut well as you can only dec 3 targets the other targets you cannot dec at the same time are opportunity cost so add these on your 2m decfee again plus the 48 hours delay 24h vote 24h warmup and you get a sense of the costs of a war for an agressorso again nt supported defend your corp and its assets yourself and dont ask for a gamemechanics change to do that for you
the point of view of people supporting this is not pvp needs to stop nerf pvp nao its the fact that eve is based on making decisions and its not really any kind of decision to make when it costs you 2 million to start a warwar is srs bsns it should be something that has to be weighed as an option and right now there is no gravity in that decision the waittime before going active does not count as a cost and is irrelevant in making the decision to go to warbetter yet i think it would be more fitting to have a bid system whereas the aggressor corp pays for the initial war and the target can pay the same amount to cancel it all funds go straight to concord isk sink right therepvp takes many forms not all of them are ship combat
to nithi hayajithe 24 hour period is a requirement 24s if your ceo says lets do it to give the other corp a heads up to get ready that part is the only benefit the decd corp is given if you didnt have that then people would wait in jita and start wardecing freighter pilots as they fly through thus making the concept of high sec a semisafe place pointless ya might as well turn high sec to null sec and what a giant clusterfrack that would be if you want to increase the amount of corps a corp can wardec then by all means this time around i would suggest that concord would be allowed to display all corporations other corporations are at war with by using a bribe 2 mil  depending on the price just to make things fair on both fronts i dont see how you cant bribe concord to display that information it must be cheaper than cow dung if you can ask concord to wardec another corporation for pennies in a jar bid wars are also nice but they can get wayyyy out hand i rather just make a minor change in the code than to add a new module altogetherto the highsec is safe enough thought well i never said that high sec was safe i will admit i do like the system of checks and balances placed by concord the ability to blow something up before concord blows you up is a realistic flaw in any criminal system out there although concord is sanctioned by the eula that you must dieeeeeeee if you do agress a non wt in highsec and i am okay with that all i am trying to say is that wardecs are too cheap even 50 mil would be better than 2 mil just fix the cheap rates
very nice    how much
good idea
i agree with removing local and the idea of unclaimed systems not having local seems fine however why would an alliance want to pay so that both them and their enemies could see local in reality if the alliance has to pay for local then they should be able to choose to allow local based on standings
this is a good feature although ccp would argue that a local chat feature is something that is inclusive in the gate system any ship coming in and out is logged and communication between ships is done via the gates and their inbuilt systems so naturally any system with a gate network would have a local chat channel wh systems obviously do not have gates and therefore its not applicable that this feature would be available although you could say that a system like local chat would be very inefficient to run in a practically dead systemccp could throw it out fictionally as a subsection of a concord efficiency directive stating for star systems of less than 005 security rating a monthly subscription would be required to keep a star systems local chat channel and its underlying technical operating systems up and running in order to process the subscrition for the said star system evidence of sovereignty as a signifier to pay and use local would need to be met
if this was done it would also make sense that npc controlled null sec would based off pirate standing where only those with positive standings to the controlling pirate faction could see pilots in localthat said while i support the removal of local intel in null sec i dont like the idea of giving any more advantages to sov holders that have advantage enough with expansive numbers already ccp needs to encourage players not to join the bloated napfests this idea only encourages it further
or at least make a warp tunnel that is very hard to see through
this in order to implement this it would put a very heavy burden on the system i would support this thread in 20 years when we have much much better computers now however i just dont think its worth it
well once u have the basic static points in space and a radius of each one how hard could it be to crunch some numbers to not fly through the mantle of a planetif you thought im trying to make sure u dont fly through someones 5m wide drone or probe in some random part of space while ur flying faster than light when u think about it you wouldnt even notice it its just the huge planetary bodies im talking abouttheres a case to be made in high population systems for still flying through freighters battleships etc as number crunching everything and i do mean everything in a system would melt the ccp servers or your own computer obviouslybut think about it if a british made development studio consisting of 6 people could do it on a comparable almost interchangable form of spaceflight simulation with interstellar gate travel comparable to eves in 2001 to work on a 400mhz pentium 3 with 64mbs of ram along with every other part of the game including full inertia non roll of dice dynamic space fighting in a full professional product why cant ccp do it with theyre huuuuge hardware muscle scores of development staff and us with our computers wayy in excess of the 400mhz p3 dinosaurs of the turn of the centuryand if ur gonna whine about number crunching im sure a lot of peoples mobile phones could crunch the numbers for a few planetary bodies their sizes and whether they intersect a straight line from a to b in realtime without breaking sweat
stealth caldari t2 ship buff for those of you that didnt catch it caldari t2 ships have high thermal resistancesstill my fail trolling aside i think that this is a pretty valid idea actually i remember when i was afraid to warp to the sun because i thought it would one hit my ship
it would add a new layer of depth to the game which would be extremely interesting to mehowever id rather not see the planets orbit as that seems like it might a bit calculation intensive for all of the planets moons and all the systems and im not sure how it would have much purposeother than that support
1and also gravity and atmosphere on planetsmoonsnow you can just fly to a planet and pump it which is very wrongwell what if a planets will have a gravity field for example when flying directly to a planet velocity of ship increases witn decreasi
this is interesting  kind of like localised wormhole effectsthe only possible problem i can forsee would be fleets refusing to engage enemies in locations where theyre at a disadvantage because of local conditions theres already far too much waiting around for fleet fights this could make that even worsestill supporting this because im sure it could be done well
well one such though occured to me as well thermal radiation is just a portion of the em spectrum so it makes sense that being so close to a star pulsing or not should incur slight em damage as well as thermal although i think thermal should be the main player therethe other shining light to balancing the caldari perspective soz for the pun is that caldari sensors are gravametric and warping to the largest mass in the system should play havok with grav sensors more than most so in a sense u can hide bt cant fightof course the right fitting on a ship could work bt it would weaken certain areas eg putting additional sensor booster or secondary sensor clusters on caldari ships may remove the annoyance of constant natural ecm in the stars vicinity but will use slots that would typically be used for defenceecmwebdisruptorsim not saying caldari ships should be the only ones affected by a naturally occuring ecm field i just think the ecm strengths should be tailored to be grav heavyand i do understand the problems with fleet fighting and getting engagements happening can be a problem but after all its an fcs job to be intelligent enough to see an oppertunity when its presented to him whether its natural phenomena or covert inteladding complexities allows situations to present themselves where intelegent fcing can gain an upper hand against brute force fcingtbh i ideally want the players of eve to once again realise that space is deadly in itself and that adding pulse lazers autocannons missiles and railguns to it are seen merely as multiplyers of the death and carnage thats already evident d
i like the idea when i first started playing eve i was kinda disappointed that i could fly right next to a sun with no ill effects there could be so much done with natural phenomena in space and not all of it has to be badcertain gas nebulae should have a masking ability due to disrupting of sensors yours and your enemieslarger bodies such as moons or even big asteroids could be used to slingshot a ship thus temporarily increasing nonwarp speeds even without an afterburnerthere should be places to hide in space especially where there is a lot of mass ie inside a thick asteroid belt or tucked in close to andor behind a moon planet or sun especially if you have all systems turned off so that you dont have any type of signature of course if youre close to a large body you then run the risk of decaying orbit and falling into the body due to the gravity fieldand on the bad sidethose same asteroid belts that you can hide in should also be difficult if not deadly to navigate through with the possibility of collisions that could cause damage or even destroy your shipas with the hiding next to a large body if you are working on your pi and sitting stationary you should run the risk of getting pulled into the gravity field and atmosphereduring pi the size of the planet you are working should have an effect on launching your goods into space  the larger the planet the harder to attain orbitstar types would have varying effects on ships too  quasars pulsars red giants  all would have different effects on certain ship systemsim sure there are a plethora of other effects that could be found while roaming the expanses of space both good and bad having some of these in eve would definitely add to the flavor and immersion of the game if done right1 supported
please no thats a bit much i would like to be able to run eve on a reasonable aged computergive it about 10 years and then i would support the notion of gravity and atmospheres on planets and moons otherwise youre looking into making this game like crysis where its made for a computer that hasnt been made yet
i doubt eve will ever have collision damage tho i like the idea that small grav fields would affect ship speedi think its safe to say that there shouldnt be any augmentation of direction due to grav effects though im pretty certain that a starships computer systems would use lateral thrusters to compensate but increased speedreduction of speed to and from objects with large mass seems logicaltell u what would be awesome if u had an extremely small sig radius and hid in a dense asteroid belt should mask u would be good to try and impliment some level of physical searching by eye of some places tho that particular idea was inspired by some dialogue in the film serenityi do believe that some of that does occur in wh space been through pulsar systems that have a small shield hit when u jump into it tho i do believe its no where near what should happen the level of energy a pulsar releases on average would incinerate an entire planet like earth in close proximity obviously with a lesser effect further away from it plus gamma radiation streams from 2 poles of some stellar phenomena black holes etc would incinerate anything in its path but would be obvious to see easy to manouver around but should instapop sum1s titan if they were feeling inherrently godlike and dumb
which is a myth perpetuated by hardware benchmarking sites you can run crysis just fine if you have a 2 year old mid range graphics card just not with aaas much as id like to see realistic orbital mechanics implemented its just too big of a change not only the actual implementationsimulation but game mechanics with proper orbital mechanics youd have a hard time even getting the orbit of two fleets to cross let alone achieve a constant relative distance so they could fight the concept of ship speed would also be greatly overhauled as ships would need a minimum velocity for a planet like earth its roughly 11kms otherwise theyd enter a decaying orbit without external forces applied a ship would also drift indefinitely there wouldnt be a maximum speed alright only when you start approaching relativistic speeds the turn radius of frigates coupled with their speed would create gforces strong enough to make pulp of any crew and the ship itself etc etc
i know the thought of a more physical stellar environment can get pretty damn deep i wasnt thinking of going so far as to have realistic orbits though i know showing info on planets in eve shows properties pertaining to such things thinking more rationally eve obviously doesnt have orbital bodies as bookmarks inside poss would fail 9999 of the timeim taking the idea of orbits right out of the proposal although im not sure i formally put it in either way there are other real world physical effects that can be replicated with ease in eve without any kind of major overhaul in base code and complexityi would love the idea of ccp getting creative with natural ecm effects on ships and the interplay of other cosmic signatures on sensors both in a hostile environment and also in ways to provide more covert gameplayone would be 360 degree scans via dscan picking up object behind massive planets and moons etc this is a simple line of sightintersection of lines and objects check if a large body is between 2 objects when one is performing a dscan i dont see why it should show up signature shaddowing makes sense especially the way ccp has implemented the scanning in eve onlinetbh this is shaping up to be not just a single idea but a group of ideas oin the same subject so if any1 wants to carry on brainstorming then at some point well all pull it into a big list and see whats the most popular of them all and have a go at trying to get ccp to implement say the top 5 or top 10

i wonder if i can support my own proposalthanks for all the support so far i will clarify something so that my stance is clear as there seems to be some confusion about exactly what i intend with this proposalthis proposal isnt meant to remove someones ability to troll entirely  it is designed to reduce the amount of trolling done by individuals the person above who mentions having 6 accounts is a good example of the problem at the moment this person can post with 18 characters in a single thread  and probably does  which is just insane something needs to be done about this my idea is simple elegant and has can have no possible opposition apart from that of people who wish to protect their multiple character inthread trollingplease ccp save our forums
this is a repression of free speech people who dont like the arguments of others always revert to censorship not supported
nothing wrong with arguing it is to lessen the ammount of people who use alts to pretend to be someone else
it wont change things a lot but thats an easy change that will improves things a bit
im afraid that you are completely incorrect this proposal would in no way limit someones ability to freely express themselves if someone has a stance on an issue they should not have an issue with expressing it universallywhy would anybody post a contradictory argument to themselves or even the same argument with multiple characters in a thread unless it was for trolling or subversive purposesthere is no good reason not to support this proposal
you are proposing great limits on peoples ability to express themselves thats the very nature of your proposal you surely accept for instance that one legitimate and effective way to undermine an argument is to subvert it derail it or otherwise reduce to nonsense the seriousness of that arguments supporters if that is a chosen tactic of some then i see no reason to impose a law preventing it
anonymity due to the same reason why we all have an avatar and a made up in game name to post on the forums
only afterwards ud still have an avatar and an alias to post on the forums
they would still be perfectly able to express themselves if they need to use accounts full of sockpuppets to undermine an argument they should not be participatingi cannot conceive of a reasonable situation where you would need to post anonymously in a thread with a character from an account which has a character youve already posted withremember this proposal is not about denying anyone anonymity or the ability to troll or alt post  it is about improving the quality of posting while reducing the quantity of posting
knee jerk muchchrist it was an observation you tard
i was going to ignore your post but decided to address it in case you misunderstood my intentions i apologize for my selfish and oafish behavior
you missed what i did thereanyway getting rid of alts post will not improve the quality as an example i post with my main and it obviously has not improved your quality one bit nor would you ever expect it toso to get what you want you will have to get the forum nzais  you get who i am reffereing to involved and as much as most folk enjoy gustopo style enforcement of conformitywell you get the idea
its funny how threads like this seem to attract the trolls out who want to keep their anonymity just so they can further screw with people since the majority doesnt really agree with them
oh its this proposal again there is low correlation between quality of posts and if poster is main or alt rendering your proposal pointless what ah needs are better tools for ratingorganizingfiltering proposals this will enable ah to easily deal with both bad and good posts appropriatelypersonally i post with this alt actually another main because im mainly active in ah and dont want the proposals to be stigmatized just because im in alliance whatever not because i do posts
1 good posts dont need alts bad posts do to project a better appearance2 the mere fact that u acknowledge its a stigma because of your proposal and on whose behalf ure pushing it through for means that it is good to force ppl to post with their main cause then wed all know ure only trying to nerf others and buff yourselvesjust like what ure doing now
so letting the alts post does somehow improve the quality i guess this notion is why many others do just that huh the only person crying facist is u no one once said u cant post at all besides the other ones against this that r making  up from outta nowhereu just cant do it over several chars because u know your posts r so bad u need imaginary friends to support u is any of this getting through to u
now now no need to get your panties in a twistthe author of this thread stated he wanted to improve the quality i simply stated what needed to be done to achieve thatnow say your sorry
whos getting their panties in a twist obviously the one crying facist but thx for trying yes i knowyour sorry
oh right i see what you did thereyou sir are a master of  posting
actually your right to free speech stopped at the login button its a private computer system  ccp can and do censor what gets posted here at will and on a regular basisthat said what does your inability to post from two characters in the same thread have to do with your ability to say what you like you can still use all of the letters on your keyboard regardless of which avatar you happen to attach to the post rightright
took u that long to think of and respond with that much huh figures actually i had a valid argument which u conveniently ignored and just continued to mudsling and blow out of proportionover a forum change we all know u dont want this because the  posting ure demonstrating would look even more pathetic if u werent doing it with your imaginary friends to appear that ure not alone and we all know what type of post ure gonna go with next so in advance btw u do realize that in your effort to not use alts to try and debate this proposal ure now gonna using your main in razor of course u didnt but way to represent your alliance with your  posting it didnt stop u from doing so but we all know who its really from which is this proposal is really about see what u did there if not plz continue making your alliance look stupidid really love to see it
it baically insults their ehonor the op and his henchmen when confronted by a faceless alt that can not be linked to the actual main character they would never really confront in game anyway
a lot of people are not understanding exactly what my intentions are with this proposali will simplify it as much as i possibly cana i have one account and three characters there is a thread i would like to post in with the intention of offering my opinionusing my main character i post my opinion in this thread and engage in a discussion making several posts and repliesthere is a thread i would like to post in with the intention of trolling using my trolling alt i post my troll in this thread and engage in trolling making several troll posts and offtopic repliesb i have three accounts and 9 charactersi am only put at a disadvantage by this proposal if my characters are posting in the same threadits a tactic or practice used too excessively these days these forums need this proposal to be enacted to reduce the quantity of selfserving and pointless troll posting and increase the quality of posting made by necessitysupport this proposal
you do not correctly understand the proposal you also failed to observe the sarcasm i responded to you with previouslyi do not have any issue at all with being confronted by faceless altsi have a qualm with being confronted by several alts puppeted by the same individual all with contradictory stances and opinions it will always be present in eve and accept that but with my proposal it would by its nature reduce the amount of posting of that nature by 67the trolls still get to troll the posters still get to post the only people disadvantaged by this are the people who need to have their errant behavior curtailed its gone on long enoughsupport this proposal
i support
so currently there is a mechanic which alllows targets to be assigned a number 09 or a letter az which will appear in a column you can place on your overviewthe tactical uses of something like that are pretty helpful if you sit and think about it for a bitthe problem with its current iteration is its slow and clunky to interface with heavy right click menus with double drop down menus completely negate any chance to use something like this in large scale combatbutif we were to change this to a keybound inteface it would allow for tactical target calling on a more dynamic level and do away with another of the rough right click menus that are poopsocking an otherwise useful feature
1and maybe more digits than 09 too 099
heres your chance to prove that you did answer them thats a post i put up earlier this thread if you can answer that without resorting to you are a liar you just want easy mode stop trolling then i will be seriously impressed
i realize this might not be as exciting as fixing certain ships but here we gorecently there sees to have been a rash of hijacked accounts in eve and ccps always been fairly paranoid about security and with good reason given the real world investments both in terms of time and money accounts have actual meaning what i propose then is something similar to paypals security key in essence a physical devicesystem that provides single use codes to you to help make accounts more secure thanks for your time
no forum is safe94 lelouche dallas multipass021110never forget
id support this but im loving all the tears
im loving all the tears and i still support this
supporting my own threadalso hilarious things happening in caod for once
make the rules before you enforce them
brilliant just brilliant
i noticed it was it spaceis that significant
not entirely accurate not one sov structure was placed in it space only unclaimed space was affectednow it was next to it space
opposed need more pubbies going testy for hilarity
i might support this topic if i new what you where talking about
good proposal the scanning interface as it stands right now is an eyestrain nightmarealongside arrows that are viewable from all directions colors that dont fade into the background from various angles and shadows that dont blot out all the probe graphics if viewed from the wrong angle and getting rid of the huge pile of mist or fog or something that covers the whole background of the probe display
this would be cool for dust give pod pilots something to do
maybe a betting system for at
in my particular case it would be quite lucrative to also bet against a player in a pve enviorment maybe recoup for all my lost ships 
i am a lover of the high speed frigs that eve has to offer the feeling of manual flying at top speed is so close to a flight sim that it keeps me in the eve universe for days at a time the only draw back i find with them is that when it comes to firepower out of the 5km range they dont seem to be able to kill anything above a players destroyer when it has a decent tank on it and most players above destroyers have wild tanks there main strengths seem to be electronic support stopping players from warping pack hunts and low level missions what i would like is a tech 3 frig that would have the ability to be able to kill cruisers besides the stealth bomber at a competitive range and being able to do it solo it would bring a new level of fear to players in bcs instead of thinking of frigs as annoying and just there to scramble and fearsome in packs or maybe have one as a capital ship that does just mean size and that it would mean a lot to loose one and take tons of time to reach it and a solo frigintercept wouldnt be everywhere so it wouldnt out weight the eve factor in a pirate way the loki is closer to the solo fighter with high risk of loss but it just doesnt feel the same as a frig and it would give us frig junkies something to aim for outside of the basic lock and hit style lvl 2 missions and fleet combat please support this vote as a yes or maybe have an idea posted for something similar or fully argue against it
frigs arent designed to go toe to toe with ships of such higher order of magnitudes in size its like saying i want a new breed of chihuahua dog that can take down a lion its not reasonable not feasable and not within the realms of a mmorpg space and social simulator i think youd find that the only way a typically fitted sb would take down a cruiser solo would be in null sec or with an exceptional sb pilot and an extremely dumb cruiser carebare with nervs shot to hell and backif youre hunting in a pack thats another story but im sure there are frigs that have all the bonuses required to take down something larger you just have to prioritise certain tasks to certain types of frigs and fit them appropriately as well as not fly them like armor buffered bssthe amount of points tracking disruptors webbers ecms neuts and vamps that u can get in a frig gang for a relatively little amount of isk is amazing when u really crunch the numbersi just wouldnt go after any caldari passive tank if i were you
i agree that there great for fleets but im not trying to say that they should be mega strong or anything else similar im not looking for a dread frig just something better even with full skills and factionspecialist ammo its dps is weak at any type of range outside of a scram range most players i know love frigs but have to ditch them for more firepower i dont think the defense or range on em should change one bit its just in the eve food chain you have frigs then destroyers and every other ship on eve above it even good drones a stronger i believe it should be able to compete with something other than the lowest 2 ship levels sololy
may be interesting to have a frig with bonuses to remote repping and bonuses to remote repair drones a few of them piloted by some really good pilots would keep frigs alive against scout drones a frig pilots worst nightmare and have the maneuverability and speed to not be affected too much by being alphad especially if theyre flown in groups of more than 2 so they can rep each other if they get heavily alphadcould be enhanced by a lower class frig version of an interdictor slowing down backup from surrounding stargates
i completely agree it would add a nice complexity to eve as well and in designing something new having some tweaks could make it a tech 3 version and is a highly interest topic that wouldnt be just about different fits for different types of tanks an intercept shouldnt be a weaker drone lol
perhaps check this similar proposalshameless selfpromotion for idea feedback not votes
youd only have to seed the teaching skill for so long maybe a month or so until people start to make it on their own after that they wouldnt need to be seeded any morepos fuel is much harder to make and mine most items that can easily be made by players are cheap enough the upper limit of how much player made skill books cost would be determined by the materials and time needed to make them
and the number of people willing to train teaching to 5 just to make more teaching skill books as well as the number of people willing to train esoteric skills like tactical shield management to level 5 to be able to produce the books for that skill so that i as a new player for example can train it to level 1i mean lets face it how many active people in the game have gallente titan to level 5 so they can create more copies of the skill book a handful do you really believe they wont gouge the hell out of the market if there are only five or six people making itif so you should consider the possibility that you are not cynical enough to play this game
also bear in mind u can get skillbooks for free by doing missions for certain npc corps and going to the lp store so if the principle idea behind this was to not have to pay the high isk pricetag on some skillbooks by making them or getting a friend to make it this idea is sort of redundant
also books are isk sinks that dont need removing
why is the spaceship command skillbook even seeded when afaik you cant create a character which doesnt already have the skill trained to at least lvl 1
lol i never noticed that before but it is a good question
nah its just the team that worked on all that stuff think they are too cool for schoolafterall they did an sql query that showed only 1 of players have over 300 contactsso it was ok to kick them in the balls they forgot that 1 are the hub people the content creatorsso funny watching them try to push a social network website while breaking the very network of contacts people had already created

yeah the whole zooming in thing doesnt even work anyway lol ive tried it multiple times my map always opens up on the east side of the galaxy no matter where my ship currently is this is really annoying and doesnt seem like it should be that hard to fix i have to zoom out in order to find myself and then zoom back in

propose moderation be brought up at the next meetingthis topic is in the right thread after all we are discussing an organisation also could any gm please elaborate on what is considered legal and illegal during downtime
true but they just make up rules depending on what favors it
i hear molle likes brown saucenew rule no ketchup at the bbqs
moved from corporation alliance and organization discussion
i too would like to see a complete explanation on just how long before an extended downtime structures should be onlined
also it would be nice to inform us about these rules before removing our tcus i mean why waste all the time if it was known that it was illegal problem is this rule didnt exists before this downtime
yes if ccp is going to decide that a certain amount of time must be spent onlining outside of downtime they should give us a firm number to go by rather than making arbitrary decisionswhat percentage of a structures onlining timer must be spent outside of downtime
all ccp policy changes are announced via ingame decisions favoring it im not sure what youre confused about
instead of giving a opinion of how it not should go figur a opinion how it does should chnage
cosmetic onlyim not really into it so no was my first reaction but with incarna they are aiming for it and wont be dissuadedwhere i have a problem is this plex for remaps isk for remaps  i have no problems with that but plex that i have an issue withif you look at the char count of 360000 they arent having financial woes when that exceeded their dreams of more subscriptions than iceland has population this is flat out more money on their part such isnt necessarily a bad thing but id prefer to see them get the money by getting more players in the game than by trying to bleed more funds out of the current subscription basei dont like the first step towards a store being game mechanics bypassing thats bad wait until they have the pretty hair cuts or outfits etc then use cosmetics but right now eve has no cosmetics to sell and only 1 item that is bought  plex so they should wait until they can get some pretty items to sell vs this bogus stuntps if you really want to stop this there is a way but its not easy and i doubt it can be pulled off you get multiple account owners to let all but 1 account lapsecancel them while signing that they are doing so in protest 10k30k accounts take a powder for even 1 month would get the message across in a fashion that gets the bean counters attention and posting that its being done in protest they dont quit just drop back the number of accounts they are using yeah this would get ccps attention a hell of a lot more than these threads will such threads are just muttering and whining the above would be pocket book style attention grabbing and thats where they are looking  their pocketbook
yesits going to happen regardless of what you say though thats just business as usual ccp can do whatever they want to their product they own it you dont the only statement you will be able to make would be to unsubscribe en masse when you do please contract your stuff  isk to me for safe keepingzug
no leave them for dust
no
nohell no
no
yes please
this the nano nerf the removal of 90 webs and dont forget about the speed nerf any one of these nerfs would have made blasters difficult but not imposible to use effectivly all together they make blaster boats impractical except for camping undocks blasters and blaster boats need a total overhaul
i think it would be interesting to see hull tanking be made viable on gallente ships make it roughly equal to armor tanking but without the speed drawbacks
wouldnt it be more logical to reduce size of battleships ship with 500000 m3 volume shouldnt really be longer than 320500 meters
yeah okay
bimonthly bump to keep this thread alive
i support it its a sound proposal but the repair should take alot of time outside triage mode for carriers somewhere around 10 minutes and 5 for motherships itll get pretty annoying if it only had a 1 minute timer and 2 minute cooldown and i am not saying this cause my main can fly carriers soon 
eve did lose a lot of key players when they were forced into the previously optional premium graphics package
not supported id rather the devs fix actual game issues or add new features than waste time supporting archaic machines especially when the overwhelming amount of users have put minimal effort in the last decade to upgrade beyond those specs
because as explained above and in the original announcement that support isnt free you cant just leave it in it costs nontrivial development resources to maintainsince at the moment were yelling loudly at ccp for not putting enough dev resources in to eve it would be just a teeny bit inconsistent to ask them to spend those scarce resources on supporting a few people who wont upgrade to a technology standard that is only a few months younger than eve itselfsm3 cards came out in 2004 you can buy one for the price of a couple of large pizzas as ed from hr correctly pointed out youve had 7 years to get on this and youve still got time left to do itexpecting people who play video games to have graphics hardware that supports a seven year old standard is not unreasonable
it was so much nicer in here when you werent postingalso proof of that or htfu the switch away from the classic graphics to the trinity engine caused headaches for at most macroers running 10 yo systems for a low budget or people that ran secondary clients on their old boxes while their main was on a newer boxstatistically eve players come from countries where dsl is probably the slowest form of connection that people use dedication to an eve subscription also indicates that the person would have to have a decent form of income generation are people playing eve over a 56k connection probably notand if they are they probably dont undockasking ccp to keep the engine running with both shader 20 and 30 support is like asking me to keep coding in php3 when i already know the standards for php5 stop whining about it and upgrade your outdated hardware or play a game meant for what youve got like minesweeper
supported a 3 yearold 35 by the time shader 30 is required laptop should be able to run eve on low settingsat the very leasthave a console command to force the disabling of shader 30 maybe i wont see the bumpmaps on incarna or the other new effects will have inverted colors but so what
yes the omen sucks itd be nice to see it fixed
confirming that the omen is terrible and that atm you can get kind of an okay fit with fmp and that it fits really well with qlb but those suck anywayplease fix the omen at the moment there are zero good cheap laser cruisers and that sucks since lasers are awesome
the omen is in desperate need of some extra pg supported
another proposal thread popped up for this issue here
adding support
well props to aiden here i constantly use this tactic mostly for its pure wtf factor carebears will always be present they will always want easy ways to do things others actually work to find a way to counter of course they just want aggro rights obviously the original tear fountain comes from someone that fell victim to this tactic now really dont you think ccp knows about it its working as intended it is not unfair if you want the same thing train an orca alt get in a shuttle when i start shooting you and fly the hell away its not that hardcomplaining about it because you dont wanna find a reasonable way to counter it is what 90 of eve will do and for the csm rep that gloated about it really because you obviously have the sway to get it fixed right nao amiritewe general rulebound griefers enjoy it when someone stands up and points fingers at us we found a mechanic we can make use of you  about it we lol life goes on
im nearing my own legion myself and support this fully
 this
blizzard can help you with these problems
as someone who spent their first 6 months of eve in wormhole space let me say thisprobing is easy as fsck already htfuseriously are pirates this lazy these days holy crap
you fail at scanning and the csm will not help you
i support topicstarters ideait doesnt really matter for me how new players enjoy or dont enjoy to start eve and what they want smart strategy and tactic game or counterstrike with space ships if ccp removes learning skills safes my skill training speed and returns sp to me i would be happy to invest those sps into new skills i want right now i havent anything against learning skills and i spent time after calculation never was angry or pity about this lost time because it is element of strategy like any other skill does anybody like to spend 10 days to get 2 bonus to something i dont but if ccp makes us gift some amount of free sp i agree with it because i like gifts
hello there person with no life outside of eve this is supposed to be a game dont take it seriously and whats with if people cant handle it eve is not for them cmon man this is a game not some private thing only pros should play its like i suffered  you should suffer too man your selfish whats with the nobody forces you to train learning skills 55 why in the world would a person invest 15month on a character that is sub par its more of a soft powernot  related politics thing the right choice is so obvioius its not even a choice to begin withthis is for improving the game widening its fanbasesupporters and giving ccp a fatter wallet so you can play the game you want with quality updates last thing how the hell did this become a microtransaction we dont pay money to take away learning skills my god your so passionate about plex for remaps you see it everywhere i support this because the learning curve is really steep as it is and i dont want to add more to that burden by forcing new people to wait it out to actually play the game personally eve is lightyears away from  as a game but  is more welcoming to the new players because the game actually allows then to do something in the game the first few days the time where new people are all hyped up and excited dont want to mention names and im not recruiting for 
yes but why stop theremaybe incorporate sec status into the dec cost higher sec status more it is to be war deccedwar decing shouldnt be free or any cheaper  this is at the yarrtard and morons saying this is a pvp gamejust fact this is a sandbox highsec a faucet i would like to see some number on income but scaled to populationim sure highsec makes more but then again 80 of players are strictly highseci hope they increase the price because again they need new isk sinks and wardeccing is a prime way to do this 200mil is nothing to a lot of players let alone an alliance
the mechanic isnt perfect agreedbut id much rather see people running around in rifters with their underwear on their head drooling like puppies after a tasty treat wardecing each other left and right than people not decing like crazy due to cost constraints
i see comments here about eve needing to be a balance between pvp and pve however in my view the game is heavily skewed towards pve already and getting worse not better even null sec is mostly pvp optional to pveers due to local mechanics etc unless you count market pvp and scams pve is the major or only real source of isk for most players i suppose ninja salvaginglooting could be considered a pvp source of isk but then most people wanting to make wardecs harder also want to nerf the salvagerslooters as wellat a minimum i think the p alliance wardec nerf should be reversedbut ideally i would like to see pvp and game lore put before pve for once in eve have players and player corps tied to the in game empires and factions and then have war automatically between players of rival empiresfactions
supported for less frivolous wardecks by small corps and a very much needed isk sink for the game with an unhealthy infinite isk inflation
from a lore standpoint capsuleers are the lucky few who have paid the price for what essentially equates to immortality and are considered neutral agents as for having players and corps tied in with empire factions and warring we already have that its called faction warfare perhaps you should check it outif i wanted to have a strong identity based upon my race id go play wow a large chunk of eves appeal is the sandbox nature of interaction between players if you want to yell about how amarr are horrible racist slavers go join your militia and get on with it but theres a segment of the playerbase who couldnt care less what happens in empire aside from if it means a different system is a primary trade hub but probably hate a group of other players that they may live next door toto me eve is balanced between pvp and pve i go shoot rats to make isk to pay for spaceships i can afford to lose while shooting at the guys next door who are real players and probably hate me just as much while id love to have billions of isk to throw around it wouldnt really mean much other than that i have to spend less time doing pve things pvp in eve is a lot like real combat happens from my understanding of real combatwar sixty minutes of waiting for sixty seconds or less of action and before that sixty minutes of waiting for an enemy to shoot at there was the five hours i spent ratting up the money to buy those modulesshipsskillbooks involved in the eventual shootingim supporting this on the fact that its a decent isk sink to increase wardec prices its doubtful that serious wardec corpsalliances will feel any real pain from it the best solution would be to scale prices based on the size of the corpalliance declaring war and the corpalliance that is getting decd your two man corp wants to attack a 5000 man alliance youre going to have to pay for it
wars themselves would do a much better job of that than fees used to prevent small or poor corps from declaring war
if capsuleers were considered neutral agents we wouldnt have any standings to empires and factions in eve we do have standings therefore capsuleers are not neutral they pick their sides based upon their actions whats missing from eve is real consequences for those actions and resulting standingsyes im familiar with faction war is eve and to me its rather lame despite being a gamer that played in a number of sandbox mmos as an rppvp type player exactly the sort of gamer fw was meant to attract i have zero interest in participating in its current formpve free from pvp to then go pvp with the gains made in pve thats pretty much the exact formula for thempark mmos dynamics between pvp and pve this is what you want and your talking to me about sandbox mmorpgs everyones entitled to an opinion but the justification for those opinions here for a wardec nerf are quite frankly pretty weak or nonsensical it would be much stronger if you were just straight up and say you want a game where you pve free from pvp and leave it at that
four people can run level ivs in drakes for a few hours and easily get 100 million probably faster if they use cnrsgolemsnightmares correctly fitted if a corp cant afford a 100 million towards a wardec i doubt they need to be in a warotherwise the miner corps will just stomp all over them in bigger shipsunless they are idiotsmost corporations i have been at war with fly tech 2 expendable ships i mean if pvp high sec wardecs are a way to help create isk sinkskeep markets going an increase in wardec costs is not going to be that much of a dent in their wallet they are probably just going to spend wiser on who they wardec not just wardec people because a corp has a stupid name or they were looking at them funny i really do believe that the amount of deaths in high sec are not going to change due to the increase in cost but i do believe pointless wardecs will be avoidedlike i said before wardec prices are not relative to their cost from then to now there needs to be a market adjustment fix
not supported  mechanic isnt perfect but is far from brokenwe spend 275 billion a week every week we run 10 wars being in a corpalliance is a privilege  not a given  if you dont like wars  stay in npc corps or get better wingmates
read the thread and this is basically the tldrpenalize a corp  alliance that pvps in a pvp game because the defending corp is not motivated enough to defend nor aware they are playing a peeveepee gamei think this pretty much sums what they are asking for
supported for the destruction of those god damned rr domis
that can be easily twisted to dont be in so many wars at once and you have the option of wardecing or not and raise your taxes
 this
not really  im not the one in the sand box crying cuz im getting sand kicked in my face wardecs had been nerfed years ago  look up the pnerfnext youll be asking for ccp to have a dev hold your hand while you play the game
pnerfvery cheap considering the fact that an alliance is made up of a series of corporations and those corporations are responsible for those funds if you have 10 corporations in an alliance and are at war with 10 other corpsalliances then its 50 mil per group a week plus whatever the cost is for continuing the wardec if you have 3 corporations in your alliance and are having this issue try consolidating the alliance into a corporation nine times out of ten its an alliance wardecing a smaller alliance or corporation when you consider the grief engine mechanic no sand is being kicked in my face this is more targeted towards corporation on corporation wardecs besides i also noted that it can be an additional 2550 mil per wardec addition not another 200 mil to be honest though you should really not be in that many wars if its costing you that much isk or at least make them mutual i am not against a corporations ideal if they want to shower themselves in wardecs with as many corps as they want just against the cheapness of it allbut if a dev wants to give me a dutch rudder while i play the game i really cant complain 
technically you do warp around objects just in a polymathatical ndimensional way
what exactly how would it be a heavy burden and on what system this doesnt need to be a serverside effect at all just have the client pick some random arc that doesnt intersect with any planetary bodiesi never understood why missiles have to fly in a straight line as well they could arc on your screen in whatever way regardless of where they really are according to the serveredit for support
alright so i love the idea completely but that one guys right about creating lag so if they add it as a feature you can take off if you want for performance reason it would definately be ing awesomesupported anyway for great idea
no burden needs to be put on the server whatsoever since there is no way to interrupt warp anyway and warp only get a player from a to b server does not need to know that player is going around a planet on the server the ship will go in a straight line and the client will display it going around as long as ship arrives to point b at the same time as it does on the server there should be no problem and no extra load
it wouldnt really matter people who really wanted to troll would just log to another account god knows half the people i know ingame have 3 or more
supported this is my alt you can post with an alt but not in the same thread it makes perfect senseedit  you know what theyre right people are just gona use a different account anyway i guess just live with it
the point of this proposal still remainsplacing restrictions on alt posting its not gonna eliminate it completely but 1 alt per extra account is much better than 2 alts in the main account plus 3 per extra account so if the trolls wanted to restore the number of alts they couldve previously used theyd have to pay triple the total subscription for it hell u can even tie it to the credit card number that everyone has to submit upon creating an account and if the occasional troll for some reason still feels the need to troll a forum badly enough to pay that much then its their money which goes to ccp as an incentive for other improvements
exactly why this game isnt even half as popular as people on these forums make it out to be
noisk for remaps i can see but plex no there is a difference between them though you obviously are too blind to see itthis is flat out buying a way around game mechanics with cash your cash or someone elses with isk more could be done with respect to how it operates  rep at stations etc could effect the prices but with plex thats cash  carryas for the effect of remaps i sure as hell know more about this than you do i misunderstood what 2 free remaps meant at the start so had to remove a remap across my first year of play i saw over 2 million sp come out of my first years training plan so this isnt trivial this is buying sp with cash just the same as the logic of buying isk with cash via plex comes into playso isk for remaps id support that how someone got the isk is their business but plex that i dont support try interacting in the game vs just tossing  at it to advance faster and buying gtc to immediately swap for remaps isnt interacting with anyone beyond ccp
i support this as this will bring up plex prices and therefore get me more money when i put real  into a game
drowning in a sea of terrible ideas
great idea i have made previous suggestions as to using hotkeys for target tags not only for being able to set a tag on a target but being able to target the tagged target as well example target caller assigns tags like 1 to the primary 2 to the secondary 3 to the tertiary e to the ewar primaryf to the ewar secondaryremote rep boats could assign r to the repair target s to the shield rep cargett to the cap transfer targethotkeys allowing the targeting of a given tag could allow the fleet to coordinate targeting more effectively with less overview issues
of course either you simply lack all comprehension or your claim that i should prove that ive already answered what ive obviously answered is a trollwith you its hard to tellanyways ill do a quick rundown just to point out that all your nonsense has already been dealt with already pointed out that you simply have no idea how the game works how largescale alliances deploy to forward operation zones and your whole whine about zomg nine whole jumps is just whining jump bridges played absolutely no substantial role in allowing pretty much every single large scale invasion in eve and obviously as successful invasions have gone on your whines about how stagnant they make eve are nonsense tooalready dealt with as this is just more of your nine jumps make me impotent at eve nine jumps coupled with your whining about how its almost impossible to incap pos mods reinforce poss destroy those poss and take sov coupled with your whine about how alliances could just station titans at poss and set up jump portal chains anywayto say nothing of the fact that theres no actual way to deal with this as any alliance with a pair of brain cells to rub together will just give a few systems in their constellations to other blue alliances to set up their own jb networks what you dont know about logic could fill a book im not even sure what sort of response you think this deserves id ask which specific logic fallacy youre claiming this is but come on we both know youre just babbling again you wouldnt know logic if it bit you on the face not that your assurances arent worth the electrons theyre written with though theyre not also you are again trying to pretend that you are the emperor of fun and you get to define for other people what they find fun your absurd game that youre really using other peoples definitions and they just dont know when theyre having fun but you can tell them is simply more of your trolling aka nine jumpsjust more ignorance of basic facts of eve as if regions like delve fountain tenal etc havent been seen as valuable even before the advent of jbs despite their distance from empire and as if there isnt already value to being close to empire also coupled with your zomg who could ever reinforce a pos no rebuttal necessary an admission of your own that you cant even support your own point but you like it so youre going to advocate it yet more mommy ccp give me easy mode nonsense there is no reason that the average individual should be able to significantly influence the dynamics of interactions between tens of thousands of people as noted that bit of trolling doesnt fly when you know full well that youre trolling pointing out as some sort of victory ahead of time that someone will probably point out youre trolling is hardly a logical point its like vomiting on someone and then complaining that why theyre about to claim that you puked on them
so your argument is that this is incorrectand you have provided no further justification other than i dont know how this game works well isnt it funny that a ccp dev has said the above and that this
supportedjump bridges make managing vast tracts of space far too easy and cost is not an issue when you have a monstrous number of players farming those vast tracts of space for resources and isk they also give a ridiculous advantage to defenders in sov warfare as it makes divide and conquer moot when the defenders fleet can literally be everywhere at oncei dont have a problem with jbs in theory my problem arises when the mechanic is abused by entities such as the nc to make moving freighters full of poses supplies whatever completely risk free they bring it in through a high sec entrance that they have camped and then its a hassle free 5 or 6 jump trip to cross multiple regions theres something wrong with that picture the idea behind freighters is that they can move huge amounts of stuff but they are vulnerable to attack without an escort jump bridges make logistic chains invulnerable nothing in eve should be risk free least of all managing sov and alliances
gee what are the odds shown that youre lying and trolling again youve decided to try to change the subject again greyscale was talking about jump drives or titan bridgingblack ops bridging not jump bridges he at least understand the very basic facts about deploying and how alliances actually do it you still think that jump bridges are the key and that nine jumps will ruin your entire eve game greyscale did go on to state that probably in his view jbs contribute to big wars but of course he never went on to describe how and as already pointed out via your impotent whining entire coalitions can deploy in force to assault their enemies without any reliance on jbs at all nor is pointing to a rather poorly thought out musing of one dev somehow proof of anything and is in fact fallacious you might as well point to zulus carrier proposal as proof of something the idea that groups wont assault other groups if they have to move a few more jumps to get to a staging area is powerfully ignorant the idea that ccp should somehow try to break up peoples natural tendency to work together in an mmo of all places for shame and to force them to have small wars is also an idea that is jabberwockian in its absurdity but if all youve got is the appeal to authority fallacy and yah thats all youve got i guess that youll clutch at any straws that come to you just like the best way to break up blobs was to create a class of ship that could fire aoe doomsday blasts through a cyno and then the best way to boost smallgang warfare and help small alliances was to create the current system with sov structures that take hundreds of people and days of sustained combat to convincingly threaten to say nothing of the basic point that you keep ignoring that greyscales mistaken view is not due to him trying to game the system so ccp can save him and give him easy mode like youre doing an essential distinction that you keep deliberately avoiding moderated for trolling zymurgist
not to interupt your rant about my reading comprehensionps i am not at all against nerfing titan bridges and cyno jumps either i think ive said so in this thread also i just think we should start at a pretty logical place instantaneos travel should have limits such as alliance only useif you think this wont promote more importance on the alliance in which you reside and less on your coalition therefore hopefully leading to smaller and more frequent battles then i mean sure you can say that but it would have to be for a reason other than my poor englishstupiditytrollingeasymode lustalso you look at one aspect of jumpbridges being offencive but they are far more useful in things like defencive actions where entire coalitions of forces can be funneled into system using jbstitan avoiding many of the risks  traps another force may have set for themit also regardless of what you say makes living further away from empire easier and more viable for the day to day member by doing so may promote less competition for regions closer to hubsempire but i guess this logic doesnt count if i knew how to play the game your coalition is firm and strong and built on friendship and trust and honour not on greed so enforcing that regions like tributevale may be easier to live out of than branchdrone regions would never cause problems for coalitions hopefully leading to what i now term as funmode evenow im not saying this is the only way of adding value to regions but it is a way relevant to the discussion of jumpbridges

do you know whats the same about these three quotes other than you said them allwell its that they arnt the same as this so i wonder are you a liar or just not able to follow your own arguments you know just give yourself that same rant you just gave me about simple englishif you are actually interested in having a discussion now you must answer is greyscales position on jumpbridges similar to mine accurate or is it not and whyand this is all i have been waiting for you to argue
you cant do it can youheres the line your argument needs to start atjumpbridges do not promote increasingly larger coalitionslarger fightsmore boring stuffedit btw autism is an extremely serious condition and i would hope you are not trying to use it to mock someone on a forum that is intended to be constructive and for discussion about how to improve the gamefunny that you would tell me that stuff belongs on caod should i have said it
in this whole thread you have not said jumpbridges do not promote increasingly larger coalitionslarger fightsmore boring stuffyou need to say that because i believe the opposite and you have spent a long time saying that i am wrong
i agreei woouldnt say remove them completely but i think the alliance only use is a good ideai would also like to add on a side note that has nothing to do with jbs but could make small gang stuff more fun and act as an incentive to travelroam more i mentioned it a while back but i really think ihubs should be attackable while the sov is still in effect even if it is just to neutralise them so that they only run at 25 efficiency etc requiring reps to be bought back up to 100 this should be doable with a 15 man gang or so and i think it will really help provoke a fight rather than roaming 1234567 jumps only for the carebears and locals to dock up and look from their windowsanyways i support this idea gj mini
ive asked you politely to not joke around about autism so im just going to put it out there that i have reported you for this nowbut let me get back to your post you do realise it would be far easier to just point out where you made this argument rather than post over and over again that we are liars and trollsas ive said it makes no sense that you arnt going to jump through more hoops when you continue posting at such length about things of no consequence to the argument at hand
thread cleaned of trolling and offtopic posts please remember to post in a constructive manner
lets discuss the problems with thisoption one i am a troll which lets hope for your sake you dont believe we will look into this in a secondoption two i am not a trollshould option two be correct you have not provided a sufficent counter argument to jbs enforce a trend towards a game style that is inherantly unplayable now lets look at the more worrying of the two should i be trolling and you seem insistant that i am whether to discredit an argument you have no other way of doing or because you actually believe it to be true i point out that should i have been trolling you which i have not been you have clearly become emotional about what is being said you have started quoting me as troll who is an idiot or things to that effect which im not sure you can claim has been done because of your unwillingness to be trolled if i was a goon i would ask you u mad i cant see anyone using phrases such as i know you are just pretending to have autism can claim they are how do i say it not mad broso please stop with this straw man and just answer the questions1 do you want to have fun in this game2 is unplayable gameplay fun for you3 do jbs lend to this style of gameplay4 how can we start to change thisif your answer to any of the first three questions is no then we really have had nothing to discuss this whole timethe reason i brought this here was to discuss the fourth issue
i suppose that i could point out that this makes actual logic curl up into a ball and cry itself to sleep but ill content myself with taking your fallacy as an acceptable material conditional and point out that i have numerous times specifically and at great length described the many reasons why each and every single one of your claims about jbs and their detrimental effect is wrong and since the thread has been cleaned people can find those posts that much more easily now so by your own logic option 2 must be rejectedqed

the closest thing i see to an argument from you in those remaining posts is you downplaying the importance of jumpbridges in moving numbers around and you have not addressed that there is a strong implication that titan bridges should be looked into alsowhich is completely ridiculous im not sure how you can stand here and say jumpbridges play no part in making it easier to move numbers aroundthe next closest thing to an argument is that having more people in fights is fun ok im not exactly sure why that is the case maybe thats just your thing you want to feel part of something important or something which im not saying is bad but i think the majority of people would much appreciate more instances of battles and more playable engagements and changes to jumpbridgestitan bridges i would go as far as saying jump freighters and other cyno type things but thats for another thread which make it harder and more riskey to move around in relative safetyquickly would end up giving more people more fights and more of them being playableam i wrong
as this is another wildly obvious fiction i feel that it should be pointed out you advance the fiction that those arent the same thing and since youre for some reason unable to follow the argument that i must be to remind you greyscale said that probably jbs contribute to big wars your argument on the other hand to remind you in case youve forgotten was via direct quote now days anyone set blue to a coalition can jumpbridge over half of eve in a few jumps this allows for massive numbers to stagnate 00 being able to control pretty much whatever they likenot contribute and not contribute only to big wars but that 00 has stagnated and big groups can control pretty much whatever they like that is wildly divergent than greyscales views and as pointed out numerous times with copious examples simply wrong and ignorant of basic eve mechanics just wanted yet another object lesson as to why your demands to see things that have already been posted and in some cases which you have already responded to but you claim dont exist is a waste of time 1 thats dishonest ive pointed out that they are functionally irrelevant to long range deployment to forwardhqs in invasion zones 2 and of course as youve just been claiming i didnt advance any arguments youve now admitted that you were lying eviscerating your whole nine jumps argument where you tried to argue for how those dreadful nine jumps were somehow the driving factor in the nc being able to invade lxq was indeed an argument against the only concrete example youve even attempted to provide of the deleterious effects of jbs which you claim exist likewise this is a lie because that too is a lie and i never said that its not hard to understand how youre not sure i could say something when you made it up and pretended i said it in the first place likewise youre lying and making that up and pretending i said it this is why people should not believe your claims that arguments which have been made do not exist or take your claims at face value when you claim that things have been said
ok after briefly going over all 3 pages  current worth of posts im gaining that you want jump bridges hit with the nerf bat or remove completly my question to you is why jump bridges alown cost a huge amount of isk to put in place both in the jump bridge and its constant fuel needs and in the pos that is required to support the bridge they are currently limited to 2 per system so its not like its a insta jump to target system currently eve mechanics are if your red your dead if your blue i like you i see no reasion why my buddy in the maelstrom cant follow me through my own jump bridgeif your in a 00 alliance you can under stand that you have multipal frounts that you can be attacked from at the same time there is nothing worse that getting evemails saying ever pos in system x is being destroyed and your 45 jumps away having to use every singal gate to get there jump bridges are not invulnerable get a fleet of 45 or so people and blast them half way into structurebut leave them up  doing this means that the corp cant put down another bridge to fill the gap as there at there limit and they cant tear down the current one cause its damaged hence they will have to get a big logi fleet to repair it for about half a day
i dont think we can have an argument if you think rhetoric such as you bastards friggin blue whoever you want and can be wherever you want in a couple of jumps nullifies jump systems make it easier to move around with larger numbersi think this has been the biggest problem between us and why you insist on calling me a liar its because my use of rhetoric is interpreted by you as hard and fast factsimile metaphor euphemism hyperbole i still cant believe you are arguing that my argument is you can save 9 jumps via jump bridges its unfair my only explanation for this is either willful ignorance or misunderstanding of rhetoric you can always take up my offer of a chat on voice coms if you want me to make clear to you free of the problems you seem to be having with my posting
iirc vuk said this and was ignored his own argument is thatin the current nc invasion of the drone regions pilots coming from mm space may potentially have been saved a whole nine jumps and therefore jbs are game breaking and the game is stagnant and blah blah blah hes ignored the fact that the defenders have jbs and major battles for sov have been going on for some time now there examples of how the game isnt stagnant even when jbs are in full effect in other conflicts have been ignored too the fact that they dont offer an instajump to a target system isnt relevant because the argument hes advancing doesnt need no facts to get in the way he hasnt advanced any reason thats remained unrefuted either hes voiced a lot of anger at the nc but has had absolutely no answer for and has in fact deliberately ignored the fact that even if blues cant use each others titansbridges then all that has to happen if that alliances let each others titans park at staging poss and bridge their own alliance members andor alliances just trade individual systems in their constellations so other alliances can route their jbs through if theyre not allowed to use other blues bridges his argument is that he knows better than you what you want out of eve and what you find to be fun if that argument fails hes argued that bridges make 00 space stagnant as well as the exact opposite that it lets large groups take whatever space they wantdespite the fact that defenders can have and will continue to lose even when they have a full jb network in place this was pointed out to him too he argued that it was virtually impossible for him to incap mods reinforce towers etc i believe he also blamed triage carriers at one pointedit oh i see there are more lies okay of course that is a lie and youre making it up what really happened is that i pointed out that your entire argument actually boiled down to one single solitary concrete example as the only one you could provide and that it was that the nc had roughly 9 saved minutes on a trip from hw to lxq and you were arguing for why those whole 9 minutes were an insurmountable advantage while you were ignorant of how major alliances actually deploy to forward staging areas because you keep lying unable to deal with whats actually been said you invent something else and pretend i said it that is your argument and your denial is laughable that was the single solitary example you provided of how unfair the nc was and to do it you had to ignore that the drone regions have their own jbs and that the conflict invalidates all your nonsense about stagnant nullsec of course you want to claim that your argument is mere rhetoric and sadly misundstood
thanks for responding in a decent mannerlet me go through some of the things you are talking aboutfirstly jumpbridges are not costly at all this is only an illusion as vuk lau has stated in this thread mm which i believe to have the most used jumpbridge network anywhere in eve atm is paying 1015b a month in fuel now lets ignore for a second that this is actually cheap for an alliance to run a few moons would do it lets look instead at how it is being usedthe mm bridges are ones i like to camp sometimes so ive seen first hand some ridiculous stuff going on one issue is the majority of the traffic on jumpbridges such as mms does not come from mm directly it comes from assorted nc entitys secondly people often ignore alliance rules such as dont jump carriersjumpfreighters through the jbs and some alliances dont have those rules this further bumps up the cost thirdly it is a frequent occurence of gangs and fcs that are too lazy to fly somewhere manually to jb 4050 ships to get where they are going slightly fasternow all of this i think is misuse of jbs i honestly think jbs would cost next to nothing if people who had the time wernt just being lazy and other peple wernt jumping carriers through jbs to save themselves on fuel costsnow two jbs per system is imo too many but i havnt really discussed this yet the reason i think this might be a little strange is because a well set up network will allow people to get where they are going assuming its somewhere theres lots of travelhub of some sort without ever needing to use a regular stargate bar entry system call me oldschool but i think stargate travel is really meant to be the inescapable traveling system of eve its how we were raised pnow the point you made about letting your friend follow you through etc etc it isnt so much about you being wrong about that its got a lot of things to do with the culture of eve and the model underwhich the game should be played at least imo in eve we used to blue people we actually liked so that we could fly with them as time progressed we started to blue people we didnt really have any feelings towards so that we wouldnt be attacked by them more time passes and we start to blue people we dislike and start to try to force ourselves to like them so that we collectively are unconquerable so from that perspective i disagree with it but a far more pragmatic answer would be  it detracts the needdesire to build up your own alliancethere should be a strong insentive to build oneself up and not to simply rely on bridgesspace you dontcant control i am unsure of the wisdom of a model that is not reliant on you being able to do anything whatsoeverthe point you make about the 45 jumps thing and you having to fly all the way to save it manually is one of the big reasons i would like to see jbs removed not just looked into this would encourage players to hold space they actually need and not overarch atm we have giant slabs of sov space that are completely uninhabbited and i think this is largely because its so hard for a noncoalition force to break in and start using unused space and this is because it is relatively easy for a coalition to just move far away from where they are staged and grab what they want rather than what they practically neednow this is a bit of a greedy cycle the more you get the more you can have and theres no real reason to stopyour last point is a bit on the naieve side a 45 man gang can reinforce a jb but its unlikely that it will remain reinforced for long triage carriers can rep them up extremely quickly and even should they not its a very difficult buisness to reinforce a jb at a hostile deathstar likely stacked with ecm mods couple this with the fact that youll probably get jumped on by evenbigger numbers its just not really worth the riskeffort to go reinforce for eg the ncs entire jb network
my previous post was in relation to the guy above the guy whos calling me a liarbtw seeing as i only had the one example here ive just made you another one
called it most people who want to deal with jbs attack them mini is yet again arguing for his inability to accomplish pos warfare complete with complaints about triage carriers ignoring the fact that theyre delicious targets this is the problem with easy mode advocates the rest of us accept the game works the way it works and if we want to incap enemy mods or take down their towers we attack them others argue for why ccp has to make it so that they dont have to attack them because its a very difficult business to attack a deathstar pos the answer isnt to adapt and if you cant handle pos warfare to go do something else in eve its to get easy mode no its your lack of understanding of economics spending that isk on jbs has an opportunity cost you are deliberately ignoring that and acting as if enough isk to buy 12 motherships a year can be handwaved away its the same sort of fundamental lack of knowledge that informs the broken window fallacy subjective opinion backed up by nothing also much less than honest as youre a 2006 character jump drives were already in place in 2006 so you have a subjective opinion backed up by nothing and supported with something untrue that you made up unsupported nonsensical claim backed up by nothing and of course debunked by actual facts as dozens of major alliances have spent considerable time building themselves up even with the dastardly jump bridge menace in effect see above claims that mini was really saying the same thing as greyscale despite mini wanting jbs completely removed from the game and greyscale suggesting slightly modified factors like jump range standard people who cant adapt or compete need eve on easy mode and ccp has to save them coupled with general ignorance of the game as if deciding to take enemy space the nine jumps a coalition might save matters and they cant simply throw their forces into attacking a region even if its half way across the map evidently those nine minutes are drastically important and 4 filled fleets wont be able to threaten sov if it takes them nine whole additional minutes to get to their target welcome to eve surprisingly enough an mmo with playercreated content in an area specifically set up so that players can take and hold turf but some people need ccp to give them easy mode so that they can compete in ways that they wouldnt be able to accomplish without ccps direct influence
heres the thing that gets me about your entire line of argument your counter to jbs is exactly why im saying they need to be looked intobecause the fact that you needno two ways around it to have vastly larger numbers than the people you are attacking and over a longer period of time to do any significant damage to their jb network the advantage swings more and more readily into the court of the people with larger numbersall this encourages is coalitions to not stop growing and to hold more and more space so they can reach further and take more things they dont need  all of this promoting fewer largerunmanagable and more boring styles of play my major point in this threadand the next time you claim 15b a month is expencive because you can have however many motherships by the end of the year ask yourself where all the isk from the ncs moongoo has been going for years you know before you had to pay this arduous tax for using jbs and back when moongoo was worth a friggin boat load 4b a week some moons if you believe for a second that there isnt massive ammounts of embezzeling going on and that there hasnt been for years actually that would make sense given your arguments thus far
megafail on understanding what an example is and whats its supposed to do zomg fewer jumps is an example for nothing its just you wasting electrons nobody has denied that jbs shorten the total number of jumps but you know that so youre arguing against something that nobody has said anywhere just like youve conveniently forgotten that your original argument wasnt just that there were a whole gasp nine jumps shaved off a route but that it was a hugely significant situation that led to nullsec stagnation in the face of one of the most massive conflicts that eve has ever seen complete with significant shifts in territory and such nonsense now of course youre trying to change the subject by showing that gee some routes with jbs take fewer jumps than without shocka unsurprisingly youve really just spent however many minutes trolling through an app to find any route you could that was shorter than any other route without jbs all without bothering to show the least little effect that weve actually seen in game from that that so awfully disrupts the ability of groups to fight each other whats ridiculous is that you still think youre making some sort of point with this nonsense look fewer jumps is an argument for nothing other than that there are fewer jumps and that you cant attack poss and you need ccps help and so on and so forthedit more ignorance of basic mechanics fiction my counter is that its perfectly possible to raise a fleet and go do something about them other than complaining that ccp needs to alter the game itself to help you yours is that you cannot possibly attack them and so ccp needs to help you simple ignorance of eve game mechanics smaller groups can and have dealt with larger groups and pos warfare in specific is notoriously open to timezone warfare again argue for your own inability to accomplish anything and go figure its yours back to the emperor of fun speaking ex cathedra about what people should want and what theyll really find to be fun coupled with a total lack of understanding about basic eve mechanics and the fact that 00 space is supposed to be carved up by playerdriven content and if a group of people manage to use valid game mechanics to take more of it than others then the response is to fight them and not demand that ccp give you easy mode so you dont have to fight them fallacy of non sequitor broken window fallacy and deliberately ignoring the fact that isk spent has an opportunity cost so add in ignorance of basic economics and antinc trolling that has nothing to do with anything at all go figure
hohohoho misterfinn youre going to be mister finnagainyou are typing so much but saying nothing of value
one of minigins original points was to restrict bridge usage to the alliance that owns them i say come it from a different directionmove the jump bridge from a pos module to that of a standalone structure anchored at a planet give it some resistshp increases due to it losing its tower defenses but keep the restrictions of 2 per system sovereignty etc but make three changes 1 members of the owning alliance when using the bridge have the fuel cost deducted from the fuel stored in the bridge 2 any allies must carry their own fuel which is deducted from their cargohold this next change could go one of two ways so im putting both here 3ahostilesneutrals can through the use of analyzer and hacking modules trick the bridge into thinking they are blues and use the bridge or 3b the bridge is totally jumperneutral and anybody can use it if they have fuel in their cargohold changing the bridge like this puts into place a catch22 situation yes it gives a bit easier movement to the owner and their allies but also opens up the opportunity for hostilesneutral to exploit it i liken it to a real world invasionjust because someone invades your country doesnt mean they cant drive on your roads
bridges are a little more sophisticated than roads i think the idea of hacking them is indeed interesting though
not supported if you dont like enemy jump bridges all you have to do is get a few super carriers out there and blow them up it happens all the time you can also put some bombers near the bridge and watch as the incoming fleet is demolished by your bombs oh wait you suck so bad you cant do that either lolnot only that but they arent as easy to move thousands of ships as you say lower the fuel capacity what are you smoking bridges need to be constantly fueled or they run out already if you moved 1000 ships through one it would run out and a good chunk of the fleet will be left on the other sideif people want to move large fleets around they can without a bridge anyway there is that thing called a  cough cynofuel costs money sov costs money and time bridges are working as intendedi actually wish that bridges could be fueled by blues so that when it runs out of fuel you can add fuel to it to jump rather than wait for one of the owning corp members to have to come out to fuel it
good luck several people have tried to explain to mini why actually playing the game to counter jbs is the way to go and not asking ccp to save him from game mechanics but he keeps talking about how he cant deal with poss i believe that the reasons are death stars people might defend them and triage carriersmaybe i missed a reason why unlike everybody else who plays the game there is a certain group of people who need ccp to save them and cant fight over territory and resources but need ccp to remove them instead ah well
yeah i know a few players including myself that have had the one week timer expire on them about the time they start or complete part 9 part 10 gives a major boost to both faction and corporation standings i did a petition on it when it first happened to me quite a while ago after about a week a senior gm reset part 10 for me during that week i found the patch note information and added it to the petition this was before the timer was actually active on multipart storyline missions its just a shame that the so called 1 month expiration timer is only good for part 1 im sure there are probably other players who have missed out on completing that mission series
it could provide a much needed extra layer of security to your eve account but if said hacker has installed something on your computer and has remote access to your computer whats to stop them from getting this information as well a keylogger that included a time stamp or whatever else is used in the generation of these numbers plus said numbers caught you logging in 3 times would be enough to crack it example wow security solution the authenticator was bypassed in this manor it uses the time and the number on the back to generate the 6 digit numberall being said i support more security even if it is breakable
whos going to pay for ita better solution is to use something that is proven established and unbreakablenot supported
im not sure thats how this system works although i agree it would be very easy to break if it did
i dont believe pgp would work in this case since were talking about passphrase systems not the encrypting of filesas for cost if ccp where to go the phone route the cost would be little to none and if they went the physical route its unlikely itd cost more then 5 dollars
if you wanted to point to existing solutions you could have gone for otp with printed out lists instead of hardware tokens pgp is sadly not the sameedit fix typo
printed out lists would be horrible we are in the 21st century ffsif you want proven and reliable solutions you want something like paypals security key that i never heard about before i immediatly wanted to add to my paypal since i hate the lack of security at paypal and promptly told me it wasnt available atm every serious bank uses something similar for online banking securityalso honestly this is the 20th proposal we had about this
you could go with rsa securid but those things are 60 dollars a crack
sure it would be horrible but it would be kinda cost effective for ccp and get the problem solved p
already a discussion for this with lots of supports and further information here
supported a simple authentication system like that is ridiculously helpful it can even be made optional blizzard authenticator single greatest thing they ever did id pay 1020 for that level of security

i think a lot of people have been wishing that a viewport into their hangars or some random hangar from inside the station would be coola sparring minigame would be cool just gonna throw it out there kinda like tekken bt without bull super abilities and the ability to place bets on who wins im not saying promoting violence all over the station but behind closed doors and only 1 v 1 but possibly with the chance that prolonged dualing can damage implants and even clone death would make a change from ship pvp toou can even remove the button bashing by having the fight consisting of charges bare with me here in the same way that scissor paper rock has an ability to win loose or draw u can have a fight that consists of a set of moves say 5 in each where u either attack defend or block and you can only block a max of 4 out of the 5 times for exampleattacking causes the most damage but leaves you more vunerable to counter attack on the same move defending allows a radomiser to score an attack hit lower than a full out attack but also allows a randomixer to reduce damage from an attack from the opponent and a block blocks any attack and doesnt allow any attack hit on your opponentu can add a set of skills to improve the randomising agents in the minigame tooso u choose a string of 5 attack defend or block choices within a time limit and when both players have the sparring encounter occurs then these rounds carry on till either 1 player gives up is knocked out or gets dealt a deadly blowu can even add various types of matches clean matches with no additional items and no drug use and vice versaedited to support
cyber cafes with computers where you can play games where you pretend to bea a corporate accountantb a bartenderc a mcburger flipperetcyou can gain skill points in diffenent areas by buying skill books and training them up to different levelsarnt these the things that every starship captain yearns to be in reality 
i would like to see more than a handful of these 168 mostly pretty good and already csmapproved suggestions implementedwhy bother posting more ideas when they cant implement more than the most trivial ones w
id like an option to access a kind of vr booth which allows me to experiment with various ship classes and fittings for free or a small charge against purely ai enemies this would be especially useful if it allowed you to try out ships which you cant fly for real due to skillpoint or budget limitationsthis should be strictly single player just so that people dont end up logging into real eve just to play vr evevarious card games like poker and blackjack would be nice but i think a lot of nations have rules and regulations about gambling online and it could be argued that gambling with isk is equivalent to gambling with real money id love to be proven wrong on this one because meeting up in station for some poker would be aceits been mentioned before but some kind of strategic map which can be annotated and updated by the viewer who then sends info out to fleets in the field would be really interesting there would have to be some unique functionality to this map or its no better than the fc having dotlan open in a second screen one feature i can imagine would be to introduce a new sov structure which automaticaly tracks the number of pilots in local along with their standings and then presents that info on the strategic map in this way a player watching the map could get great intel from multiple systems and inform the fleet as to the situation in friendly or contested spacescouts would still be needed however as enemy space would not be covered by this system and even in friendly space the map could only tell you the number and standings of pilots in systems but not what theyre flying  necessitating direct observation by a scout if you want detailed info
currently capital ship bobbing is out of controli guess you better get capital ship bobbing repaired then 
and this guy thought that changing jumpbridges to alliance only use was a bad idea
i hate patches they always result in the necroing of old threads that would be left dead and buried
this idea is alot like that  who suggested extra fee for pirates ages ago op at least be originalill support because 2 pages full of s fell for it
i like the idea of custom subscription fees some more ideas please like higher subscription fees for people playing achura toons because they are fin ugly and hurt my eyes higher subscription fees for people logged off in mission hubs and jita because they are useless highsec dwelling leeches lower subscription fees for people in the fw militias because they are actually doing something for the greater good of their empiresetc etc etcand to op never stop making suggestions like this we need more lulz in this game
would make sense to support it but the drama and goonstest tears on caod threadnaught is just too entertaining and im bored at work
they got caught with their fingers in teh cookie jar and now theyre whining about why there was no sticker saying you cannot eat teh cookiesnot supportedmaybe a thread in the jita park forum would be more useful
second time in what two months when ccp just suddenly turns up and say hey you cant do this heres a bandelete to someone who has been doing something for a long time before retroactive punishment is never a good thing
pretty much this most people petition before doing something borderline but when that something has been done before
ok excuse me if i dont know what the op is talking about  im currenty working from a hotel room with y net connection but 4 lines each 4 words long really doent explain anything to me that said if some one would explain what happened i might support this post
any abuse of game mechanics should be stopped by ccp testys need to htfu and fight for sov
the tldr version is test onlined sbus right before downtime due to extended downtime the other alliances couldnt attack them so they got sov in 14 systems in the middle of the extended downtime dotlan entry for it gms got notified about it and wanted to offline the tcus but instead destroyed them and spawned new tcus in one of their stationswhat i dont understand is why the gm didnt just anchor the tcus again for them so they could have onlined them again during normal time but who knowsas tamber said  the whole whine is about we didnt know that is against the rules boohoohope this helps
note to self raise this
there is no issue
if your going to try and shoot something down saying that its so bad it doesnt need an explanation only works 5 of the time like trying to figure out why some guy fitted a titan with mining lasers and suchthat said im generaly on anti logi duty when it comes to fights as silly me i trained caldari bs5 and have no real turret skills so im generayl flying my scorpthe main strenght of a logi blob is there ability to lock each other as they take incoming damage and rep faster than the damage there taking if i can knock out 5 logis even for 20 seconds thats generayl enough time to actualy kill one  simply rince and repeatthat said the main problem in eve is not that there are to many logis  its that there are to few other roles in fleets currently there are 3 fleet parts command ships main fleet logis command ships generaly take a very long time to get good at and every one can be part of the main fleet hence the only other avalable part is logis
tldr after 54 replies and 700 reads only the original poster thinks this is a good ideameanwhile almost everyone agrees that logis warp speed should be upped to match most normal fleetships it was approved by the csm submitted to ccp involves changing one value in the database and ccp has done jack  about itis it just me or does posting ideas in here seem increasingly pointless
im sure if everyone had their own mint and was able to print however much money they wanted they would also at least in the short run think its fineits only after you start having to spend a million dollars on a loaf of bread that you realise what you have done to yourselves
hold on so where are those eccm projectors coming from
yet again faced with someone who yet again is trying to remove his ignorance and point out effective ways to counter logis mini is arguing for his own impotence its almost like no matter what mini is going to aruge for reasons why he simply cant accomplish anything and why ccp has to save him and put his game on easy mode oh wait i mean its exactly like that its a decent tactic in certain gang types for standard ships to fit a remote eccm or two and to have logi partners that they can pair up with of course as i keep pointing out mini is a liar and a troll and nothing he says can be taken at face value a basi with one local eccm and two remotes on it has a sensor strength of 153 not 269 but of course his all level v should actually read all level v  modified because hes got a full set of high grade talon implants in there for iirc about half a billion isk i guess mini just accidentally forgot to mention that
if i wanted eve on easy mode should i not make friends and join a coalition such as the ncwe talk as if its something hardworth doing how you are playing the game like i should aspire to be as good as youif i was in it for the fun should i not look at things which arnt fun in this game and say is this funnot fun whywhy not how can it be made more funinstead of everytime there is a suggestion of change i choke in my own furrious splutters of that guy just wants easymode eve he wants mommy ccp to come save him lets face it youve spent the better part of the last few days claiming i cant adapt to what eve is like yet ive been there done it all and suggested that it might be in everyones best interests if it not remain so if anything all you are proving by blind ranting is that you would be unable to adapt to changes such as logistics blobs becoming marginally important and jumbridge systems being slightly less effective and i think the reason why is because it took you so long to figure out how to use these things to begin with you dont want to learn how to do anything else its really quite sadyour sense makes no
caught in the fact that you were lying and trolling with that picture and its half billion in implants that you just happened to forget to mention and edited the info to hide you are again trying to change the subject and youre attempting to change it bytrolling the nctrolling the nc againagain pretending that you are the emperor of fun and nobody can decide for themselves how to play the game but since you need mommy ccp to protect you and set your game on easy mode that youre really doing that so you can benefit other people whether they want it or notthe same trolling tactic you keep using where you troll and then post about how someone is going to call you out for trolling and then claim victory since youre obviously trolling but someone pointed it out so you win valuable points redeemable for fantastic prizesthen trolling that since youre unable to adapt and you constantly argue for your own impotence and talk about how you need mommy ccp to save you and give you easy mode that really its the people who can adapt and play the game who are the ones who want easy mode its your traditional troll on this subject people who play the game and adapt are the ones playing on easy mode those who need mommy ccp to save them like you are hardcore then of course more trolling probably antinc trolling about people learning to use things as if it takes time to learn to use jbs or more likely your often repeated lietroll that razor didnt use armor hac gangs about a year to a year and a half before pl did but of course this is again just your trolling attempt to change the subject from the fact that youre arguing for how impotent you are and for why you so badly need ccp to save you so youd rather troll the nc and act as if you made a point because if youre impotent and need ccp to save you then the people who are actually willing to adapt to the game must be unwilling to learn to do anything else not like you who are not only unable and unwilling to learn to do anything but you need mommy ccp to save you and set your game on easy mode which is really hardingcore
considering how cheap and useful those sets are i would be surprised to see a logi pilot without one unless he is going for a different strategywith all the macro ratting in the north you would think you could afford a few implants to make your hull tanked ravens rat more efficiently pbff
i heard in eve you arnt allowed to use implants fyi 500m to be unjammable is relatively cheep especially if you play no risk styledont pretend for a second you didnt run straight off to eft to see how i was doing that just as i expected you to and just as i expected you to you ran back sceaming how i was caught out by you the point of that link was to show how ineffective ewar can be against logis 150 strenght isnt exactly weaksauce so i am perfectly sound to have said yah ok if you know how to play this game you know why jams wont work against anyone running a proper logi ganginstead i get idiots saying things like i fly a scorpion i can jam 5 logisthen you whiteknighting them saying its ok you are easily jammablecompletely ridiculous if you dont use implantsedit and exactly like the guy above me just said if you arnt using implants you should be
mmm hmmmmm this from the same person who thinks that jbs are risk free for freighters jumping through them oddly enough you also somehow missed the fact that those implants were on minis ship fitting although he deliberately tried to hide that factbut of course you also included some trollingthenc in your post if theres anything that helps support an argument its some trolling ayupps learn to play eve mini jamming is percentage based and theres no such thing as unjamable but typical trolling from you caught in your pathetic little bit of deception youre trying to change the subject oh and if youre lying and trolling admitting that youre doing it is even dumber than the awful trolling you love to engage in just like you rather obviously have no clue how to play the game if you think a pack of scorpions cant absolutely ruin a logi chain even when two remote eccms running on each logi to say nothing of your hillarious ignorant babble about how any pilot who ever flies a logi ship should invest half a billion isk in each and every jump clone that might get into a logi and of course as you really like lying youve fabricated yet another quote and pretended that anybody ever said it anywhere let alone in the service of whiteknighting youre not very smart are you
surprise mini is again trying to argue for why hes unable to do things in eve and why ccp needs to save him meanwhile those of us who actually fly logis with or without spending 5 bil per jump clone know that even an enemy that puts a lot of ec600s on a logi wing can count on enough jams to make things significantly tricky for them to say nothing of a dozen scorps too
no im not saying i have trouble dealing with logis im saying you do and im saying its going to make the game boringyou just said a scorpion wing can mess with logis easy but i just showed you why thats not the case so you changed your argument to ecm drones ill let you figure out why ecm drones dont work well on your own rather than me having to friggin babysit you all through very simple tactics we have been using for yearsbtw even assuming you cant figure out the exctremely simple solution for ecm drones you should know they are actually bugged ill let you run off to the test server to try figure out how
which ships do the eccm projectors get fitted too i havent seen this tactic used and i cant imagine it being particularly viable in an ahax gang i could be wrong there
what ships cant you fit them to the hardest gang to run them in is a shield gang because you need the mids to tank and tackle also but even there we have extremely strong setups that involve a lot of projected ecmand this is what worrys me about this game im being shouted down by people who are using the setups incorrectly or at half their potential just wait till people figure out how bad they have been up until now
theyre quite effective in ahax gangs ignore minis trolling about how other people fit ships he likes lying about that in a standard gang you want to have at least two or three zealots ideally that each have one remote eccm on a guardian buddy who they have watchlisted it helps boost sensor strength but of course as its percentage based drones scorps etc all can pose problems to a logi chain especially when coupled with secondary effects like neuts damps painters etcwere you lying then or are you lying nowas for your troll that you havent been whining about how you cant deal with logis but really its other people whove spent many posts trying to tell you how you can deal with logis who cant deal with logis okay i guess its that kind of tard logic that you keep using to trollno you didnt you understand less about math than you do about logic and thats saying something also youre yet again lying in order to troll thats yet another thing that nobody ever said anywhere that youre making up go figure youre lying about that too and of course youre still sucking at mathyour general ignorance about eve and total lack of knowledge about how to play is again hilarious as well yep liars have to have very good memories because evidently you cant even keep track of your lies which is it there are very simple tactics that youve been using for years so theres absolutely no reason for you to be whining about how mommy ccp needs to save you and give you easy mode or your original claim that its almost impossible to counter logis so mommy ccp needs to save you and give you easy mode see this is why not lying is much better than lying try it out you might even like debating honestly
you can also use more against logis than ecm with damps it takes longer to lock the target which might be just enough to kill him before reps kick inalso it is pretty funny you choose the basi for your ecm chance calculation quickly followed by the remark that it might not be too viable in shield based gangs where exactly were you planning to use the basi or has it something to do with basi having highest sensor strength too lazy to actually check but since it is caldari it is a reasonable guessanyway logistics make fights longer longer fights are more enjoyable spending 30 minutes before seeing the opponents hoping you actually get a fight while most times one side just wont engage and then the fight being over in 10 seconds because you got primaried first is no fun shooting on each other for a long time is way more fun
no purely because you posted in green no idea what your idea was
yep just like his forgetting to mention and then later hah hah really i was trolling you bit about putting in 5 bil worth of implants
ah never heard of them being used like that interesting idea
no i chose the bassy because thats the one i have used mostand had the fit ready for on eft and i said it was less viable the bassy is still amazing and you can run friggin insane gangs with themyou can still get a guardian to 230250 sensor strength with relative ease the difference between the two is really negligable  and in day to day use it is more practical to have the guards with higher strength than bassys simply because of my already stated argument that in armor gangs you use your mids for a lot lessalso i dont see why you cant use implants i just said even assuming you are all bad at the game and dont use the implants you still get remarkably high strengthyes one of my counters involves sensor damps but its not nearly as effective as you might think there are much better counters the problem is you wont see them very often for various reasonsbesides lets face it if you had the choice of flying somewhere with 50 logistics of 50 scorpions supporting you what would you rather assuming of course you would fight even or greater numbersim just warning you that once people get their acts together and you start seeing 100 vs 100 heavy logi gangs this game is going to get pretty boring and that people are having one of the very good counters eg missile volley removed so they can cycle their reps in time rather than broadcasting when things start redboxing leeds me to to believe that you guys dont actually want counters for logis to exist you like them the way they are because you dont die as much as you used tothus i can see when someone stands up and says yo this is gonna get friggin ridiculous and boring soon you all want to continue printing money in the short run because hey youve figured out howor so you think
all im saying at this point is that a stacking penalty should be looked intotheres stacking penalties for practically everything else
caught lying and saying both that its virtually impossible for him to deal with logis and its trivially easy for him to deal with logis and really he has no problem dealing with logis but the folks who have problems dealing with them are all the people whove been trying to tell him how he could deal with logis while hes been saying he cant do it mini tries to change the subject and keep trolling unexpected and novel you draw conclusions like a spastic five year old on pixy sticks draws starry night with an etchasketch the fit that you had ready with no mods other than an eccm and the edited all vs  modified that you tried to sneak in as a normal one and which you already admitted was part of your plan to try trolling peopleyah good call there youre even going to lie about what you yourself have and havent said amazing of course again youre the one who uses your claims that youre horrible at eve to claim that you need mommy ccp to save you and give you easy mode also loltroll anybody who cant spend 5 bil per jump clone is bad at eve now zo noezalso as the emperor of fun you can tell people when they are and are not having fun even if they annoyingly think they know better peasants
so far you have said the following5b is a lotrzr didnt steal the idea of armor hacs off anyonescorpions can mess with logisticsecm drones can mess with logisticsyour limited understanding of this game is only eclipsed by your limited understanding of how to argue a point you actually need to have one you cant just say my counter argument is that you are a liar and a trollnow a perfectly valid argument for you to have used which you didnt is something like after a certain number you can just get enough dps on the field where no matter how many logis there are you can volley down people now im sure this is true and a good argument however i would rather not see the effective counter to a mechanic be bring so many that there is no chance they can rep in time because again that promotes a type of play which imo shouldnt be promotedits funny because now im actually arguing your side for you s as well as presenting my casefeel free to continue calling me a liar and ignoring valid points at your leasure
by the way have you figured out yet if you were lying and trolling when you claimed that it was almost impossible to counter enemy logis or lying and trolling when you claimed that it was trivially easy to counter enemy logis and youd been doing it for years just curious which story youre going to try to stick to thank you for reminding me that you are a committed and relentless liar going to retract your lie yet about how rzr didnt use armor hac gangs roughly a year to a year and a half before pl led and organized by rzr fc ernest grafenbergor do you just like lying value is relative genius and ill point out that youre lying again as your demand was that anybody flying a logi should have 5 bil worth of implants in that clone which means every single jump clone that might see use in a logi both are true you not having a clue how to play the game doesnt invalidate ya know facts or math or logic fancy that of course youre lying and trolling by claiming that ive ever done that go figure every actual argument youve advanced has been dealt with every single one of course ive also noted that you are both a liar and a troll as proven by your own posts including your own admission in this thread that you were trolling liars needs to have good memories yours suckstrolls need to make sure that they havent already trolled the same point that theyre now claiming is a good one failtroll being that youre not presenting your case since you evidently cant decide how youre going to troll you still cant figure out if youre going with the story that its nearly impossible or trivially easy for you to counter logis youre also certainly not arguing anybody elses sidethe  you just pulled actually is known is the strawman fallacy pretty textbook actually in that you set up an argument that nobody was using and then knocked it down for bogus rhetorical effect but i guess when youre a troll whos pretending to have some sort of cognitive damage that goes with the territory again the same trolling tactic of yours you lie and claim that i have ignored a single valid point and then preemptively whine about how youll be caught at lying just like you lie constantly and then preemptively whine that someone might point that fact out speaking of which figured out yet whether or not its trivially easy or virtually impossible for you to counter enemy logis just want to be clear as to which claim youre now saying was a lie and which youre now saying is what you really meant to say
the character was not modified nor was the screenshot doctored theres an implants tab here
reading all 3 pages of this proposal was a waste of 15 mins of my time and i want those minutes back miniguni think ive figured out wtf is going on in this threadi think sum1s a little ragey that they were pulled from the fc list bt the again if i was joining a fleet and told i could either snipe or be logi id probably have grounds to complain bout the level of intelligent command1 on the request tho ahh if only
lol ok ill leave this rest and say you guys are right for now ill revisit this in a couple of months with a few videos and kb stats
you seem to have forgotten to answer this please do describe what your real position is and identify which one you dont believe is it that logis are almost impossible to counter or logis are trivially easy to counter and youve been doing so for years yes it was it had a full set of high grade faction implants and as you already stated you included that with the hope of provoking me into a response which you dont have open on the image you used to say nothing of how you admitted that you were using the image to troll for a reaction and are again trying to change the subject this time to a totally different screenshot you could try addressing and trying to rebut them rather than repeatedly pretending that they dont exist ive at least directly addressed and eviscerated each and every single one of your points but you still cant and wont even admit that my arguments exist let alone honestly discuss them
i think bad logi gangs are very easy to counter i think good logi gangs with good fcs are also counterable but the counters to them are pretty hard to pull off and often rely on their fc not suspecting you of doing something fishyi wasnt ignoring you because i didnt have an answer i was ignoring you because you have no idea what you are talking aboutagain i need to point out that i dont think you seem to understand very much of my rhetoric you might be misinterpretting it for trolling in fact i think thats definatly what you are doing
nope sorry i want you to clarify not try to evade were you lying when you said or were you lying when you saidboth can not be true and so one is obviously a lie which is it its nearly impossible for you to counter a gang that isnt making serious mistakes or you simply do not have trouble dealing with logis only one can be true and one must be a lie which mmm hmmm two quotes one is obviously a lie both are your words youve ignored them for about half a dozen times and now youre trying to obfuscate and claiming that its really only about bad gangs when you said both that you have no trouble dealing with only bad gangs but the rest are almost impossible to counter and that you have no trouble dealing with any logis at all mmmmm hmmmm i recognize that youre saying things regardless of whether or not theyre actually true and using them to prop up an argument that is unsupportable and then when caught on the facts you claim that your shall we say innocent factual errors are simply rhetoric
 but im not having trouble dealing with logis because of two reasons one as ive already said most people are still learning how to use them that you have to run off to eft to figure out that scorpions are crap against big logi gangs shows thatthe second is that critical mass hasnt been reached yet imo can see this happening pretty soon tbhnotice how this leaves room to be more than able to deal with logis inappropriate language removed but leaves me wondering what will happen when people finaly catch onthe most concerning thing isnt even that no counter will be found im sure something will come up the real concern is that people will end up meeting frequently with other logi gangs and neither gang will be capable of inflicting any real damage to the otherrkn that could be pretty friggin boring
trolling comments removed please keep this on topic discussion of the proposal is ok if you have an issue with someones posting habits please click on the report button
can i report someone for posting in all green
nope mini your quotes have been posted both that you have easy logi counters that youve been using for years and its easy to counter them with none of your new nonsense about how unlike every other thing in the entire game somenhow your easy counters dont scale due to critical massand how its nearly impossible to deal with logistic ships only later coupled with your epeen nonsense about how everybody other than you sucks at eve and only you understand how to fly logis but thats okay youve made two wildly divergent claims if you thought it helped your argument and you have no way to reconcile your two diametrically opposed statements so youd rather spin it in some way or another ahhh so thats why you were trolling on that point you thought it would be a gotcha later of course it isnt no people are not just learning how to use logis most of us have been using them for years oh i know other people arent as awesome as you and blah blah blah and of course as pointed out you simply dont understand basic math scorpions are not crap against logis by any stretch of the imagination having been in logi wings with sensor strength in the mid 150s and still being jammed out with fair frequency i know that you are using theorycrafting to eft warrior your way out of a situation that you have no actual understanding of based on real first hand experience where scorps and ec drones have provided significant annoyance to a logi chain and your eft warrior stance im going to go with reality also im able to deal with math and it doesnt baffle me that even a three percent chance iterated several time a cycle and cycling several times a minute will most likely lead to several hits over the course of several minutes but math probably likes the nc so you can ignore it i know surprising ah the same sort of doom and gloom psychic prediction nonsense that fortune tellers use nothing firm or concrete or even specific but at an unspecified time and unspecified critical mass will develop in an unspecified way and it will result in unspecified horrible consequence through an unspecified mechanic but it will happen pretty soon unless you pay them or uncritically believe what you say funny that everybody whos tried to educate you on ways you can counter logis understands that the counters scale and there is no mythic critical mass that is those who were trying to educate you while you were still arguing that it was virtually impossible before you decided that really all along you were arguing that it was trivially easy but only you were cool enough to do to do it right before you decided that really all along you were arguing that its only because you hate the nc that you can easily counter logis but once a mythical critical mass is reached the sky will fall and armageddon will occur also disco will be popular again except in reality thats already happened and your nonsense turned out to be false oh wait oh wait i know its because nobody has as awesome an epeen and everybody but you sucks and blah blah blah and eft beats what actually happens in game
i wanted to put back on the table this subject since i think it would be a good opportunity for the players to be involved at the maximum in the events and politics of new edenboth for rp and have as much as possible reason for pvp and other players interactionsthis is the precedent tread about the subjectfw and alliance
i understand that the universe can be a harsh place you often have to watch your back and watch your wallet too to make sure you arent cheated by the latest jita chat scam or the likemost scams in eve i think require just a bit of commen sence to understand that something is up the old saying dont trust someone you do not know goes a long way but i recently ran into an exploit where a user or group of users can list a set of items say in the same region on the market in my case it was the hardwiring  zainou gnome kxa2000 item which was selling on the forge region area there was a buyer for said item for 25000000 for a minimum of 19 so i go around the forge and gather up 19 of the items which cost me around 280 ish million isk then i go to the station to sell the items and a error pops up and the listing is gonecontacting ccp i got this replygm correspondence removed please see forum rules number 9 for more information zymurgist my suggestion is that i think this should not be allowed i believe the simple way is that if a person makes a buy order that requires a set number of items for x price he must put the money up front first this would insure players that in a multiple item deal they will get the fundsif not that then some way of notifying next to the buy order that requires a set number of items that the creator of the buy order currently has enough funds to fulfill it i just think this form of scamming manipulating the market is wrong i think some scams in eve online is fine but i thnk some scams and manipulation for players who might be new and want to get into trading it just makes them that much more hesitant scams should only be allowed if they are more or less common sence trust issues where a smart player can know how to avoid them by the old saying trust no onei just think that you have to be careful in making eve online too real in that it can keep a lot of players from getting into the gamethe large amount of scams in eve i think personally will keep it from ever being as popular as say games like world of warcraft which can have scams too  as in any game but i just think eve online has too many scams that are allowed for its own goodplease dont allow people to fudge the market like this i think this really needs to be brought up to ccps attention as this kind of exploit should not be allowedthanks
you are not allowed to post gm mails
though shall not speack the game of w for it gives it power over your very soulthat said this particular scam type has been known for the last few weeks but is still one of the ones you cant verify by looking into it bet you didnt know that the people who you bought all those implants from where in fact the scamers selling them at a generaly inflated price to bootthat said the margen trading skill is usefull but it does need a counterhow about if a player places a buy order for 100 items at x price using margin trading they cannot remove isk from there account if it would bring there total account to under what is required to pay for any market orders currently in effect or should a player have 7 market orders for 100 units of x items and there isk balance is reduced to under the total amount required to pay for said order the orders are imedeatly canceledor lastly if a player places a market order and does not have enough isk to pay they go into negative isk all market orders are cancled they cant open more and the negative isk is tyed to the account its on not the character so if they try and delete the char they still have the negative isk
in before the lock for posting a gm responsealso welcome to eve its worse than mos eisley in this place hive of scum and villany
oh look another ive been scammed change the game thread dude if you cant spot a scam or cant handle being scammed then perhaps you should consider returning to elf and fairy land not supported
while perhaps harsh this is a fairly accurate view of the matter scams are not only allowed in eve they are encouraged you will unfortunately encounter very little sympathy or support
the game is fine scams are not supposed to be obvious jita contract scams are not the top of the fraud food chainhtfu
thanks for all the support peoplealso that idea for the arrow facing the camera would be also a godsend
certain n coalitions are obsessed with comparing this game and wars in 00 to iraq vs usa so i thought we would introduce food consumptionthis is how things will gowhen two forces collide lets say when n vs e the total morale will be calculated and the side that has more morale will have to pay trade goods per person in penalty afterwardshere is an exampleblob 1  2100 playersblob 2  1000 playersstatistically blob 1 would win due to node crashing lag and general ation the overall morale will be 3100 if blob 1 wins they will have to celebrate like in rl and in effect would have to pay 1100 players in luxury goodslets say everyone likes caviar spirits tobacco wine and livestock or the equivalent to 5 mil per person so say the above blob fest happened and blob 1 won they would have to pay a 55 bil penalty in celebrations parties and foodthis means alliances can still stay blobby as ever but would have to reconsider blobbing even the rich wont be able to satisfy my appetite note this only applies when there is a huge size difference and will only apply for the difference which means based on the above example blob 1 would have to cover for 850 pilots 25 bigger than the smaller blobblobs will be worked out through standings and actual attacks based on fleet
its very simple1 drop boosterand maybe others im not sure is increases a tracking of capital turrets2 crash booster is not affects capital missiles alrough its should as shown in eftso i think its something wrong here 
you might want to test it ingame before claiming things based on eft eft itself has bugs aswell
yes ive asked about this before in other forum and its has come to a same thing so ive tested this in game no effect on missilesive checked an actual damage so this is not a info bug and corpmate says that he uses a tracking booster on his dread sometimes
1 what did you shoot at with your dread what sigradius had the object2 if you go to the fitting screen then hover your launcher and select show info for the ammo the missile explosion radius didnt change before and after taking the boostermore facts really
1 sleepers  with some painters and webs damage is around 21k which isnt changes even with painters explosion radius is far more bigger than signature radius explosion velocity is enough btw its has a good alpha so im not complaining its just about boosters which i think should influence all caps or none at all in case someone will troll about such use of a dread or anything2 no its didnt changes
while i like this idea this would infact limit the sandbox and some enterprising pilot would be out of a possible mini professionthis is a perfect oppurtunity for someones to make a service
theres a point in case for arguing why if youre flying in a frig gang u shouldnt have a trailing interdicter to set up bubbles to slow down any backup someone calls inreally the only thing that would be an addition would be a frig based repping platform although a couple of t2 logistics a good distance away would do that well would have issues of maneuverability but with points webs etc on the frigs around the target the target wouldnt get anywhere to be effective any weapons systems could be countered with that many different frigs and mid slot choicesthere are ways to do what you want just not in a solo aspect eve online is ment to be something that encourages teamwork and cooperation whether good or evil
the burden of proof should be on the player realistically if they start tracking down on claims of exploits then theyre not gonna have time to investigate every claim especially bogus ones

okay im no great fan of test or itbobt20the issue that has me worried is the inconsistant and quite frankly blatantly biased descision making of the gms in this issuewe know that gms are basically free to do as they wish citing the interpritation get out clause however when bias is as clear as this and the gm wagon train is circling for all its worth no public discussion of this decision are you seriousit is time to call in a 3rd party to investigate what exactly happened and why while i understand that many feel the csm is a talking shop for ccp to fill with hot air it is instances like this that they should be investigating ccp you want to regain the credibility you have lost yet again by a biased decision open your doors to the csm and let them investigateedit for latest case of gm abuseincompetancecan we also add in the latest incident a legal war dec being cancelled by a gm with the usual ccp whitewash replyseriously it seems some gms are just not up to the jobgm incompetance
oddly enough isnt that what the ccp internal affairs division already does
it were the only ones initially to petition itthe use of extended downtime to take sov is blatantly wrongeveryone else has got in on the act and all downtime actions have been dealt withcry less the sensationalism only makes you look more stupid
with ccps previous history of internal inquires t20 ferrogel et al i would be safe in saying that any result that a ccp employee came out with would be biased towards the companythis needs a nominally neutral party one that is not paid by the very people who made the decision
wow yes lets waste everyones time with something noncontroversial at all goonstest are making fools of themselves all over eve the correct response is to ignore the s
afaik the other tcus form other alliances were removed as well so it is no real favourism per se because the dt tcu onlining is kind of an exploit
to be honest its a simple matter that this has never been punished before the original punishment was to offline the tcus and then shock horror they accidently get destroyed and then rather than respawning the tcus offline in the systems the gms just shrug their shoulders and walk away from itit has never before been called an exploit see previous instances of this being done and the actions of the gms are suspect in the least
since when was the csm capable of running investigations i think you have misjudged there purpose and there reach to be honest they dont have access to the resources they need to do what you are suggesting they bring the issues we raise as the playerbase to ccp thats all
this test is acting like a toddler that did not get his binky and is now throwing a tantrum grow the  up  happens that you may not like over the course of your life throwing a tantrum like a 3 year old is not going to help your cause at all
again the point remains that the other tcus were only removed after petitionsi am happily awaiting the banning of market trading exploitation contract scammers and anyone who is using in game mechanics to gain an advantagedo you think this will happen well only if its a itbob petition
and thus proving op is a 
ok test alt please attempt to waste everyones time more in fact you should send an angry letter because nobody cares
tests were removed hours before the others the others were removed after test petitioned for fair treatment this tactic has been used for years and it wasnt a problem until it happened to an alliance that ccp has shown favoritism before
coming from sysfail no wait thats too easy im sure theres some kittens to drown around here it would be more challenging
cms has nothing to do with this test was using unfair advantage and they got punished end of story live with that or stop posting and quit the game goonstest always tried to  up the game they tired numerous times to use exploits etc
why bob alts are the best
hey it had a unfair advantage when the delve sov fell we demand a rollback
i would like to point out that contract scams are a built in mechanic and is works as intended however this whole tcu thing was not intended to be possible hence the onlining timer that allows counter attackwhen people find a way around that built in vulnerability then it sure as hell is an exploit
we used a game mechanic that every 00 alliance has used including it
wow really you mad dude nobody cares about your tempertantrum bashing someones alliance has nothing to do with it coming from someone who hides behind an alt if youd like ill post with a different alt is this what you want keep your thread on topic or keep flailing that seems to be working for ya to flail def to beat or thrash about uncontrollably
until test crawls out from under goons skirt and survives on its own no one will care about them except the members your alliance is a joke your leadership is a joke your membership is a joke you are a scar on the face of eve and i hope each and every one of you who spam petitioned gets permabanned for wasting gms time from other legit petitionsand before you say it yes i am mad that i have to shift through one alliances  posts all over the forums i know it is a cool story bro
sighno im not an alt i am an honest to goodness main dont beleive me check on bcparanoia  def you
this is such a nonevent despite the best efforts of test frankly nobody cares i certainly dont want the csm wasting its time poking about ccps cupboards c
people afraid of losing ships  decided to put the tcus up shortly before an extended downtime for patch maintenance knowing this was going to happen they circumvented a massive mechanic for claiming sovereignty and insodoing used an exploit to capture multiple systems without needing to field the appropriate fleets to defend their tcus quendishir
test is really making themselves look stupid and consistently demanding that everyone carerespond positively to their personal struggles would be entertaining if it wasnt so annoying if any of this was legitimate testgoons wouldnt be running around spammingtrolling our dead boring broken forums
obvious itbobkenzokugmdev alt trying to spin their crap
haha im no csm but heres my thought anyway you are both wrongaltho dropping the tcus before the extended downtime was kind of lame the systems were unclaimed there was nothing to defend per se it had no horse in this race it had no business crying fool over some systems they dont even fracking own
it was a nice try from test but dont whine when it doesnt work out as planned even my pet hamster understands that this is a reasonable decission from gms since normal gameplay limitations were evaded and my pet hamster is dead
obvious testgoonnc alt trying to spin their crap
the point is all the tcus that were removed were removed after petitions so where is the inconsistency
wow many of you folks are really stupidthe tcus were destroyed during the downtime the tcus setup by others in the same period were not destroyed until enough folks petitioned them and it was done two hours after the downtime ended so they were able to take advantage of them for a bitccp claims that this new rule is also retroactive do you have any idea how many alliances have used this in the past if ccp was truly going to apply this retroactively there would be thousands of systems lost as this was a huge game mechanic when patch downtime occursnot only that but ccp keeps iterating that this is only tcu related im not sure why using timers and patch downtime in other situations like timing a pos to come out of reinforcement during downtime or dropping many other types of structures is perfectly acceptable but as of the past few days tcus are not allowedthis is even more ridiculous because a gm actually has an alt in it the same gm that destroyed all of the tcus very suspicious that these tcus were immediately destroyed by a gm who has an it in the space where they were dropped and yet nothing happened to anyone else who dropped tcus at the sametime until a few hours after downtime
every alliance that has deployed sov stuff has used dt normal or extended to minimise the risks if putting an outpost up coincided with an extended dt then if you dont think that was used then i got a bridge for youtheyd have been dumb not toid be willing to bet that if test had put up maybe 2 or 3 tcus then this wouldnt have been any sort of issue at all fourteen is the problem anyone with half a brain can see test did it just to take the pss out of it andor ccptldr if youre going to use dodgy but accepted mechanics then dont rub ccps face in it by taking the pss if you do then this is what happens
moved from general discussion
all the tcu that were petitioned and found to have most of their onlining time fall in the extended dt have been taken care of the test ones destroyed were replaced by gms as were the funds for the sov fees the argument if there should be one at all is whether ccp should allow or continue to allow if you want to look at it that way the anchoring during extended dt or if this policy is fine either way theres no scandel here
so basically theyre at fault for not seeing the others when dotlan was flooded with 14 new systems i doubt ccp would have done anything if 12 systems were claimed after downtime yes downtime was abused predominion for pos timing and that sort of thing but you could still do something about it when the server came back up with 14 systems to sbu and shoot at for hoursthats a different storyi think what crossed the line was what i highlighted in my previous point there is a difference between timing reinforce timers for downtime and a tcu onlining abusing the extended downtime so there was nothing anyone could do about the onlining tcus unclaimed systems or not was what ccp saw and thus took action againstas for the other tcusthey were likely taken down later because it went unnoticed yours would have as well if you grabbed maybe 2 systems but hey lets all whine about an obvious flaw in the game mechanics that provide unfair advantages shall we
you sir have hurt my feelings i demand a apology immediately im crying at the keyboard and i think i may quit eve
more testy emo tears please makes eve somewhat interesting again and yeah epic idea to have the csm launch a fullscale investigation and demand from ccp to disclose all relevant facts related to this because we all know that is so gonna happen gl with that testygoonsshrubberiespubbies
you guys wanna know how i know you dont care everyone keeps posting about how they dont care
i dont see the problem looks like ccp were notified of people taking advantage and so fixed the problem after being notified of others doing the same thing they dealt with them tooif you do something knowing that you can get unintended benefits from it you should expect that theres always a chance that youll be caught there is however the issue of either ccp not being aware of this problem in the first place and if they were why was it allowed to continue
there is an issue here i have not been party or have first hand knowledge of the communication between test and gms however if what has been reported elsewhere is to be believed it has not been classified as an exploit rather it has been referred to as ingenious timing which have been giving players an unfair advantage i believe it was not even referred to as a true unfair advantage but just one of sortsgms i really am trying to stay on the correct side of the rules here but i realise that i can easily be faulted for overstepping my only question would be how shall the player base then ever be able to convey opinions between themselves  and to the cms  and have a meaningful discussion about gm actions the issue here is then not someone having used an exploit or anything of the likes test seems to have just had too much isk and their usual want for messing around ccp sells this game as a harsh place learn game mechanics and live by them if a rookie falls for a can flipper or baiter outside a rookie system too bad there is no reimbursement this in ccps view must then be fair but someone looking at a map and seeing a bunch of open systems checking a calendar and seeing downtime and acting upon it is unfair and unfair while not an exploit leads to intervention so this saved it alliance some hours of shooting tcus the question is was this the correct way to handle it would it have been better to take the rl approach and say that this act may or may not demonstrate a need for some new rules and if new rules are required make them valid for what is done from the time at which those rules are put into function was this really serious enough for the rule to be implemented not only for future cases but also to be utilised retroactively i dont have the answer for that but i believe that this kind of discussions are precisely the kinds that the cms need to address towards ccp if the organ shall have any justification on a personal note to tamber according to the transfer thread you are the new owner of that character why do you post with it argumentation has many ways to reach its potential argumentation is one and preexisting reputation another why do you utilise the latter when it isnt yours
sorry its still me 
then my sincere appologies and glad to have met you before you changed persona
i just wanted to say that in my ceos communication with the gm in question we could not get a solid answer as to how long before downtime is ok additionally in a petition from one of my other alliance members ccp grave failed to see the parallels between timing structures to online during downtimes extended or otherwise and timing pos to come out of reinforced during downtime i would post the logs but apparently that is not allowed on the eveo forumsthe long and short of it is that were not receiving any specific rules as to how this brandnew policy will be implemented which is frustrating to say the least how can we make strategic decisions without specific guidelines moreover how can a gm ensure his or her decision is just without some kind of outside measurement perhaps a timer which seems suspect to ccp lalouche would not seem suspect to ccp grave without a guideline who is to say which one is correct
probably because1 writing a program that check what percentage of a process is completed during dt and what percentage is completed outside dt with variable duration daily dt unexpected dt and programmed extended dt that can last for a longer or shorter period than the one scheduled is a nightmare2 because probably a program doing that will be so full of bugs and touch so many seemingly unrelated things that it would require months of patches to the patch that patch the patch before really functioning and a lot of developer time so it is better to let the gm handle the problem when someone petition and let the stuff stay if no one care about the onliningprobably after this the number of petitions for dt onlining will increase but the time the gm will spend on this will still cost less than the developer time required stop it changing the eve program
the idea that the gms should decide what form of onlining structures into downtime is egregious or not is ludicrous theres simply no difference between us onlining 14 tcus and someone onlining say a single small tower in contested low sec  or even hi sec  there should be hard rules that apply to everyone equallyyou can try and say that the 14 tcus are a bigger deal but they arent in small corp warfare a single tower is just as important to that small corp as the tcus were to a huge alliance rules are rules they cannot be arbitrarily decided they must be applied equally to allthat requires that the rules be stated and adhered to anything else is favoritism youre implying that one paying customer  a large alliance leader  is more important than another  a small or solo corp leader  they both pay the same amount per month

i see several people suggesting that the kitsune is more or less okay this is an understandable conclusion unlike many of the eafs it does work however this functionality is more a reflection upon the effectiveness of ecm than the ship it is an expensive t2 frigate that is only marginally better in some ways than its t1 counterpart while being actually worse in other critical ways that aside ew offers an opportunity to add real tactical depth to the game a fleet that elects to go this route should be every bit as effective as a fleet that goes for straight spank and tank and arguably even more
supported wanna hyena that is somewhat better than a vigil
this is a suggestion for what would be possibly a lot of work but i feel would be very well received within the community the suggestion is this1 first off all the pirate ships that are missing unique models should be given them ditch the reskins and make them their own hulls 2 replace the generic stations in pirate space with unique pirate stations this could be as simple as one pirate station for each race or as complex as each type of station having its own hull3 for each major trade hub and corporation and factional headquarters create a unique station like the roden centre itd be a lot of work but itd be amazing when done it would really give people some real reasons to go sightseeing provide some real landmarks to visit
do want been waiting for updated pirate station models since trinity
naturally the only time the sansha bandwagon with an angel is when they stand to benefit as welledit  comical smile addedi would think it be quite easy to convert some of the existing battlestations into pirate stations if war installations that imitate existing stations are any indication

i like this take on wardeccing the argument is not that the mechanic is broken but more that the prices are outdated with this i agree 100mil200mil means that you need to work to make it financially viable war is supposed to be expensive

thanks every1 for the support in this topic and for a lil bit of multimedia in the discussion follow the link to see exactly what i mean about avoiding obsticles and changing direction in warp and bare in mind the whole game runs smoothly on a 400mhz 64mb pentium 3 physics spacebattles n allindependance war 2  edge of chaos gameplaythe intro looks at cool things bout ship setup and changes u can make in space then the physics engine and how inertia is modeled into piloting in space225secs  shows u warp with manual control and its a  to control327secs  shows what i want to impliment autopilot controlled approach that aviods planetary bodiesthe rest is a lil bit of space  battling for u to enjoy 
1 letting your standing to the originator of a proposal bias your opinion on it is petty to say the least2 i never pushed a proposal on anyones behalf in fact i have voted against bad proposals from members on multiple occasions you demonstrate exactly what im trying to avoid just because im alliance whatever people assume i must be pushing personal agendas its inconceivable that im actually trying to make the game better
1 fyi the op and i dont even know each other and u dont have to take my word for it because even if i was lying that would be more reason to support this proposal anyway2 so how is it even the least bit conceivable that ure making the game better by trying to block this proposal on an alt u honestly think if u posted on your alt rather than your alliance main its better because of the stigma avoided which somehow makes it valid heres the thingregardless of whether or not theres an ulterior motive behind something if u give good support aka quality not quantity and refute the opposition aka not ignoring them it wont matter because even if u had an agenda the argument would still be valid therefore good posts give the associated party a good outlook while  posts reflect a bad outlook aka the stigma and thats why the only reason u would not post on your main is because u know its a  post with no valid arguments that would stigmatize your affiliation which can only lead back to the conclusion that ure trying to nerf others and buff yourselves with more trolling alts and we all know it as well so u can stop pretending its anything else at least with your main ull be held accountable and well know who the idiottroll really is maybe then ull think twice before making your affiliation look stupid and risking your removal from it the only thing demonstrated here is exactly why this proposal will truly make the game better and your continued selfdefeating attempts as well as others to derail this proposal only furthers it and these selfdefeating attempts range from accusing me of posting working in collusion with the op and the htfu after denying us the ability to hold their mains accountable which is admitting they cant handle the supposed risk of trolling in an internet spaceship forum despite hiding behind an entire alliance no less but plz continue to block an antitrolling proposal with more trollingits really convincingon our behalf
i do believe the orgianl proposalit has nothing to do with what you are ranting on aboutso please stay on topic with the ops proposal you have done nothing but troll and derail this thread
l2read and l2think stupid troll theres no difference at all whether its across one thread or multipleits still one char per account but thx for ignoring everything else with a stupid halfassed response like u always do way to represent your allianceagainso plz continueat least the other trolls can find some entertainment in a thread against them
no you are pushing for the main to post only the op states and posts with his alt to make a pointso yeah you get a 310 for trying
and obviously ure too stupid to figure out what that point was which is that alts can be abused to make something look better than it really is and thats why in order for ppl to see the good points they have to sort through the clutter of garbage something u clearly have no trouble creating way to talk out of your assso yeah u get a 1010 for trying cause many other trolls fail less than u
u madbecause you really sound mad if you have to resort to using terms like stupid ass and to try to brow beat someone that opposes your stance you are proving your self too inept to actually argue your point and you should not be one to articulate some elses point of view
and yet it describes a troll like u perfectlyconversely u have to resort to ignoring everything else u cant troll including refutes nitpick on trivial or imaginary issues to derail the topic and best of all u cry over namecalling after u already cried tard furthermore u accuse others of what ure doing aka hypocrisy and last but not least uve done all of the above in one single post the real question would ber you madcause u sound really mad ps if u think trollingraging on your main will magically absolve everyone else who trolls on their 3alts x account total think againits not and for u to try this hard in doing so especially without any merit behind your ranting can only lead to the conclusion that ure probably one of them as well so plz continue some more as a lesson in futilityits pretty entertaining
you are demonstrating the behavior you claim you wish to stop you incessant rantings of self importance is leading down a dark path of fail stop now and repent
deleted for double posting
or what ull troll some more cause thats all u know how to do ok do unto others as they would do unto u u troll me i troll u the fact is weve made our point well u and the other trolls to be exact and uve got nothing cause no matter what u do it doesnt change the lack of content in other threads infested by trolling alts uve already lostthats why its futile and stupid for u to even try your move
there are three that i know of that do not make any sense and may have been posted beforefirstly jump bridge do not allow alliance member to use it unless they have a password and to make it worse its not a different password and has to use the same as the pos shieldsit should have a settingsallow use for corpalliancestandingspassword use for corpalliancestandingssecondly bubbles and points stop people from jumping now considering that the bridges are meant to act like gates why does pointing a non aggressed ship stop it from jumpingit just seems really weirdlastly jump bridges dont take fuel from your cargo which is a bit of a hassle for some people as you dont know exactly how much fuel you need and then have to put that amount fuel into the bridge
absolutely its about time that every jb doesnt require you to reenter a password gates are different from bridges and i dont really have a problem with prohibiting ships from using a bridge if it cant activate its warp drive bridges are more like jump drives anyways and you cant jump out if youre scrammed there should be some sort of script that the server runs that checks the jb itself for fuel and if it doesnt find it looks in the ship thats activating it and asks the pilot if he wants to use x units of lo to jump through
i support allowing jbs to have a separate password from pos shields at the very leastin regards to the not knowing how much fuel you need to jump there actually is a formula for it but it involves knowing the distance of the jump in order to calculate the fuel required
lastly jump bridges dont take fuel from your cargo which is a bit of a hassle for some people as you dont know exactly how much fuel you need and then have to put that amount fuel into the bridgeyes please the rest of your idea is garbage
im very aware of it but there isnt an easy to work it out in game which is more of the problem unlike jump fuel it varies dependant on the ship you are flyingyour entitled to your own opinions
absolutely its about time that every jb doesnt require you to reenter a passwordit just occured to me you have spent about 5 pages on the other jb thread claiming i wanted easy mode for eve because i wanted to have alliance only use of jbs
youre not particularly good at drawing logical conclusions
i just thought it was a little funny
mmm hmmmmhilariously funny why your desire for easy mode is totally the same thing as not wanting to have to hit g5 g6 g7 etc for the various bridges getting rid of a minor annoyance is the same as your desire for easy mode perceptive yep
if you still cant see why this would be in a problem after all this timewell for one im certainly not going to convinse you there are two answers you are just being stuborne or you have just not played from outside a supercoalition in a long long timeyeh whats the problem why dont you just put supercaps in a system two times into a system one time while people are expecting it to destroy a jb which can be put right back up again against someone who can field at least 56 times the numbers of supercaps and 1020 times the number of support most other groups can
yet again called it and this is the same basic problem as before some people want to play the game and understand that if theyre unable to fight effectively against a large group of people then either they need to adapt to that situation like say burn eden has done spectacularly or they need to find an area of the game where the dynamic is different like smallgang roaming they understand that and the enemy might have more guys is not a gameplay mechanics problem that suggests that they run to the assembly hall and demand that ccp save them thats because they understand the game understand how cooperation and combat works and understand that theyre the only ones responsible for their success or failure in the game other people dont get that at all if they dont have the resources or tactics to compete against a much larger group of people then ccp needs to save them and alter the game specifically to help them that this so often happens to be tied to antithispowerblocorthatpowerbloc trolling is of course coincidental of course when youre arguing the logis are broken because some people may be able to field more than you areand poss are broken because defenders may be able to field more than you are and triage carriers are broken because defenders may be able to field more than you are with a support fleet larger than you can field and pos modules are broken because defenders may be able to field more people than you are and jump bridges are broken because defenders may be able to field more than you are well its probably a good hint that the problem isnt really with game mechanics at all
fallacious reasoning ftw jbs are ed to the point that any lemmming can do freighter runs on its own i get you enjoy trolling miningin fine but right now you look like a total douche nullsec shoudnt be the place for the lazys playing easy mode and you perfectly know it
using words you dont understand ftl but please explain which specific logical fallacy you allege has been committed go for it also worth noting is that you only pretended to answer what i actually posted and then changed the subject thatd be the fallacy of non sequitor btw i was discussing minis consistent arguments for why he is impotent to effect change in evecounter enemiesincap modsdestroy possetc and why they miss the point and deliberately obscure the fact that there is supposed to be choice in this game and if youre unable to play a certain style then you can choose another one rather than demanding that ccp save you and alter the game so you dont have to make any choices you tried to change the subject to an argument that jump bridges are somehow easy mode because a freighter can jump through them of course while never explaining why the ability to use a jumptitan bridge is easy mode fallacy of begging the question most likely because there was nothing you could say other than the bare assertion and it makes no sense that a carrier being able to jump is totally in line with game mechanics but other ships using the same exact game mechanics are just horrible horrible proving that you have no idea how the game actually works a freighter can do runs on its own of course this is as absurd as the claim that its risk free to jump blind into a bridgecyno system the number of times that neutsreds have had a single cyno scout post up on a bridge and then bridged in a dreadsupercarrier to kill a freighterjump freightercarrier simply goes to show that not only do you not have a clue what youre talking about but youre using your fictions and ignorance of the game as a club indeed which is why i object to your ignorancebased trolling and nonsense about how being able to jump blind into a potential ambush is easy mode
ok well i said supercaps to demonstrate how ridiculously easy it is to incap and destroy the bridge without even bothering with a reinforcement timer it is very possible as i have seen it done many timesi have also been with a team of stealth bombers several times which took out large deathstar pos so if you want super easy mode then yes you can do it with supercaps or with a bit more skill a group of people in cheap bombers can take it out as welleither way there are plenty of ways to deal with a pos whether you are a super alliance or a single corp all you have to do is use a bit of your brain to come up with a solution
come now people have been trying to educate mini for literally days now on why his problem isnt a problem at all and both poss and jbs can be dealt with it hasnt worked so far largely id wager because minis argument is based around his claims that since he cant accomplish certain things in eve ccp has to save him and alter the game specifically so he doesnt have to make any choices folks have also pointed out that if you want to be able to challenge a large group of people in eve you have to be capable of fighting them and if youre not you need to make the choice to do something else or to adapt and find viable tactics mini doesnt want that he doesnt want to have to choose between smallgang and largescale warfare he wants to be able to challenge thousands of people working together and if theyre able to as hes complained raise a larger fleet than he is than he wants ccp to simply remove the structures that hed otherwise have to fight over so he no longer has to make the choice and ccp simply punishes his enemies since he cant do it with his guns
you are awesome thx mate
and youre trolling please stop mate you ignored the fact that you alleged a fallacy but cant point one out indeed you ignored that and tried to change the subjectyou ignored the fact that being able to jump to remote locations with structurestitansjump drives is a specifically designed feature and game mechanics working as intended indeed you ignored that and tried to change the subject now inexplicably youre trolling on the point that being able to jump blind into a potential ambush is hardly easy mode and is in fact a very good way to lose an expensive ship and its cargo evidently jumping blind through a gate is also easy mode and naturally you ignored that and tried to change the subject
this is litteraly what has happend in this threadi say something along the lines of  jumpbridges promote an unfununmanagable style of playyou say  jump bridges can be dealt withi say  not in a funeffectivemanagable way that is to say they promote unfununmanagable style of playyou say  ive addressed your issues they can be dealt withok good luck with that
again mini you lack basic understanding of what youre arguingand again you are pretending that you are the emperor of fun and only you get to define what fun is likewise if youre impotent to effect a specific change it must be not just unmanageable but an allcaps barrage of screaming that it is unmanageable even when people try to educate you on perfectly effective counters you resist even when people point out that if you cant handle dealing with poss then the answer is to choose to do something else in eve or adapt and find tactics that dont fail and instead your reaction is that ccp needs to alter the game in order to save you and yes that is exactly whats been going on during the entire thread you argue for your own ingame impotence when it comes to effecting any sort of change people try to point out that youre not as powerless as you want to claim and that even if you were that there are other things in eve you can do and you again just loop back to arguing for how powerless you are to effect change
you are ridiculous just because you say something doesnt make it true i challenge you to to take a 45 man gang as you have suggested and go hit the delve jb networklooking forward to your results oh and the fun you have doing it remember to give a big cheer when you are done reinforcing it
ah i see youre ignoring all the actual counters posted and still arguing for your own ingame impotence this is novel and unexpected likewise you are again arguing for an antichoice position where a 45 man group should definitely be able to challenge much larger forces and ccp has to save them if they cant rather than groups chosing their engagements based on what they can accomplish and the tactics they have figured out again the emperor of fun speaking ex cathedra about what people can and cant enjoy and how they should and shouldnt play the game and why ccp needs to directly intervene and save him so he doesnt have to adaptthank you emperor thank you
personally i think it is you and your alliance that is ridiculous the other day i was going to jump my jf to seed a low sec market and your 30 man hydra gang spent the best part of an hour chasing and camping my cyno alt around low sec and smacking when she docked up great eh all that effort to try and gank a probe with no weaponsnow you talk about taking down a full regions jump bridges with a 45 man gang if that is your method you are doing it wrong 45 man gang in supercarriers would have no problem hell even 1 supercarrier makes short work of a poswe now get onto the thing that i wanted to mention you had an alliance that could in effect cause headaches for major space holding alliances 1500 man if i remember correctly but you couldnt resist scamming them for as much as you could this is why you cant have nice things nobody wants to help you cos you are unreliable and pettylive with it
say it for me seiging poses and jbs is fun otherwise i think im relatively safe in my assumptionand no thats not a friggin counter that is the cause of the problem having to drop 45 scs to down a jb is encouraging giant numbers the server cant handle in the event such a thing happenswether to save your own or to kill people who do that to youif there was a counter that didnt require you to drop giant numbers or scs on jbs then sure this isnt related to the problem of leading towards the game being more and more laggy with more and more problems with less and less funbut as it is your counter is directly related to the problem that ccp greyscale was underlining and that is that the jb networks lead further away from a playablemore frequently engagablemore sandboxyeach player has a real impact as opposed to a lag impact gameand as such it is not about crying about the counter but saying that your counter is part of the problem
this makes no sense pl and the russians have just proved how effective a sc gang is at destroying infrastructure just because you have not got that capability and are unable to have it due to your alliance reputation of unreliability and scamming who would want to join an alliance with a sc alt when they dont know wether they are going to be killed by their own alliance mates or not or have their sc stolen does not mean the mechanic is broken as i said live with it your alliance screwed the pooch
the same errors over and over and over and over and over its like your argument is trapped in one of the lower circles of hell as usual readers should note that mini is lying and has invented yet another quote that doesnt actually exist yah its just a thing you can do ingame following ingame mechanics that are working as designed that allows you to effectively deal with and neutralize opposition oh wait that is exactly what a counter is but because it shows youre totally wrong youre going to try to ignoreitaway now youre just making things up 45 people in system why thats nearly a number that the server just cant handle and of course your whine isnt even really about jbs its just another handy issue youve found to try to hammer on any group thats larger than the one you find yourself in the same objection you have to jbs zomg someone might defend them is the same youd have to poss in general moon mining capital ship construction drug manufacture research poss the argument is again why you demand that youre powerless within the game and why ccp has to deliberately alter the game to save you rather than you just finding something youre good at and doing that instead small numbers via supers thats horriblelarge numbers via a regular fleet thats horriblemoderate numbers via a bomber gang thats horrible ccp altering the game so that people who cant manage to counter poss dont have to awesome yes it is is crying about the counters plus saying that being able to actually do things in eve is a problem but that having ccp fix things so that you dont have to actually do anything to compete with larger forces is a solution
i dont think you get hydra alliance and i bet you got scammed by themyou guys have spent the better part of the thread saying that we can not dictate how people play this game yet the only thing dictating 00 politics atm is the ability to just form these giant napfestssomeone was saying the other day at the start of the game it should give you an option coalition a or coalition b  thats what your sandbox game is coming down toand im pretty sure if you had any clue about whats going on in eve atm you would know why pl is having success perhaps more than they otherwise would be having should things be slightly different im not sure why people are pretty stoked that to accomplish anything in this game you must have at least 50 scs and this is their evidence for how things arnt broken
good grief you simply do not understand the game at all in other words while you refuse to adapt and demand that ccp alter game mechanics to save you other people are pointing out that players themselves being able to work in concert and carve out player created and player run empires in 00 is game mechanics functioning as designed youre actually arguing that having to play in an mmo with other people oh no who define how conflict will play out is the problem and instead getting the game developers to specifically modify the game so that you dont have to actually manage to compete with superior forces well thats the solution twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe again arguing for your own ingame impotence and youre surprised that youre unable to accomplish things of course youre not required to live in 00 spaced youre not required to participate in largescale sov warfare if you do youre not required to join any coalition at all but youre unable andor unwilling to adapt so you believe that the correct course of action is for ccp to save you and remove the levels of choice we already have in the game ahh the delightful i cant come up with effective tactics therefore you are bad at eve plus some gobbledy about why pl is having success should things be slightly different again you are screaming in all caps to hide the fact that you have no point at all you can accomplish a great many things without supers you are whining that you want to be able to engage in conflict with entities many times your size but you dont want to actually have to do whats required to fight them so youd rather that ccp just alter the game to save you but of course youd prefer to lie and claim that people cannot do anything in the game at all except engage in large scale conflicts in nullsec
lol no i didnt get scammed by them a simple bait and switch is easy to see my point is that you are unreliable and vindictive and although you had the chance to be a contender and take the big boys on ypu blew it for iskies anybody in their right mind with a suitably skilled character will not join you for that reason due to that you are crying because you cant compete and want the game dumbed down to your levelwhy dont you go and scam someone over it or spend 30 man hours chasing a weaponless probe who by the way had a whale of a time avoiding you and laughing at your incompetence blob much btw you are guilty of doing exactly the same to the noobs and small corps as the bigger boys do to you and nobody wants to join you because of your attitude and reputation so carry on with your 1337 pvpthat would be the reason you are posting in green jealous much
thread cleaned please refrain from running personal attackstrolling in this thread
im not sure if your issue is with my argument about jbs or with hydra allianceit seems like you are trying to disprove what i am saying by saying ah you are in hydra alliance well not only does this have no relevance at all but i would point out that i have only been in hydra for a couple of days and for the record im not sure if any hydra guys are vindictive or bitter towards space holding entities from what ive seen of them they really dont give a  what the rest of eve is doing they are just doing what suites themand for the record i think they are p chill about how they play the game not that i always see eye to eye with all of them but i just dont see how your rant about hydra alliance at all nullifies and again i will restate my positioneverything about jumpbridges encourages larger coalitions to hold more space which is going unused which in turn promotes less fights more blobby fights where the server often struggles less emphasis on the player which i thought eve was meant to be about this encouragement of this style of play is of detrement to the majority of the communityinsistance that jumpbridges can be countered by shooting them is not really a logical rebutal to this because it is one of the aspects in which jbs encourage the style of gameplay we are seeing more and more ofif your argument is that i find it fun to shoot posses and lag out all the time you cant dictate what is fun for me then ok i cant argue against that really but i doubt the majority of people shooting these posses and sitting through this lag are enjoying it because we hear so much complaining about it from the people doing it btw not from me because you know i dont do that im more the guy that is complaining that other people are complaining and nothing is being done highfive
personally i dont go on pos ops because they do not interest me but i do know how easy it is for a smallish corporation to wreak havoc with a few scs on a large alliances infrastructures and they really enjoy that type of gameplayif i had a sc i would enjoy doing it also i also get great satisfaction from camping hostile jump bridges and with a small group using the right mechanics you can rack up a hell of a lot of isk damage on jump bridge using alliances very easilynow we come onto your last point that your alliance enjoys the way they play well kudos to you the large space holding alliances also enjoy the way they play as do the sc pilots that can wreak havoc on a large alliance with so few fleet memberswhat you forget is that so not long ago you were using the tactics that have been described to deny other alliances the use of their jump bridges but hydra decided that it was better to scam their member base than to seriously use the numbers to get results so you are as guilty as the aforementioned superblobs you have used the same tacticsjump bridges create excellent pvp potential to all types of pvpers the alliance that owns them can use them to cut off and pincer a roaming gang the attackers can rf them and so coral the defenders into a situation of their choosing and campers can get bucketloads of idiots to gank with a bit of pre planning what is their not to likeyour argument about ease of logistics is non sequitur also it improves the possibilities of supply line destabilisation when freighter runs were the norm it was extremely hard to break these up unless you had overwhelming force so point in mute there you still needed force in numbers nowadays you get the ruperts jumping into unscouted systems solo what isnt there to like about thatwith a little pre planning you can use an enemies jump bridge network to your advantage it increases the possibilities of pvp
hrm so theyd find their own thing to do that they enjoy and they wouldnt feel the need to demand that the entire game proceed according to their wishes and their views of how things should go and if they werent suited to a specific type of warfare they wouldnt do that and would instead do what suits them rather than starting a thread in the assembly hall demanding that anybody who cant match larger numbers be helped by ccp so that they dont have to match themthey sound okay nonsensical rambling not only without support but hilariously autorefuting if coalitions are holding space in order to plant jbs then that space is being used again unable to find a way to make an impact on your own youd prefer that ccp directly help you by altering the workingasintended game mechanics that you dont enjoy to say nothing of the fact that you simply dont get eve for the love of all thats simple and easy to understand eve is an mmo eve is an mmo in which a huge swath of territory was designed specifically so that groups could claim it and hold it as theirs faced with the fact that the game is working exactly as it was designed with emergent behavior dependent on the players interactions youd rather have ccp just alter things so you can play on easy mode thats not eve you obviously understand neither the concepts of logic nor a rebuttal pointing out that it is easy to counter jbs as long as youre semicompetent shows that nothing actually needs to be changed likewise whining about jbs is really just yet another one of your backdoor attempts to have ccp help you by altering game mechanics you dont like there is no functional difference between attacking a jb pos or a staging pos or a moon mining pos etc etc etc your real argument is with the fact that there exist assets in the game that can be defended with more force than youre capable of bringing thats the game working as intended if you bring a knife to a gunfight you end up perforated just a suggestion but dont try to sum up others arguments youre rather bad at it to say nothing of how your bizarre emperor of fun routine doesnt make any sense anyways flying dozens of jumps manually isnt fun but there you dont care about that because you hate jbs you are naturally rather selective with what type of fun you want to champion and go figure it just so happens to be when that fun lines up with changes that youve already wanted and while youre looking for rationalizations to support themim sure thats just a coincidence also not fun having to wait 60 days for capital ships v just give it to me right now having to grind isk to pay for new ships just give me free ships having to schlep ships half way across empire to forward staging areas using freighter run after freighter run to transport dozens of rigged ships give me jbs in empire etc etc etc come on emperor of fun at least be consistent
trying to change the subject again coupled with the nonsense and alreadyrebutted claim that somehow being able to use jump bridges creates big conflicts youve already had your ignorance cleared up its already been explained to you that setting up a forward deployment zone is hardly effected by the dastardly nine jumps of doooooooom you seem not to be listeningps as always readers should be sure to check anything and see if it actually says anything even remotely similar to the nonsense that mini is spewing just like his faked greyscale quote above that he didnt acknowledge but simply kept rolling on heptamerons lament in particular was over sever instability in a conflict that had absolutely nothing to do with the invading force being helped by jump bridges nothing at all its a totally unrelated point thats simply included so that mini can troll the nc yet again
way to miss the point personally i feel that this topic is in the wrong forum it should have been in the ideas section and then it would be suitable to be discussing iti agree with finnagain you do not seem to be capable to think outside the box to realise that jump bridges actually increase small gang pvpbut then again you are not after that are you your thinly disguised troll is an attempt to buff your preferred method of km whoring by using your superior numbers in risk free environments
jumpbridges do save time but they also do things like allow you to run and manage a much larger coalition of blues with far less trouble further there is more reason to blue people with established jb networks etc being able to run massive coalitions with relative ease and safety with more reasons to be good friends clearly promotes the style of play your fcsleadersmembers are complaining about and im hardly changing the subject im not going to spend an hour each time you say this is just rambling telling you its not and why its not when you will just repeat the very next post this is just rambling so instead i am arguing the core basic points of what i believe in the hope you can actually look at them without saying well i dont need to answer this because it doesnt relate to jumpbridges my point is about the style of play and how jumpbridges are one contributing factor dont get me wrong there are other things that should be looked at but i think jbs are a good place to start as i feel they were hardly a necessary addition to begin withnow theres all this talk about how you can effectively camp bridges with small numbers and what not ill have you know that i am well aware of this and the nc knows about these tactics largely because of my excorpsbope escapades
erm no jbs do not intrinsically allow anybody to manage anything let alone less trouble what do you mean by that im not complaining and im sure the fcsleadersmembers of the affected alliances are not complaining either just seems to be you plenty of smaller alliances like the idea of jbs also you dont have to be a behemoth alliance to have and use a jb networknow that is rambling
i dont see how a coalition force being able to use the same instant travel options wouldnt be more managable than having to sort out each alliances options individually threads i have linked above come from mostly coalitions most of them from the nc so i can tell you they are complaining they just arnt blaming ccp for the right reasons being their mechanics encourage the game to break also what i am saying is along the lines of if person x is living far away from empire or wants to break into 00 or something of the sort there is far more reason to blue and keep blue someone whos travel networks allow you to move faster to where you want to go etc etc one of the suggestions in this thread was yes ok jbs are here it is unlikely they will be removed so a way of slightly drawing them back would be to relate their use to the alliance you belong to this would maintain a benefit for them even should your alliance not be a behemoth i mean yes there are unforseen issues such as alliances starting to trade systems to extend their networks and such which can all be looked at in time but for now i think its important that people start to consider things like thisi hope this answers the questions you raisedbut i really must insist that small camps of jumpbridges are hardly devestating to coalitions and do not deter the overall encouragement of the jb system in reinforcing a strong coalition system in eve
really the subject was serverside lag in the max campaign no go figure of course you are impervious to facts as well youve had it explained to you over and over and over why jbs do not do any of the nasty things youve claimed from making bigger coalitions to well whatever other fantasy youve tried to sell but you keep repeated the same debunked nonsense over and over and over because you cant simply admit youre wrong total nonsequitor which is of course your plan as youre trying yet again to change the subject when its pointed out that of course there are easy ways to counter andor farm jbs now it also has to be a way to cut off a significant percentage of jb traffic with a small gank squad on a bridge i dont think even you believe this nonsense anymore if its such a crucial point one wonders why you deliberately refrain from understanding it there is nothing inherent in being able to take a bridge that makes for larger numbers youve had this explained to you time and again but like i said facts bounce off you like bullets off of superman again facts bounce off you with no effect at allyou dont even realize that youre refuting your own argument as you babble because you dont care about what makes sense youre just trying to rationalize a reason for ccp to give you easy mode if coalitions take space to put up jbs then theyre using that space how it is that youre unable to understand that theyre using that to put up a jb network doesnt contradict theyre not using it is welland of course large powers have always had tenetsrentersslavespetswhatever the idea that groups only control their sphere of influence now that there are jbs is risible for its sheer ignorance quotient again unable to accomplish something with your guns you want ccp to intervene directly to help you and give you easy mode your lack of logical insight is truly stunning all other things being equal two people will beat one person four people will beat two people ten people will beat five people the idea that alliances wont want to work with other alliances to increase their combat capabilities on offense and defense is well it shows the very strange lack of understanding that all of your arguments do and this is yet another reason why you simply do not understand eve you want ccp to save you you need ccp to give you easy mode even if your massive nerf goes through and groups gasp adapt and overcome youll still want that looked at because your goal isnt any of the obfuscation youve used to sell it its just to hurt anybody bigger than your bunch whos actually able to project force and who you cant counter without ccps help alliances cooperating and sharing bridges nerf bridges alliances trading space so they can each set up their own jb networks that has to be looked at so we can see how we can nerf that too
a strong coalition in eve terms does not come from having an uber jb network or by any infrastructureit comes from solid leadershipgood fcs and clearly defined goals and directionremoving jbs from game would not affect the oh so human condition of strength in numbersyou are barking up the wrong tree small gang warfare is becoming vogue again it is healthy all across eve space holding under sovereignty is available to all from the largest group to the smallest just the requisites differ
all other things being equal two people will beat one personfour people will beat two people ten people will beat five people the idea that alliances wont want to work with other alliances to increase their combat capabilities on offense and defense is well it shows the very strange lack of understanding that all of your arguments doaside from this you continue to say stuff like you just dont understand logic without actually saying why those things dont make sense and if you do provide any reasoning its along the lines of its already been debunked which is a word you seem to either love using or throw around without much understanding of its meaningbut for the time being i will look at the point i believe you raisedyes there is always insentive to work with other entities but i think that insentive has gone well beyond the primal stick together instict ccp by introducingimplementing things such as jbstitan bridges has said yes we will make it easier for people to work together this is the wrong way to go about it i think if people want to work together that is always going to happen but i fail to see the need to make it even easier to do if it is the natural thing to do anyway because while this is a game ccp should be encouraging a more fun model of play im not saying people wont band together if there arnt so many insentives to do so but i think fewer people may further i think if real teretorial greed is reintroduced eg some regions worth total bank and other regions will run you into the red more entitys may be ready to play their hand and see what they drawnow none of this is a this will fix eve forever type of thing this is just a lets get things headed in the direction of a fun game rather than where its headed now where it is encouraged by game mechanics not only by human nature to try cram as many people onto your bluelist as possiblealso i think youll find that people do at the very core want to have funbecause at the core of it they do know this is a game and the only reason they are so insistant on having this many blues is because it is so reinforced by all the game mechanics just how massive an advantage you can recieve if you do get into these supercoalitions i mean i can ask you a simple question to tell you why it is people will put aside their fun do you want to lose more often than you do nowjust what it comes down to i thinkbtw i need to say this again it seems i am not saying a jb network is what makes a coalition no im saying it makes it stronger and gives more reasons to joincontinue to be in a supercoalition
ok i just read on that other jb thread this from you finnagain absolutely its about time that every jb doesnt require you to reenter a passwordthen as i said there it occured to me that you have spent a lot of time here claiming i want easy mode i was originaly ignoring this because of how ridiculous it sounds because i really thought it seemed apparent what was easier joining a giant coalition or trying to do something elsebut then it occured to me that it is actually an inconsistency with your argument and a rather big oneyou spend half your time saying that jbs dont make a difference  wont make a difference if they are nerfed and the rest of your time saying i just want easy mode like there is a pretty basic contradiction there in that should you honestly believe its not a big deal yourself it wouldnt make this game any easier for me at all now lets ignore for a second that this change probably wouldnt make this game too much easier for mebecause i will likely still not get involved in 00 stuff beyond small roams and take it is a big part of your longrunning argument in which all i wanted to do was make it easier for me to take your space or somethingdoes it not make a difference or are you worried things will get harder for you which i have long assumed is the reason you are trying to deflect this off as something that will make things easier for other people that need savingi mean lets face it if as you say jbs arnt any of what i have said and you have spent the better part of the thread downplaying them youve got no worries i say bring on the change so you can keep winning
uningrealyou just quoted the entire paragraph in which i explained why you dont understand the logic involved and why your formulation ignored basic game mechanicshuman naturemath as trolling goes this is particularly lame if you dont understand what words like refuted or debunked mean you can ask alleging that pointing out all your refuted arguments somehow means that other people dont understand the words is risible already refuted if coalitions wanted they could just trade systems to set up allianceonly jb networks and put their titans in each others poss to set up bridging chains too to say nothing of the fact that this is yet again only your subjective opinion with no value other than the novelty of knowing what you think about how groups ought to work together ah back to the emperor of fun and of course as long as there are objectives worth fighting over people will gather in numbers to attack and defend them and as your claims about jbs being novel in any way in that context have all been refuted youre now at the point in your argument where you simply repeat things that have long since been debunked as for your nonsense about why your proposal is a troll for you to find a way to hamstring those people who are actually able to work in teams but would still be functionally impotent and so it shouldnt be opposed well like i keep saying you draw conclusions like a blind man on meth draws accurate portraits hey let me paint your bmw tiedye so it goes faster thats that the dumbest thing ive ever heard no and it wouldnt even make it go faster well if it wouldnt have any real effect then why wont you let me do it thats a pretty big contradictionyour mother fed you paint chips as a child didnt she
irrelevant you dont know logic game mechanics or human nature
removing or nerfing jbs will not reduce coalition size periodwhy would ityes it would impact on their gameplay but it would not reduce that alliances member base why would anyone leave a large alliance just because they have no jbs where are they going to go to another alliance with less members with shock no jbsas i have already mentioned jb networks have nothing to do with the size of a member base that comes from other aspects look at my post above for those reasons you attract new players to your alliance by making sure you follow those three rules alongside others that are not as determining andwhich are not mutually exclusive you have a vested interest you like small fast roaming gangs and want moar targets for your style of playtransparent much
people dont want to fly 60 manual jumps to have funlimit their ability to derive the benefit of being 60 jumps away from hostile territory while also deriving the ability to get out of those 60 jumps with ease all the while not having to actually hold anything themselves and i suspect people will start to fight each other for funive heard the line used when tri was blobbed out of the north a few times you were the only game in town well two things if it wasnt about winning and greed would have been pretty smart to leave that only game in town and not blob the  out of it but more related to this its a choice that is becoming easier to makethe only game in town is getting closer and closer because of jbs stopping people from saying hmmmm this is an interesting dilema there is no one to shoot within 60 jumps because i have everyone set blue could this be a problem for my memberbaseps yes there being more targets in 00 is a pretty good thing for pvpers i dont see why this isnt meant to be transparent does this mean the limiting of such mechanics would only benefit me
i support changing jump bridges i also wish the few nc mains and alts who seem to be the few against the idea give it a rest and let some others speak we all know that your coalition would seriously struggle with jump bridge limitations but please let some others speak i for one would like to see the upkeep cost of networks increased greatly to the point where when anyone not in your alliance using the jb simply makes the upkeep so costinefficient that you are forced the find other means of travel and either one of the following 1 limiting 1 jump bridge per constellation or 2 jbs cannot be anchored 5km outside a pos make them only anchorable at a celestialone last thing that i dont like caps can use a jump bridge to get into a cynojammed system
either remove jbs or make it so that anyone with the pw can use them pretty much if i cant have it nobody can
someone trolling the nc in a mini thread whatre the odds which is exactly how they were designed so that the defenders would have the advantage and be able to get their capital ships into a cyno jammed system feature working exactly as intended but let me guess if you cant muster a fleet to get in and incap a cyno jammer then jbs have to be removed for fun
i support that there needs to be renovations to current jb systemsits wayy to far easy to move stuff around i dont care on the blue system but put a better limit on how muchoften they can be usedas to it breaking sov no itll just force alliances to have smaller space which i believe is a positive as it gets more alliances in nullsec
dear piloteersi know this is an old discussion but i personally believe that the wardec mechanic for high sec needs many revisions nevertheless as 90 of eve makes its money by either running high sec missions plexes or some other pve stuff then old game mechanics need to be updated to the current pvp avoidance and rampant pve isk farming of todaytherefore i propose that the wardec mechanics be shifted to a more reasonable form1 a corp can now wardec another corp for the standard price regardless whether either is in an alliance  the alliance whos corp has a wardec placed against it can then choose if they wish to honor their alliance and adopt the wardec across the entire alliance there is no additional cost to either party as a result of this action if the wardecing corp is a member of an alliance and has its war against another corp adopted by that corps entire alliance the wardecing corps alliance can do the same and adopt the war at no additional cost2 any character that leaves a corp during a wardec may not return to that corp for twice as long as the war remained active thus if a war lasted 3 weeks a character that left during that war may not rejoin until 3 weeks after the war is ended3 any character leaving a corp during a war must also pay a declaration of neutrality fee equal to the cost to fully insure their clone the player now has a cool down period of one month where any further declarations of neutrality multiply in cost in exactly the same way as multiple wardecs the cool down period being extended after each declarationthe other costs can be left the same or reduced maybe the multiplier for additional wardecs has a cap on how much a war can cost somewhere between 3 and 5 times the base costthe reasons whya cost of war declaration shouldnt be a barrier to empire wars the cost of war comes from buying and losing war materials not making a declaration of intentb players are avoiding wars by switching corps a cost needs to be added to that in both isk and inconveniencec instead of alliances being majorly a nice tactical and social tool to enhance game play and player politics it has in some instances become a means to simply avoid wardecs from smaller corps and paupers due to increased cost not as it ought to be the added security of allied corps to fight alongside in the event of war and this is trueeverything else can remain the same for now
so essentially you want low cost targets that cant avoid you no
some guy called frug i think it was brought up another issue with wardecs over at features and ideas regarding issues for people that like to shoot towersso an addition to the proposal would be corps leaving an alliance at war would now have a 48 hour period where the war continues previously 24 hours
this wardecs are broken no one would disagree with you there but all your suggestion does is multiply whats broken about them making them even worse than they are now
i like this but then lets make the standard price 2 trillion isk to make it fairthis is sandbox gamenot pvp in highsec because i have no balls to go to lowsec
lets see are costs of war in highsec to high 2 millions against a corp doesnt looks like it 50 million against an alliance also not very much so from the financial perspectiv its cheap maybe even too cheapwhat happens during highsec wars most of the time the mighty pvper hunt in wolf packs against lonely targets if they encounter a force that could be a thread for their precious ships and killboard statistics they start to play docking games very tactical very skillfulmy guess would be that funding is not the real problem in highsec when it comes to war
i say gambling is a go but only in lowsec because the empires outlaw it itd be a nice way to boost traffic there also maybe even extend it to say that gambling can only be done by bartering hauledin boostersother illegal goods to make it really illicit and seedysome kind of unique functionality for playerowned stations would be interesting perhaps alliance  corp monuments you could build  tear down and continuing the gambling idea the ability to run the casino  host tournamentssome way to leave local would be interesting if youre not in a ship it doesnt make much sense that youd still need to show up  be talking to people there does itmaybe a minigame for running locates for yourself or others or minigames for industry making building  researching more interesting
they actually had an arena on singularity for a few days a year or so ago it was basically whatever ship youre in now vs some ai enemies but it never worked so they removed it just thought id mention it
the only thing i would add to this and i like all of the suggestions is minigames lots of minigames minigames that dont necessarily require gambling with isk it would make a good dent in the stationspinning time waiting for skills to train up
all good ideas id like to see it open up the underbelly of society with blackmarket jobs board and contracts hidden agents instation missions like steal the decryptor free the slave assassinate the cfo of a corp and the like specifically eve is in a unique position to provide instation content that star wars and star trek cannot since there are no rules in eve i guess it will mostly depend on if the devs are just making a lounge for capsuleers or if they are going to provide a immersive extension of content if they do opt to create instation missions i have tons of cool ideas
quite simply the ability to see what is outside the station to a radius of 100km so you dont have to partake in silly docking games if it turns out youre being camped
the feature id like is for the project to be cancelled so that the enormous amount of our money being wasted on this could be redirected into development of eve online the spaceship themed mmothanks in advancethis is a good example of a feature that definitely should not be in incarna but absolutely should be in evei dont want to have to session change out of the spaceship mode into incarna mode just to look out of the window then reload evemode and undock
actually i think it needs to be in both  or at least some generic method that is available in both
i would like to see this in incarna
if they incorporate incarna into eve ill finally be able to enjoy hunting neuts that appear in 00 stations

how about some actual gameplay that relates to the spaceships game we all know and love even though incarna will not run on the same servers as eve in space it will be stupid if what happens in stations is entirely unrelated to the space game some ideas off the top of my head  hacking public terminals by solving some kind of cyphertype puzzle not just a module with a random chance of success as we use in radar sites but something that requires brain power to discover tidbits of information about the current or immediately adjacent systems related to a corporation or players in space at that moment might be useful might not might have an option to dig deeper might not might even give you access to a snapshot of someones hangar records so you could see what they have in system anyone walking by could come up and inquire what youre doing potentially screwing up your progress assuming the hacks are timed activities bribes to the station manager to delay docking of certain individuals for a short period of timemight need to be based on criteria related to standings or other stuff not just isk black market trade only possible via direct handoffs in certain establishments of special hacked implants or designerdrug boosters which cannot be sold through traditional channels  smuggling instation one assumes there are station security personnel of black market stuff carried on your personwhere you have a chance of getting busted by random electronic scans when moving illicit goods from one part of a station to another getting busted would have various penalties associated with itfines holdups due to interrogation temporary shortterm confinement etc the ability to put up any item as collateral in games of chance offered in station you lose the item is immediately confiscated and placed in the winners hangar sabotage of industrial facilities affecting some percentage of currently running jobssuccess maybe requiring a series of puzzle solving activities combined with placement of explosives or other disruptive items bribing agents to take a day offoops sorry no missions from that agent that day would have to involve more than just isk though you might for example discover that agents have a penchant for gambling and might invite you to a game of chance just to see if they can take your money for nothing rather than risk their own jobsnow granted some of these ideas are probably full of holes and even stupid but i havent had four years to sit around and think them up
i made me do it
its been proposed here before and im proposing it again give the players the ability for a fee to change their characters name there is absolutely no legitimate reason to disallow such a mechanic here are some ideas for ccp to implement namechangingcharge 20003000 per name change and limit the number of changes to 1 or 2 per year per account given a conservative average of 500 name changes per month this would gross ccp 10000  15000 monthly to get a more accurate estimate look at the number of character transfers that occur per month  most of those would have their name changedincrease volume of character transfers due to the ability to change the name this would effectively boost the fees collected for character transfersappease your player base the vast majority of players in eve are either for the implementation of name changes or indifferent the cost to implement the code would be low compared to the revenue gained and the appreciation from playersrespectfully submittedafflikshon
i was about to say but man it exist already oo when i realized that no i was thinking about the portrait seein all the others paying services its strange this one is not availablei suppose they didnt implant the code for it player name  player id  so its a pain to change i dont care this thing but need to know it if someone on our contact be it red blue or neutral use it a simple notification mail would be enough
its easy to change your characters nametransfer all isk and assets to a temporary characterpress the bio mass button on your mainwait for dtcreate new character with a new nametransfer assets and isk backthe cost of course is all the skill points you have ammasseda fair trade for the anonimity of a new identity me thinks
the following can be inserted pretty much anywhere inbetween what dav saiddeal with the consequences of making an idiotic nameanddeal the the consequences of doing naughty things with your characterandthink before you ruin your reputation or create your characters nameive had my stupid character name for almost 5 years nowif i can handle it so can you oh wait also there are multiple posts on this subject alreadytamber

i enjoy character selling it enables one to buy a character and get into the game more quickly lets not debate this here this is just my view of ithowever why should a person be stuck with the characters past alsoi suggest a name change and erasing of employment info upon exchanging characters simple as that
if you do not like the past then do not buy it why is that so hard
well thats about the worst reason wait theres not even a reason in there to not do what i suggested so i guess that makes it even worseif you can come up with a good reason for why this shouldnt be implemented then comment
ok i robbed corp a move the toon to my 2nd account and rename it in the go all history gone and i dont loose any skills whatsoever and can just go and screw the next corpall your actions are bound to your name live with the consequences
listen i looked at it as if i was to buy something i would look at all facets of the item if there are flaws i cant live with then i just would not buy itand then there is this 
or someone could just buy a new character and transfer the assets to that new character situations very similar to this already happen most likely this still isnt a very good reason to refute my suggestionedit aside from that theres no reason ccp couldnt make this a petitionable offense and track down the character in question while tracking the isk also

in keeping with ccp tradition the proteus really got screwed compared to its other t3 counterparts amazingly its the slowest ship of all 4 races has the weirdest slot layout of all the ships and is arguably one of the weakest tanks of all the shipsone of the things that baffles me is its gravitational capacitor sub system the bonuses reduce warp capacitor cost and increase warp speed yet even with the boost it cant even warp faster than a t1 frigate and why anyone would believe you need a reduced warp cost is amazing its a cruiser class ship with an over sized capacitor it can warp just about anywhere and longer warps see the capacitor recharge for longer so thats a non arguement either so i propose to do one of 2 things to replace this sub system and boost the proteus appropriately either a reduce mwd capacitor and boost mwd speed by 3 per level orb reduce mass by 5 per level but add 15 base sigthis enables the proteus to get a useful buff that also allows pilots to choose bt an effective mwd platform or an effective ab platform this of course keeps on the track that blaster ships need to be able to close the gap and defend better in their blaster optimal that everyone is preaching
yep
youre arguably one of the dumbest pilots of all the capsuleers
awe cute look whos hiding behind his newb corp alt could you please explain which other t3 has a worse tank when considering all factors including sig speed capacitor hp and actual rep amt
all of them proteus has the second or third biggest buffer cap behind either the rattlesnake depending on fit or damnationu mad bro
the proteus really got screwed compared to its other t3 counterpartsmight i introduce you to the legion
umm besides the loki which gets some other awesome bonuses the proteus has the 3rd highest buffer once you account for resist just of the t3 ships of all ships in game its not even close to the top unless perhaps you go for some ridiculously nonviable setup proteus also has to plate to get that buffer which totally s on its already bad speed a mass reduction change for that subsystem would actually help it plate easier go try an ab or mwd fit on any of the other 3 t3 ships and you will find that they beat the proteus heavily on speed and all 3 of them have much more significant range this is the only ship that doesnt get some sort of aid to its speed in defense of its other subsystems and how can anyone argue that the warp bonuses are useful im not so sure why you guys are focusing on the fact that it can get a decent tank by comparison to any of the other t3 ships its totally inferior in terms of speed and total defensive ability im sensing yet again csm forums fail bc people can read past a first sentence
i too think my t3 that has a bs buffer and damage with a long range scram and plated cruiser speed and agility is underpowered please boost it
just lol not supported
i lold at work not cool
there are good fits for all the t3s i think the proteus is probably one of the stronger t3s though in my own experiance you can get something like 1ks tank off just one rep and you can fit two on s and lets not even get started on its passive tankdont think this is the way to go im afraid
somehow i agree more with this user than with the op
think its time you find a decent fit for the ship instead of complaining
in at i think proteus was the 2nd most fielded t3either legion needs fixing or better yet they all need nerfed then add t3 frigs and bs
i dont think you understand what game mechanics are if you think downtime is a game mechanicalso this was done literally for years when pos were the sov deciding structure people would anchor pos right before downtime giving zero time for response it didnt seem to be a problem then glad it is now but having the rule announced would be awesome instead of ccp randomly turning around and going hey this is against our rules that we cant show you
ok i see many funny sides to thisfirst i will state my honest opinion i dont think the tcus should have been removed because in the past this has been abused and nothing has been done this could be because no one has petitioned it of course but ill get onto that pthe second point of view is on be extended dt someone was saying 2b is well worth it to get molle to rage and well i think this kind of exploded in tests face because i know not all of them have raged about this but a lot of people seem to be having a bit of a cry about how unfair it all isso i would like to thank test for spending isk to troll themselves sorta its pretty funnythe third point of view is in the past ccp has flipflopped on decisions like this and a lot of the times its been against whatever you like to call your big bad molle empire p eg bubbles being classed an exploit and i remember a bunch of people clamouring to lol at bob many of which are people crying about how unfair it is now lolso im just saying sure this hasnt been entertaining in the way you planned it to be but it has been entertaining none the less thank you

one vaga is good against one drake 200 vagas are good against 200 drakesi guess your right counters do scale welltrolling part removed jerichoactually thats a good one im going to bio that too finnagain zero  your quotes have been postedps the fact that you find it hard to fly one logi ship in a big logi gang reflects on nothing and no one but you and the people you fly with
in other words you have no actual counter to point out after arguing for post after post as to how it was almost impossible for you to counter logis before you decided that really you could but it was other people who couldnt you cannot propose an actual mechanic by which this counter no longer scales but you can type in all caps go figure and then of course youre reminding folks about how youve fabricated several quotes and claimed that other people made them and pointing out that after you were caught lying and claiming both that it was almost impossible as well as trivially easy for you to counter logis youve decided to bio that too the fact that your quotes were posted is relevant as you you posted at least one obvious lie out of two wildly contradictory statements yes you then went on to try to claim that you hadnt said what you said but you meant somethign totally different that just happened to be what you didnt actually say and you still havent addressed which time you were lying and why you felt the need to lie the funny thing amidst your epicallcapsfreakouttext is that you didnt feel the need to clarify anything for post after post while you were arguing either the lie that its almost impossible to counter logis or the lie that its trivially easy and youve been doing it for years for post after post while you were trolling people but as soon as it was pointed out that both cant be true and one had to be a lie all of a sudden then you felt the need to clarify and when called on that clarification you babble about drakes and vagas and not the counter to logis that you swear is easy and simple and youve been using for years but nobody else can cuz of how 1337 your are even funnier in your epicallcapsfreakouttext is that youre lying and claiming that anybody else is trying to claim what it is you said when after your your quotes have been posted and you are trying to deny spin or ignore them when your own words are in a conspiracy against you and someone posting what you yourself have said is somehow deciding what you said and not you well its time to stop the nonsense and just address which of your claims was a lie and why you were lying most likely however they were probably both lies to a certain degree the first that it was nearly impossible to counter logis in the present not in some mythic postscalablecounter future that you later lied and said you were talking about was both to bolster the claim that logis need to be possibly removed from the game and that youre awesome but that your enemies suck and arent as cool as you along the same lines your later lie about how its trivially easy for you to counter logis after you were arguing for most of the thread that no such thing was true was because you wanted to present yourself as 1337 some more and get the good ol epeen going while you were alleging that all the people whod been trying to educate you on how to deal with logis while you were arguing for why you couldnt possible well they were the ones who couldnt deal with them not you because youre awesome which is to say much more likely than not you cant identify only one quote which is a lie and identify why you were lying about it because both contain dishonesty and were used for the purpose of your regaling everybody with how awesome you are and how notawesome everybody else is speaking of you lying the fact that you find it hard to fly one logi ship in a big logi gang reflects on let me finish that sentence for you shall i reflects on the fact that mini is lying again and there is no such fact because mini made is up and is a liar and nobody ever said that anybody found it hard to fly a logi ship in any gang big or small but a lie serves minis purpose far better than an honest discussion of the issue glad i could help
im not going to give you counters you havnt thought of if you are bad at this game its not my problemin fact i think you have mentioned almost every counter in this thread except the ones that work somewhat against good logi gangs so go back and by deduction work out what they are for yourself
thought so youre just trollingyou spent half the thread trolling by arguing that there are no counters and you cant counter logi gangs and ccp needs to alter the game mechanics to save you then you spent the other half trolling that you have lots of easy counters that totally work you just cant say what any of them are and naturally if you do have easy counters that work then the very premise of your own thread is refuted but naturally the super seeekrit counters that really exist honest that you just cant tell anybody also have some sort of undefined unspecified mechanics that really exist honest that prevent scaling and you argument no matter what lie you use that its almost impossible to counter logis or its super easy ends up being used for you to claim that youre 1337 and everybody else is bad youve gone as far as to lie hilariously that while many people have tried to explain to you how to deal with logis both from the perspective of flying logis extensively and flying against logis extensively that it was really other people who were saying that they were unable to deal with logis but that you knew how what luck the counters that you claim you know are secret and you cant tell anybody but that proves how leet you are and how bad everybody else is your claim that you couldnt counter logis even while everybody else was trying to tell you how you could that too just showed how leet you are and how bad they are its almost like no matter what position you invent no matter which of your own statements you have to contradict with obvious dishonesty the argument is always about how awesome you are and how bad anybody is who disagrees with you almost like its deliberately set up to troll people and by almost i mean exactly
mmmm good point youve totaly convinsed me that logi gangs of 50 vs logi gangs of 50 will be lots of fun excellent job

csm are discussing this with ccp nothing to report yet
it does seem like a double standard for players some alliances are allowed to do this while others are not
this is all based on the assumption of point 1 being true1 anything that happens over a regular dt is allowed2 tcu  sbu this is where my idea is unfounded until now i guess iirc you are not able to wardec anyone before an extended dt as they count doing that to rundown the warmup timer as an exploit as it denies the opponent the chance to become prepared i assume ccp is following the same thing here test did not allow it the chance to fight back the reason that test got their stuff moved and the others didnt is because until now people may not have gamed the extended dt and had their stuff petitioned ccp looked at it and said its a valid argument and removed tests then when they cried ccp went and took out other tcusbus these probabally were petitioned too after exact precident was set3 stations petition away ccp will tell you to run away stations work by you putting the station up throwing all the crap in and clicking build if you were to press the build button at 2 seconds after dt you get to wait til the next dt if you press it 2 seconds before dt in two seconds your station egg is going to morph this is due to the fact that one of the scripts that runs at any dt has its sole purpose of looking for any itemids registered to eggs and morph them into a station4 poss you can anchor these and start their online timer during a standard dt and have it come out done so doing this during an extended dt does not matter other then you anchor guns at a time different then before having them come out of ref during a sov timer is valid too iirc granted it may not be valid to time them to come out at the very beginning of a 15 hour dt as i am not sure if that is enough time for the tower to passively rep its shields back over fifty from twentyfive then again this crime could be committed by having the tower set to whatever the dt is going to start at in this case 500 game time and your plan is to never even bother during the fight to reinforce so you wouldnt be penilized for passively exploiting due to when you got attacked

noi dont mind cosmetici dont mind cool modulesas long as they are expendable it doesnt matter your characters skill points are pretty much forever thoughin essence the selling of remaps is the selling of skill pointsone of the things about the sandbox and hostility of eve that made it fun was that it felt fair in its own skewed way being able to buy skill points makes this less interesting since it makes one feel like they have to sink more real money into the game to stay competitive will not renew my subscription either when this goes through

yes excellent idea
too much of eve is generic exploring space just isnt as exciting as it could be if the same models were not used over and over again
there was another thread asking for the same thing a while back and i believe the op in that post showed that ccp already has unique station models for pirates which arent being used in the game itd be nice to see them pop up
signedas much as the workload would increase for this augmenting current station would also be a good thing and by augmenting i mean the physical models not just the paintwork
yes to eyecandy considering the amount of work involved however it shouldnt be a priority right now as a workaround ccp may want to consider more art contests like the one on da recently but for specific not generic ships many of the submissions to the contest were epic and if the incentive is if i win my model is gonna be the new bhaalgorn rather than my ships is gonna be some random thing implemented at some point in the future and probably with the utility of a zephyr im quite certain more people will put larger amounts of work into itetypo
yikes i wouldnt touch on the eve da contest that was quite a can of worms in the end a lot of unhappy people tho i did very much like the winning ship bt art contests would be awesome im sure theres quite a few eve enthusiasts that are capable 3d artists plus ive a few i didnt submit n get it judged by the eve community this time rather than a non associated pannel of deviant art peeps
should have clarified that  art contests but not with da that was failda or a similar outfit wouldnt be needed to advertise something like this  the eve community and mouthtomouth propaganda would be all thats necessary for this to spawn whats needed  a shiny new model and valuable addition to the game with less effort for ccp and if selected by the community less chance of getting reactions along the lines of eww

in news today you dont know what top teir means that is the mallermax skill so it should take more skill to fit then a harbinger or zealot let alone the very fitting friendly stabber and vexorhull cost is close the same because is in the same teir as the arby guess you missed thateveryone already flys arbies which is the issue the omen is close to a dead ship in pvp because of fitting issues and a buff would be acceptable next time read up on the ship before making failed opinions
the description for the omen says the omen is a stereotypical example of the amarrian school of thinking when it comes to ship design thick armor and hard hitting lasersit has to be able to fit thick armour and hard hitting lasers and not the abominations that are quad light beamssimilar size or cost ships have more hp more firepower and are easier to fit as wellmeh skip laserboats till harbinger is no good for the gamemeh crosstrain x race instead is no good for the gamewhat eve needs is for all ships to be useful when there are ships which are more useful to build t2 ships with than to fly in their own right then thats no good

um im a toon with less than 48 hours of training and i fly in a thrasher destroyer btw and i can be in a drake and still have less than 900k sp which is what a week of training pretty sure you can be in something other than a frigate much sooner than two months  and sprinkle in learning skills as you wantneedselect a group of skills to train with matching primarysecondary attributes ie gunnery or spaceship command skillstrain the matching l1 learning skills to 23 remap the attributes to boosttrain skillsrinse repeat for other skills and 2nd remap available to all new playerscharactersdont bother training charisma skills at all and save yourself the hassle unless you are a mission altpi altdont train tier 2 learning skills past iv if you train them at allthe complaint omfg if i dont train all the learning skills to v then it will take me 370 days instead of 300 to fly a carrier is a shallow argument
dunno bout u guys bt i remember in education going through and learning about the techniques of learning and how your brain facilitates thoughts into short term and long term memory along with practical ways of being able to learn more faster and with better recall but then again if its good enough for real life i guess its not good enough for ccp failzorz
try and fly that drake into a level 3 mission with only 900 k spi dare you
not the point  the point being its much more than a frigate in much less than 2 months what is level 3 mission anyway is that a pvp corp
thats the point i was trying to get across gives menacemyth imaginary kudos
finally a good suggestion even if said before  i think it was100mil is nothing for a week of war its easily possible to permanently wardec a corp as it stands now with basically no issue2mil a week  even i can afford to wardec for monthsyears 100mil will make wars what they should be wars not zomg lets lolkill this corp for a week of course the propvp corps are ing but its what is expectedeve needs and isk sink this is the easiest one and would be a very fast one to implement 2million isk come on 1 lvl 4 mission and u can dec for a month actually more then that
cant have this275 billion is the cost of 3 tech 2 fit carriers and for what they do that is plenty money10 wars is not a good enviroment to grind on a weekly basis and afford the ships to fight i guess it would be better if we remove the stacking system and have it at a higher flat ratethat way corps mercenary corps can actually afford to run multible wars but the first one isnt edly cheap might actually be a buff to people dedicated to warsjust a thought
could always have zones i put that idea forth like 6 months ago00 wars freelowsec cheaperhighsec more expensiveyou could even divide highsec into 57 and 8 or somthing
supported
this is the best ideal for high sec war decs it even makes common cents if the cops can be payed off to not do there job they can probly be payed off to do there jobs as well
agreed
you mean griefing should be cheap pvp is always cheap go out to low secnullsec or have a mutual wardec or trick someone and  them off into wardecing your corpalliance wardecs will still be cheap even if there is an increase in costs just that a person has to actuallly gasp consider who they wardec fighting is cheap war is expensive
since the bid system has been mentioned i guess i need to decide whether or not i support it frankly i do not support a bid system for a variety of reasons i will list them belowa the bid system is a new module that would need to be tested and incorporated into eve that would bring much more overhead many more months of bug testing and there really needs to be more people dedicated to other things with my fix its a few lines of code change with a bid war it requires opening a new set of databases more error checking and a whole new set of rules and logic yes its simple from a person who does not code for a living but i rather see the lag problems fixed than to burden ccp with a bid war set up there are already enough problems in eve than to keep adding more crap ontop of each other not saying the bid system is crap but its just that there is more of a chance that bad things will go terribly wrong if you continue to add more things to evebit will be broken and abused for instance small corporations who can not afford the bid system get overrunned by griefers bigger corporations have more isk to toss away at smaller griefers yes it creates a isk sink but not an effective onec another big issue  say corp a wardecs corp b corp a pays 2 million to start the bid and corp b pays 200001 mil the next day does this mean that the bid system will continue for 24 hours before the war bid will be cancelled how much of a cool off until corp a can wardec again even if you limit the window for the bid system to last 24 hours there are a few people who have a life outside eve who can probably not make it in that kind of window and then their votes in the corp are shoved aside much more coding much more bickering too much of a pain in the ass for ccp to even consider this option right now towards the rr corps issuesimple fix is to hire a merc corp to do the same thing even i have to admit that hiring a merc corp is sometimes the best option to alleviate the strain of a wardec nothing says  you like a stream of 30 kestrels against 7 wardecing hacs if the rrers are still a pain switch to neuting and using cloak ships to allow warp on zero tactics its going to cost the offending corp more isk if you use a dominix to neut a dedicated logistics ship even if the dominix goes pop always have a higher up friend in a merc corp you can talk to on a normal firstname basis do a few roams with them learn some tactics if your minerhigh sec corp gets wardecd i am sure you can afford to spend 100300 million towards your friendly merc corp who will love to cause the station camping to be in your favorstill they can escalatenevertheless rr can be used both ways its fair anyone in ccp can agree with that
war decs can be loads of fun but i must agree the fee is too low an established corp will have no problems with an increased fee personally i think something should be done with the neutral rr game mechanic
i think there is something wrong with the game mechanic everytime i get decced i wake up with a sore anus
i think 300 mil for a corp dec and 600 mil for a alliance dec is about right declarations of war are a serious ting and should reflect that seriousness in their price right now decs are being used 85 of the time as a means to pvp nonpvp interested targets in high sec or simply as a griefing tool by those who get a chuckle out of seeing newbie corps squirm and disband the fact is that ccp designed these particular regions for a reason high sec is for youngins to learn the game and for casual gamers to roam more securely low sec is for pvprs pirate activities risk for reward and general butthurt nullsec is for those corps who want to run things their way and god help you if you get in the way cheap and easy war decs have led to what is an ever growing epidimic of grief deccing by experienced pvp corps looking for a good time at the expense of corps who dont even know what theyre doing yet im not saying it should be made illegal by any means nor am i saying that high sec should be overtly safe what im saying is that it needs to be expensive enough that you better damned well mean it or else it becomes nothing more than paying next to nothing to shoot ducks in a barrelto put it in different terms you wouldnt want mike tyson to be able to walk into a local boxing gym and pay the manager 2 bucks to run around knocking out all the amatuers before they even learn how to throw a proper punchhe should pay 300 bucks lol
eve and iwar are completely different beasts  the comparison falls down on many levelsiwar is entirely single player and has full control over how much calculations need to be made at any given time eve is singleshard multiplayer where the amount of small easily run on a 400mhz cpu since 2001 calculations is an unknown because it depends on how many players are in one place at a timeits also not just about the number crunching but the gameplay too  how much would it take a player to navigate around celestial objects and how much benefit will it give to the game experience tbqh i would see this as similar in terms of gameplay enjoyment naturally it would work differently to having to scan down each gate in the system before being able to warp to it yawn
make large colidable objects invisible while warping  thread
two facts1 they chose to waist resorces on remaking all the models and effects in the game2 they chose to waist resorces developing a purly cosmetic out of pod experiance without any functionality beyond a chat roomone pointif development resorces are so limited they dont even need to have our ships go arround objects they could just impose some kind of funky distotion effect when we pass through things as things are now it just looks crude and unpolished
you want something to compare the eve development to that has credable ties oklook at pioneer space sim and tell me thats closer to eve than iwar bear in mind pioneer is an open source graphical update on david brabens elite a game that even ccp have said eve online distinctly evolved from ohh and theyve solved the warp round planets thing too dont say it cant be done or shun it cause its not got a suitable comparison the closest comparisons have been made and each time this particular issue has been solved even by amateursplus if eve truely is an evolution of elite and therefore pioneer which ccp say it is the code is there to implement already its open sourceohh and 1 other thing if you actually read the thread and not the last 2 comments ud have realised i have been talking all along about avoiding celestial bodies only and not every tiny little item in each star system
yeah sure that would effectively remove poses from those moons because they will keep getting damageas for the general idea do you really feel that general gaming experience for all players will benefit from this in the amount that could be justified by development time needed to make this i think notnot supported
i guess u only put ur poss onto moons with very low orbits around gas planets jesus how picky are you even so i do believe the general gaming experience will benefit players in the end im going to make an analogy that will help u see it more clearly eve online right now is the space sim equivalent of an fps shooter having a flat arena with no walls or objects in to block either your path or your shots just safe areas u can run into where u cant be hurt and the ability to change how fast u run how much damage u can take and how powerfull ur guns are if an fps game came out like that itd be shunned by the likes of everyone unless it had some severe distractions and minigames along the way i know the combat system in eve is chance based rather than dynamic hit detection based bt if u truely can say ud be happy bout playing in a fps game like that ur better at dealing with a bad compromise than me this specific change adds dynamicism and new oppertunities for risk vs reward which seems to be ccps motto as well as adding a new level of tactics and random occurances to pve as well as pvp it would influence tactics on scouting and recon duties against corps and alliances in hisec and null sec offer sanctury to people whove planned ahead and the ability to plan traps based on actually knowing an area of space that you traverse rather than abusing broken game elements for a tactical advantagebut i guess if u wanna stick to what u know dont like embracing change for the better because it screws with you comfortable little world then ur not really going to embrace rl properly let alone a space and social interation simulationrant
you know if this was caod id fully agree imo the noalt posting rule there is definitely right you got it backwards im not talking of what image my posts would project onto my alliance but what stigma my alliance projects onto my proposal people do have their stereotyped thinking even if unconsciously and i wont claim i manage to be bias free but i try for instance imagine you saw a proposal by a goonand if you are righteous like you claim you should consider the proposal implications for all parties  who would be buffednerfed by it and if somebody might in fact be pushing some unilateral agenda regardless of the proposal opa feel free to check my posting and proposal historyb its funny because most bad proposals are done by alliance members or well known characters not some unknown altim gonna go ahead and call troll because discussing alt posting in a banaltpostingthread is very much on topic we can agree that improving ah is a thing that should be pursued but you want to inhibit discussion on why the proposal at hand is not the solution were looking for trying to impede what is ultimately a democratic processso whos the one more interested in pointing fingers instead of improving the game after all
and if it wasnt caod it wouldnt be any less important despite what u alone favor1 the direction of the stigma is irrelevantthey affect each other the same way u post u make your affiliation look bad your corpalliance mate posts they make u look bad but if ure that obsessive over eimage because u think your affiliation makes or breaks your stance it doesnt then u might wanna leave your corpalliance if u dont even want to associate with them simple as that2 so if u can make a good stance regardless of affiliation its a good stance however if ure gonna post by giving no good reasons and ignoring the opposition then its not valid when that happens one would take a look at your affiliation and then it boils down to buff me and nerf them because i said so3 ure not really trying at all to be biasfree if ure gonna comment on another corpalliances proposals right after in other words u totally ignored almost all of this threadagainwhen all that would be nerfed r the trolls who resort to hiding behind another identity of course caught up in your own hypocrisy and selfrighteousness ure incapable of noticing that so when u mention this unilateral agenda r u talking about your idea to only apply this to your precious caod and not anywhere else ure not special so why dont u take your own advice because so far all u have left is to complain about how it would affect u and your eimage only which isnt saying much a u still dont get itfigures no matter what u do in your selfrighteousness ure not gonna absolve all the other poster alts ure not specialget over itb and whos supporting them with trolling comments their own alts its real funny how u somehow failed to notice that1 only your discussion just proved our point2 wowjustwow and ure calling me a troll again no one said u couldnt post at all only your own side said that good job on missing that completely for the millionth time moron u already answered your own question with your selfdefeating attempts i mentioned i was merely making note of that not to mention only thinking of yourself and disregarding everyone else sure as hell isnt gonna improve the game in case u still havent figured it outure not special so try to get some perspective and some words of advice check yourself before u knock on someone else next
ill bump this since id like some input
itt nc finds it too annoying to tpye passwords for various jbs that let them travel practically anywhere in the top hemisphere of the eve universeinstant conclusion everyone else wants easy mode carry on brave nc
its not just the nc that has massive networks of jump bridges they exist through the drones as well as delvequeriousyou seem to single out the nc for everything based on your own political affiliation ill agree with you that with the current situation of server node lag the tendency to very large fleet battles is bit conflicting those battles could be awesome were the server able to handle them anywhere close to playable and were there viable options for meaningful smaller conflictfolks are going to find a way to work together in these big coalitions thats always going to be a tendency that youre not going put a stop too with some game mechanic changes its possible to influence or encourage the opposite but its difficult to do so without placing arbitrary restrictions or inequities which ccp wishes to avoidi think there are many other things ccp could do to revise dominion sov that could help a lot more than some restrictions to bridges i dont think we should completely discount some changes to bridges but they arent the fix all solution you make them out to be what do you think of the ideas here
minis love of trolling aside there is no good reason that bridges cant be set for standings rather than requiring the annoyance of retyping passwords for each bridge
while we are at it we should also make it so that you dont need a cyno to jump places lets face it its too annoying to have to put a cyno where you want to golets make it so that you can just jump to wherever you wantthis game is way too tedious with all these severe restrictions to travel
sarcasm doesnt work well in text my friend well maybe for you it would if you adopted a different color to indicate sarcasm but i digressif you couldnt make it out from my post i was trying to agree with you on your concern for fleet warfare and perhaps get your thoughts on some of my ideas but it looks from your response that youre more interested in trolling
its interesting and hard to tell does mini troll constantly or are his logical skills simply nonexistent he likes to feign stupiditymental damage in order to troll people i think i waver back and forth in my judgment maybe he really does believe that not having to enter a password for every bridge saving someone literally 3 seconds to a whole two seconds is somehow analogous to being able to use jump drives without requiring a cyno and having limitless range for those drives but probably hes just trolling in any case the 23 of the ops points are solid pointless restrictions like requiring someone to enter a pw each bridge or not being able to take fuel from authorized users is simply a set of annoyances set up for no real reason its adding gnats to the picnic because some developer thought that the gnat quotient wasnt high enough but effectively allowing the equivalent of using jump drives while pointedbubbled is a bad bad idea still 2 out of 3 aint bad
i wasnt talking about or to you im just laughing at that finnagain guy who spent the better part of the last week telling me that this game shouldnt be changed because you want easy modei also have another suggestion btw maybe we should make it so that you can autopilot a fight also so that you dont need to fire your guns or lock targets the game should detect ships that are being primaried and just shoot them with the right ammoits too annoying to do those things manually
as it saysi propose adding a column to the ui that specifies the signature radius of all potential targets it goes without saying that changes to signature caused by target painters micro warp drives and other modules and rigs eg shield extenders should be dynamically accounted fori feel no need at this point to specify why this would be an improvement but reserve the right to do so at a later date should it be needed
definitely if there is traversal there should also be sig radius
yup
this would be a nice feature as a preemptive strike against those who might claim that there is already a size column available in the overview that column does not show signature radius it shows a standardized value base on ship classafaik this information is not currently sent to the client therefore adding this feature might cause lag especially in large fleet battles where there are alot of ship in those large fleet battles their might be a lag spike if there is a change in fleet boosting effects that changes the signature radius of many ships at onceif this can be made to work then great but i doubt it would be acceptable if it caused the lag monster to return
this is actually a good ideasupported
sadly the war mechanic is broken beyond repair just suck it up

bumped for great justice
well the thing is the nice yellow color of the gallente shuttle is the color of the manufacturer which is interbus afaiki though like the idea of having a set of colors
hell let us paint our damn ships already
fin never gonna happen ccp have already expressed their views on customised skins on peoples ships they dont want eve to turn into the kind of texture and colour mental showcase that things like second life has become
of course my idea keeps that from happening it allows the illusion of choice while firmly keeping ccp in charge of the color scheme by only allowing to schemes to be used
worked for citibankthey used to shout the daily password across the office and all the staff had logins that never expiredrussian hackers took them for more money then they were able to countadded a limitedtime pass authenticator device to each staff member and problem mostly solved
why pay for hardware when reliable software solution is easy to implement and costs nothing to us customersnot supported
what software solution would that be
eve is suposed to be a sand box  and im sure that for most players wis will enrich their sandbox experience however for many others being forced into giving up avatars they had for years for a feature thats more of an eve mini game will lessen that experience rather than for us to create new avatars or use the silhouette  let us use our old avatarsrespectfullyhg
how then would you explain the differences between the two character portrait styles freak babies that never evolvedyou dont want to participate in wis thats fine but for ccp to support nonuniformity of the rendering of character portraits is a liiiiittle absurd
i feel your pain hamish but this is the chance to create a new look for your character with some actual originality i mean i have 2 agents that look exactly like your avatar dont you as a paying customer deserve to have an appearance that differs from some random ass npcs more than just some backgrounds lighting angles and a different top
yes please id like to optoutcurrently have load station environment off and audio engine off
im going to have boobs
you can opt out of it the same way most people opt out of mining just pretend like it isnt thereas for the new avatars just try your best to replicate your old facenot supported because expansion packs dont work like that
ii will keep this short and elegant as usual if your at war than it is illegal to use any remote modules on yourself or anyone elsethere easy enough no more neutral alts sticking their nose where it does not belongremote modules are legal between those in your same alliance though so it is balanced
how exactly do i use remote modules on myself isnt that sort of already not allowed by the gameyes i knew what you meant but you might give some thought to clarifying your proposal
lol dont try and burn down sum1 whos there to give out bandaids to people who obviously need them and if youre getting aggitated by the fact the person helping is a neutral with bias then either hes another player entirely helping out another or you havent forward planned propelyhate the player not the game in this respectps  not supported bt im sure u knew that already
doesnt aiding someone at war already flag you attackable
yeah but it means local isnt the perfect intel tool as ccp intended
you dont need incarna for any of that  all incarna can do that eve cannot is rp dress up toys made possible because you can look at your avatar in 3d and mechanics related to physical location  but short of adding avatar combat im not sure what gameplay elements could be improved by thati dont give a crap what pointless dress up elements ccp choose to add but the last thing i want to see is meaningful station functionality which i have to pointlessly walk across an irrelevant station to reach when it could easily be added to the station dock menu this goes for suggestions like gambling stores black markets map rooms etc just as much as for public terminals recruitment station windows and so oneve does not need more trivial timesinks forcing me to slog around an irrelevant station map to access eve mechanics
i like mynxees idea of finding people to bribe probably find these folks in low sec say you want to transport boosters from point a to point b if you could meet someone they might say pay me this much and you can go this specific route safely for the next 72 hours or whatever now there could be a skill of bribing andor it could be based on your standings with the faction who owns the space you are going through andor the corp you are dealing with maybe if you have a high standing with the faction you are better at detecting if the briber is really going to bust you this would be explained that with factions that you have high standings with you have connections so if the potential person you are going to bribe were to tell you you can get past someone you know is honest you would know not to take the bribe this would be automatically detected in the background you would just be told something like you have a bad feeling about this plan or conversely this seems like a good deal and then have the option to accept or reject the planmaybe there could be some high sec equivalents too maybe you could see someone who you could pay a bit more to get some added concord protection for a certain route if someone tries to suicide gank you on the trip concord response times could be lowered whether others suicide gankers could pay off someone to be made aware of these deals or not is something that could be consideredyou may have to stop in to stations to see what the demand for certain consumer items are that might change based on the news maybe a scare about quafe potentially causing an illness will reduce its demand or some health benefit would increase its demand so if you had connections with the company you may be able to find this sort of thing out before the news hits and stock up or sell offwhatever it is i think the amount of information you can get will depend on your corporate or faction standings perhaps you will get better informationbribes from minmatar if your amarr standings are very low as well so there can be definite trade offs to the standings game maybe different corps who compete will also give better intel if your standings are low with their competitors
whatever people who have been playing eve for a while think most people new to the game think its odd that you only ever see your avatar having a body should definitely add to the immersion its the same thing with why they make models for spaceships instead of all of them being just white spheres of various sizes labeled merlin or tempest depending on what they are the mechanics would all be the same but the immersion would suffer but anyway back on topic here are some random ideas that i havent really thought through very well and probably wont workanother idea probably a bad one that would be a really big change from the current system but might be very good for the whole spying thing would be if you could pay someone to tap into chats local chats would be easy to get even if you are not in that system private chats and eve mail a bit harder and fleet chats would be even harder the only way someone could really talk in private in game would be if they were literally face to face in the same room and had a device that scrambled any bugs that might be on the other person the advantage here would be there would be a way of detecting spies similar to real life seeing someone meet with your enemy allot would then be a tip off just like in real life plus if you used these taps there might be ways others could detect this add tools that would make allot of the intel aspects happen in game instead of out of game of course third party methods of communications would be a straightforward work around such as vent or email so the idea may be a complete bust but it would be awesome if we could get the spying dynamic which is now solely a meta game into the actual game of course the concern would be that this sort of thing would just force everyone to no longer use the in game communications the other problem may be that your scouts would end up sitting in a station instead of actually flying around scouting which isnt really fun maybe you could at least bribe someone to find out who someone is in fleet with there would be no easy workaround here if you want to warp to fleet member you have to be in the same fleeti really dont know whether any of these later ideas could work because of third party workarounds but it would be great if it could work it would truly be that sci fi universe we all would love to see
she  made me do it
thiswould benefit scammers corptheifs and the like would not benefit honest or average players in the least aside changing from a name they no longer like which is easily remedied through character transactions right now there are consequences to every action in eve this is one of its best traits you can mastermind the greatest heist in history though your toons name will be tarnished as a result make it worthwhile there aint no such thing as a free lunch
op you really havent found anything else to troll about have you
absurdly terrible idea die in a fire
i cant support this i understand your feels but they payed to play and train up to fly thoughs ships i would not want to pay more then other people just to fly my bss its just not a good ideal i dont even fly caps and i would stop playing eve if they started charging more mony to fly differnt kinds of ships
moved from the assembly hall
perhaps you can discuss with ccp the matter of the treatment of veteran players and how they should listen to us more often
give the bug hunters the ability to teleport on tq if theres people floating around invisible for a while get one of them to poof over to that area and look it would give ccp word from someone they semi trust more then random player with photoshop
well you would certainly see an explosion in apps to be a bh
add covert ops cloak and a buff please btw they also need more fitting help sin needs more grid for surethanks
why so serious for real though this is a game dude not like resigning lol from congress ora job
simple way to improve low sec is get rid of gate camps i would live in low sec if it werent for lolgatecamps buff the sentry guns tinker with session changes cloak invulnerability mechanics whatever gate camps are bad only bad players camp gates get rid of gate camps and more people will use low sec
forcing isnt quite in the spirit of a sandbox gamehowever  if going through lowsec would allow players to shave a couple of jumps off commonly used routes there would be an incentive to go to lowsec without anyone actually being forced to do soalso beefing up the rewards for doing stuff in lowsec would help right now theres hardly any difference between mission rewards in a 05 and a 04 system while there is a huge difference in the risk involved

yes to this  rsa ftw tho its definitely not infallable bt only if u browse the most dodgy sites on the net totally unprotected
this enables secure account sharing this will allow someone to lend out their account with no threat of it being stolenif it does not then it is worthless
if only one security key can be associated with an account typical then this isnt making it easier for account sharing youd have to have the person your sharing with to call you ts or we and read the passphrase of the moment of to them its no different than if you where to reset your password for each person you share with prior to allowing them to login and then reseting itsharing will continue to be a risk as you still dont know that the person youre sharing with wont otherwise compromise your account wipe your itemsisk steal your momtitan or otherwise and when those situations get petitioned someone usually ends up taking the ban read recent evenews24if this is combined with ip based security it would make it even more difficult for account sharing to take place
i never said anything about it being easiernot true you could recover your password because you still have the keyi was talking about account being secure not assetsthat is why you never petition account theft via sharingyes but no one is talking about thisthis feature could make account sharing safer that said i support this proposal on the condition that all that is required to transfer all three characters on an account is a single rsa key entry
i know there are reasons to not do this but i believe the reasons to do it far outweigh themcharacters corporations and alliances all save to the same name spaces a lot of these names are taken by trial account players that tried eve in the early days when eve was completely different and will likely never returnat least to the same accountwhat i am suggesting is an extremely selective purge of character data for those that have never subscribed and whose accounts have not logged in in the past 3 years if you want to be even more selective you can delete only characters with less than a weeks worth of skillpoints these characters have very little invested in them and are littering the name spacethe benefits given would be that new characters would have a greater identity to them as they would not have to be as obscure in naming or be enumeratedenumerated pilot names seem to break the sense of identityat the very least could we get a bit of research on how many characters these parameters would encompass or any thought on if this will ever be managed
good ideait would also be interesting to know how much purging ccp already does
i like this idea while certainly nonessential to gameplay it would be nice to clear things up for new players or those of us who want to snatch a famous name taken by some guy who played for 2 weeks in 2005 what a bastard

leaving for 6 months and getting your stuff back is one thing but characters and corporations from 2003 taking up the names and corp tags are another one possible solution is to use the mechanism applied to offensive names rename the characterscorps to caldari citizen  and allow them to petition for a name change when they come back
why so you can be the one to snatch up the name with an alt and sit in a corner chuckling to yourselfwhat a colossal waste of programmers time and moneynot supported
not only do i support this for the original intent this kind of data should be housekept anyways else you get an everexpanding set of database tablesoh also red on gray is so damn annoying so now youre pink
supportedwith the coming of dust 514 the namespace is about to get crowded there will be mass frustration if every dust player has to settle for their 5th choice on a name because some 2003 5 6 7 8 9 eve account is holding their preferred choice if they havent been back in 2 years then they should have storage added to their name like closed for the corps if they resub they can pick a new name or use their old one if its still available
thisbut i dont think dust will use the same system it will just go by xbox live gamertag
in a falcon that warps 375 au per second it takes 58 seconds to warp from an alighned position 946 au to another pointfrom those 58 seconds it takes 53 sec to get in warp 14980t 03848x inertafrom those 58 seconds it takes 37 seconds to get under 1 au from destinationit takes 21 seconds to slow down that is 36 of the total warp timemy proposal is to reduce this time this will encourange more traveling between systems and that is good for the quality of eve 946 au375au  252 seconds yet it takes 23 times as much time it makes no sence
the problem is that acceleration isnt variable every ship has the same acceldeccel for warp so faster ships dont actually warp much faster  its not possible to enter warp before another ship and overtake them in warp and it should be for ships with a huge difference in warp speed 15aus vs 21ausi am not in favour of a general increase in warp times though only a change so that ships with a warp speed advantage can benefit from it
yes because theres so little movement between systems these daysif you dont have a reason besides i want it plox just say that dont come up with some halfassed attempt to justify your request it makes you look like an idiot
trolling posts like this also make u look like a idiot i support this i think it will encourage more small roaming who is these days botherd to roam because they need to jump 45 minuts to travel 20 jumps to get to some hunting grounds
i would like to add my vote to this too for example i had to make a trade run yesterday with a ship that can carry around 14000 m3 for a set of items that were 8000 total that i could only carry about 2500 at a time so i had to make 4 runs back and forth in a indy now this may not seem like a big thing but the trips were 31 jumps apartthis was in a indy not a much slower freighter too it took me about 9 hours to do the run back and forth i used autopilot as the hell i was going to click 2 times per jump 32 jumps both ways for yeah plus they were in high seci just think that is a bit long yesjump clones are good but i think they can only be used one every 24 hours yesthere should be some way to improve travel times a bit mainly as suggested warp speeds not sub warp speeds as that might throw off game mechanics a bit but just having faster overall warp speeds for all ships might help a bitas one girl pointed out in her video blog the reason why many women do not like to play eve is it takes forever to do anything im a guy though but just saying give us some luv
variable warp speed up yes shorter warps no new eden feels already small as it iswhen you need to transport big amounts of stuff just ask someone with a big cargo ship or set up a courier contract sure courier contracts may take a while but you dont waste playtime on hauling it yourself
yes pls
the npc slot balance issue can be solved easily by running a simple check on how many bpcs are put into the batch job you can them just set an arbitrary max number of bpcs per batchsupported though im skeptical ccps gonna raise a finger at this issuethey love pandering until the last minute
mhmm
yup
new players can get faster into peeveepee  moar pvping players  better for everyone
erm learn more about the mission system in eveand if you only pilot a drake with 900k sp well a frigate pilot with 900k sp would most likely be able to pop you

nooooo ccp dont do this really verry bad idea
i also say no to microtransactions  not even neural remap
lol i really like this analogy kudos
except 00 wars are always free why would anyone wardec to fight in 00
ccp asked the csm for ideas for incarna well this one seems obvious show the characters public decoration on their outfits militarystyle people with many decorations should be able to select a limited amont of them 5 to display
this is a neat idea actuallyand if its not going too far into dress up barbie territory itd be cool if corps and alliances could design their own uniforms and so on im guessing there will be enough variation in the clothing for this to happen
heckyes
decorations and stuff would be an idea yeahoutfits for the militias as wellcould have other outfits too with corpalliance logos on them as well
very nice where do i sign 
 this this has to be a point of excellence for them it is part of the immersion of the gameimagine some close friends watching you play eve and then they stop the awing experience to ask why you just clipped through that planetmoon
anyone familiar with that game also knows that you can lds through celestial objects as well though you have to be going fast enough ive flown through plenty of stars just to watch my heat gauge redline
forum warriors take it somewhere else
keep going you are really helping the proposal
1especially in cp some days it feels like theres this one person who posts there and nobody elseedit i also like your implementation idea i dont really see a downside
exactly and u prove my point yet again trolling alt
as an alt i support this idea hell i even support the idea that only the highest sp character can post
accepted
yesnice monitor setup btw that must be awesome to use in practice
can you expand on how this is useful
yeah knowing my weight is useless in spaceknowing my combined mass on the other hand would be most excellent
im not talking about knowing it in space as it is right now when you have items in your hanger unless you move them to a cargo hold there is no way to see their combined weight this would allow you to simply select multiple items in your hanger or in any cargo container and see what their combined weight would be
do you mean you want to see the combined volume in cubic meters m3  ie how much stuff you can fit into a cargohold of a ship
exactly i would like to be able to select multiple items both in hangers containers and carp holds any selection of different items and see their combined weight in m3there are many situations i can imagine where this would be very useful it wouldnt be very hard to implement i dont think as its simply a matter of selecting whatever combination of items you choose and have the weight show up in the right click menu
lets clarify some terminologythe weight and mass of cargo is useless and unused information the game never cares about how much mass your cargo hashowever the game does care about the volume occupied by your cargo all cargo sizes and cargo limitations are expressed in cubic meters m3 which are units of volumechange your proposal to talk about the volume not the weight or mass and ill support it
this is a great idea that i can get behind in addition to the jb jump bridge checking your cargo bay for fuel to activate there should also be an option to check for any fuel in any stations in the constellation maybe region but that might be too muchon another note bittergin minigin needs to go back to his own mega fail thread about nerfing jump bridges and stay there honestly man you want to make something that needs fixed even worse stop smoking that illegal stuff and start making sense
see what i mean anyways lowcomedy aside nah that makes them gravely op with current mechanics at the very least in order to use a bridge you actually have to physically bring fuel to it making haulers or other ships vulnerable to attack while theyre adding fuel allowing ships to use their cargo holds removes a layer of unnecessary aggravation but allowing bridges to check stations to say nothing of all stations in a constellation allows a bridge thats functionally impossible for an enemy to keep unfueled if all you have to do is get to the bridge and click jump and you dont actually have to bring resources to it theres no way to prevent the flow of lo to the bring short of multiple corpthefts and robbing every corp that has an office in ever station in the constellation or even that station not a good idea
instead of vacuous raging please describe what hypocracy youve convinced yourself exists the word by the way is hypocrisy the suffix cracy denotes a form of government so hypocracy would be a government ruled by lower oxidation statesplease no more trolling about having to type a password is equivalent to jumping without a cyno or the server running battles for the players its obvious that you dont actually belive it and ive asked you to stop pretending that you have autism in order to troll people there are people with the disorder aspergers that youre pretending to have and in general they are some very decent people dealing with a very hard situation you mocking them by pretending to be autistic in order to troll people on an anonymous message board is a really really really slimy behavior there are people who have actual problems with obsessive and repetitive behavior rather than the stuff you engage in jut to troll people the nc the nc the nc there are people who actually lack fundamental semantic understanding and are unable to recognize the nuances of how language works its easier to not type a password than to type a password its easier to have the server decide fleet fights while you go grab a snack instead of piloting and its easier to be able to jump anywhere in eve without a cyno therefore theyre all an easy mode of play in the exact same way and there are people who actually lack empathy and the ability to understand where other people are coming from based on what you have said i will define how you can have fun and whether or not you are really having fun doing what youre doing for you to pretend to be autistic and mock them with your behavior simply to  people off on the internet is shameful and you really should be ashamed of yourself stop it autistic people have it hard enough without some guy on the net using their difficulties as some sort of sick joke sick and shameful do you actually have any logical arguments to contribute at all or is it simply ragetrolling would you like to calm down and start over and i can try to discuss whatever it is thats got you so angry without trolling
noi have a few old alts for somone to buy if this does go threw 3 from 04 and 2 from 05
i imagine if you ask anyone who has tried eve online and has not gotten deeper into the game after the trial most of the time theyre reply would be it takes forever to train for anything for long time eve players it is something that most wear with a badge of honor they are proud of the skills they have trained for and rightly so but for newcomers to eve it can be daunting eve in itself has a lot of options already that can overwhelm players and over the past addons some things have been added to try to make new players feel more welcome as well as corps like eve university and the like but one of the biggest hurdle is skill trainingthe bad thing about skill training is that while eve advertises itself as a game where anything is possible where you are not set in stone who or what you can be the training process pretty much restricts you you can only train one item at a time at first its not so bad because lower level skills do not take that long to train but once you get past those you start looking at better ships and fittings and then you start to see that for the better things it can require weeks if not months of trainingif you add more skills or go on a different path for a bit  it just makes the other thing you are training for take that much longereven with very high learning skills and implants it can still take a very long time to train things i think there should be things added to help new players better and those who have been in eve for a while but still need to skill upi think honestly skill remapping should be added a lot of people might not like the idea but at least say once every six months maybe or even just once a year you can change a certian percentage of your skills to something else if you want toanother idea would be for new accounts add double learning time for not just the first month or the first million skillpoints but maybe for the first year many older players might not like this idea butit would greatly help new players or players who have been in eve for a while but have not skilled up much to get into the game fasteranother option would be to allow for training two skills at a time that way a person can now have the option to explore two paths at once instead of being stuck on one narrow roadanother thought expand the training queue from just one day to a week or maybe even a month some people might not like that eitherbut lets face it do any of you really find it fun if you dont play too often to have to come in every day to recheck your skillsi think that can help also a system where you can inject skills you do not have the requirements for yet so that when a certain skill that is required for it trains up  you can train for itand also have it in the queue that as long as you have planned to train for a skill or set of skills that is required for a certain skill and have it injected it can be added to the queuei just think something like this should be thought about to really update the training systemit just takes way too long for people wanting to get into the game to really enjoy itand after a while they might either get too frustrated to figure out what to train or get tired of logging in nearly every day or every other day just to trian up they might end up leavingeve online has a lot of great things and its good that is has deep options and varied gameplay but also consider that sometimes things can be a bit too much for their own gooda player might see all the cool videos about pvp but then not realize if you really want to get into pvp you need a good ship with good fittings even smaller ships require a good setup to succeed often and that can take monthsnow im not saying lets turn this into a game where a powerleveler can reach max skills in a week im no where saying thatim just asking that some of these thoughts be brought up thanks
well that is what makes eve eve not everyone is supposed to like eve
while were at it lets make titans the starter ship ive always wanted to fly one of those
welcome to eve will you be staying long
so true jump bridges have needed changing for a long long time also lawl  nc scrubs trying to argue with minigin you actually have to understand game mechanics to argue in this thread and no one in the nc has even a base understanding of how this game works stfu scrubs
helloi believe that sovereignty is a broken game mechanic it is far to easy for large alliances to be able to pay for sovereignty rather than actually having to defend it they took sov at the change of the mechanic and then only have to ever defend it if someone decides to pay 350mil per stargate to contest it with unlimited resources isk one could run 10 men to take sov from many alliances one could blockade the many of systems one large alliance owns and take the ones they choose not to defendquoted from evewikieveonlinecomon tcu mechanics the structure is vulnerable to attacks while it is in the anchoring anchored and onlining states an online tcu is invulnerable unless both of the following conditions are fulfilledsovereignty blockade units are anchored and onlined at more than 50 of the gates in the systemthe sovereign entity over the system does not possess an outpostconquerable station nor an online industrial hub within the systemif this statement was revised to saythe structure is vulnerable to attacks while it is in the anchoring anchored and onlining states an online tcu is invulnerable unless one of the following conditions are fulfilledsovereignty blockade units are anchored and onlined at more than 50 of the gates in the systemthe sovereign entity over the system does not possess an outpostconquerable station nor an online industrial hub within the systemthis would require the large alliances to actually fight for their space which i believe they can do they just arent required to do by game mechanics the game was once a game for those who liked large scale battles and one for those who like small scale battles now small scale is not viable to contest sovi understand being part of the minority small warfare i will not have many followers in this thread but this isnt a popularity contest it is a request for fair game mechanics for all who play it thank you all for listening and for your time upon this subjectrespectfullysanicity
a further notesomeone brought to my attention if the tcu used stront to go into reinforced than it would give the alliance time to stage a defense reasonable arguementwith reinforced timerstront capacity being dependant upon sov levelagain thank you allsanicity
tbh nc will disagree with anything that promotes pvp because vuk doesnt approve of combatnot really sure about your idea but yes ccp really needs todo something about 00 to promote small gang warfare
hey whered the jita node go the other day everything was like all laggy and stuff cuz they were using worse equipment for the systemoh wait the nc was using it to kill russians and set the alltime concurrent user record for a single system u mad bro
youd be surprised even the large alliances are rather fed up with the way sov warfare works postdominion the system heavily favors defenders and only encourages both sides bringing enormous fleets to one point of contention i for one would be ecstatic to see a system in which small alliances can take and hold sovereignty from large alliances who are unwilling to at least mount a defensive effort as nice as being a member of the naptrain is having to fly 30 jumps to find someone to shoot at because every adjacent conquerable region is held by a rather small number of alliances is frustrating i dont support this specific attempt at a fix though because its trying to put a bandaid on a rather large problem and i also dont believe that sov issues can be truly fixed until lag is reduced to reasonable levels
stuffing everyone and their mother into one system is not pvptrolling aside id say the real issue with sov warfare atm is the timers not the ability to attack the tcu station  ihub hp is ridiculous and the timers on those are heavily weighted in a way that you can force an attacking force to fight you in your most effective tz thus allowing you plenty of time to cram as many people into a system as you possibly can to deter a good fight

hi alli have a techy question if anyone can answer it i have two gas planets yet one has more buildings on it than the other one and the only difference i can find is in the gas planet informaionone has a surface grav of 637ms2 and the other one has 121 ms2 does this mean that surface grav affects the ammount of buildings on the planets 
you sure that one planet isnt just bigger than the other pi modules are designed to look the same size on widly different planet sizes so your links could be hundreds of miles longer and consuming more powercpu eachps i dont think the assembly hall is the correct forum for questions like this just for future reference
moved from the assembly hall
planet size is the cause bigger planets use more power resources for links that look the same size as they do on a small planet
well i just got offered part 1 of 10 part storyline mission  guristas strike  and the expiration timer for that only shows 1 week instead of 1 month maybe that is due to the recent changes whatever the reason when patch notes are listed with specific information about changes made to the game ccp should stand behind those changes and if retracted or changed again inform us about iti still believe these important multipart storyline missions should all have the 1 month expiration timer countdown for all 10 parts
ill back thistbh id still like to see personalized designs done at least the same way as medals and visible on your vessel
or have people paint their own ships their own way but it only shows up on your account this way there is a purely graphic change on your client and you can take screenshots and videos to show it off out of game but people dont have to pay for your artistic failure in game a neon orange raven for example with sparkles
im not against a client side color changing idea but id much prefer being able to share the experience with my mates
possible software solutions some can be implemented as stand alone solutions or combined with others ip filter for those with static ip addresses if you have a static ip address you can check the option to limit your account to that ip address only regional ip filtering option every ip address is connected to some region and isp even if you dont have static ip address you can exactly know the rage of ip addresses that could be assigned to you that way the only possible attackers could be from your region that limits chinese hackers quite effectively dont you think issuing public cryptography keys to every account owner only clients with correct keys could access the account entire governments depend on this so its pretty safe force password change periodically it doesnt have to be anything too complicated actually imagine this system when you create an account and enter your password a file would be created on the server and sent to you as a link which gets deleted after xx days this file would be random in length for example a random length between 128 and 256 bytes and it will have random data in it you can save that file anywhere on your disk or usb stick or wherever you want when you log in to the game you are required to select that file on the login screen which then gets uploaded and verified on the server if theres a match between your file and server side file you are clear to log in this is technically somewhat like suggested hardware solution but you are not required to pay for it wait and pay for shipping and get all sorts of complications if you break the damn thing or lose it or it just dies because its made in some god forgotten part of the world where people work for peanuts force entering the name of one of your characters on the account every time you log in its not that effective but it would filter out some of the attacks 
 if you are going to rely on a public key infrastructure private key protection is essential for that reason it would be insane to store the private key on a platform as open and unsecured as a personal computer a look at the malware infection rates 
had you read the link i posted youd know paypal offers the same system for free using ones cell phone and text messages to send you a code as needed literally an app for thatim not suggesting that ccp need to force everyone to use this security system nor am i suggesting they force players pay for it if they dont wish to although i shall point out that given ccp makes about 15 dollars a month from each of us they could easily take 5 dollars from those payments and absorb the cost of producing these devices for new playersaccounts the cost could be rolled into the cost of the buying the game itself and this is only if ccp wants to force everyone to use it which they need not do
when tech 3 cruisers were introduced they were billed as the totally customizable ship you were supposed to be able to switch from an active shield booster fit to a cloaky bubble immune fit with the same ship as needed and while this has proved true to some extent something has always anchored the t3s down ever since they were released rigsthink about it every other module on the ship can be swapped out at a moments notice the entire ship can be disassembled and rebuilt into an entirely new ship except for the rigs when you install a rig you are committing to it it can only be removed by destroying it this is especially troublesome with t2 rigs as they are so expensive this is entirely counterintuitive to the purpose of the t3 cruiserscurrent rigs limit the customizability of t3 cruisers especially when t2 rigs are involved by forcing you to use a ship with a vast number of possible configurations as though it were just a single ship with a single loadoutsay i have a tengu its currently setup with a shield buffer and ham launchers making it an impressive straightforward combat ship since the ship is inherently expensive i decide to splurge on t2 core defense field extenders to improve the tanknow if i need to i cant convert my tengu into a covert ops setup without either leaving the t2 shield rigs on though they are useless to the covert setup or destroying them losing a large amount of isk in the processso here is what i propose tech 3 rigst3 rigs would have the same bonuses as t2 rigs but in the spirit of the modular design of the tech 3 cruisers they would be able to be removed without destroying them thus allowing you to swap them out with the rest of the ships modules this would allow the tech 3 ships to become the fully interchangeable platforms they were intended to be in addition it could be an opportunity to reduce the cost of t2 rigs and make them a little more viable in regular pvp as the way prices are now most t2 rigs are effectively offlimits to most pvpers think of how ludicrously expensive t2 rigs are now the price effectively prevents anyone or at least anyone in their right mind from fitting them to regular pvp ships t3 rigs would be balanced by the same principle t2 rigs would come down in price a bit somewhere between where they are now and t1 rig prices and t3 rigs would take their place as the expensive rigs though maybe not quite as ridiculously expensive as current t2 rig priceswhat do you think thoughts comments
forgot to support my own idea the bump doesnt hurt either
you make an interesting point howeverit might make sense to allow t3 ships to remove rigs any rigs but only a limited number of times for example a cccii might be removable up to 10 times before finally exploding where as a ccc1 only lasts five times
but why limit the t3s customization in any way to avoid nont3s from fitting removable rigs why would that matter most normal pvp ships will never have them becausea they dont need them to be effective nont3 ships are generally bought and used with a single setup in mindb the cost of the t3 rigs would make it not worth it to fit them to just any ship like current t2 rigshowever i believe its in the spirit of the game to leave the t3 rigs fitting options open to t1 and t2 ships rather than limit player choice in this case the balancing comes from the market rather than game mechanics or ship stats
bumped for the following reasons1 malcanis is awesome2 ingame inflation caused by macros and bots is as problem and needs to be fixed3 if 2 was fixed ccp would earn a good deal more from plex sales thereby eliminating the need for microtransactionsthink about it plex is just an exchange rate between ingame currency and rl currency if ingame currency can be created by russianchinesewhatever programmers who macrorat and courierbotnet their way to billions then plex is just buying some small slice of what those automated producers can provide on the other hand if plex bought the careful attention of a limited  of human players theyd be worth much more and players would supply morei completely fail to understand why this isnt a much higher priority for ccpccp

i think you misunderstand what test server isits not for us to test out plexs and ships we cant on tq its for ccp to test new patch releases and do their best to work out all the bugs before it goes live plexs can be scanned out on sisi just like on tq with the same odds actualy better odds since almost no is searching for them go out to a 10 true sec and scan till your heats content youll find em
actually it iswith every patch ccp would want the people using the test server to test every aspect of the game were possible this includes stuff you do with npcsalso i cant remember exactly were but it has been stated that the test server while also being there for patch testing is also ment to be used for ship testingafter all how else would one test the effects of changes to shipsalso you might want to ask yourself this why has ccp bothered placing all those beacons in fd 
so then your saying its a good way to test all aspects of plexs by having them a spawn in systems they wouldnt on tq b respawn everytime its completed like anoms c not have to do all the foot work involved with the scanning out of the plexs as required on tqmy statments stands if and when they make ship changes most times they give you the ships as a reward to test for bugs etc plexs arent broken or being changed with these future updates although incursion will add a different kind of plex and those are being spawned in a few systems just for the sake of testing not this current version of the mirror but the one upcoming in a week or twothe spawing of ships and plexs is not what sisi is about its the testing of current changes
so any update on blob warfare  while i appreciated your reply 2 months ago it doesnt really change the fact that blob warfare has been one of the major problems with 00 and still is being ignored yet blob masters such as vuk lau continue to be hypocritical saying they would love to get rid of blob warfare however not only does he ignore his own priorities he also promotes blobbingstuff like this doesnt really help ccp with anything how can ccp work with a team that arent even consistent with what they believe in its like the saying goes practice what you preach and this by far was one of the biggest priorities csm agreed on yet once again least spoke aboutthe assembly hall in the last 2 months has increased in antiblobbing threads people are getting fed up with how numbers are ruining eve with recent battles increasing past 3200 people are losing faith in both csm and ccp especially since expansions such dominion were meant to promote encourage smaller alliances to enter 00 heavy abuses of blobbing are nc who managed to have 2200 people within one system which was less than 50 of their nap list since western nc was busy with ev0ke just to counter 1000 players which resulted in the server lagging  3200all that has changed is ccp working on fixing lag which historically will return due to the mechanics of blob warfare players are tired of blobbing hypocrisy and ideas given to ccp that only helps a few players
blob warfare was supposed to be addressed with the dominion expansion ccp has stated they wanted small gangs to affect sov with the dominion expansion what we got was another half finished expansion with sov structures consisting of mega hp so the only way to contest sov in a resonable time frame was to increase the blob and blob with supercaps excelence at its best the half finished system now so grossly favors the defenders that they litterally have to not want that space anyway for the attackers to have a chance at capturing any space at allevery 00 sov holder applauded the dominion expansion as ccp stated the goals but when it went live every 00 sov holder was dissapointed and the only comfort they could gather wasat least its not pos bashingpos spammingccp finish the dominion expansion
the lack of understanding here is shocking as is the incoherent rage the very term blobbing has no meaning at all its a contentfree snarl word most of the time simply used to describe someone who can field more numbers than you can lets not kid ourselves here its hardly an objective claim is 21 blobbing how about 32 41 claims that ccp somehow has to fix the fact that all other things being equal greater numbers will have an advantage over fewer numbers are simply ignorant what can ccp possibly do to alter the dynamics of reality itself and no fixing dominion wont get rid of it you have a csaa pos someone else wants to take out well if they can raise twice the numbers you can they have a much better chance of destroying it you have a moon mining pos someone else wants to take down and tower up for themselves well if they can raise twice your numbers they can take down your pos put up their pos and defend it so that you cant take it back you have a station that someone else wants wellcomplaining that in an mmo of all places gasp shock horror people are working together in groups to beat other people working in groups but gosh darn some of those groups are larger than the other groups so its just not fair well lets say charitably that it simply misses the point if people cannot handle the fact that in an mmo there may be a mass of mutipleplayers online who can oppose you then mmos arent for them single player games can have a finely tuned degree of balance say mass effect 2 even on insanity mode never overwhelmed you with more than you could possibly handle there were no complaints that the husks were blobbing you even when they outnumbered you because the game devs specifically crafted a balance so that the individual player would always have a pretty decent shot to fight through and win but people seem not to understand that there is no such balance and nor should there be in a game that isnt a singleplayer gameand for some reason we see this whine and dont simply laugh yet if it was another game we all would if someoneme wanted to play modern warfare 2 online without it being so unfair while they were one guy against a squad of 8 players and how they wanted infinity ward to fix the game so that numbers werent so decisive if one guy was playing team fortress 2 against 16 other people and complaining that he should still have a fair chance to defend his flag as well as capturing the enemy flag wed laugh at him but when its the exact same thing in eve all of a sudden its serious biznezz and ccp had better do something about the fact that mathamatics holds true in reality math will always hold true in reality theres nothing to be done about it demanding that ccp stop math from working is to put it gently quixoticps if you want an mmo which does its best to get the fairness thing that people seem to want world of warcraft has instanced areas with strictly limited groups that are able to enter that seems to be what some people want so rather than asking eve to change to that model it makes much more sense to go to a game that already has it
quoted for awesome and i suggested it first via twitter
cover my ticket and entry to fanfest and i will be glad to show you around all the barsbarbaras is pretty good even if the dj cant actually mix any beats togethertamber
good idea there could be held in a phone box maybe 
you know what would be hilarious if csm could get a summary of all the stuff they agreed  disagreed with during the elections and be asked why half of the ideas were ignored despite being a priority for many years and why some of the stuff people want to change are still promoted
it had never been an issue before when alliances have used this now all of a sudden it is an exploit and people who do that are bad bad people please the gross incompitance of ccp to provide propper documentation for their game as to what is and is not allowed is enough lets not tarnish their good name by dragging accusations of gm involvement in helping an alliance especially bobkenzokuit get rid of a problem for them
supjust wondering when the new feature of exchanging 2 plex for character transfers was introducedpretty sweettd
locked for ranting not a suggestion for the csm
still not fixed
i like the idea of removing the sins turrets but rather than just add one drone controlled per level give a 99 reduction in cpu and power for drone control units make them eat up 5 of those 7 high slots if they want to operate 10 dronesadd to that a 20 bonus to drone damage and an additional 200 power cap and its a winner
no ofc not lol
cosmetic only and convenience as wellno to spimpartial to remapsyes to nifty dealys for our characters to wear and look pwnyes to things that make our ships look cooler while changing nothing in the ways of performance of said shipsyes to more characters training  research agenting  etc on a single accountfine with anything that is lesser than the best that can already be obtained ie better than t1 not as good as t2faction or somewhere around therehowever i will not quit if microtransations are added or not added in any shape or form if someone else wants to pay isk for virtual items that make them better until they get blown up why would i care the sort of nice thing about eve vs other games is aside from sp things are not forever i would not buy modules or anything else that would be lost when a ship was destroyed i do buy things in other games so there you have it from someone that does support mts in other games  it just doesnt work in eve i would oh so love ship skins though especially if we could design our own the car designer in nfsc comes to mind 
so microtransaction startedmove a character 2 plexchange face 2 plex
noit is a stupid idea within the eve framework and any first step would likely be the thin edge of the wedge
noid have to be ed to vote no i value ccp as one of the few great and wise ones but i can not believe that vanity wouldnt soon become just a slight boost and after that mandatory if you want to undockthere is no greater temptation than money and if money starts to flow in more will follow unless we stop it here and now
we already have microtransactionswant a faction shippay 35 buy 2 plex sell 2 plex buy shipwant a new characterpay 350 buy 20 plex sell 20 plex buy new character 7b isk will get you 35m50m spthe proposals are going the other waywant a new portraitgrind 700m isk 7 days buy 2 plex get new pici vote no to unlimited plex for remaps should nuke learning skills anyway or plex for spplex for sp  game killer why sp are the most important commodity in the game if you can buy themplex price upvalue of mining ratting pi moon mining down earn less plex per houralthough thinking through it eventually players would be better off buying 2 plex selling for 20b each made up number and then buying the ships they want driving the price of ships up and the value of minerals up so there would be a new equilibriumwhy are we complaining again wont the player market sort it all out anyway the only real complaint i see is that sp give the game a goal that is never attainable there is always moar and to allowing sp to be bought instantaneously would basically kill that dynamic basically it would kill the thing that has everyone addictedsurely ccp sees that though it is like getting the 100000 broadsword in dd game over move on not fun if i can pay 500 buy sp buy tengu fly in c5 wormholes in a matter of minutes well what is the fun i can already pay  buy tengu but i cant fly it unless i hunt around the character bizarre for a tengu character of which there are not unlimited sso yeah no isk for sp other than that i say who cares we are already there

i see youre saying that the risk of having something unrecoverable stolen due to account sharing should be an effective limit on account sharing i dont know that that is the case i have heard of several situations where someone sharing an account just reported it as hacked and had their charactersitems returned the article in evenews24 is the most recent such report of such a situationif ccp where serious about account sharing violations they would have ip based access control and would be issuing warnings and temp bans for suspicious access ive actually never heard of them doing this personally i think they dont really care until it causes them a support ticket you are right security keys could remove one of the possible risks in sharing an account however there is still the risk to assets corpalliance roles reputation and i dont think that that those risks are really an effective deterrent in the first place i think that the pain of communicating the keys pass phrase for every login would make most account sharing folks choose to use just passwords and not get a key
agreed
should be part of the normal course of maintaining the game and hence not a waste of programmer time and effort
sounds like a good idea to me supported
my idea behind it is that that roaming in small gangs is very time consuming without actualy travelling far my idea behind it is to shorten this warp speed is a good way to accompish this a 20 reduction in a 45 hour roam 3 hour of warping is an exta 36 minuts time saving that u other wise spend staring at an almost static screen
that wasnt trolling  it was honestytrolling would probably have been either funnier or sadderthe issue is at its heart that small gang warfare has gone the way of the dinosaur in eve but warping to more places faster will not fix that
your small gang may be able to move around and find targets more quickly but so can the blob that will overwhelm you and so will the extra ships hiding in the next system who want to join the fight to make it 2v1 odds and so will the supposed lonewolf baitships support be able to get into the fight and annihilate you before having a small chance to do something about itbad idea combat is not bottlenecked by how slow warping isif its for transporting large amounts of stuff in a freighter deal with it it should take much longer to move hundreds of ships in one go than fly them one or a few at a time in an industrial hullj
youd still have at least 1 session change per system after jumping in so the potential for time savings is perhaps not as great as the op indicates that said supported
as others have said theres no particularly compelling reason to increase warp acceleration rate across the board but id like to see varying rates of acceleration according to ship size
eve is too small as it is this will just make it smaller
i currently own a comet that does 117 aus and for most jumps i spend more than half of it speeding up and slowing down accelerationdeacceleration should be in line with aus speeds a ship that goes 9 aus should acceleratedeaccelerate 3 times faster than a ship that only goes 3 aus
pos managementas we all know at the moment it is very difficult to make member specific poss in a corporationthis thread will supply you with a problem and a reasonable and absolute solution to start off with corps at the moment cannot efficiently manage a pos for a specific member you must give them a certain level of rights that could jeopardize your corps poss as well as others poss one must asign a dodgy role to do so and with that role that they must maintain they could easily thieve another pos another temporarily solution is to allow the pos to be configured via corp or alliance this is not very safe seeing as anyone at that point could then take down their posmy solutionthe solution is very simple and not difficult to implement and i am sure many would appreciate it there should be an option on a pos to assign a specific person in a corp absolute power over every function of that specific pos and only that person could manage the pos if they wanted to assign more specific roles to a friend of theirs they would have their own role management menu but only for the pos that they own you may ask yourself but what about people who have config starbase equipment roles anyone who has fuel and config roles for starbases would still be able to take down any pos regardless of whos it is in that case only high officials would need that role for security reasons i believe this solution is a reasonable one another final management option on a pos should be to choose to keep the pos under the same current system we have now this system would be called a corporate system in other words not a member pos but a corp pos that would still be managed with the same roles we have nowpros  more effective control over poss privacy and selfprotectioncons there are none
just letting you all know i definately support my own proposal
i agree with this it would lower the amount of corp thieves and make managing a pos a lot more easiersupports
sounds less like a fix and more like a bandaid or a quick patch while it solves the i want my own pos problem it doesnt solve the whole corp shared pos issue right now and under your proposed system someone needs access to the entire pos at a minimum to be able to do anything they need their own wallet their own corp hangar everything they also need access to see everyone elses jobsi think that needs to be fixed more so than having an entire pos to yourself i dont know how popular the idea is but it seems that at least some people setup a pos for the entire corp to use for themselves as well as the corp itself that means members can research their own bpos manufacture whatever right now that means each member needs their own wallet division corp hangar and the role to view and cancel everyone elses jobsi think it would be far more useful to stop doing it how its done now to treat a pos more like a mini station that can only be used by the corp to let members set up jobs from their personal hangar and their personal wallet skills for remote researchmanufacture required of course have the materials in their personal station hangar set up the job as with any npc station except select the pos array and presto i like your idea i just think it needs expanded more it only solves the issue for moon mining and such
i was saying that what my fix does is allow any module that is anchored on a pos to be the sole property of that specific pos owner if the owner wanted to he could lease out rights to certain modules to members of his corporation using his own control system
any more pros or cons to consider
i like it should work for research tooa compromise if ccp doesnt like this is maybe make it only work in a pos arraylab this eliminates the only con that has been thought of thus far i feel open to all is a better option than restricting it to just pos users though id rather have it for just poss than not at alli too would also like to see it not take up another spot if you are queuing after your own job ie if i want to make 1000 runs of emp s then 1000 runs of emp m right after it i should be able to queue those up in that order and only use 1 manufacturing skill slot basically have it work like the skill queue in a way this would need an interface redesign though  not a bad thing i actually tried doing this once just assuming itd work like that because it made senseps menu option name suggestions queue in successionsuccessive queue  queue one after another in the same slot queue multiple  queue each in its own slot
not supported unfair simply you also want to remove all 5 imps and give ppl isk back so everyone trains equal omg lolz no way not supporting
learning skills are a pain in the ass this fix is doable surprisingly in a matter of hours instead of days might take ccp a day or two to work out all the bugs lolololol but learning skills are just an overall pain in the arse i would personally rather start being able to pew pew someones head off at day one than spend several months training learning skills nevertheless keep learning implants that is only fair imo
signedi support the original posters idea
as a relatively new player i have this to sayi did not like training them but i did train them a bit on my main this character and my alts that i mademy friends that i got to join did not like training them but agreed that the eventual benefits were worth the waitmy friends and i are in agreement that it still takes too long as a new player to not suck as someone else somewhere else on the forum said you basically sign up make a skill plan and wait 46 months to start playing im not sure what there is out there to fix this if anything but if ccp removes learning skills and doesnt make up for the training time increase then this is just made worseso i agree with the original post to a point if learning skills are removed or made otherwise ineffectual it will not bother me as long as i get the sp back to use on other skills in some form and something is added to replace the benefit they provided either more base attribs to assign or some speed bonus maybe an implant i dont know i still spent time training them my one character got them to 54 so i should get to keep that sp to spend on something elsefor 3 on the original post the 10000 faster thing is odd i think they should just go back into the unallocated sp pool im not 100 sure how that works as i wasnt around for that whole free sp thing but im aware of its existence and it sounds about right for this
i am new to this forum and i am surprised at the fervour with which this topic has been discussed i have always viewed the learning skills as tools i was prepared to get them to a level with which i felt the costbenefit ratio was right for me and then got on with the job of getting other skills i dont think that i would lose much sleep if the learning skills disappeared so long as i was compensated for the effort i originally put in in the end its all one to me if they go or stay
not supportedi didnt like training them but the playoff is well worth it
troll yes plz giev mah sp now so i can trains dreadtrollokay now that thats out of my system lets begini started reading this and my view was are they serious why on earth would they remove them but then i talked with few buddies of mine that i attempted to get to play earlier on and suddenly i found more interest from their direction as i flashed this ideabottom line is that as said before they feel that these skills are something that must be trained as the first skills in eve being older gamers we feel the need to minmax but they are at the same time unwilling to pay for their subscription for several months before they can even start training skills needed to fly tacklers with me or maybe salvager for mish running if were in empirewhat im trying to say here is that even with this minor change in the skill training system i got more interest and im certain it is not limited to just my friendsnow to the method of how it should be paid back i admit having 35mil sorry 54 only sp gone missing would  me off big time but i trust this is not the way theyd do it as it would be a big you note for everyone playing currently  in immediate future and as such would highly outweight any possible benefit now if it would be given us to freely redistribute then being the jerk i am i would gladly accept it would give me instant access to rather few ships that aside i dont think anyone would mind it other than losing their sph advantage over newly started but they do have severe lead already that cannot be brought down unless the newbie suddenly gains access to 5s and the older player has 4sbeside i dont mind even then as i already am proficient with my selected ships the newbie would have to train them all to be at same line and even then id have something morebottom line on contrary to my original reasoning i am for this and would like to vote my support on the condition that i am refunded the sp spent on learnings if this is not met whatsoever i cannot help but to feel violated i wont make any futile threats that i quit as i know damn well i wont but still it would make me as owner of 2 accounts very sadinsert sad panda face
i only became for this idea when they put in the floatingsp system where i could put sp where i wantednow i want that 54m sp to put where i wantgiev plz honestly though both my accounts already have 55 so i dont care how this ends up i would not mind being able to max out some of the more esotetic racial skills with that sp though relatively painlesslyi suppose i can also understand the plight of the rookie in which it is an annoying obstacle to get to the fun of the game however when i started playing back in my day lol it was seen as sort of a its good do it when you want to get around to it sort of thingi blame impatient older players trying to force perfection onto rookies for the current stigma that it needs to be done right away
i dont like the idea of plex for remaps
i will not buy plex with isk or with  to obtain remaps however i am not against other people doing iti am impartial this change does not effect me and it seems it doesnt really effect anyone most of the people downing it seem to think it will just be the start of something bigger if it stops here i dont care if its addedas much as id personally love the idea of me being able to buy sp for  its no fun if everyone else can so i do have to down vote that lolps to everyone thats all micro transactions are the devil11 ebil i say ebil1111 i have 2 things to say1 1750 its not 15 why does everyone keep saying that its 352  1750 is hardly a micro transaction2 ccp is obviously aware that they will have to add them eventually to compete with other mmosnow poor ccp is like well if we cant add that  what do we add then i came up with the following1 skins for ships id buy those id pay maybe 1skin 2skin if it was themed in a way that was licensed from someone else see example below as long as there was enough that itd be somewhat unique if there was only 2 choicesship i would not pay if there was 10 i would i would absolutely not pay if the skin was lost with the ship destruction even if it was 10 cents per skin
we already have microtransactionspay 35 for 2 plex sell plex buy nifty battleshipso i think you guys should be more precise in your protesti hear two thingsmy interpretation which are the following1 high sp characters should remain unique in other words you shouldnt be able to buy sp or train sp faster remaps by using isk or  this preserves the uniqueness of high sp characters and makes them more rare i agree w this2 plex should be the sole link between  and isk and the price should remain high no one wants you must pay 1 to fight in system xuy023 or to buy that skillbook you need 2 by keeping plex relatively expensive it prevents this type of thinking even though economically it is still part of the game that helps roleplaying also decreases the hassle factorfwiw  sp are currently purchaseable via the character bazaar so it is inaccurate to say no  for sp the supply of characters however is very constrained and the transfer fee sets a floor on the types of characters that are tradeableif the transfer fee is removed we could very easily see a character bazaar filled with all types of characters trained in just 1 skill in that way you could buy skills but as is  at 20 or 725m isk  it is too expensive to have trade such characters that menas it is only practical to buy characters are the upper levels of the game or with significant  investment 2b isk  35 x 3  105i think the discussion would be much better with more succint points1 keep sp purchasing rare2 maintain the  to isk exchange rate at 35 minimum regardless of isk value
i dare say it bumping this thread there has not been enough opinionsflaming
considering it costs less than 2 million to start a new corp id say this is a bit on the high sidethe key is finding the balance point where people who dont want to fight arent constantly getting grieved because believe it or not its not fun but someone cant just corp hop to run npc missions with no taxi think a flat fee  bid system is one of the better ways to resolve it the aggressor would pay the initial fee which really should be in the range of 50100m target can match maybe at a 10 discount or so to cancel before war goes active if they do the aggressor can raise their bid to any amount and the target would have to repeat the process to cancel itof course corporation creation fees need a bit of an adjustment too so as to not insanely buff corp hopping
my lord that is an epic idea i like it i second your idea
why not just scale the price to the number of members either it could scale based on the compared amount of members ie if you have 2x as many members as the corp you want to wardec it costs twice as much as normal or it could be a fixed price based on your member count ie 10mil per memberexample for a comparative fee say the normal price is 100m10 man corp wants to dec 10 man corp 100m10 man corp wants to dec 100 man corp 100m20 man corp wants to dec 10 man corp 200m100 man corp wants to dec 50 man corp 200m100 man corp wants to dec 10 man corp 1000mfor fixed price based on member count itd just be like 10m  members or 20m  members or whatever amount is decided uponthere should be some sort of mechanic or rule to prevent people from just having everyone leave the corp place the war dec and rejoin perhaps something like standing where it takes a week for the system to recognize there is less members in the corp but not for more members or some other smart feature that makes it unrealisticannoying to trick the systemcould also factor in corp age too deccing a significantly younger corp could increase the price perhaps using an average age average the age of all characters in the corp having lots of younger alts join wont help you defeat this when placing decs because then you will have more members which raises the price for placing a dec on someone else or will decrease the price for placing a dec on you by a larger corp so this one combined with the above balances itselfanother option independent of those is maybe pay a fee to concord as an isk sink for protectionimmunity from war decs in highsec the fee should be quite large significantly more at least double than it costs to place a war dec and should scale to the number of members you want to protect ie 200mil  10m  member count the fee should not cancel any war decs already in place so paying it will not make decs go away or be unable to be removedrenewed that means you have to pay it all the time if you want the protection also you cannot place wardecs while protected and any you have should cancel it should also take a day to initiate just like a war dec doessince threats for most corps are not all the time and the fee will be high enough per member it would likely only be used by corps with absolutely no interest in pvp it wouldnt pay any corp which could properly defend itself against most threats to pay the fee that means only pure pve corps would use itthis would also give corps that target rookies a recruiting advantage since they could promise safe well eve safe corp playperhaps add another penalty to it such as concord adds 5 tax to all members in addition to whatever your corp taxes so if your corp wants to tax 10 and concord adds their 5 and all your members take a 15 tax which is a lot and they arent going to like thatanother option for a penalty is to still allow war decs but only protect the targets in very high sec say 07 and aboveperhaps also make the option unavailable for very old corps after say a year the option becomes unavailable though this might be unfairfor the record i prefer the first option over the second but am happy with eitherin any case i support an increase in war dec fees either as stated in the original post or as i just stated
well ancyker ive heard that idea proposed before and at the time i liked it the problem is we have to think like ccp and think of a way to make changes that will cost next to nothing to implement and  off at least half of the player base the amusing thing is that the pvp base thinks ccp sucks up to the carebears and the bears think that ccp sucks up to the pvp crowd on average i just see a lot of sucking on ccps behalf but im not sure that any one group is at the center of it jk ccp 3 though in all seriousness one day well all wake up and realize that we have ccp right where they want us i just hope they include a tube of ky with incarna
i guess the general gist of this thread minus a few trolls is the fact that corporation on corporation wardecs need to be increased in price i will admit an alliance in 10 wars that cost 550 mil does seem a bit high but overall fair if you consider the fact that wardecs are by choicei am going to edit the proposal and change it to something on more general terms there needs to be a change to the cheapness of wardecing prices in high sec and that there needs to be an increaseany other mechanic fixes i would like to be avoided in this thread yes they can be suggested but the overall goal is to adjust the wardec costs towards market inflation the more complicated the change the less likely it will ever be fixed or adjusted keep that in mind folks ccp only has a very small team if any focused on fixing bugsmaking adjustments in eve if you want eve stop rushfixing a few of their releases there is a quality control thread excellence somewhere around here post in there too and give opinionseve excellence
since people are obsessed with comparing blobbing to rl i figured why not add rl related stuff in gamea while ago a npc crashed his nyx into a station i think players should be allowed to crash their super caps into stations destroying the station and super cap completelythis is very much like rl like where people crash trucks into shops and cars into houses and has already been done in eve already so why notin addition to crashing into stations they should be allowed to self destruct causing huge aoe damage or crash into other super caps causing both target and said suiciding cap to diethis happens in rl and has happened in eve by npcs therefore it should be allowed by playerswhen a supercap hits a station station will turn to rubble will not be dockable and all loot  assets will be able to be collected  looted with a huge  destroyedwhen a supercap activates self destruct an aoe like effect similar to titans old dd will be caused destroying thousands of sub capswhen a supercap crashes into another super cap both super caps will diejust like rl1
never stop posting
just like rl1
i propose that eve should actually be like this trailer
yes the abbadon should have the orb of death attack that 1hits titans and other cap ships
militia outfitsuniforms are a good idea im not sure about showing corpalliance logos on clothing  either it would be too small to be noticeable or too large to be realistics you dont see the nation leaders nowadays with huge us flags on their shirts maybe allow alliances to design their uniforms in a similar ways corps can design their logos  ie picking from a relatively large set of optionssupporting my own proposal
supported
could be like how sports teams have their name in big letters on the back having say a jacket with your corp logo on the back to go with more normal clothing maybe
more like a black leather biker jacket with a guristas pirates symbol on the back supported
oh man this is totally catering to my secret dictator fetish in which i am the ceo and i make a bunch of awesome medals for myself and the people who actually do work in my corp dont get them i do though
i second that fully decorationscorp and race military uniformsone step forward to bringing the eve feel back to eve
something i wish eve let you do was put kills on your ships so say you get a solo kill in an ishkur on the ishkur you got that solo kill in you could paint that kill on the sidedunno if anyone else has ever thought this would be an awesome idea but sounds kinda like this so thumbs up
1  make it so you can get local back with a communucations array anchored at a pos with an ihub module installed like cyno beacons
also if more than 30 people are in local it will display the number of people in local but not who they are this way you can keep track of blob battles in systems that are not controlled
thats very true though id have to say that only occurs when youre manually piloting while in warp  theres no chance ccp would ever implement that  though avoiding celestials when using autopilot warp seems very possible
supporting with maini guess this is more of a symbolic gesture than anything else at this point but hey there you go
updated to reflect volume instead of weight
i agree i dont like having to keep an empty station container sitting around to check volume there should be a way to see the volume of a stack of items as well as multiple stacks doing maths is lame yo seriouslythis doesnt change the game play at all so there is no con its a very simple feature to add i imagine and there really isnt a reason not to add itps adding it in a menu is odd just display it on hover so when 1 itemstack is selected display volume of it when multiple items are selected display combined volumefor hoveringgiant secure container  3000 m310  veldspar  1 m3125042 items  1320 m3
it would be useful supported
indeed ancyker i didnt think of a hover approach to visualization i wonder though if that would be a nuisance in the long run to have a volume tool tip pop up every time you hovered over a group of selected items too long
issuethere is a problem on large planets that cause the placements of structures to be very long the length of this distance causes the power consumed by the links to be far greater than on any other smaller planet this graphics problem prevents the placement of at least one building processor extractor because of the extra power consumed by the extralong linksthe length of the links are forced upon the user the interface will not place the structures any closer than approximately 120km whereas on any other planet the distance is more like 20km i am told via petition that the reason for this is because of the distance of a pixel something about a pixel and the scale of the graphics of the larger planet its great to have an awesome looking environment to play in but why should the realism of the planet size come at the expense of consistency in the way that we interact with the planets its a trade of realism for the looks of the graphics for the realism of the placement of the buildings the prevention of placing my building at 20km because of a graphics pixel is not realistic not to mention illogicalthere is no documentation informing the effect that planet size has on the placement of buildingsit is very frustrating to go through the process of placing a colony on a planet exactly the same way you have for three or four other planets and find out this planet is different somehowproposal1the ultimate solution is of course to change the internal mechanics so that the size of the planet does not affect the placement of the structures on the planet 2change the gas command centers so that they have more powergrid to account for this pixel problem3add a note on command center description that explains the issue of problem size give a specific limit of planet size that will cause this issue for instance a planet greater then size x will cause this issue
you just spent an entire week ranting about how things are working as they were intended and then you say jump bridges need to be fixed they arnt easy enough to use yetlets not throw stones in glass houses
there is a bit of a difference between not having to enter a password to jump every time and having the game make tactical decisions for the player locking  selecting ammoccp have been trying across the board to make some of the tedious things easier to get through stuff like align to on bookmarks it was possible to do before by know which celestial the bm was near and aligning to that instead or manual aligning now its less steps to go through to accomplish the same thing the player still has to setup the bms and plan ahead to use them sarcastic suggestion how about being able to warp to anywhere at any range instantly see what i did there bit of a difference stuff like combat hotkeys that are coming in incursion shortcuts to give your ship tactical commands the player is still thinking and making the decisions just easier to execute them not having to enter a password every bloody time is not going to give a player advantage it would simply remove one of the needless tedious annoyances in the game again i think bridges could use a look at balancing but making them awkward and annoying as a balancing point is fail did you get around to reading some of my other ideas on dominion sov battles 
yes there are some bigger fish to fry but theres no reason they cant fry a few shrimp too most bridges only circumvent a few jumps in a long haul across the ncs jump bridge network were actually lucky to cut the jumps to destination in half with bridges example to get to lxq for me by bridge is 25 jumps 39 by gate to gate yes its a difference but not several hours difference as you seem to suggest by your 20 mins per bridge comment if we want to balance how effective bridge are in moving people around well their being annoying to use should not be part of that balancing its just frustrating i dont really agree that 00 is boring because of the big coalitions i think that people are going to group up until a practical limitation in the group is reached it is human nature and ccp encourages this in eve what makes eve boring in light of the big coalitions is that there are few opportunities for smaller independents to compete and that the mechanics that artificially determine who controls sov encourage large blob warfare definitely not what we expected when ccp described their intention for dominion to have emergent and declarative sov controli expected something very much like how the industrial and military indexes worked simply being in the space defending it exploiting it would give you claim over a system a combination of pve and pvp achievements would gain and maintain sovbe interrupted from pve or slaughtered in pvp and your control would waineven if tcus and sbus and such where removed completely which i wouldnt cry about capital fleets would still have a place in attacking key infrastructure like those bridges you like going on about if you really want to focus on the bigger things we could do to improve the 00 game lets ive given you several opportunities to discuss and you just stick to your trollish hardline of raging on the nc
its quite obvious that i am not a defeatist i have presented multiple times ideas for improving dominion on a scale much greater than simply jump bridges and it is ccp that is encouraging the nature to form large political groups its part of their ideology for this gameive given you several chances to have a discussion about things that might actually help the gameplay but you persist in drilling anti nc into everything you say and squeezing every ounce of conflict out of the smallest of disagreements passwords on a bridgeit is you who is ridiculous
again you are lying and trolling i believe that the harshest word used so far has been annoyance of course you are a liar and claiming that there is any outrage going on oh and speaking of you trollingx2 of course if you actually have a problem with human nature people will often cooperate if it brings them an advantage math 2 is more than 1 3 is more than 2 and a mass of multipleplayers online who evince human nature and a basic understanding of math then obviously eve is not the game for you again there are quality single player games out there for you and if you like trolling people online or whatever then you can go play wow which has balanced instanced dungeons rather than letting any number of people who want to cooperate work against any number of people whore opposing them yes a minor annoyance like having to hit a g key or retype 36 letters is hardly a major issue its a shrimp in comparison to real fish that have to be fried but removing minor annoyances is likewise an absurd reason to get you ragetrolling
look no offence to you but your ideas are not particularlly good on the sov mechanics they are extremely hard to impliment and furthermore it ignores a lot of issues with alliances being able to exploit stuff like third party involvement avoiding fights etcyour system isnt reasonable to be implimented and it will never be looked at by ccp for pretty obvious reasonsthe way to go isnt change things again because there will always be unforseen problems the way forward is actually to go back imoregions need to be made of extremely different value travel needs to be significantly impeeded for larger entites and if i had my way removal of the standings system  another thing which should be looked into is exponential rates to be enforced on space holding to limit alliances taking space they arnt usingif you want to form a large alliance you have to formalise it and deal with the problems that come with a lumbering entity not this garbage where you can maintain the benefits of being a smaller alliance and derive all the benefits of being a giant super alliance with lion feet and eyes of rubyof course who are we kidding some dev is just going to run along and say wouldnt it be cool if and sov will remain ed
and this is why mini needs to leave eve and go to wow already same old whine mini wants easy mode and ccp has to give it to him not that travel should be impeded for smaller entities nah but its the larger ones there shouldnt be any sort of synergistic emergent behavior as has been designed into the system from day one and is a feature working as intended as always this issue is really about mini being impotent to accomplish change in eve and wanting ccp to do it for him larger entities eg anybody who can work together to field more forces than mini can deal with need to be ed over by ccp and again mini simply doesnt understand eve and cant adapt so mommy ccp needs to save him and give him easy mode hes even against the ability for people to work together at all past the alliance level and he also wants to be able to nerf any alliance thats bigger than his group so that they cant operate effectively just whatever happens ccp needs to make sure to alter game mechanics to help him since he cant do it in game to say nothing of how he is again pretending to be autistic an autistic person cant use enough empathy to figure out that people like having friends and compatriots and like having a team that can beat the other team mini understands that groups will work together but is pretending to have the same damage so that this even begins to make sense as if the eve playerbase couldnt simply filter their overview by tickers and not shoot at people they like and as if they too are ignorant of math and dont understand that 123 again he thinks that if he pretends to have autism and tries to make it really annoying to refute his nonsense he wins the internet anything to alter game mechanics so mini doesnt have to compete and again theres a sandbox a mass of multipleplayers are online using it and theyve found ways to carve it up but mini wants to stop that and is ignorant enough to think that lots of alliances are claiming sov and paying sov fees for space they really dont use then again hes probably lying as previously hes described using space for jump bridges as not using space how using something becomes not using it is probably only a troll that makes sense to mini again a nakedly obvious statement about how mini needs ccp to directly intervene to help him large alliances have more people cooperating and he cant figure out a way to fight them as a result ccp has to change the game and actually cause them problems so that theyre now lumbering and then maybe mini can accomplish things same old same old this isnt about game mechanics at all this is about altering everybody elses playstyles because mini cant compete or adapt
you are incredibly stupid if i wanted your space id come join your alliancedespite what you might think you arnt my mortal enemy because im not stupid enough like you to believe i should dislike people because they are in an alliance i am not allied with and on the other hand blindly support an alliance i am allied withyou talk about the sandbox and why this means ccp shouldnt place limitations on standings well thats the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard i dont think standings should ever have been included for example a big reason a sandbox game is the way it is is that decisions made by players can affect the outcome now if there are no standings available there is a decision given to the players merge into an alliance to get those extra numbers negotiate a nip or remain on neutralhostile termsthis is the hight of a sandbox game a sandbox game is not dont worry what you decide because you can just set standings to every entity this side of the hemisphere and your choices will be irrelevant from now on futhermore with any luck there will only be at most 2 or 3 super coalitions to chose from at any given time and their playstyle is essentially identical and largely unsupported by our serversrather than putting realistic and unintrusive measures in place to allow alliances to opperate as alliances but i guess im just a liar a troll and a spastic so hey lets just do what you think is right
so mini thinks its smart to lie and claim that anybody has ever said that he wants anybodys space at all andor he simply has no reading comprehension skills and believes thats a good basis to call someone stupid its a bit like saying there is no such country as brazil and youre incredibly stupid if you think there isits quality palatr his perpetual frothing sputtering incoherent babbling rage over the nc says otherwise of course liars have to have very good memories and minis evidently lasts about 12 seconds just a few posts up hes babbling about how he doesnt like nc guys oh yeah which is also funny because then his next lietroll is about how he doesnt dislike people based on which alliance theyre in mini is again proving that he is almost incapable of posting without lying and also that by his own definition he believes himself to be stupid i wouldnt go that far i think hes only pretending to be stupid he can of course not find anywhere that i said i dislike people in alliances im not allied with because he made it up in point of fact several of my buddies over the years have been in different alliances and enjoy different play styles but mini likes lying hes also inventing something whereby i blindly support anybody anybody whos read anything ive written about rzrnc ups knows that mini is again lying in order to troll you can also know hes doing that because today is a day that ends in the letter yhere mini demonstrates that he has no grasp on logic at all something is evidently ridiculous about a sandbox allowing the possibility of both cooperation and opposition with a straight face this raging antinc troll thinks that dont interfere with me and shoot on sight should be the only options but lets help each other is just wrong and breaks the sandbox im not sure but id wager that guilds in wow are pretty much along those lines and when they enter the instanced dungeons that would make mini happy due to no numerical advantages they have to fight as guilds and cant ally with other guilds not sure but it if so it seems that mini really should get over to wow already here mini is just trolling and doesnt even believe his own nonsense nonintrusive measures including geometric growth to sov fees not allowing alliances to set standings and only for larger entities travel beiong significantly impeded its up to a troll like mini to try to rationalize how significantly impeding someone is nonintrusive
lets help each other is lets join the same alliancei mean im not sure if you want to believe im raging or you want other people to believe it but im pretty sure your significantly more angry than i am as im yet to repetatively abuse you for pretending to be autistic
i dont see how they are difficult to implement at all eve already has military and industrial indexes that are tied to very granular activity metrics add another index for security and have it change based on killslosses insurance systems valuations rattingmining activity structure reinforcement and destruction i think it would do a great job of allowing an attacker to go up against someone who avoids fights or blobs pos infrastructure is key to almost all alliances in 00 if they dont show up to defend it put it into ref and that will deteriorate the security index there shoot the station services into incap more security index loss if they blob split up and attack lines of supply bridges and rattingmining systemsstations all of this varied battle will allow an attacker to widle away the security index of a sluggish larger opponent after the index has been reduced it could allow  faster sbu anchoring favorable station  hub timers attacker sets preferred timezone in sbu lower hp on structures perhaps through resist mods these are easy changes to implement in the existing sov endgame fights what i am suggesting would give smaller entities a chance to do something meaningful against a largeruncoordinated opponent but numbers will still matter a small alliance is not going to take and hold space in the territory of a larger entity it seems that you would have ccp put some arbitrary restriction on the size of fleets on the size of alliances on the size of groups of players so that a balanced fight may be had they have stated that these kinds of restrictions are against their very ideals for eveif we draw the line at alliances as you suggest then everyone will just form up into bigger alliances i agree we probably wouldnt have an alliance as large as the whole nc coalition but look at the recent it come back they have done quite well under a single banner approach 6000 members and then when were down to a couple mega alliances well be taking about eliminating alliances and keeping it to just corps so that small corps can compete in the world of mega alliances
i dont read anything about arbitrary restrictions in minigins suggestions hes just saying rightly that the fact you can designate a clearly visible blue bff status to a limitless number of otherwise unknown to you players makes the catherding of coalition forces a much more feasible processi dont think removal of standings is a panacea myself but id sooner see simple changes like that rather than some bloatfilled overhaul of sov with more indexed and confounding metagaming
im not suggesting confounding metagamessimply this get your fleet and go do damage to your opponent damage their assets damage their activity level just hurt them in any way and it will be affected in the security index a wide array of strategies to weaken an opponent become viable means to conquer space no longer is the only option to bring a huge blob to kill sov structures
wait so are you suggesting that if you dont defend your own space and actively the said index will dropi must admit its an interesting idea but i dont understand how this index would be related to kills and such eg an accidental roaming gang could end up taking sov or a tiney entity with no interest in sov may accidentaly drop the rating to a level where another entity may come and take advantage of that
youd have to quantify variables and values for every way that the index can be affected pretending for a moment there would be no obvious ways to abuse it i think it sounds overzealous trying to solve blobbing by creating a plethora of new sov objectives doesnt solve the problem of thousands of players being interested in defending a single system and my experience tells me it wouldnt stop another 3k fleet from forming up
yeah i know a simulator of a simulator nonetheless i think this idea has some meriti would like to see something like an eve arena where folks with fake ships as in virtual virtual ships could play on teams or solo in death matches team death matches capture the system or flag scanwars maybe and other minigames like that sort of like the bgs in wow but rather just to be something without any reward or loss so that it doesnt make up for pvp outside of the simulator its just a fun toy someone might use instead of station spinning i would also like to see this being available only in highsec stations while someone isnt at war or flagged for combat so someone couldnt  time away while they are being engaged by someone elsealso for mining i would like to see a drastic improvement to this by making a minigame out of it i would like to see something like an asteroid where you have to clear away nonvaluable ore in order to get to the good stuff without destroying the valuable materials in the process or be able to by chance have an asteroid have surprises inside like possibly remnants of old technology possibly a datacore or something like that hidden inside i mean this idea could be expanded on but honestly anything at this point is an improvement for miningthoughts
the idea of a simulator has come up numerous times before i think many of the things that you think would be great in a simulator could be organized by players such as tournaments races contests ext theres many of these events out there now and certainly room for more if you want a no riskreward ever fight go check out the test server there is a whole system on the test server setup with arenas for different ship classes and all conventional ships and fittings cost only 100 isk each its a playground of mayhem mining improvements have been talked about for some time ideas about about more interesting mining sites via scanning whole system belt mining comet mining planetary ring mining the list goes on and ccp has talked about them at the most recent fanfests well see where they go mining definitely needs love
hmm but honestly i would prefer it if there was a simulator like i mentioned where you dont need little games like races and pvp arena and such to be organized by players i would like it if there was something like a matchmaking system a ranking system and etc inside the simulatoryeah but id rather it just be on tranquility also id rather not have to switch servers just to have this function and im sure others would also like it if things were this way see my goal is to make mining an active experience a lot of industrial things in the game are just start it up and wait for it to finish id rather see the player take a very active part in the industrial side of eve i have to wonder if my idea would have any effect on macro miners also i guess what i was suggesting is more of a point and click thing where the player has different tools that heshe would need to use to extract the minerals from the asteroid if there was something special inside they would have to clean off a certain amount and then gently pull the piece out clean it off and then put it in the cargo bay i think things like this would make mining exponentially more enjoyable but thats just my opinion
1 when changing blueprint in a processor it should not throw out the materials to devnull rather it should either only take the materials it needs when all of them are available or toss them back whence they came if a route and space is availablecurrently changing blueprints in a p4 processor gets pretty expensive or you have to wait an hour minimum probably more since youre most likely changing blueprints because some material isnt available2 if you route two storages to the same structure the structure should not consume double the materials as it currently does there is no excuse for this to happen so far in the future 3 holding modifier key while placing a structure snaps it as close as it can be to the structure closest to the cursor and rotates around that when held4 holding some other modifier key to place many identical structures in every other application and game in the whole universe this is done with shift5 higher tier items should have priority if my processor throws in a wetware mainframe into the launchpad and it doesnt have space surely my workforce would toss out some aquaeous liquids instead of the millionisk mainframe
1 what it should do is kick back materials that are not required by the new print to the source of their inbound route if space exists if not then they are lost2 i dont do this so i have no idea what youre talking about3 yes4 yes for the love of god5 manage your storage better that said  i would like to have the ability to define overflow storage as a route so you would define another route to additional storage and only if both spots are full does the new material get tossed into the etherin general yes supported
i wouldnt be surprised if some of these things are already being worked on by ccp because of that recent dev blog and allgenerally supported however the one pi improvement i would like is to see actual structures on the planet instead of giant dots 
ok so everyone hates blob warfare its one of the biggest complaints i hear from people and with good reasonits boringtheres no tactics no strategy and no pilot skill required in the i have more ships than you approach inevitably the smaller fleet will avoid battle at all cost rather than lose a fight they obviously cant win nobody wants to waste their hardearned isk on a suicide mission with no upsideanother complaint ive heard involves fleet command ships you dont see them all that often and certainly not in roaming gangs i dont know if its the price or an improperly defined role for the class or just a lack of effectiveness for their purpose that deters their use im not well versed in the complaints against thembut perhaps both problems can be solved togetherhere is what i propose fleet bandwidthfleets would be governed by some kind of points maybe similar to bandwidth this bandwidth would be provided from fleet command ships you would still be able to create fleets without a command ship but basic fleets like that would have only a certain number of points and exceeding them would require you to have a fleet command shipfleet command ships would have a certain base amount of this bandwidth by default as with drones on most ships larger sized ships would use more of the fleets bandwidth than smaller ones perhaps there would be a module that would increase the amount allowing for larger fleets controlled by a single fleet command shipit would perhaps look something like thisstandard gang no fleet command ship 26 shipssmall fleet w fleet command ship at default bandwidth 612 shipsfleet w fleet command ship with boosted bandwidth 1218 shipsagain larger ships would need more points than smaller ships so the system would be based on those points rather than these definitive ship numbers but something like this would hopefully be the rough end resultperhaps the command ships would have modules designating what kinds of ships they were specialized to command like frigatecruiser crusierbc bs capital etcor perhaps there would need to be several sizes of fleet command ships available small perhaps destroyer sized medium like current command ships large battleship sized for commanding battleship gangs and capital sizedi dunno maybe we can take the command ships out of the idea entirely somehowi know not all fleets conform to one size of ship and i know this idea isnt well structured yet but i just thought of it and i figured id throw it out there and get ideas from the rest of youwhat do you think
people will just work around it with multiple fleets not sure if that is worth the effort then
paging finnagain to this threadyour ideas wont work anyway but itll be funny to watch finnagain lose his nut about it
the only people complaining are the ones who dont know how to make friend to help them fight that other gang that actually has a group of friends
pretending to have friends isnt the same as actually having themand i know saying that on an internet spaceship game online is going to get me lynched but its out there now
fleet command ships arent used anymore because the t3 cruisers give better bonuses and are immune to bubblesas far as your idea goes it might help in some very specific scenarios involving small gangs but even in those there are ways to work around it wouldnt help much except hurting small gangs in the long run
you want some cheese wit dat
the i have more men than you approach to warfare and conquest is part of human nature people fight to win and unless there is some unrealistic cap or arena style battles people will always try to bring more however they can if you make some kind of mechanic people will just work around it by making extra fleets having neutral reppers etc eventually you will have to rework the entire game in order to stop the blob and then it wont be eve anymoreyou could say a blob has no strategy but i disagree for one it requires recruiting and effort to assemble the blob get everyone in the right shiptypes etc when the blobs clash it isnt some mindless random shooting all over the place the winner is still decided based on a good plan and tactics
actually this technique has almost never worked over the past several hundred years in rl theres alot of factors huge armies have crumbled when leaders were assassinated revolutions caused empires to crumble historically having more numbers has almost never played a huge part in winningtake rl current wars for example despite blobbing certain countries there has been practically zero improvement  changehuman nature may want to win but theres been so little evidence over the past to show that blobbing works in real life as well as it does in eve even in the animal kingdom blobbing isnt a permo win as it is in eve removing standings wont have a work around unless alliances just put everything in one alliance and even then it would require a huge amount of messing around to fix risks would be involved since alliances will only see themselves as blue having neutral reppers wont change anythingclearly you havent read ncs guide to strategy i dont see how putting everyone online in one system just to crash the enemy is strategyalso their recruitment check nc ads they pretty much invite everyone in
given equal technology of 2 sides the only difference that can have an effect on the outcome of the battle is having more men or better tactics having both is even better still real life wars wars are different because most of the time both sides do not have the same technology available to them and natural resources are not infinite and evenly spread out like they are in eveyou can still change overview to see the alliance ticker on the ships pretty much all you have to do is have a list of tickers that are friendlyfunny how everyone whines about the nc when there are other large groups out there it and friends for example people band together to form largermore powerful groups to provide mutual safety against perceived threats and of course if a group wants to become a threat they will have to be powerful enough to overcome their enemiesas for inviting anyone in well besides the obvious spy issues its a game and i dont see an issue with allowing people to play it
you live in another universe with an alternate historylook what happened in the urss during wwii better trained army with superior tactics and better applied technology in several fields germans vs larger numbers russians it ended badly for the germans there were a lot of other factors but numbers had a large impact it was the same for most of know history superiority in numbers count a lot
fyp
exactly pretty much the only cases where overwhelming numbers havent provided a winning advantage are those were overwhelming technological superiority applied back in the days of 2005 where there were only a small percentage of players could both use and afford fully t2 fit sniper bc hacs etc then smaller numbered fleets could and did successfully engage large fleetsnow the guys that were getting worked over by those fleets in 2006 can all fly and easily afford hacs capitals and so forth and the technology gap is significantly narrowed therefore it becomes about numbersthe people bawwing about the blob being so unfair are really just bawwing about the good old days when they could do the eve equivalent of mowing down 12000 tribesmen with a couple of dozen maxims and then back to camp for tea and medals all round now they have to engage the noobs on a relatively level playing field oh deary me how awful for you lord and ladies to find out that you arent really all that much better than those dreadful common natives at all when they have maxim guns too and there are still 12000 of themadapt or die get over it
glad you mentioned why rl wars is different in game we have progress also this isnt nc vs it sc no longer exists and it has 6k people i would hardly say that is anything close to ncs 60k peopleas for the other guy giving 2 lines of examples ironically missing out germans attacking  conquering france with ease despite englands allegiance to france clearly you read to read up on wwii and how and why countries succeeded and failed in alot of stuffthis game isnt rl and will never be rl is far more political strategic and requires alot more than get everyone in the same system and they wont have a chancealso ccp changed titan dd because everyone whined about pl hot dropping a small alliance that successfully hot dropped to the point where in delve war ii them and nc made a point by dding a capmy point is dd was changed because of how it ruined 00 even though i didnt see dd being a problemthe reason the nap whines has increased is because the second there was a hope of fixing lag nc blobbed a system alone with 2200 players of their own baring in mind 50 of nc were busy else where the outcome was lag again alliances are now either forced to nap everyone in 50 jumps to even have a chance against nc and any decent alliance hates having such a ly huge nap list why because they want combat they went to 00 for combat and not to blobfixing this blobbing thing benefits everyone that doesnt hugely depend on nap warfare the only reason nc and nc alts are in panic mode is because its their only strategy if this wasnt the case they would openly welcome nap changes like vuk lau promised many many times and changes to blobbingbut until ccp change the mechanics on 00 to benefits smaller wars smaller alliances and actually promote combat all you will see is lag node crashes and naps while players will leave 00 and either quit or stay in empireoh and lag doesnt happen in rl so unless you can show me an example on how human nature is to blob a place cause lag and win a fight i really dont think you can compare eve to rl
edit oh look a dreadlord deceived me by editting my post shockingas for you agreeing to rl wars i really dont want to have to link everything over the past 1000 years on how certain battles  wars were won and not because of blobbing
the point you missed was that in eve everyone has access to the same resources and the same technology therefore the battles are reduced to tactics and numbers therefore a group will be motivated to get as large of a force as they canand i think your numbers are quite a bit off lol 60k people
i put stats up month ago heres an easy way to work out who is part of nc and what numbersclick alliance tab in corp click ranking majority of those top populated alliances i think only 2 arent are part of nc and that list goes on and onit worked out 50k 2 months ago but hey dont take my word for it you have all the info in game add it up yourself
it is funny that half of the people that are posting here are actualy useless alts that contribute nothing exept trolling i dont know if the commandship is a good idea it will turn out to be more of a hassle than anything else the only solution so far vs blobbing is gurilia tactics small fleets 512 with a dictor few recons rapierfalcon and nano ships if they bring the blob just run or logofski a good scout is essential as that defines movement speed u need to stay ahead of the blob u can still gank stuff bubble stations and they can not do anything this do require experiance people
i will actually pay 1 mill isk to the person who can provide a solution to blobs that actually works without it either making the game ludicrously complex or actually just making blobs better
during the invasion of france the german used the blitzkrieg tactic to get local superiority ie they still used superiority in number and armaments the allied forces were locked in outdated tactics and had little mobility so even if they had larger numbers but not by a so large margin they were unable to use themto cite another examplei can go on for several hundred of pages of examples numbers count a lot
for trolls sake i present you the case of finland vs cccpfor the actual idea i disagree i dont disagree with the actual issue but i disagree with the solution i file this on the same with diminished damage per shooter vs one target just say noproblems that id foresee is beside the neutral  multigang abuse that it would bring more trouble to the midsized alliances than it would to the truly big ones in terms of skilled pilots  possible gang leaderswell if this isnt the case correct me but i still can find more downsides  abuses than what it would actually bring
this thread derailed in such a weird way however with you we can go at it all day i can mention how napoleon got owned even after outnumbering the russians in the invasion of russia and how bad weather was a major problem for battles such as the spanish invasion as well as alot of battles  wars etc but since we are on the topic of wars why not look at stuff with a little more skill  equal numbers like 1066 battle of hastings it is really difficult comparing rl to eveeitherway it doesnt change the fact that blobs in eve cause lag and coalitions main strategy is to put everything in one system to cause lag for enemies jumping in which eventually kills the nodethis isnt rl and while i appreciate the technology  numbers comment the reasons for blobbing are much different in eve and lets not forget ccp wanted smaller alliances to move to 00 through dominion not only that wars in rl do massive destruction in eve the only things affected are ships items and morale we arent even allowed to destroy stations accel gates etc in eve making it hard to be strategici dont really think it is a good idea comparing a spaceship game to rl especially when theres so many rl factors to take into account like death resources in eve things respawn like asteroid belts food upkeep for troops etcif people want this like rl then ccp should change everything make it so everything can be destroyed  built how food  death play a major part to outcomes of battles and introduce super weapons that can cause much destruction like hiroshima edit  oh and it really depends on what you are saying about numbers counting alot yes numbers do which is exactly why things need to be changed in game to either make it more like rl or more skill based and not number based you cant have it both ways this is the point most of the antiblob people try to get across
comparing eve to rl  fail
simplesif the objective of alliance a is to take a system of alliance b currently alliance as best bet is to send as many dudes as they can in a big blob alliance bs best bet to stop them is to put together an at least equal or preferably bigger blob in the system to counterthis leads to a dynamic where alliances are constantly trying trying to engineer bigger blobs untill the servers explodeto reduce blob size you need to engineer objectives which mean alliance a has to split their fleet to hit them all across multiple systems and alliance b has to split their fleet to defendsomething like systems a  b is impossible to take down unless you take some  generator in either system c or din contrast small gangs do nothing  you can roam some systems end some ships but nothing that would really hurt a big allianceso add something to sov systems without 00000000000000000000000s of hp for small gangs to blowup
how about randomly banning every other account but yeah the obvious answer would prolly be to bring back areaeffect dd not that this wont lead to other issues in its wake
1 giga blob 10 mega blobsconfirming this idea will not help
this has merit as long as the objective is singular then the blob will rule and when talking about system conquest the system is the objective so yea and clearly spreading the attackers out within a given star system isnt really effective as theyd just wipe out the defense force then go after the objectives maybe control of both sides of the gates into the system or something similar is needed thus even when its a dead end system with only one gate the attacking force still has to take objectives in two systems then a given blob is divided among different systems thus reducing potential to kill the node and suggesting a different fleet make up depending on the specific objective fleet a needs to defend fleet b is on offense etc
simply trying to limit the size of blobs will not work there must be a viable objective for smaller fleets and a benefitincentive to split up forces i have some ideas in the thread bellow for creating meaningful small gang objectives in sov warfare and alternatives to the toe to toe blob vs blob lagfest standoffs that dominate it currently
i like both of your ideas a combination of the two ideas would go a long way to making combat in 00 more interesting the more i think about it the more it makes more sense to give people incentives to go with smaller numbers rather than penalize larger numbers people dont try to work around incentivesmaybe there could be some way to make smaller numbers more stealthy while making larger fleets more visible small groups of ships could perhaps move nearly undetected through enemy territory while larger ships could be heard coming from a mile awaysay your ratting and a 30 man enemy gang is rolling down the pipe toward you could there be some sort of perimeter alarm that larger gangs would trigger and smaller gangs would slip through without notice perhaps it would count the total mass of the gang rather than number of ships
the current system of accepting and completing agent missions is both archaic and inefficientcurrent system cons1 requires traveling back and forth between agent and mission space this causes unnecessary repetitive clicking server and network load2 wastes valuable player time for mission runners time is money3 archaic the requirement for traveling back and forth between the agent and mission only applies in games where the time period or setting is not futuristic since eve is set in the future with advanced technologies it only makes sense that all communication is done via satelliteproposed solution1 only require traveling to the agent to accept the initial mission subsequent missions that are accepted and turned in from the same agent can be done from any location remotely2 missions where an item is needed to be acquired can be turned in upon completion of the mission from any location remotely as long as the required item is inside the players ship cargo hold3 for missions that require transport of goods from point a to point b the goods will be placed in the players ship cargo hold upon mission acceptance no matter where the player is located upon delivery of the goods the mission can be turned in remotelythese changes will alleviate some of the repetitiveness from running missions help streamline game play and reduce network traffic and server loadin addition it will help reduce the overcrowding of mission hubs since players can base their operations anywhere this includes use of an orca or carrier as a mobile base where ship fitting changes can be done in spacethis will benefit everyone including pvp players since they also run missions to fund their activitiesif you agree that this proposal will enhance game play and be beneficial to you i encourage you to send a proposal to ccp today
1 seems fair enough2 no while it is reasonable to expect remote communication when an agent wants an item brought to them they dont want it 17 jumps from where they are would you accept a courier contract as completed when the courier drops it off in torrinos and youre in rens mission items should have to be returned to the agents location3 no similar to above having the transport goods put into the cargo hold seems fine so long as the players ship is at the point a stationsame with remotely turning in the mission it would just be cleaner if the mission can be accepted from anywhere as in 1 and completed from anywhere but the goods are placed in the players hangar in point a station and must be either in the players point b station hangar or their ships cargo hold with their ship docked at point b station for hand inyes some traveltimeeffort would be required but that is the whole point yes time is money for mission runners so they need to expend some to make their money the more efficiently they as players can do it the better
issues 1 relatively few 00 systems are inahabited or used to their full potential2 server stability fluctuates with increasing numbers in giant wars when 78 regions worth of players are crammed into one system3 stagnancy of 00 warefare  long siege times  low chance of engagements that are playable4 evasion of consequencessolutionhate to be blunt yall but complete removal of standings system would solve nearly every major 00 issue we are having with this gamehow would it solve these issues1 almost complete shattering of coalition system likely that nips could still be used  this would severely draw back the ability of 00 alliances to hold lots of space  obviously this would lead to more alliances being able to get a foothold in 00 and hopefully more people coming out into 002 far less likely to encounter server issues on a regular basisbeing people from over half of eve converging on the one system to sit there lagged out for hours3 weaker alliances may leed to more powershifting and a more dynamic 00 map which again would allow more people to see more of eve  will also leed to more instances of battles for both small roaming gangs and large fleet fights looking to invade etc4 use of alts to evade consequencesderive benefits would be stopped by such a thing obviously bringing importance to choice of alliance  corpproblems no one from a coalition that is benefiting from these standings is going to come along willingly but i know finnagain would want me to tell you all to man up and adapt or dieits a difficult task to convinse people that they would be better off in such an eve  particularly as they have experianced little but this sort of gamerandom thoughts uncertain why standings should have been included in the game to begin with as both coalitions and alliances enable you to derive benefits allowing standings is simply a way to circumvent any consequences of having to be in the same alliance my thoughts are if people want to work together they have to be capable of holding it together further at current being blue to another entity is essentially meaningless it has nothing to do with friendshipliking we have seen leaders of alliances blue alliances whom they have aledgedly hated for mutal protectioninterestingly enough i dont believe that a removal of standings would at all cheapen the politics of eve it might in fact enhance it instead of meaningless conversations essentially of are you scared of being invaded yes are you yes lets be friends it might turn into something far more complex and delicate something like nips or mutual invasion pacts ie if im invaded you invade my invader etc such a change could liven up areas of this game which have been relatively dormant unforseen issues if something like this is done we could be surprised by the desperation of certain entites and perhaps there could be similar issues if super alliances are formed however it is my belief that it is far more difficult to maintain a 10k man alliance than 10 individual 1k man alliances so perhaps it wouldnt be an issue but if we end up with two alliances holding the entire of 00 again then i guess looking into other limitation options is also wise
let me be first to say no will edit later pso what happens when standings would be removed the allies are gonna fill up with members till they have a super ally which could do the same like the actual coalitions maybe a little smaller but you could still do the samehow would you defend against such a super ally cry till ccp cuts down the maximum of members an ally can hold
well two thingsfirstly i think its much harder to try and get everyone to fold into one giant coalition because of things like pride arrogance mistrust etc etc also i think once such a large formal alliance is made there would be significant internal struggles simply with the size having too much isnt always good for youaside from this i think if your only real argument is that i cant see how it will be any worse than what the game is like now so why isnt it worth the tryalso supportin mah own thread dont get me wrong i doubt this change will ever be made but i can hope and i dont want to give up faith in ccp just yet
supportednerf the nc i mean coalitions
because its completely impossible to meta this whole thing or form a superalliance
how about no standings are used for a lot more than just 00 mega alliance formation even small corps and individuals use them for various things
excellent idea but if this is introduced you will definitely need an alliance player cap because nc nap abusers will most likely put all their previous naps in their alliancehowever this idea is brilliant it will finally allow skill to hold space rather than blobbing it will also mean lag will only have to be fixed to counter at best a 12k battle assuming 2 alliances capped go at it with every member onlineit involves nice risk  reward but i think nrds alliances wont be too happy with the change00 will become populated with alliances craving blood no longer will naps prevent the outcome of a battle alliances will have to decide which friend is worth having and which isntsmaller alliances will now have a chance in 00outcome eitherway will be more pvp more activity and most of all more lagg free battlesmini you should apply to csm your ideas actually will help eve unlike certain nap abusing hypocrites
i think that removing standings from the game is probably the wrong way to go if you want a dynamic environment where borders change on a regular basis unfortunately youre right in the respect that if standings are removed then most of the coalitions will just merge into even larger more static alliances and no real changes will occur except the further damaging of smaller alliances which are already pretty much relegated to becoming renters pets or guerrilla alliances if they want to inhabit 00 with no real options for taking space on their owninstead id like to see standings severely nerfed introduce real penalties and benefits for setting other entities blue or red not a hard cap either because that has literally never ended well and get rid of this stupid sov infrastructure system and static anomsmost of all for the love of god stop treating each system as an isolated unit of sov and instead start treating sov over all owned systems as a single entity being generated from a central hq system and systems that are being used for carebearingthe best way to nerf these supercoalitions is to reintroduce resource scarcity and give supercoalitions reasons to fight internally then make legitimate ways for smaller pvp oriented alliances to have some sort of real effect against spaceholding alliances and their sov
you will never be rid of supergroups one way or another they will show up it is human nature this thread just looks like an attempt to get people to change mechanics because you cannot deal with it removing standing is a good idea but it will create mega alliances fragile ones but they will happen and continue to do so as you guys keep forgetting about the industrial side of this game who is gonna protect the people making you shipscurrently the market is well fed from having safe supply routes throughout space the market would take a large hit if these lines suddenly died causing you all to lose wealth fast as your want for more pvp empties your wallets from ship prices suddenly spiking and more losses than you are adjusted toi will agree it is nice thought to be able to have more groups be able to fight smaller battles one i can atest to as yea im with the nc and no those lag battles are not funbut this all looks like a way to get the game mechanics changed because youre losing so find another way politics aside i however do like the idea of a consequence system on standingssephixan
yeh red vs blue is very interested in taking your space look out everyonethe reason people always assume i cant hack losing is because they assume and poorly so that they are winningwake up to yourselvesspeeking of being unable to deal with it sephixan  youre right standings wouldnt be pulled out and if they were and when my predictions come true ill just quit the game because the one thing i love about it is goneedit after further conversation it boiled down to this sephixan  k how do you get minerals from null sec to jita in your hundreds of unallied groupsapparently the reason coalitions need to exist is to that we can move minerals too and from empire in safety brilliant
i wish people wouldnt keep saying human nature first of all human nature alone covers several theories all which down the line go against each other and is broken down in alot of areas from psychology to philosophy which in the end are all theorieswhile i am fond of psychology and understand the importance of analysing and understanding stuff i wouldnt and neither would any person simply reply because of human nature you may as well reply people blob becauseblobbing through survivability can be down to a  load of stuff dependency and ego come to mindnode crashing via blobbing can be down to alot of things like opportunity and dependencyseriously which ever dumbass made it openly acceptable to allow people to say because of human nature really needs to go study psychologybecause guess what xxx does yyy because of human nature can apply to everything thanks to how vague the statement is at least back it up oh and for the record survivability plays a part in nature but even so if your logic is going to promote blobbing because it is natural then minigins idea should go ahead because it is naturalthis is what happens when people get their education from tv sigh
the point is regardless of if you remove the feature to have colors to show who you like and who you dont people will still have friends and enemies so nothing will change they will simply work around the inconveniencenoone would have a blue today and then when standings are removed suddenly go oh well since the game doesnt let me put a blue  next to your name now you are my enemy lol instead they would say ok since we are friends and ccp were idiots to remove a useful feature of the game how can we organize ourselves so we dont have friendly fire
never before seen such an effective method of removing the chance for small groups to ever be active in 00 blob warfare should be prevented by game mechanics not by stupid limitations and making the ui worse make travel slower  less blob warfare
well minigin i think the issue list you compiled is valid but im in agreement with furb
making conventional travel slower is a terrible terrible idea nerfing jump bridges however is a very good idea
i believe thats what he meant
pretty much everything with jump in the name jump bridges jump drives jump clones etc no not jump gates normal travel definately does not need to be slower
your proposal is utterly stupid and full of failjust because you feel removal of a game mechanic will fix things doesnt mean it willwe have these things called internets and social networkingwhat in the frakking hell prevents us from coming up with our own standings systemseriously i suggest you take a step back from the gaming world and get a taste of reality again before you start banging your anticoalition drumif you want more targets then dont blue anyone and red everyone you have plenty of targets to shoot at that pointno one said you had to use itps besideseveryone knows that these newfangled coalitions dont really work as well as they do its a political game with promises and eventually turn out to be false anyway just take a gander at the coad oh wait your from there never mindits really just blob insurance but in reality its just mutually assured destruction pay me rent and i back you up and in reality they are just in it for their own agendaps2 honestly you cant prevent blob warfare so fix the lag so blob warfare becomes epic and smooth connection wise if anything you get a nice movie
ccp made a huge improvement on lag and what was the first thing you saw nc bring in more people to bring back lag this has been the same thing thats happened over the past several years and will continue toplayers blob and create lagplayers whineccp fixes lagsee what the problem here is ccp could change it so 500k people are allowed in one system lag free but eventually the same problem will happenso imagine this scenario600k nc vs 100k while all smaller alliances have max maybe 10k memberssee what the real problem is because unless the mechanics are changed smaller alliances wont stand a chance in 00 and the only strategy will be to blob mass naping and blobbing only encourages other alliances todo the same killing small gang warfarecant wait to see 550k titans on a killmail
i like what you are trying to do mini but i have to disagree on the effectiveness of the method and that last line is partly why people are going to find a way to adapt to the restrictions the baseline mechanics of combat and sov present no benefit to split forces or fight in smaller forcethe problem of blobs needs to be addressed there first trying to place artificial limits on the size of gangs that an entity can field will not hold people will find a way adapt because there is a incentive to do so here is an idea i had brought up for discussion before but cannot find the thread if we want to reduce the blob we need two things reduce the effectiveness of blob to provide incentive for splitting the forcegive smaller forces a meaningful objective in sov in your other thread on bridges we talked a little about changing sov mechanics to give small gang objectives so ill leave that over there but we also need to reduce the effectiveness of the blog force to provide an incentive for splitting the force otherwise they will just blob one objective after the other attacking them separately with smaller forces has to in some way be more effective eve is a game of diminishing returns yet the power of a large fleet to direct their fire on a single target in undiminished over numbers at least until the server starts to lagif there where some limitation of the effectiveness of a larger gang to all target individual members of a smaller gang we could see much more fluid and dynamic fleet fights imagine that if only so many ships could affectively lock a vessel  a function of signature radius vs scan resolution  we would have a situation where ships where encouraged to primary their most effective target class and not all lump damage onto one primary as a fleet
real men dont need blues
removed a trolling comment
you forgot the op
ive never known a use for the size column replace it with signature radius no net lag increase 
sup hookers how about a t2 small tractor beamz stats same tractor beam reach 20k unbonused tractor speed 900msec i think the standard beam speed is around 550msec give or take faction small beam thingy slight tractor beam reach increase im guessing 25k versus 20k maybe increased tractor speed that is alli am a troll 11
im all for it but i think a t2 version should get at least a 5k boost to distance along with speed
settle down
just speed is kind of mehrange increase too please 25km t2 30km factionnamed if thats too high 22km t2 25km factionnamedorthere are medium and large tractor beams in the static database dump medium has a 40km range and large has an 80km range they all have a 500ms speed these seem acceptable why not release these then t2 could have only a faster speed since range would be based on size faction would not be needed in this case
i approve of the idea but think its not really necessary with marauders orca and soon the noctis giving bonuses to tractors
yes moar t2 needed 
additional t2 required
and all t3 cruisers with emergent locus analyzer subsystem
i can understand your point of view but i cant help but think every item should have at least one t2 variant available if for no other reason than to add more choice admittedly the noctis huge tractor boost is going to change things but not everyone is going to want to fly one marauders are nice but not for everyone and orcas have their bonus for a good reason and salvaging isnt itthe majority of people will still place single or dual tractors on their mission and ratting ships and this is something for them
i fully support the development of the api feature as long as we are able to choose what data can be sent out from our keyshowever i do not support the idea of write access mainly because this serves two potental issues as mentioned by other posters in this thread1 server load my become unbearable2 major security risk
i thought of an idea a while back that would be a secondary training cue it would take 10 times the time to train the skill instead of 9 days it would take 90 this would be a way to train for a secondary ship extremely slowly while working on a primary ship just like your normally would
you obviously do not get eve thats ok not everyone does please dont screw it up for the rest of us with inane ideas like these thoughmy guess is no
youve been playing since july and you have the tenacity to dare propose a change
i think the word youre looking for is audacity back on topic long skill training times in eve are absolutely essential to the game its the wall that keeps out most of the rabble the bouncer at the front door of the club if you will people who stick with eve tend to be more intelligent and mature than other games playerbaseseveryone has to go through the rough first year and new players will just have to suck it up and endure like we all did the wait is worth it
overall nobut you did have two things in there that arent bad allow players to queue up a skill that they cannot train until that point in the queue  yes please double training speed for newbies  we already have this  and were about to make it roughly quadruple with the commissioned officer edition thats being released soon alreadythe rest of your post shows a lack of understanding of eve everything is possible if you work for it you can do anything but be prepared to be patient and to accept the consequences if you choose poorlydouble skill training  ie double training speed the game is not supposed to be fastexpanding the training queue to a weekmonth  it isnt very difficult to log in for 5 minutes per day surely and if you only want to change your skills youre doing it wrongtaking too long to get into the game  i am a member of eve university look us up  we can get newbies into useful roles in a fleet fight in less time than it takes to get them into the class that explains how to use the skills theyve trained you can be a useful tackler within hours of creating a character you can be a useful ecm pilot within a couple of days find some friends fly with them and realise that there is no invisible barrier to the game before x months of training you can play today

there is a whole discussion thread dedicated to how sov battles could be made better i have a suggestion there to add a declarative function to sov battles in that smaller scale battles would have an affect on the sov over time that they could be used to soften up a defender and shift the tcuhubstation battles in favor of the attacker tz and hp wise give this a read and comment
for most maybe not but funding shouldnt be a barrier to declaring war in the first place also there are other long standing issues with wardecs addressed in this proposal that have nothing to do with funding
sooo many questions about this maybe there should be a scale on planetview screen or a total kms of pipeline on screenkb
i agree i posted a similar question earlierthis graphics problem of trying to make the buildings look the same size should not affect the distance between the buildingsi want a petition to change this affect how do you do thatthis problem seems to affect gas planets more then others perhaps the gas command centers need to have extra powergrid to account for this graphics problemi cant understand why they would let this graphics issues affect the placement of the buildings in the first place why cant do they put in some kind of internal calculation that accounts for this
dear ccp it isnt fair that people can choose a way of playing eve which differs from my own the nc are mean and have alot of people its not fair teams also allowing playerdriven interaction is surely against the rules ccp should introduce more railroading and stop people from playing this open ended sandbox mmo in the wrong wayplease nerf everyone who isnt me or i will sulk in the corner and stamp my feet
now thats not fair at allin addition to the sulking and the stamping weve seen a few quality temper tantrums too
yes clearly everyone wants to end large scale coalitions thats why most of 00 has  joined large scale coalitionsor by everyone did you mean me and a couple of other loud whiny forum babies
there is an increasing trend in assembly halljita park threads in which they are degrading into flame wars this is not the purpose of this sub forum which is designed to bring ideas to the csm for discussioni am clearing out these flames but please be aware that these are in violation of the forum rules in future we ask that you use the report post feature and we will take the necessary action do not get involved in titfortat flame wars which ultimately mean your points get lost and ignored
as much as i applaud you intentions navigator you know as well as i do and many others that flames and trolls occur everywhere on the forums which are only lightly moderated some entities seem to have more of a carte blanche than others imohowever as you seem to be speaking more about this particular sub forum i believe you maybe hitting your head against a brickwall mainly for 2 reasons1 its political2 the description of the forum seems to give a sort of free reign to the topics and discussion in comparison to the other forumsa less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar managementbut i wish you luck anyway
hm dont forum rules state that moderation is not to be discussed time to grant the forums mods their wish and file a report
nereskyalthough technically you are discussing moderation i would like to point out that because it is a less formal venue to discuss whatever you wish this does not mean that the regular forum rules do not apply the point of these sub forums are to have spirited discussions regarding issues that you would like the csm to raise directly with us at ccp if that thread is nothing more than two or three players holding a grudge at each other and posting flames or trolls then important messaging can get lost in that crossfirei can tell you that the csm work hard to bring forward solid player ideas and we would rather see good ideas having a solid discussion so that the csm can get a broad feel of what players want
didnt mean to cause offence was just making a statement and technically i wasnt discussing moderation but wishing you luck in your endeavoursapologies offered if offence was caused
the problem is some players really do want to find ways out of game eg through the forums to beat opponents who they cannot beat in game its corporationallianceandorganization discussion masquerading as noncaod discussion its like if we saw dozens of threads from nc pilots complaining about the effectiveness of drone regions drake fleets and a dozen variations on nerf drake tank no nerf drakes ability to get remote reps no nerf drake pilots and anybody who flies a drake loses 1 mil skillpoints on destruction were seeing the same sort of thing now remove pilots abilities to tell whos blue and who isnt dont let fleets use allied jump bridges titans or black ops and so on and so on and so on its caod masquerading as game mechanics fixes more importantly the whole concept of blob this or blob that is 100 meaningless other than to indicate that its being used as a snarl word by someone honestly there is simply no objective definition of the word blob that doesnt rely exclusively on a whine that someone is able to bring more forces than you are is a 100 man gang a blob well not if the defenders have 200 pilots but what if that 100 man gang is fighting 2 people is it a blob then if the 100 man fleet jumps out from a system where it cant fight 200 people and then fights 2 people is it suddenly not a blob in one system and a blob in the next even though the actual fleet hasnt changed at all is a 5050 fight fair what if one side brings all supercarriers and the other has battlecruisers is it a supercarrier blob then obviously its not about how many people you bring but what the opposition has and that means that the only real definition of the snarl word is a subjective complaint that someone else can have more people in the game than you do andor that they have better ships which is of course game mechanics functioning exactly as intended and it does miss the fundamental dynamic behind eve which is that in lawless space players are the ones who decide how the game plays out because its playerdriven interactions that set up the market determine the resources available determine what empires exist where etc the desire for a game with artificial fairness ie a game where nobody can bring more people or have better equipment than you can is simply not eve but it is essentially what games like world of warcraft have built in not only should eve not try to emulate the softest aspects of wow but arguments about how people shouldnt be allowed to bring morebetter ships than others or how only one playstyle should be boosted eg small gang at the expense of tens of thousands of other players because some smallgang advocates cant adapt andor they want to be able to refrain from adapting and still be able to challenge those who can offer superior forcenumbers well its an attempt to sneak ingame conflicts through the back door as if they were some sort of necessary gamemechanics fix i cant figure out a way to counter significantly greater forcenumbers and i refuse to find a niche where that isnt necessary is not a valid topic of discussion its a blog post
you are doing it again finn dont you get it your argument can be used for every change in progress completed or suggested things change for a reason as far as your replies have gone you have gone and truly in short said ccp except for bugs i dont wish for any change in this game ever and because you are so vague yet you brand yourself as sincere and whatever you say you believe to be accurate without listening to anyonei cant be doing with your inconsistence or ignorance anymore say what you like i will continue as i am but refuse to even acknowledge your existence even in game and considering how many arguments you get into daily i would be surprised if i am the first one to say this

i believe that the black ops should be able to bridge all t2 crusier sized shipsrecon or notalsoi believe that all the bo should get a standard bounes to bridging 10 fuel need per skill black op lvl instead of the jump portal skilli also think the jump range should be a bit longer and covert cynos should be able to be lit anywhere in empire aswelli also think that the black op should be able use a covert ops cloakalso change the jump portal skill prereq to something other than a probing skilli think the prereqs should be electronics lvl 5bs lvl 5 jump cal lvl 4scenice lvl 5black op lvl 1covert jump portal lvl 1 note this should be a seprate skills book asdie from the jump portalthese prereqs are for the covert jump portal onlybut i think there should be a covert cyno jammer as well for system that have sov lvl 5 for more than 5 monthsbut thats my idea for the black op
it should have went without saying
if your right and the wolf is the mini vaga that is really sad that the wolf is actually slower than the vaga
i also agree with this give tracking a little bit of a boost so its between acs and pls make the ships a little bit faster and call it good also some more cap would be nice on the ships designed to active tank either that or change the bonus to 5 ris per skill could some one write up a proposal and start a new thread or get a csm to look at this i get off of work in 13 mins and dont have the time right now i hope we can find a way to get this problem fixed soon does the csm have any ideas on this topic i have read your logs and i know you have talked to ccp about it in the past but we need to keep on them about it hybrids sucking is affecting 12 of the races in the game if you want to salve problems with eve please make this a must for ccp to fix in the summer expantion
the csm has shown absolutely no interest in fixing hybrids or the gallente faction and ive never read any indication that any of them have even paid attention to these threadsif you notice it wasnt even listed on the crowdsource csm issues to vote onin other words csm fail galhybrid users and need to pay attention
csm have got this issue on their very long list of fixes however prioritisation is low and they suggested an increase in range nevermind eh maybe someone somewhere in ccp is working on it and has a very good intuitive fix in the secret back store
i daresay rails need something to compensate for the fact that they require both capacitor to fire and ammo and cant instaswitch they need a distinct advantage over lasers and projectiles and right now theres nonethey cant change damage typedps output is poor to middlingalpha is nonexistentthe entire medium rail line is a jokerange is slightly longer which doesnt make a difference in mediums and makes no difference past 150km when enemies can just warp to your wrecksoh well i get my zealot in a week so i wont have to bother with em soon enough

there is general consensus that hybrids are weedy however for a number of reasons previous proposals did not pass i suggest we figure out what we need and finally get hybrids fixedcontent of this post may be modified as the discussion goes on in order to reflect the conclusion our community will hopefully come to i would like everybody replying to this post to agree or disagree with each point separately the issue with hybrids today is that they tend to combine the shortcomings of all weapon systems rather than their strengths ie neut vulnerability need for ammunition etc 1 the most bizarre aspect of hybrids to me is the larger ammunition size all hybrid charges are twice as large as their projectile counterparts there are two reasons why this is wrongthe ship firing hybrid charges has to expend its capacitor energy to do so that means it will need more capacitor booster charges and have to carry larger hybrid ammo overall this will result in lower durability of hybrid platforms rail guns have higher rate of fire than artillery canons that mean they will chew through more ammo during an engagement and since this ammo is larger their durability suffers yet againin the difference of projectile ammunition hybrid charges are simply chunks of metal containing no propellant their calibre is also much smaller  425mm against 1400mm assuming that the bullet length is the same which it isnt hybrid charges should be at least 10 times smaller in volume then their projectile counterparts without the propellant conclusion size of hybrid ammunition needs to be greatly reduced2 to give hybrids an extra edge reloading time could be reduced from 10 seconds to say 5 seconds that makes hybrids tactically more flexible lower reloading time could be justified by smaller size of ammunition 3 blasters have range several times shorter than that of projectiles yet their tracking is the same they have the lowest relative taking at their range this tracking should be improved 4 null ammo is the worst of all t2 longrange ammunitions 25 bonus to optimal and falloff is substantially worse than 50 bonus to optimal scorch gets to make them equal null should get 375 to 40 bonus to optima and falloff if someone doubts this i will be glad to give you the numbers 5referring to this topic where author gave every weapon system a score although arbitrary by nature it reflects the situation quite well ideally lasers should obtain the best score then followed closely by hybrids and then by projectiles in order of their energy consumption this is clearly not the case as the author states blaster damage output should be somewhat improved to compensate for their lack of range their range should not be extended otherwise we get op autocanons 6 to bring the scores closer together both tracking and damage of rails should be improved i am hesitant to give exact figures but adding 5 to each figure should do it void and javelin suck but thats the case with all guns and reasons are wellknown there is also an obvious problem with gallente physisophy britux with dualrepp mwd and full rack of cap hungry guns  but i tried to concentrate o guns themselves here please keep your criticism constructive to csm if you need numbers references or whatever else tel me
1 hybrid charges are mostl likly large due to there construction ther ein essence micro bombs  they have a tastly core filled with some type of explosive and a hard outer shell when used in a railgun the whole unit is fired at the target when used in a blaster the core is suched out and super heated then fired like a water gun which makes me think that they should most likly be doing more damage or like the rail guns in the moves  damage all 3 hp bars at the same time  hey when was the last time you saw a movie that used rail guns the the thing didnt shoot a hole clean through its target2 not sure if this would work even due to size you still have some form of ammo belt to deal with and if that belt has 5 large projectile shots or 10 medium hybrid shots it gona take the same time to take down and replace3 i personaly dont see why blasters have trackign issues to begin with you woudl think that a weapon designed to work up to max 10k ish would be able to track anything in that zone im perfactly up for giving blasters a insanly high hit anything in your range tracking ability cause if a frig cant outrun a bs its doing something wrong4 never really used those ammos types so cant present argument
heh true never noticed maller was the bigger so omen shouldnt be as good as it is then i guessvexor compares to arbitrator both in cost and function arbitrator is easier to fit then vexor omen compares to thorax both take just as much cost and skill to fit properly maybe the tiers are different but this is how it seems to be balanced its pretty awesome when fit right and using some decent cheap hardwires to boost itbah i got the official tier wrong but its where it fits in the game regardless
yes arby is fine we know this isnt a thread about the arby it is about the omen ammars only dmg bonused lasor boatdoesnt even come close the thorax can be fit below max skill with 800mm 12 eanm 12 magstabs and a dcu the vexor fits any of the above mods just fine in its lowsomen at max skill needs a powergrid rig or implant and has to fit 0 cpu resist modsso noobs need max skill and implants to fly it while the harby fits fine to bad you cant afford a harby or the implants while newno maller fits fine with low skill and works even better with autosso yeah change the omens fitting to be more forgiving of low skill and more ease at high skill good layout weapons bonuses and yet is the least used combat cruiser because of this
it does kinda suck
im sorry but i disagree you want to be able to fit top tier weapons a mwd gank and a heavy tank tie brother you cant have it all the other ships albeit they arent as tight require some kind of fitting modulerig or intuitive fitting to make a good t1 cruiser have you noticed how small the sig of the omen is its smaller than a stabber when fitted shield modulesrigsthe vexor is a little different as it can rely heavily on drones but if you want to use that hybrid bonus you can only fit electrons and an 800mm plate with and a useful utility high med neut smalls are just too weak if you use a fitting rig yes the vexor has impressive dps but its using lolblasters and the omen can kite all that dps even within scramweb range and only has to worry about drone dpsthe caracal is a real pita to fit however i always like to fit it with amls instead of hmls or hams this frees up loads of pg for those nice lses and requires meta 4 modules or a 3 cpu implant to fit its dps is fairly poor however those amls really hurt frigates myself and a couple of other people in my corp have a navy caracal fitted with amls to create a 60km frigate no fly zone around us they even scare the balls off of dramielsthe stabber is paper thin has low dps and fights deep into falloff but wow is it fasti really cant see anything wrong with t1 3rd tier cruiser balance in any way
you realize that the omen has to use adaptive nano plating 800mm plate and an afterburner to fit medium sized guns right and it still gets less dps slower and less ehp than the standard vexor with small guns
the omen is faster has a smaller sig and has considerably more range a vexor has to rely on its drones to do the damage unless you ac fit it like i said the vexor is a difficult ship to compare it to as intuitive fitting and thinking outside of the box works well with that ship think of the poor caracal pilots who really struggle to get any meaning dps with a mwd and tankan ab omen works well a mwd  800mm plate omen works well a nano omen also works well honestly its already a good t1 cruiser just stick your hands in your pocket and rig it
and yet no one flys themall your fits require high skill which is way to much to ask for newbe go rig it i am glad you are made of money but 7 months ago i could barely afford a cruiser hull we are asking for the ability to fit a more conventional fit not to make it overpowered its stats are not great fitting is just a little low for a standard armor ammar fitit is great that you can fit it out well with rigs and implants did you forget how it was when you had engineering 34 and electronics 34 the other cruisers not counting the caracal fit together at basic skill and all of are usedeven the anti frig caracal the omen is not on a regular basis also you mentioned sheild fitting them what new ammar pilot is training sheild skillyou can still use all your niche fits but this preposal is for new pilots with medium skill and the ability to be able to get a more standard fit out of it if you could the number of people flying it would rise and it would no longer be one of the dead shipsthere is no downside what so ever to an omen fitting buff

no those are top tier gunsthe guns you were looking for are focused modulated pulse energy beams those guns you got on there require 90 pg each before skills more than the lower gunseven with maxed skills you cant get the big guns on any cruiser without fitting mods ive never been able to fit a thorax properly with anything bigger than ions the vexor usually has to fit small guns instead of the mediums it has a bonus for and the vexor needs just as much skilling to get good stats out of it honestly these are t1 cruisers tie understand that
excuse me my mistake refits

from past experience of ccp running sql queries that tell them this will only adversly effect 1 of clientsnot a good idea theyll mess it upedit btw i have important legit alts holding corp ceo roles that would be killed by this query
your ceo alt is on a 3 year old trial account
leading a corp like that takes some real skill
i had an idea similar to this while i was on the csm but couldnt garner enough support my concept is to remove all characters that are both over six months old and that have less than 2 million sp this will clear up a great deal of space and still let people keep their old charactersthe only downside to this is that isk sellers will have a lot more names to work with however many of the names held in stasis deserve to be released to the playerbasesupported
why do the alts have to be deletedall that is needed to free up the name space is a name change  same as what is done for any name that is reported for eula abuse or being offensive
i would suggest not deleting anything simply rename them add a string to the name joe blow would become joe blow  retiredif the player returns they can do a name change
please read the post any character on any account that has ever bought game time would not be affected renames would also work
didnt know that the isk sellers used names other then aijtm3490375 and stuff along those lines and to the guy with the ceo roles just log the accounts on that way they dont meet the i havent been used in three years deadline
yes please more names for active paying players
buying stuff in big quantities in the lp store is grueling you click accept the window refresh and you lose focus on the item you want to buy again with the filter they implemented you can manage to display only the item you want to buy so you dont have to scroll each time anymore thats the only thing that this overcomplicated filter achieves getting rid of the scrolling the dumb thing about it is that you still have to click 50 times on accept if you want 50 batch of ammo why the hell cant you make the lp store like a real store  you add a quantities column you add 2 more columns lp total and isk total for each row big total at the bottom and checkout button 1 simple click to buy everything you need  numbers display as red if you cant proceed displays as green if everything is fine you need only 2 simple filters affordable only and show all you dont need more filters because we will scroll down the list only 1 time to add quantitiesi want a lp store that works like a real simple ui store
i support this change the lp store looks like something a student put together in an afternoon please fix it alsothe ui in this part of the game does not resemble any other eve uiits been raised beforeand autoscrolltotop is the most annoying thing ever

thanks ancyker more to think about
this proposal would increase the entrylevel barrier for pvp especially for new players in my opinion the price of declaring war should vary with the corporation size andor maybe character ageif two noobcorps want to fight they should not have to give all their money to concord it also clear that 2 mill is not enough o make someone think before declaring a war so we need a sliding scale anyway thats not what is broken about highsec wars instead two things need to be fixed for highsec wars station gamesneutral rryour proposal does not focus o the real issue
so you do agree that the prices need to change towards everything else said there is alot of problems about neutral rr but those are being addressed in different threads station camping is always going to be there i have seen both sides of the coin use it i have seen plenty of omfgsohardcorepvpers and bleedingheartcarebears station camp like nobodys business similar to the neutral rr fit like i said before if they neutral rr then have a cloakystrike team on standby its not hard to delegate these kinds of tasks if you are a decent fc besides best way to end a wardec is to cause as much isk harm as possible fighting is cheap war is expensive towards the newb corps once again 2 million is easy to obtain its not necessarily a barrier if a corp knows what they are doing a sliding scale would be beneficial but even then if 7 man corp wardecs another 7 man corp the price should definitely not be a pathetic 2 mil maybe 2550 mil for a corporation wardec 100200 for an alliance nevertheless the more complicated you make a damn module the less likely ccp will implement there are plenty of issues in this game that need to be sorted out although this one is not as important as lag fixes it is still an outdated issue that needs to be adjusted thankfully it is cheaper and easier to fix something as simple as prices depending on what kind of legacy code they are dealing with and what kind of module needs to be adjusted i am not going to say wardecing prices are moreless important than station camping or neutral rr but it is easier to adjust game prices than it is to implement new laws and algorithms for neutral rrers or causing pvp station huggers to bounce off if they have been aggressed
jeez just raise the prices high enough so that ward decs become serious matters again and not fly by night whims its not brain surgeryatm its just too easy to lock up some poor newb corp in their base for a month just because you think its funny to do so or have 3 ongoing decs at a time all the time just so you can free pvp in high sec without having to deal with pirates
pondersim not really very knowledgeable on this subject but i was looking at war deccing someone a few days ago and the quote for isk that it gave me was 50 mil where is 2 mil coming fromalso i honestly think 100 mil vs 2 mil for most corps wouldnt make a huge difference at least for the ones who want to declare war in high sec
im wavering between saying that noobs should stick in the npc corps so they cant be war decd and still have access to somewhat experienced players who can help them out every now and then and player corps should have a large and stable enough pvp wing to be able to defend the new players on their ownthere are of course times when the war dec should stop by force as in when a group of people are just getting harassed constantly and not able to play the game because of this but honestly its preventable
i really dont like anyone bein stuck in npc corps espeshially when people have been playing for 5 yearsand are still in noobcorp i think people need to get into the reacl game asap
 durrrhhh  please answer the following to show the masses your grasp of the current war dec game mechanic 1 how many wars can a corp make2 how many wars can an alliance make3 how much is the cost of each war for a corp to make4 how much is the
well thats the whole point isnt it high sec is supposed to be for new capsuleers to learn the game and casual gamers to tinker around being stuck in an npc corp doesnt allow you to learn fleet cooperation or build a new corp for future movement into low sec and eventually null sec discouraging new players to formjoin corps hurts the entire community as a whole and the future of eve altogetherthats not to say they shouldnt face danger or the occasional war dec but too much arbitrary deccing goes on nowadays and a change in pricing to reflect how serious war decs should be would help to offset the issue

oh yeah supported
sounds nifty dont see any downsidei like the custom uniforms idea but wonder what happens to the clothes you pick when you create a character i guess itd be optionaluniforms make complete sense though
do want
i want my shiny medals and i want to make a decoration in my quarters out of the skull of the griefer i killed the other day i want to toss darts and knifes at the portraits of pirates that killed my iteron i want to have statue of my ceo and my corp logo there as well
as long as it is optional why not just make sure it does not lead to those postmodern breastplates some soviet marshals had due to abundance of medals
some sort of a bar with different colour bits for public certificates like the one on the left in this picture

i support kills on shipif it takes this to get it fine
ok this has irked me since i had enough sp to know what a hybrid turret was there are a ton of rail gun type hybrids with many different names but there is one type that is mis named calling itself the xmm prototype i gauss gun when x is its size i hope i dont have to get to technical but a gauss cannon and a rail gun are not the same weapon in both concept and design in fact the only thing they do share is that they fire a bullet at high speed now get this straight other than a name change this will not effect any stats on the weapons them selfs i would like this implemented because as eve evolves there a good chance that new weapons will come out and i would like to see gauss cannons becoming a third hybrid turret typeas for the name to be changed to that could be a community vote maybe a prototype lithium rail accelerator and yes if you want me to i will go over exactly how the 2 systems work and why there not the same
 very nice i like this idea alot
i dont remember lds enabling flying through celestials at least in iwar 2 your ship overheats by being in close proximity of a sun not by going through it fly close eneough and you will blow up anyway lds doesnt function like eves warp drive its is stated that it cant exceed the speed of light iwars counterpart to warp drive is capsule drive which doesnt have option to change destination midflight
cough warp disruption fields coughi do not support this directly it does seem silly to see the ship fly through objects though i suggest an option just to remove all object models while in warpthere really is no need for this you are not ramming into something there is a bubble around your ship warp bubble collapse in and you arent actually moving from what ive heard the ship pulls matter around it or something i dont know sounded complicated when it was explained to me so i didnt really pay attention
there was a tim when we died warping through planets  abck in beta i think it was almost as good as the amarr shuttle flying backwards  
well the term lds was ment to be linear displacement system and was supposet to function up to the speed of light as neutonian physics says nothing can actually travel faster so was the theory although put into the game it made travel teadious as it took aaages to get to places that sort of broke the games pace so they changed it to not have that upper speed limit the capsule drive was another thing entirely its iwar 2s equivalent of eves jump gate system except the idea was that to activate the jump u had to be at a point of gravametric equilibrium aka an area where gravity wells produced by planets cancelled each other out they were refered to as lagrange points anyways i digressumm so ur arguing over semantics on something u didnt really listen to and the idea of not moving and everything else moving around u to satisfy your own desires for travel is a tad egotystical si completely agree about the warp disruption fields btw and if spline curves can be created for routes around celestials so that the ships arrive at their destination on the same trajectory as if they came through whatever object then yah that would be a perfect solution warp disruption fields will then still catch people when set up normally the only lag associated situ i can see is fleetwarp alligning and fleetwarping to a location thats got a celestial obsticle would mean the fc or whoever initiates warp would have to upload the splines mathmatical formula not much of a data throughput issue even on 56ks to ccp servers to then distribute to all others associated i guess a suitable delay entering warp would allow comms of that info so that every1 warps as one unit and it would not need any ship to realign to another point in space just follow a curved warp trajectoryalso in terms of client side server side discrepencies a simple delay factor dependent on celestial radius server side when the warp line enters a celestial body would realign the time to destination on both client and server resulting in any warp disruption by another party close to destination to occur without differences between both partiesplanting a large warp bubble perfectly on a curved warp trajectory round a planet would be practically impossible unless you travel on the same curves calculated client side more than likely on popular routes through systems so that situation also stays unchangedi should stop reading my gfs law books s all in all not much addition server side apart from fleetwarp some nice formulaic work client side and hey presto
the way i see it the easiest ways of implementing this would be to either remove the planet models while warping or make the ship do some kind of jump when passing through a celestial like when jumping through a gate or like a probe warps alltho a bit less shiny i guess to not wear it out
nice idea

this isnt a graphics issue whatever that is supposed to mean in the context of the op gas giant planets are quite simply larger than other planets and as such the links between objects are longer because they are longer they consume more power  its not an issue its the way gas giants work
a tcu would still be used to claim space so there would be no accidental taking of sovthe security index would start at a medium level to give some security against flip flops but not provide the full defensibility right away pve activity such as mining and ratting would contribute to the security index killing enemy invaders would contribute to the security index on the other hand losing ships losing pos structures having station services and poss reffed would deteriorate the security index if you are attacking an afk empire you will quickly deteriorate their index even if they dont show up to fight by doing things like reffing poss and station services suppressing thier pve will mean they wont be able to recooperate those index losses and in a short while the index will be in the attackers favor lowonce the index is low the attackers might be able to more quickly sbu have less ehp to get through on the stationhubtcu and timers might be moved more towards the attackers preference this would force alliances to use the space they claim and to actively defend it it would give small gangs a meaningful effect on the sov war by spreading out and hitting infrastructure and limiting pve
well if you go and read my full post
the problem of course is that since the term blob is a meaningless word it will always be the case that some people use it as a complaint split up sov objectives and the attackerdefender can bring more ships to each relevant system theyre blobbing split it up into 20 objectives and the defenderattacker can still bring more yep blobbing get rid of sov entirely and there are some objectives that someone wants to takedefend capital ships arrays a bubbled titan whatever and there will still be bigger fleets and smaller fleets better equipped fleet and more poorly equipped fleets and so on and thus complaints about blobs refining how sov warfare works is a good goal but trying to fix blobs is a never ending quixotic errand and one that simply ends up punishing those who are able to work together more effectively and punishing them again and again and again because really even if your sov proposal was put into practice and each of the involved systems still had a defender ratio of 31 with the attackers do you think that people would be fine with blob warfare then or would we see another round of requests to accomplish through the forums what certain people are unable to accomplish in game and requests to accomplish it by any means necessary stop blues from using each others titans black ops bridges stop blues from even being able to identify each other without opening up the ticker column on the overview whats next if youre in a fleet thats greater than 21 with you opponents fleet your subscription fee goes up by 50 per month there will never be a valid mechanics fix to a problem that isnt a problem at all and is due to mechanics functioning exactly as intended each and every single proposal even if followed to the letter will simply generate calls for even stricter even more extreme more draconian and more importantly more nonsensical punishments to anybody who beats someone in game when their opponents cant adapt and are unwilling to find a new niche short of wow style arena combat the antiblob faction simply will not get what they want not ever and when eve switches over to instanced combat arenas its pretty much dead
i never suggested that it was the solution to blobsonly that it would offer some viable options to counter the blob or at least split it up and annoy it a bit numbers will still matter eve will never be a game like wow where the opposing forces are carefully balanced against each other
then whats the point
i know and for what its worth i like your suggestion a hell of a lot more than dominion but thats what people are demanding and thats what all these suggestions are about its all blob again though youre thinking about it from a problem solving point of view the whole complaint about blobs is a solution in search of an actual problem however even if you split up the main blob into 20 groups there will be the same complaint if the attackers cant outnumber the defenders theyre blobbing every one of the 20 systems altering sov so that it makes more sense and doesnt involve shooting sov structures with more ehp than some supercaps is awesome but it is impossible to ameliorate let alone solve blobs because the term is meaningless a fleet battle which is 12 will almost always have cries of blobbing i agree but also thats the point some people will and can never be happy if thats not the case as long as attackersdefenders can drastically or as weve seen sometimes even slightly outnumber the other force andor if they can field better shipes someone will be complaining about a blob and looking for ways to change game mechanics to hurt those who can beat them in game using game mechanics functioning exactly as intended eve is a great game and itll work on the axis that makes eve great and wow if you like that sort of game is great on that axis too people who need fairness out of combat and dont want groups to be able to cooperate past the guild level already have a game that caters to exactly what they want hell for all i know you could also build a mod to make your elf look like a spaceship
i like the idea of at the very least changing the jb pass from the tower pass but would like the idea of not having to have a pass if im in the alliance or even if im in an alliance on some kind of allow list like in chat channels reds apparently cant jump anyway even if they have the pass and having to put the pass in for every jump is annoying it doesnt do anything just requires more repeitionalso i dont get the way some people seem to think that making some things easier in eve is turning eve into easy mode i want fewer clicks in pi no your making eve into easy modei want to be able to rename ships im not currently endeasy modei want to be able to organize my stuffeasy modeits like trying to talk with conservatives about real issues they just automatically call it communism socialism sm facisim antiamerican helping the terrorist etc then they use them all interchangeably

this is very interesting but it wouldnt stop things like still assembling a giant fleet from a coalition to siege stuff etc or worse using an alt corp to drop towers so that you can just reinforce them yourself to mess with the indexif the intention is essentially to limit the ability to hold lots of space why not just stop taking half measures and put an exponential cost on it if you make it so that its unrealistic that an alliance can hold more than say half a region a region at most then we would start to see alliances start to trim the fat more alliances get out into 00 more boarder skirmishes etc etc
reffing towers that are neutral to the sov holder wouldnt detract the index this would discourage in a way having a bunch of allied towers in your system who dont defend their stuff adding a small layer of difficulty on managing coalitionsccp originally did plan to have exponential cost increases after further review they decided against it i think that we have a lot in common mini we agree that sov warfare in its current state can get a little boring likely because it places too much focus on getting large maximum dps fleets together to siege the key structures your focus seems to be on reducing the size of those fleets mine on providing a role for small a mobile fleets in sov warfare perhaps we need a little bit on both ends
i wasnt suggesting that such a tactic would be used to take sov i am far more concerned it will be used to keep soveg i own a system someone else starts to pvpnpc whatever in my system im worried my index will drop too low so i dump a bunch of poses into the system with either alts or whatever then i reinforce the poses i have put down instantly jumping my own claim to the system without really having to do much
ah i believe that a tower metric should only affect the towers that are owned by or blue by the system owner shooting neutral towers in the system would have no gain or reduction in the system think of it kind of like how predominion sov was you had to bash all the towers down in this model you wouldnt be required to bash them all down but it would be one option among many though the same argument can be said about hiring a merc corp to come and die to you a lot but that will cost a substantial amount of money as the index gain for killing invading ships would be based on insurance values were getting into the technicalities of how the indexes function which should ccp implement a system like this im sure they wouldnt get into publishing the inner workings but with some thought it certainly possible to limit the ability to exploit the system
currently the prophecy has very little to differentiate it from the harbinger the 10 per level cap usage bonus of medium energy turrets is very underwhelming and so many people are much happier to fit acs or blastersi propose that the prophecys turret bonus be changed to 10 optimal range of energy turrets per level this will then give the prophecy a far more defined and different role other than a brick with epic ehp or the poor mans harbinger
well acs work wonders what you need lazors for pyeah it is true its like a brutix fit tank and acs and youll do better than tank and blastersdont know why youll need more optimal on pulses  oh shut up they have the best optimalfalloff combination
just trying to give the prophecy a really useful bonus that isnt a damage bonus an optimal bonus would make little difference to pulses but a great difference to beams a sniper prophecy would become very appealing
it will suck just like current railox
over 200 dps  90km optimal with 50k ehp mwd and 100km targeting from a t1 1st tier bc is good enough
yes pulse sniping is definatly underpoweredi always prefered the idea of an rof bonus for the punisher maller and proph so if you fit autos you get lol dps and if you fit lasers you get a quicker cap out but they are better dmgbut anything to make the laser chicken a better laser boat then autos will do go go scorch sniper laser chicken
i sort of like this it would make a nice little trinity between the harbinger tank and dps but not range zealot dps and range but not tank and the prophecy tank and range but not dpshowever id prefer the prophecy to be khanidised black ham prophecy ftw
i searched and i honestly couldnt find a thread like this so heres my propositioni know that suicide ganking is still somewhat of a problem in eve and if i remember correctly ccp has said that suicide ganking is an unintended result of the mechanics of the game and it is still somewhat of a problem in high sec my very simple proposition is this fine players a dynamic cost for each ship that they destroy in 05 systems and higher that are not at war or do not have any kill rights whatsoever no red flashy or in other words any incident that requires concord to step in the fine would be given to each player separately at the same amount and would change depending on the size of the ship and the estimated market value of the materials on board ie lets say theres a regular industrial carrying 1 bil worth of material based on regional market prices for the material for the industrial the fine would be 500k isk for the material the fine would be equal to the average buy order price per unit of that material also in order to filter out the scams with prices that are extremely low or high on the market the fine could be calculated excluding orders that are a certain number of standard deviations away from the medianplease note that i am not a carebear i just think that attacks on convoys and freighters belong in war decs when its in high sec and not with suicide ganksthanks for your time
ccp has also stated that highsec is safer not safeit is a good thing that most suicide ganks are to grab juicy deadspaceofficer modules that are valued about 10k isk according to the material value i mean who in their right mind would gank a freighter full of tritaniumalso how would this fine work for people with empty wallets
and how do you suggest we handle the npc corp alts that do the bulk of the haulingsince you cant war dec an npc corpor is this really a stealth let us dec npc corps whineno sorry  just no suicide ganking is fine and charging people to do it will only raise the thresh hold of what they gank it wont stop them from ganking especially those are doing it for the lulz anyway
i understand high sec is safer but not completely safe however this wouldnt make high sec completely safe as corps could still start a war dec with another corp in order to destroy their industrials and such also what i meant was the value of the material or item itself as a whole not the materials it was made up of that was a mistake on my part ie for faction modules the fine would be according to the value of the faction item itself not the materials its made up ofalso for players with no isk this is an interesting problem there are a couple solutions and the one that comes to my mind is that the player would then have to work off the debt to concord by doing missions and such in order to make the isk back to concord ie they would get none of the isk but it would go directly to their debt this would make it so that if a player has a main where heshe would keep all of his or her isk this person would still have to pay the fine either by transferring from their main to pay the fine or doing the work on their alt
quit assuming every post i make is a troll post this is not a stealth whine its just an idea that i haddefinition of griefing according to ccpaccording to that if people are just doing it for the lulz then they are griefing with my idea in place suicide ganking would no longer become profitable and hence could be defined as griefing and would be against ccp policiesalso according to my post the fine would be relative to what was in the cargo of the destroyed ship and the ship itself so no it will not raise the threshold of what they gankas for npc corp alts im open to suggestions
i dont assume that every post you make is a troll post in fact ive even agreed with a couple of your posts one of them this morning in factmy issue with your idea is youre trying to fix a nonexistent problem theres nothing wrong with suicide ganking its not even that hard to protect yourself from itas for the profitability youre right  i misread your original post of course you could accomplish the same thing by saying suicide ganking is against the rules and that spawning concord  instant ban no programming requiredof course well lose a lot of new players that accidentally shoot their fleet mates but omelet  broken eggs right
its not a problem how so i thought it was still a fairly large problem in eveparticularly a few days ago i was transporting some superconductors to jita in order to sell for about twice or 3 times the amount they would go for in my home system yay iskies and on the way i was targeted at least 4 times that indicated to me that suicide ganking is still somewhat of a problem in the eve universe no one ganked me because it wasnt worth itas for the suicide ganking against rules instaban that might be true however i think we would find it more effective to take away the profit of it in order to discourage it in other ways rather than just punishment by ccp officials in other words motivate people not to do it as it would make an automated system instead of people possibly trying to do it and not get caughtas for new players i would honestly think that they would get popped long before they accidentally destroy a fleet mates ship if theyre in a corporation together then i wouldnt impose the fee because that is simply the corporations mistake for letting that person in
suicide ganking as it is now is a definite problem to those being ganked i wouldnt expect those who live by ganking to be in here supporting this after all its pretty much an exploit as its based on figuring out how to circumvent the concord game mechanic either way im all for a middle ground here the problem is easily solved by making the wreck of ganked ship accessible only to the the person ganked thereby negating the potential payout that makes suicide ganking worth the initial cost or by having either no loot dropped on high sec ganks or by having concord destroy the wrecknone of these options makes suicide ganking impossible or illegal thereby making high sec safer it just eliminates suicide ganking for profit iow you can still gank people for revenge or kill mail but not for profit this is really the way it should be as it means you would actually have to lose something in order to kill illegally in high sec but the option would still be thereproblem solved
or people could just stop flying around as piUFFFData there are plenty of ways to avoid suicide ganking1 dont carry more than 1bn in a freighter2 use the corporate hangarship maintenance bay of the orca3 use cloaky transports not afk hauling readyif you really have to violate rule number 1a have a scoutb have someone webbing the freighter double web daredevil or rapiers are awesome for the joband suddenly ganking you becomes much less likely
eve is an mmo it shouldnt be designed for people to fly 10b of stuff in a freighter solo ever there are so many different ways to prevent getting ganked in high sec laziness and stupidity is why people get ganked in high sec not game mechanics
if you know of someone who has performed a suicide gank and not gotten the ship they were in popped by concord you are correct that is exploit by all means file a petition and that individual will receive the swift banhammer of justiceon the other hand if concord showed up and said individuals lost the ships they were in at the time of the gank then no exploit was committed they committed a crime and they paid the price
the exploit im talking about is figuring out how much firepower is needed to take a certain ship down before you yourself get popped by concord not a strict exploit of course but thats why in my op i said pretty much an exploitreading through the thread you can plainly see it consists of 2 groups of people those who get ganked and those who do the ganking guess which ones support this and which dontlike i said im not saying it should be illegal to suicide gank just that theyre shouldnt be any payout for ithow fair would you think it was if i put up an insurance policy on my wife murdered her and even though i went to jail i still got the insurance payout and everything she owned current suicide ganking is too much like laughing all the way to jail while flashing your victims wallet
err lol yes well  no 
like i said if youre the one doing the ganking then of course you think its good and fairyoure right darius dont fly a money balloon around and it wont happen to you i only find it aggravating because id love to be able to put together a mission ship with officer modules loaded but thats become as dangerous as giving northern coalition the raspberries in null sec some things you just dont do out of common sense but it doesnt mean you have to like that you cant do them or not try to change themwill this issue be resolved in the future no of course not but ill still give it a thumb
i dont gank and i dont support this proposal either your initial premise is flawed
no they actually said its an intended mechanic that is fully supportedits only a problem for people that persist in afkautopiloting valuables in untanked haulers
no its a problem for any pilot flying a ship thats worth enoughwell vel if you dont gain or lose from this proposal then why are you even interested enough to be in the thread not that you arent entitled to your opinion i was just curious youre certainly allowed to be in here i was just wondering why it mattered enough for you to take the time to respond if it doesnt effect you
that sounds like if you dont agree get out of the thread sorry thats not how it worksps i havent been ganking myself either
is there a link to something from ccp saying this
this comming from someone that has never suicideganked but has been suicidegankedits fine i made a mistake i lost my shipif you feel youre scanned down by suicidegankers quickly get the  out and dont warp to next gateif you feel youre afraid to lose your officerfit dont fly it and under no circumstance go to that one mission hub for that one corp in that certain part of caldari space we all know what im talking about bottom line is that you should neverever fly something you cant affoard to lose including whats in cargo lesson everyone should be familiar if they have found their way to forums
because i like eve and changes like this will fundamentally affect the dark and dangerous feeling that makes the game fun for me so its not entirely accurate to say i dont stand to lose i stand to lose an aspect of the game that makes it interesting  the idea that even in safe parts of space i still need to pay attention and not be complacent that even in safe parts of space i my ship and my cargo are at risk taking that away would diminish eve
not supportedat least not until highsec ceases being a major isk faucet through missions etc if highsec was just for brand new newbies industry and trading i would support this but its far more than this atm
fair enough thats one of the more logical reasons ive heard on this or any other subject of late admittedly my own reasons are selfish since i would just like the ability to fly around a bs with officer modules without having a target painted on my back but like i said supported or not this idea will never be implemented so it sort of makes the discussion rather hypothetical at bestcheers and safe flying
you know you want them we all want themskills dont matter make them insane electronics v mechanics v gunnery v hell make it all of thembut please make salvage runs less pain
bumpalso consider the social aspect of a system like this currently the sort of cooperation you have while mining is hauling mining boostingwith this suggestion you can have someone first drill away useless rock with a strip miner second person comes in with a smaller ship and removes the last parts that was missed by the blunt strip miner a third person mines most of the exposed minerals with another strip miner and a fourth person mines the scraps thats left with a smaller laserthats four people involved just in the mining process two of which can be new players then you also have the hauling and boosting like before it got potential for being more social and newb friendly while not stopping anyone from doing it solo
this sounds an awful lot like my idea that i posted yesterday however this one has a lot more built upon it and is meh presented better than mine i support itwhat about having artifacts inside the asteroid that is scannable and you would have to carefully clean it off and pull it out of the asteroid without damaging it like i mentioned in my post
would love a link to that post btw cause as i see it macro minersratters are the only viable producers of isk to online eve isk sellerswe all know isk sellers are against ccps eula as they allow players to negate ccps methods put in place to allow players isk for cash that cash goes to ccp but instead its going to 3rd parties allowing payment of programmers to build better more sophisticated macro programmes to carry on the cyclein my oppinion macros are inadvertently linked to isk sellers isk sellers are pulling money away from ccp all the in game accounts associated with this process whether buying selling or producing isk in game are funded via plexs because its relatively free for them and has no paper trail back to persons or locationsthere are 3 groups that u can act against1 the ingame macro isk makers2 the online isk sellers3 the desperate eveonline playercombating 3 has some effects but requires lots of time and resources to do much like killing a tree by cutting each individual leaf off and monitoring it constantly to cut any new leaves that appearcombating 2 has been tried but as online retailers selling game currency isnt illegal under any law in any country this practise can only be discouragedcombating 1 i dont think has been tried as it requires creating new features and trying to make it macroproof which i understand is extremely difficult the raw data is there to investigate suspected macroers but again time and resources plus shutting down individual players becomes ineffective as others spring up almost immediately to counter the lossthe only way i can see ccp creating systems that are macro proof is to include randomisers much like in casinos and gambling websites so that it randomises parts of the selection process in mining that way if and when the random number generating formula is hacked and a workaround is developed for use in a macro ccp can update to a new formula and block out the macros attemptsthe only other way which would be entertaining to a degree would be to include a system whereby damage is done to modules and ships that are not constantly monitored im not a miner myself but remember reading about skillbooks that allow miners to stop or prevent gas explosions in certain ore types if asteroids contained several types of ore that are only uncovered upon closer inspection with scanners then situations can be put in place whereby a severe explosive event can occur without proper monitoring and preventative measures btw soz for the wall of text
i honestly dont think that pi is a very good example in your argument of ccp not doing minigames well pi is essentially an unfinished product since its going to be coupled with dust 514 and hence still has a very large part of it missing honestly i like pi also i dont see how its a bad minigamehonestly i cant really think of any true minigames in eve and on top of that even if there were a minigame that wasnt all that good made by ccp that is by no means a reason to immediately discredit all possible minigames that they could come out with in the future
i like this idea would make minign fun and more profitable though ccp might have to reduce the ore recovered from modules to force pirates to only kill a few mining ships per night
i like the idea of making mining more interactive but i do not like the idea proposed here where is the half support button 
necronotice that the ops last bump was back in july double dee brought it back up to say not supported just before it would otherwise have been locked due to age
nm just read the last post
so you want to virtualize a virtual gameand you want to split up your proposals into 2 threads how could i eg support your idea to make mining more interactive which ccp wants do with ring and comet mining if i dont like your arena idea correct i cant
ccp already looked into providing a simulator and it was rejected as has been stated if you want risk free pvp the test server is available most of the timeim more interested in an arena system where you use real ships and have to pass though acceleration gates to enter this would only allow ships and pilots conforming to the specific match requirements to enter
an arena system would be cool but i dont think that it is unsurmountable for a player organization to run this sort of event themselvesits wont be free though ship loss is what drives the economy 
yes we can set something up as playerswe can also delete the market and establish a barter system where people give isk and jettison trade items out of their cargo hold in space near each othersometimes its nice to have a refined system for doing things instead of a clunky playermade workaround for a lack of mechanicsthink for a second people might actually be able to get some good fights instead of the never fight unless you can win mentality it certainly helps keep a nation going but it isnt necessarily the most fun
well thats depressing i wasnt necessarily just looking for risk free pvp but rather just something that we could use to escape the dreaded stationspinning phase we all go through every now and then the no risk no reward thing was just to make it so that folks arent immediately repulsed by it because of loss and also arent drawn into it as a permanent thing since theres no rewardto be honest if any good and somewhat indepth minigame could be provided instation i would be happy again all i want is something to escape the station spinning that we all go through every now and then
signed  and we can watch from the comfort of an ambulation bar in which scantly clad minmatar slave girls r loose federation girls dance on tablesone nice addition to the gates idea would also allow it to be set to certain players only so as to avoid the system being so badly abused that no one uses it
slave girls ok im on boardwe need a spectator sport to watch in the station bars
i do like the idea of making mining more interactive it would give mining fleets more to do while making it harder for macro miners to operate
this should affect one in five constellations and is similar to how wh global bonus  debuff effects workevery now and then due to certain cosmic changes constellations will have a global buff  debuff depending on how you look it it can affect any constellation and can last upto 48 hours and change every 3 hourseffect 1  constellation is naturally cyno jammedeffect 2  50 reduction on em resistseffect 3  50 reduction on thermal resistseffect 4  50 reduction on kinetic resistseffect 5  50 reduction on explosive resistseffect 6  100 increase to shield hpeffect 7  100 increase to armor hpeffect 8  cloaking modules cannot be activatedeffect 9  larger targets such as super caps  structures  starbases will receive 5x more damageeffect 10  aoe will deal 5x more damage such as bombs  smartbombseffect 11  mining modules take damage while mining like overheatingeffect 12  all ships will appear on overview careless of range so you can wtz on themtheres more but you get the ideaatm battles are all about numbers in 00 at least anyway with systems changing effects people will have to be more strategic with what they bring ship types will be consideredalso macros will have to be careful as certain effects will not benefit people afk so to speak idea may need tweaking 
i like the idea tbh tho i think in terms of tweaking it shouldnt be a blanketed constellation bt a source point and any systems within a certain lightyear range possibly otherwise alliance scouts and roams will pick up on effects and capitalise on them based only on targets in a constellation a sourcepoint in one system and affecting only systems in a certain range will throw a complexity element into it rather than an easily identifiable areait would also be advantageous to scout other systems to tie down a point of originkinda like 1 of my ideas bt with a bigger paint brush  see my csm prop 2 link in my sig
i believe the sansha incursions will bring in some effects cynojamming is one example
will this affect 00 also link please 
i dont know about 00 and i honestly cant remember the location it was a couple weeks back i might hav heard it on sisi during the tests there my apologies son the other hand i support some sort of natural phenomena it would bring some variation in
this is correct if you enter a system on sisi with an active incursion there will be a variety of effects  some that i have seen include market price fluctuations war tax and tank modifiers i dont remember the specific values
why is ccp so bad at advertising future stuff to come this sounds great but after checking blogs and well alot of other stuff i cant find any info on thisfor an expansion that is rumoured to be out on the 16th there hasnt been much talk about it so i was thinking of sins of a solar empire when i came up with this idea and how magnetic clouds etc affected drones etc and noticed even though there isnt alot of info on it it is something getting implemented in incursion does anyone know if it will affect 00 though
gives spacebook a real use
spacebook has no utility for me right now this would be a positive step
i like the idea of manually setting the skill queue from eve gate but if full api access is exposed i fear that it defeats the purpose of the queue regardless of the built in queue length full api access to this would allow any 3rdparty tool to automatically manage an indefinitely long queueit would be nice to be able to change training without the full eve client but i think whatever mechanism that allows this should keep within the limits of the current system
supported for making sov warfare suck less and not letting this disappear into the ether
they took somthing bad and made is worse
it really should be more compelling than it is currently
sov and all things 00 need to be looked at and a team need to be focused on 00 at all timesoh and for the record the team should look at the following areasnapssov claiming timers etcblob warfaresupercap spamming
agree sov needs some further attentionshameless plug for my own ideas here
agreed sov needs work hope ccp take a look at sxygeeks idea
hey ccp what is wrong with you  i hear you are replacing live events with this incursion ncp rubbish well done you just killed of the most fun part in eve the interaction with devs live events was not broken so why you changing it  maybe some of us pilots want live events and liked how they worked if i wanted to run dungeons there are plenty of complexes and scan sites around why oh why does live events get the axe  speak up ccp explain yourselves  so i put it to you the players and roleplayers boycott incursion and let us keep live events if we want just ncps we can run missionscomplexesscan siteswormholeseve was the first game i played where i could see devs and likes in the flesh so to speak ingame evetv  deadlive events  deadroleplaying  soon dead if incursion hits
huhyou realize that the sansha incursions arent the only live events the devs are going to throw just the first rightalso roleplaying was very much alive for the 3 years where there were no live events and i dare say it will be very much alive after them if ccp decides to stopwhich they arent
supporting my own idea as for routing several storages to the same process i do this sometimes because i run out of storage in one launchpad and have to use some other storagelaunchpad instead in which case the new materials arriving to the old one are also routed to the next processor well the really good solution to all this would be drumroll upgradeable launchpadsstorages
that would be nice too
breaking up the blob fleets would be best achieved by first breaking up the players by discouraging large alliances and napsfor this to happen ccp need to ramp of the competition in eve over limited resources limited resources being key whatever players are fighting over needs to be of a nature that only so many can benefit from it that way expanding a corpalliance roster or naping up the galaxy becomes counter productive to player goalsthe other means would be to utilize the game lore like nearly every mmorpg eves lore is of racesnationsfactions that are at war with one another if players benefited for picking sides and having their faction prevail over others directly drawing them into these conflicts we would have further useful divisions among the player base and no existing fw does not do thisthe first idea suits nullsec best and the second empire and npc nullsecneither would take away from eve being a sandbox like many other ideas on this subjecteve needs a massive injection of cut throat competitive pvp over limited resources and an equally significant change in making the games lore relevant to players all of which in turn would mean a nuclear nerf of what amounts to themeparkish pve grinding in eve which at present dominates gameplaythen when it comes to fleets mechanics that encourage strategy and mobility remove local chat boost bo nerf gate camping more ae weapons constellation or region wide simultaneous objectives for sov warfare theres loads of ideas already out there yeah im sure you could and would be prepared to waste your time doing so as well although i do find it amusing that you would mention the battle of iswandlwana when the battle of rorkes drift immediately following it is one of the most well known battles in part thanks to the movie where the very few stood against the very many and wonyeah numbers count a lot but so does trainingskill morale strategytactics etc etc look on map at the size of italy or england those relatively tiny places in the past ruled a good portion of the world however being a game its fun and playability that ought to count more than anything else of course thats far more subjective than even what contributes to winning rl battles and wars
the problem is simply who you will favour if you split the targets so that the attacker need to destroy something in 2 systems at the same time to conquer 1 system you favour the defender that will only need to defend one of the systems and will blob that one if you split the targets so that the defender has to defend 2 different systems while the attacker need to kill something in only one you favour the attacker that will blob 1 single target while the defender is dividedso essentially you will gift someone with local superiority at the expense of the other player beside the strange dream where in rl having more people dont count  outside dd and martial arts films in a battle numbers count you can cover a 21 gap with better tactics training and equipment maybe a 31 but very rarely more than that prepared fortifications and terrain change those numbers but we are speaking of open space battles where the terrain and fortifications are the pos guns cinoyammers and the gate people want small gangs to be capable of making a difference the problem is that if the small gangs can make a difference the big alliance will send out three four or more small gangs for every small gang sent out by the smaller alliance so the smaller alliance will still be losing much more of what it will gain the only difference would be that both parties would be losing terrain or structures at a higher pace than before honestly i dont see how you can change the game in a way that will balance the number advantage without making the game unplayablethe people that gather the higher number of active players must have an advantage if you look there is an exception in eve wormholes if you operate there the group with the higher numbers in normal space generally will not be capable of using its superiority in wh space thanks to the limited access to wh space but that is not a solution that can be used in regular 00 warfareand the wh solution is to offer local superiority to someone reducing the maximum number of troops that you can gather in the battle site so it not really resolve the 2 to 1 advantage it simply force people to play with lower numbers of participants sxygeek idea of a security number that can be eroded even by attacks from small groups linked above is the most viable i have seen to give meaning little gangs activity maybe it could work
hmm damn youre right why defend multiple points if the objective cant be lost as long as you hold onemaybe to use incursions as an example when under attack the sansha actually effect things in system i forget what but its significant makes day to day activites frustrating and slower at best impossible at worse thus giving players a reason beyond roleplaying to go kill the sanshaso employ a similiar system for sov alliance a is attacking alliance b trying to take system 1 to do so theyve got to take objectives in the surrounding systems the defenders if they ignore those other systems risk long term impact on day to day activites therein though really the security index thing you linked is probably a better way to go and seems quite interesting
having joined gallente faction warfare a week ago i have noticed that the hub system for gallente villore is bias to caldari in comparison to the hub system of caldari for the gallente proportionthis is due to the security rating and thus the strength of the navy npcs 05 gallente and 08 caldari i have found that a few caldari corps base out of villore where they are attacked by the weak npcs which are easily tanked however i could not do this to them because the npcs would kill me due to the superior strengthmoving isnt really an option due to the lack of fed def stations in higher sec systems close to the low sec battlegroundsi believe that this must be one of the reasons for the high turnover of people in faction warfare because we get camped in our home system people cant be bothered with faction warfare anymore so they leave then this goes on to having a lack of pvpers in the opposition so those on the other side leave because a lack of pvp if you followed this through all the way you could probably see some market volume reductions in it in terms of ships and fittings etcwhat i want brought up is the unfairness of the npcs strengths in terms of security ratings either balance them out regardless of security or raise all fw hubs to 08  drop them all to 05i know this is only really of relevance to those who are a part of faction warfare and those corps exploiting this would hasten to disagree that this is a good idea but everyone can think about this with a level head and see that it is bias so please give your viewthankscap blart
well thats the lazy gallente navy for you not defending their space because theyre all still in bed at 11 oclock in the morning
not supportedif you are trapped in your hub station then get some of your militia and break out
cannot be bothered to check out the exact ratio of which militia got how many stations in what sec systems if it is heavily skewed though and not balanced between all 4 militias ccp should take a look at this it is not like fw gets a huge amount of love from them anyway so even minor tweaks will surely help
since us players are not allowed to discuss moderation perhaps the csm could attempt to do so for usi propose the csm works with ccp to amend forum rules so they better suit the needs and expression of the players instead of the iron fist approach that is commonly takenpoints that would be includedon patchdays allow one feedback thread for each aspect of the patch instead of one thread for everything in which nothing constructive can happen getting pushed into one thread is like forcing us into an echochamber where our particular feeadback becomes negligiblewhen there is a controversy of some sort it results in page after page of locked threads instead those posts should be left open to allow the issue to run its course instead of having it dominate 3 pages of forum threads in general discussionallow killboard links as long as the post has a minimal amount of content to go with itgenerally make the forums more like the sandbox that the game is the only real moderation that should be needed is to stop true spam inappropriate language and personal attacks
the corp tab needs work its outdated its awful and it needs some helpi have no suggestions i leave the particulars up to you  just make it betterthank you
yay more botting
watching good ideas sink in the sea of wrong that is the assembly hall makes me sad
where is the surface on a gas planet
at the distance from the center of planet where surface gravity is calculated at least in eve in reality its matter of definition  most simple is some arbitrary level where pressure is x units altho tbh with those distances between us as observers and gas planets for us they are kinda point masses
under its atmospheregas planets do have a surface just not a solid one think of it like the surface of water but made of very dense gases
in a gas planet there might or might not be a solid core below that layer weve not found a way yet to determine thisif its there the temperature at the surface would be in the order of 35000 k and pressure around 4000 gpa for your average gas planet not an ideal place for a colony so best to assume the base is floating in the atmospherenow go buy and read the algebraist you can send me 100 m isk in thanks later
lol
it has yet to be proved that a gas planet does not have a solid core
you cannot prove a negative as a previous poster stated though at the depth where a surface would exist on a gas planet the environment is so intrinsically hostile that you wouldnt survive long enough to complain best to just assume the gas harvesters are floatingyou knowup where the gases are
the csm have been discussing blobs and sov again recently and will be requesting a couple of sessions with ccp during the december summit feel free to take part in the upcoming csm roundtable if you have ideas about this as usual nailing down what the problem is becomes the primary requirement for coming up with potential solutions for example is 100 battleships a blob if so how about 10 super carriers it isnt as simple as counting ships on each side from personal experience the term blob is thrown around so much it seems to mean anything from 2 vs 1 seriously weve been accused of blobbing people in a 2 vs 1 fight with similar ship types  all the way through to the recent 2000 vs 1000 fights
thats the issue and the reason that there is no actual problem the term is 100 meaningless except as a snarl word hayakawa referred to these as presymbolic noises that were pretending to be actual fully formed language or as he put it such statements have less to do with reporting the outside world than they do with our inadvertently reporting the state of our internal world they are the human equivalents of snarling and purring    to take sides on such issues phrased in such judgmental ways is to reduce communication to a level of stubborn imbecilitynobody has or can define blob because it has absolutely no definition beyond something i dont like or more forces than the defenders have or better ships than the defenders have all of which are game mechanics functioning exactly as designed there is absolutely no problem with blob anything there is a problem with people complaining about types of combat that theyre unable to adapt to and niches that theyre unwilling to vacate once theyre unable to compete even a semidecent metric such as enough ships to induce lag on a node is jabberwockian ive lagged out systems to near unplayability by leading fleets of a dozen pilots is a dozen pilots now a game breaking blob fleet if the defenders of a csaa thats building a titan field 500 people and the attackers field 500 people and their ships are exactly the same but the node lags out then even though neither has the slightest advantage all of a sudden both are blobs the word is meaningless except as a snarl word at least in through the looking glass style nonsense language we at least have context to give us semantic clues we know what a frumious bandersnatch is even if weve never seen one even in joyces wake we can figure out how nonsense words are used in context we know what joyce means when he says comeday morm and o youre vine senddays eve and ah youre vinegar hahahaha mister funn youre going to be fined againbut with blob the only actual semantic value it conveys is grrrr wed laugh if it was an industrialist complaining that he was being blobbed because his lone operation was in competition against an industrialist corp with 100 members and a huge mining wing but involve guns and all of a sudden its serious business and something must be done and it will continue to be used in exactly that manner because grr blob is the eve equivalent of i dropped the ball because the sun was in my eyes and also you suck short of wow style arena combat if all other things are equal there will always be an advantage to being able to defend with more peoplebetter ships than the attackers and attack with more peoplebetter ships it doesnt matter if you change sov people will always have assets that they want to defend or attack people will always have fleets that are larger than their opponents fleets and most folks are hardly going to start telling people leave fleet we have seven more pilots than the enemy and make sure that the ships that are left are a fair balancebecause blob has the semantic value of the nullset is really just a snarl word about people who can bring morebetter ships than you any discussions on how to fix blobs will really just be about using the csm to prosecute ingame grudgesa very very bad policy to start
blob isnt entirely semantic considering ccp ought to know approximately how much their grids can handle a blob in technical terms would mean a group of ships large enough to destabalize the node ofcourse with reenforced nodes or lack there of in some cases this becomes variable
limiting the number of people that can enter a system node will never work if its a hard limit then whoever shows up first wins if it is a per side limit then one side may just split into two neutral forces  take the system to its limit and no one can enter if it is per ally limit then one side will again use two or more neutral forces and do manual target screening or some other form of nip the tendency of people to form up into a group will always be there we can only offer some possible alternatives for smaller entities to have some effect to spread the fighting out a little from the server crushing battles we have now due to sov focusing on a couple high ehp structures
semantic literally means meaning so something that is semantic has meaning my point is that blob has zero semantic value zero meaning it is a snarl word it only means grrrand the metric of node stability is one i addressed is a 12 man fleet a blob because ive lagged empty systems out with 5 minutes of jumpmodule lag and only a dozen people in my fleet it also presents an absurdity if were talking about reinforced nodes and both sides have equal forces if the defenders bring say 600 and the attackers also bring 600 and both sides have the exact same ships down to their fittings then the node can still be significantly lagged out what does it mean then if both sides are blobs the term effectively loses all meaning if two sides have 100 identical composition and are 100 fairly matched but weve still got blobbing nor are calls that either side should reduce its force particularly persuasive if the defenders have something that they wish to preserve lets say just for argument a dozen csaa poss with titans in the oven anchored in one system that are coming out of their reinforced timers at the same time should we expect them to defend with even a single pilot less than they could if they bring 300 players because they think thats a nonblob and their opponents bring 500 and win does that mean that they werent blobbing if they bring 300 players because they think thats a nonblob and their opponents bring 150 and lose does that mean that the defenders really were blobbingwhat if the nodes stability sucks and it lags out pretty heavy in both situations even when its reinforcedand more importantly if the attacks arent able to eliminate those poss and baby titans or the defenders arent able to defend those poss and baby titans who compensates them for the opportunity cost of that lost ability you someone else anybody at allof course not it is therefore a demand that in accord with a snarl word thats got the semantic value of the nullset either attackers or defenders voluntarily sacrifice victory on the altar of appeasing a demand that can never possibly be met there will always be someone wholl claim that two rifters versus one merlin is a blob id like to point something else out about this as well fleet a jumps into system 1 and fights fleet b which has equal numbers and its reinforced and everything goes well then fleet a jumps into system 2 and fights fleet c which is 12 its strength andor system 2 is not reinforced the system lags out by some strange alchemy fleet a is both a blob and not a bloblikewise if fleet a has say 100 ships that have drones and fleet b has 100 ships that dont have drones if fleet a deploys drones it will lag the system out a hell of a lot more than fleet b fleet a then is not a blob as long as they dont deploy drones but a blob if they do
youre right i should have said that refering to blobs is not a game of semantics excuse mebut you have to admit given the fact there are very quantifiable if not somewhat complex variables to mathematically decide how much the average node can withstand there is no reason not to assign relative values with a title be it blob or more than capacityi agree theres absolutely nothing behind trying to enforce static limitations per node but i disagree that is the only approach to discouraging nodecrashing numbers of ships becoming a part of a single fleet i believe the process to reform soverign warfare has to deliniate away from blobbing and look at the root causes of blobbing outside of creating ineffectual objectives the root of blobbing directly related to how easily one can muster that number of pilots under a single banner something i believe doesnt get a lot of attention at least not the good kind
well yes but it can vary from fight to fight and hour to hour even in the same reinforced node so even that metric becomes relative and somewhat subjective lets say additionally that fleet a is heading to system 1 which is reinforced and in which it can fight an evenly matched opponent without undue lag but on the way to system 1 it meets another enemy fleet in system 5 in which it lags the system out while taking no casualties by this metric fleet a is not a blob once it gets to system 1 but in system 5 it is a blob even though it has the exact same numbers in systems 1 and 5 this is my point coming up with an actual definition thats workable is impossible we can indeed talk about situational circumstances that leave specific nodes unable to handle certain fleets but the issues presented havent been make the nodes be able to deal with the fleets but try to find a way to stop people from using those horrible blob fleetsoutside of wow style arena battles this will never happen in eve so folks should accept the reality of the situation if theyre going to keep on playing eve all other variables being equal numbers will be decisive its basic to realitylogichuman naturemathatmaticswhathaveyou that 321 and again all other variable being equal 31 is better than 11 if you want to winweve even had one person suggest that what we should do is remove standings themselves which would simply lead to the same exact groups we see now but theyd just have to add an additional column to their overviews hardly a decisive change its just a function of emergent behavior in an evolving system with a population over a certain threshold you cannot stop it except by gutting eve hey you like losingnowhat a coincidence i dont eitherhey do you like winningyepwhat a coincidence i do toohey lets work togetherokaythis holds true for two people who play together and form a corp two corps that play together and form an alliance two alliances that play together and form a coalitionsure there will always be some people who prefer small gang pvp solo mission running or what have you and thats fine different play styles should be allowed of course but what we see most now are people who are suited by their numbersskillsshipswhatever to a certain style of play who object and want ccp to alter the game so that they can compete in a different niche if someone doesnt want to compete with a group that can potentially bring thousands of players to bear nobody is forcing them to they can do many many other things in eve but once they do get to that level they lose the ability to coherently complain after all a 3000 man alliance is blobbing a 1000 man alliance but that 1000 man alliance is blobbing a 100 man alliance that wants to fight it too which is of course blobbing a 10 man alliance that wants to fight it which is in turn blobbing a guy whos playing solo
i think youve got a very defeatist viewpoint on the subject matter i find impossible to be a meaningless term when dealing with finite numbers realistically there isnt an exponential growth factor to the number of ships that are going to try and load a single grid i think its perfectly reasonable to try and quantify a mean figure for stability and worth with that information inhand there cannot be a complete disconnect between stop blob fleets and make nodes be able to deal with fleets when there are hardware or software limitations to be dealt with be they shortterm or longterm hurdlesonce again i dislike the wow tangent i certainly hope nobody ultimately suggests instanced fleets of a very wow number of ships what is their paradigm now 20 players my argument is that the primary reason a blob materializes is very much supported by the straitforward way in which an extremely large number of unrelated players can tell one another apart from the enemy even if there were workarounds the phsyical limitations of filling ones screen with overview columns seems to bear a reason itself some players might not think that working with a group of thousands is worth it anymore is that a static limitation not really but it is a step in the correct direction this doesnt gut eve in any way shape or form it merely creates a necessary level of confusion to discourage a playerdriven need to condense into groups larger than the server can handle the term blob shouldnt be as relative as you make it out to be blobs ought to be referred to in this line of conversation by their only meaningful value numbers sufficient to crash a reenforced node
i think blobs are fine for null sec huge fleet fights are a good selling point for the game however it would be nice if ccp designed some game mechanics which didnt lend itself to blobbing as far as reality its not like in order to fight world war 2 the americans english chinese and russians all formed one big blob of troops and roamed around the world chasing after a great big blob of japanese german and italian soldiers there are typically several smaller battles going on in different places eve allows people to move into position before sov systems are taken and this is for good reason because people did things in game to get those assets they should have an opportunity to defend them without having to be logged in all their lives however more casual players should have a means to faster quality pvp in fw there arent really big consequences to occupancy accordingly it should be set up so that its just allot of fun there should be many different places to defend with different types of ships the fw complex idea is brilliant in that it restricts the size of ships that go in and makes it so you cant warp directly on top of your target both of these mechanics are major accomplishments to prevent blobbing in plex warfare however ccp also did some things with complexes that werent really that smart if they make a few changes to the system it would be the best pvp in or out of eve i have outlined some changes here
first no nothing defeatist at all some things will work some wont and its not a question of defeat either since i dont believe that open ended cooperation in an mmo is a bad thing my saying that you cant make it so that people wont want to work together for strategic and tactical ends is a bit like me saying that you cant make it so that people dont like beer andor sex its not defeatism also discussing the impossible is only invalid in an nonfinite set that is an infinite one in a finite set it is quite possible to define its nature and bounds and be certain as to what lies within them thats fine but it also doesnt have anything to do with the subject at hand lets just say for example that we find out that n is the ideal number of ships to have in a system in order to run properly in order to actually act on that however we run into the problems that syx clearly described as well as the simple counters that would invariably be used and as ive pointed out numerous times the sliding scale nature of different systems or even the same reinforced systems at different takes makes this a meaningless metric a 500 man fleet is not a blob if it meets another 500 man fleet at 1200 in a reinforced system that can handle the load but by 1400 the system is littered with wrecks and abandoned drones and now two new 500 man fleets lag the system out heavily and suddenly theyre both blobs to say nothing of the fact that again a 100 man fleet isnt a blob in the reinforced system but if it moves to another system then suddenly its a blob be that as it may the wow comparison is apt and ontarget some people really do object to the basic dynamic whereby people can group together and put forward more numbers than fewer people and were not so far off from that exact proposal either you are altering game mechanics that are working exactly as intended in order to stop natural cooperation and it wont do anything more than provide a bit of annoyance in terms of allowing groups to cooperate you remove the ability for players to easily see who theyre friendly and who theyre hostile with for people to decide who can and can not dock at their stations for people to decide who their poss will and will not fire on etcyes its gutting the game just not as thoroughly as some more extreme suggestions but as pointed out and elaborated on even that metric changes can change rapidly in the same system to say nothing of a fleet not being a blob in one system and the same exact fleet being a blob in the next system over and as pointed out using that as any sort of a limit is doomed to failure due to the factors that sxy has already addressed in detail
i think there is much more to eve than you suggest youre making it a good point to pump wow and alarmist rhetoric into your argument and im merely stating what i think is quite feasible for the design team to discuss in terms of making the quality of eve fleet combat go up without resorting to creating a grandios set of decentralized sov objectives in the vain hope players wont just regroup on one of themi dont think i need to reiterate what i posted above it was fairly clear cut and i can sense that you understood my conclusion that the simplest possible solution was to stop trying to change how people deal with soverignty itself and instead change how they have to approach one another to build these soverign blocks that are creating fleets larger than node strength that is not to say people are disallowed or discouraged to take the natrual progression of gaining more friends and allies to fight with but grabbing a random assortment of allbutstrangers togther is quite a simple task and i think that is the progenitor of most sov problems
nothing alarmist and ive already described why wow is an apt comparison the fundamental objection to blobbing is that people can cooperate past a certain small scale wow obviates the necessity for that complaint in a way that eve never can as playerdriven content and cooperation is and always will be its central feature of course i understood it thats why i responded to it in detail and explained why it wouldnt work to effect change on the main issue and would have secondary unintended consequences that would gut significant portions of the game that have absolutely nothing to do with fleet sizes deciding who can and can not dock at your stations for example you can artificially claim that certain types of cooperation are okay good natural whathaveyou but that doesnt put any logical force behind it the reason for cooperation is a mutually desired outcome not necessarily playing with your buddies attempting to form sort sort of subjective cut off to enforce results based on a view of what good cooperation is and what bad cooperation is misses the basic point especially of a sandbox game the point isnt that there is playercreated content but it has to be created by a group of players who might conceivably meet up for beers some day id be happy to have a squadron of awesome sabre pilots who all have bad breath and listen exclusively to country music
absolutely agreed it makes actually for some fun moments when a roam of less than a single squad is accused of blobbing just because some clueless muppet got caught by them on a gate otoh for the sake of serious discussion on this matter it isnt helpful at all apart from a rather fruitless discussion about mere semantics see above in thread and an official sizing of the blob by ccp not gonna happen imho some common base has to be found even if it is a merely theorethical number and leaves much to be desired for most involved parties you sort of need that common ground to make a discussion work otherwise youd just get talking people at each other about pears and apples the only real indicator we got to deal with this finding a common ground for discussion is the limit to fleet size provided by game mechanicsccp if you do want to find a compromise to have a common denominator referring to what makes a blob anything above max fleet size would offer itself agreed 256 playersships is still a huge number for many but it is the only hard limit imposed by game mechanics at all and yes i am aware you can formcoordinate multiple fleets this would only be a theorethical ad hoc definition to enable discussion in any case
there is no cutoff you can make as many friends as you like the only diffirence would be that youll have to be aware of who they are rather than just the fact they have a given icon tint there is nothing to detract from playerdriven content in my proposal hence why i used the term alarmist you can meet up for beers with anyone you want blue or not
except as pointed out your proposal would simply lead to an additional overview column and significant unintended negative consequences like a total lack of control over docking rights in stations or poss targeting profiles and of course your proposal simply would not make you be aware of who they are rather than just the fact they have a given icon tint not even close the only thing that changes is that fcs now have to keep a cheatsheet next to them while they play or memorize a bunch of alliance tickers and instead of shooting reds they shoot anybody without tickers x y and z or with tickers a b and c youre using the term alarmist as a smear unless youre really arguing that not being able to prohibit your enemies from staging out of your own stations is doing nothing to detract from playerdriven content or forcing your poss to either fire on everybody not in your alliance or allow everybody including your enemies to camp out right in front of them and so on this is the fundamental problem the law of unintended consequences guarantees that not only will your proposal not actually accomplish its main goals but it will have serious negative ramifications for playercreated content to say nothing of the fact that if ccp actually takes the step of artificially trying to limit the degree of cooperation and brings eve closer in line with wow it sets a very dangerous precedent especially since your proposal would be wholly ineffective and would undoubtedly be followed by more calls that we must do something in that manner each failed damaging idea would be cause to iterate yet another one because after all it has to work sooner or later andor it just wasnt implemented properly andor people just didnt act properly andor do you really think that people would stop complaining about blobs and stop demanding change if your propsal went through prohibited alliances from determining who docked in their stations or sat outside their poss but otherwise business as usual went on or would they use that as a justification for an even more extreme solution if your proposal was coded into an update tomorrow morning do you think that its allies ras allies rawrs allies would all just pack up and go home do you really think enough would to change the political landscape of eveedit unless of course your proposal isnt to get rid of standings themselves and instead just the bluered icon that goes next with em in which case your proposal would have zero impact at all as youve already got an option to sort your overview based on standings blues still wouldnt even show up on your overview but now theyd just be blues in name only and instead of not seeing them and knowing that they had a blue icon next to their name youd not see them and know that they were blue but didnt have the blue icon next to their names
to me the blob was never specifically numbers its the fact that there is little to no tactical value in most situations to moving your fleet in anything but said blob save for your scouts which just jump to the next system and check local and your cyno droppers with terrain being a nonfactor line of sight not mattering and friendly fire nonexistent save for a handful of aoe attacks its one blob of ships getting into range of another blob of ships in smaller numbers theres more room for the tactical maneuvering and usage of strategy that makes your group of 12 that lagged the system not a blob but it could still very well be one if you just moved as a mass and focus firedso id say the call for reducing the blob isnt a call for reducing numbers but for increasing the amount of thought and strategy fleet warfare takes beyond the fitting room and cta hopefully that explains why people arent so keen on agreeing with you that the blob is a natural part of the game finnedit  and of course the ones who are calling on number reduction and teamwork reduction are noobs and should gtfo 300 didnt take place because of forum whining it took place because strategy and tactics managed to minimize the effect of numbers they still lost in the end due to numbers  tactics the archers sneaking behind and whatnot as it should be
your definition of blob is highly idiosyncratic however and im not quite sure what youre arguing the problem is then can you clarify if fleets are motoring around with substandard tactical acumen and individual pilots arent taking the initiative and zooming around on their own or what have you then their opponents should have an easier time of butchering them right wheres the problemit sounds like your objection is more aesthetic than pragmatic and i simply do not grok can you please elaborate how do you increase the amount of thought and strategy fleet warfare takes beyond the fitting room and cta other than by putting a fleet up against a tactically superior force that requires a significant alterations in tactics and how does ccp get involved at all in this process shouldnt forcing fleets to engage in more nuanced inventive individualistic tactics be the job of whoever is going to whip them good if they dont manage to adapt howeverdoesnt really help at all as im sure youll agree that the vast vast majority of people talk about blobs in terms of either numbers or negative effect on the server and your definition is certainly not in the majority to be honest its the first time ive ever heard anybody at all describe a blob simply as a group that shows little individualistic tactical acumen sure some people will probably add in a and their fcs suck and their pilots are all terrible to a complain about someone who has greater numbers too but ive never ever ever heard anybody complain that they outnumbered their opponents 21 but their opponent had all their pilots aligned to the same point and was using fleet warps so they were blobbingwe do however agree about those who are calling for numbersteamwork reductions
many people forget that this is a game  they become very risk adverse with their internet pixels which encourages players to only fight when they will clearly win there are exceptions im generalising there is safety in numbers so people cluster together be it corps into an alliance or alliances into a nap a definition of blobbing would be when multiple friendly fleets are required but again that is too simplistic a fleet of 250 frigs isnt the same level of blobbing as 250 bs or even 50 supercapsalso there isnt anything that says you have to stay on the losing side and im not advocating there should be it is just an observation this means that people can flip sides without issue or in some cases play both sides with altsid love to see pilot skill have more effect in larger fights rather than being reduced to 1 dps to alpha a target but im not sure how that could work under the current shoot single huge hp structure 3 times to win system and with the level of lag that occurs when you have to do anything more complex than lock primary and hit f1 in larger fightsdiscussions continue and well see what ideas people come up with
nah people remember its a game but they also remember that its got an awesome economy some people who point to eve being a game forget that  and so if you take your nice shiny ships out and lose them lots eventually the ships you can take out are much less nice and much less shiny and the grinding you have to do to make more isk to buy new ships means that you have that much less time pewpewing to say nothing of skillpoint loss with t3 ships give someone a choice between spend at least 10 hours rattinggrinding isk to pay for the ship you are flying and might lose or get killmails and keep your ship i think that many people would choose the latter unless of course you are offering to pay for my losses in which case i agree and i will get into fights much more carelessly totally off topic but this is a misnomer and it bugs the hell out of me a nap is a non aggression pact it specifies a simple lack of conflict what weve seen that has many people really upset is a map a mutually assistance pact that however is just the nature of the game sure 1v1 interceptor duels are really nifty sometimes but mathematics govern every level of eve if you can get together enough ships such that they can onevolley an opponent and you can kill their ships faster than they can kill yours chances are you can destroy their fleet loot the field and achieve your objectives the way that pilot skill can generally have more effect in fights is to fight in smaller fights where the crushing burden of mathematics doesnt come down like a hammerps can you flesh out your description of blob fleets if say i am a tyrannical alliance head and my alliance has 12 csaa poss with 12 titans and theyve all been reinforced and i want to save them if i call for 300 pilots to form up and defend the system and my enemy brings in 500 am i the one whos blobbing or are they what if i see two other guys are fighting and each has say 200 battleships in their fleets but i want to be able to gank them all and i form up two fleets to go in and pound them have they blobbed me or am i blobbing themif i form up a fleet of 255 pilots and all you need to do to counter my fleet is to use a couple dozen bombers am i not blobbing but if you dont have bombers on hand and have to use 255  n pilots am i back to blobbing do the surroundings get taken into consideration too say if youre fighting above a deathstar pos with many ecm jammers and the defenders dont need all that many people at all but you need a more than a full fleet to deal with their fleet plus the pos has their pos effectively blobbed you and is it necessarily a bad thing in your view if to blob means to field a fleet that requires more than one full fleet to counter should ccp work to prevent people from fielding such fleets if so why this is part of the problem i think in that the term blob really has no actual definition as its used 99 of the time and im not sure about the other 1
tactics is positional and battlefield maneuvering which eve is seriously lacking my personal opinion is implementing line of sight friendly fire and shots that dont disappear if they miss would fix it without having to manufacture any pretend game mechanic to force people into some formation for a number bonus or random shiny strategy is the overall warfare choosing when where and with how much to strike as well as the infrastructure behind your war this eve does have but its still limited compared to where i would like it myself the infrastructure isnt my cup of tea to comment on but when warfare generally promotes focusing all your efforts into one locale youre going to see concentrated forces and as alliances get bigger those numbers get bigger until this is fixed as the total numbers get bigger the fleet sizes will always get bigger the only way to combat that without getting some alien server technology is to encourage division of forces if it takes 30 ships to successfully attack point a and that group has 60 willing pilots with nothing better to do theyre all going to come attack point a just to be sure if it takes 30 pilots to attack said type of point and it nets an advantage if both are attacked without it being too easy to just wipe the first point with the 60 then move on then the group is more likely to divide their forces they still might not but thats life tldr  you have to add both tactics and strategy or the fleet sizes only increase with increasingly diminished pvp action beyond activating modules and increasing lag even then it might not fix it but saying its a nonissue is a bit much if only for the sake of player enjoymentedit  and im not sure if i addressed your question finn due to this forums poor reply mechanics and it being 5 am ill look at this again later
sir isaac newton is the deadliest son of a  in space ahemto be honest i simply dont agree as ive had fun in small medium and large gangs with things exactly as they are well it is a non issue by most ways of looking at it every single person who ever logged in for a trial account and stayed with eve did so and enjoyed it enough to do so without those changes and many still evidently enjoy it well enough without those changes to be honest if i want a game like that i just load up freespace 2 and go blast the hell out of some poor shivan bastards eve from my point of view is simply a different type of game you are also honestly the first and only person i have ever seen whos said that its an issue that there isnt true los or newtons first law in the game
thanks for that because my threads and posts arent limited to 1 character  section i will outline the main issues that i feel people are concerned about in regards to blobbingin a game that prides itself on risk vs reward the risk involved in having someone blue or red is political and poses no threat what so ever to a coalition while i understand naps and confederacies can happen in strategic games players are aware that naping infinitely is what the problem is no risk is ever involved in mass napingthe problem with this is alliances and coalitions can grow and grow and grow until eventually more than 50 of 00 is under one banner this will go to 100 now a few years ago no one would have expected it to be 50 but now since it is we will see it  100when 00 is controlled by one coalition will people still be calm and relaxed about the mechanics involved in naping even if things remain where 50 of 00 is under one banner things look so bad to the point where people are leaving 00 for whs or quitting altogetherprovidence is a great example of what 00 should look like ofc some coalitions  alliances will grow more but when alliances mass nap everything in 50 jumps for safety it kills 00 especially when powerblocks are so big they control half the mapthis is the first problem with blobbing which is directly linked to mass naping ccp need to introduce a risk vs reward into naping the same way there is a risk reward into almost everything elsestrategies in huge battles are limited to who can get into the system first who can spam contracts  market while enemies jump in and who can crash the enemy making it free killslets take lxq as an example 2200 nc vs 1000 drone approx not to mention there was a nc fleet in a neighbouring system told not to jump in this is only 50 of nc the other 50 were busy with ev0ke lag was fine  2900 when numbers increased things got messy as far as smaller coalitions are concerned if lag is fine  2900 then it will be a while before lag will return at least for reinforced nodeshistorically when lag is fixed alliances  players try everything possible to beat the lag cap this is a perfect example the problem here is the strategy involved in short lag was a direct creation of nc strategically to give them an advantage againi will leave it at these two factors atm as i need to go out now but theres alot more the increase of antiblob  antinap whine is happening for a reason the ironic thing is 00 alliances welcome empire to 00 and want people to leave empire but as far as i can tell the only place worth going to is heavily contested areas for example the southi think the south is a perfect example of 00 theres large and small alliances who are obvious not neutrals with benefits friends and enemies but exist still since the death of aaa and atlas many people have considered southern 00 as true 00 and the north as a cheap bad copy of macro empireoh and because someone will mention and compare this to rl in rl food consumption death super weapons biological weapons destructible items being able to destroy everything including stations and stargates etc plays huge part of rl war this is a game and is far from rl and in case someone says it saying people do this because of human nature is like saying people do this because human nature is split in a  load of sections that i wont even go into again
i think trying to define what a blob is or is not is beside the point the point is in eve it takes hours to find good fun pvp fights 2 on 1 is obviously not a blob but if your in the same ship types it rarely makes for a good fight
the problem is not blobbing it self  its a viable strategythe problem is to how easy it is to assamble and manage blobsimpletry bringing 1000 people into wormhole system not so easy to do it anymore  but still very much possible
true that because of the unique mechanics of a nonstatic accessexit route and the nonviability of clonejumping and cynoing into wspace and prolly half a dozen other factors not coming to my mind right now nice and well but to adapt these specific mechanics even to a lesser degree to nonwspace sure weccp could totally abandon clonejumping brace for the incoming whinefest and revampinglimiting cyno ability for capitals and supercaps will not really fix the problem either just move the blob issue to exclusively subcapital warfare limiting access to any given system sounds easy on paper but then youre talking about a massive breakdown of infrastructure if you were to adapt the same mechanics to nonwspace all of sudden you cannot move your haulerminerratting shipwhatever to the next system over because unfortunately 20 minutes ago a midsized roaming gang went that way not going to work out well i reckon this whole messproblemissue is exactly such a messproblemissue because way too many factors and game mechanics are intertwined there the whole sov mechanics gimmick general combat mechanics and not at least the somewhat skewed risk vs reward ratio in battles bringing the blob is a viablepopularwinning mechanics because with enough ships of any type tea daze if you get just enough of those frigates will do fine you can do stuff which you cannot in many cases with a mere 10 ships not talking 10 supercaps here obviously adn that is in my humble opinion not the fault of the players or their stance general attitude or that vaunted human nature its game mechanics one of the older memes of eveo is adapt or die and thats what most people do at some point on whose doormat is the blame to lie for players wanting to matter in 00 and thus blobbing up hardly their call that a lot of options these days vanish if you cannot bring enough firepower to bear get a fleet of 200 together then move them as a blob to do something somewhat meaningful grain of salt there for the sake of theorycrafting assume sieging a tower then try the same after you split up that fleet into 20 units of 10 ships each want to bet how much they can successfully take on would be nice of course if you had the tactical option to make the splitup fleet matter as much as the blob unfortunately the lack of amassed firepowertankdpswhatever rules out many a venture straight away and you can scale that up rather easily basically same reason why people bring 1k instead of 200 as long as you can do much more damage and have the option to do anything within sov mechanics eg with a big blob compared to split up little tactical units it is not going to change mind me im not belittling small gang warfare here per say but did anyone recently succeed say reinforcing a tcu with a gang of 10
do you consider deliberately bringing more players than a node can handle fun  even when you are wellaware that the target fleet is much smaller
this is the same nonsense as claiming that jump bridges or nullsec coalitions obviate risk the riskreward dynamic is exactly the same on a coalition level as it is when two pilots decide to cooperate theres a risk of betrayal underperformance drawing in other hostiles who settle grudges etc its telling that youre even at the point of claiming that setting people red doesnt involve any threat what so ever at the point where your argument deteriorates to arguing that having people who will shoot at you doesnt involve any threat at all its rather clear that youre using a rationalization to support a position that youve already arrived at and youre trying to retroactively find support for after the fact 1 of course you havent provided any facts at all that 50 of 00 is anything at all 2 even if it was true the claim that if 50 of 00 has a map then we will see it at 100 is the most obvious sort of slippery slope fallacy ive seen in a while id ask you to explain the chain of logic that goes from well if half of a group is allied with each other then absolutely all of that group will work together with no exceptions but since there is no valid chain of logic that gets from point a to point b before derailing violently its probably best not to ask funny out of all the strategies thatve been discussed over channel command on teamspeak in the fc channel on jabber in the fc forum on any of the nc boards strategic creation of lag wasnt ever mentioned but seriously this isnt simple antinc ranting and you have logs of teamspeak meetings or some such right actual proofnowhod a thunk it
is completely alleviated by the ability to outpace a sever by deliberatly bringing many more than capacityif that isnt part of policy then you wouldnt cta for thousands more than the opposition has in reserve and you certainly wouldnt attempt to jump them in systemi too find it quite difficult to believe that the nc or any other entity is claiming to be unaware of their numbers and just looking for good fights if you wanted good fights you wouldnt bring a number of pilots sufficient to bring a node to its knees at every opportunity
i have been thinking of an easier way to describe blobbing and how its not the numbers thats the problem and always ended up with a wall of text but you pretty much summed it up with the wh comment i really hope ccp and csm address this long going issue i cant see how any alliance in the north would like the current mechanics considering how many players are leaving nc and moving south just for the hopes of having some pvp or going inactive
found that proof yet should be somewhere as you claim it exists and you should have it since you made a claim that wouldve been based on proof if it wasnt a smear so wheres that proof hanging out speaking of proof large numbers of players leaving the nc you have some proof of that too right its not just something youre saying and leaving to get pvp what near constant ops during major wars and riding bikes over half of eve arent pvp either do you perhaps have proof that all the api generated killmails that the various killboards have which show pvp going on are faked no hrm no its wholly possible for a fleet with massively superior numbers to simply blackscreen out while a smaller fleet farms them for kills just like a small fleet can blackscreen out while a larger fleet harvests them so do you have proof then because your argument is logically unsound once a cta is called people show up and then the fcs find fleets for them so theyre not alarm clocking to get into the game and then sitting around spinning their ships as for jumping ships into a system the dynamic behind your complaint is rather obvious youre not complaining about the defender bringing massive numbers just the attacker bringing numbers that can definitively defeat the defender to say nothing of the fact that even with perfect intel you can never be 100 certain that your enemies cant raise reinforcements or that a third party wont take interest in the conflict and get involved and as soon as you provide a quote anywhere of anybody saying that any entity claims to be unaware of numbers then that would be a valid topic of discussion
the assumption must be made that youre either unaware or purposefully nodecrashingwhat other logical conclusion can be drawn did the leadership of 2000 pilots forget that even a reenforced node wouldnt handle multipul thousands do they fancy themselves ingame stress testersthe point is its completely illogical to assume that thousands of players would show up to one node at this point in time unaware of the consequences
objective defeat 400 pilots in system arequirements something greater than 400 pilots to ensure victory but no more than 1600 pilots to ensure the sever does not destabalizeoutcome 3000 pilots enter system and node diesexplain to me how this happens accidentally
1 have you seen the list of csm items in development for the next expansion the stamp wont have enough space on it 2 there are over 150 issues raised by players and championed by csm in the backlog you wont get all of those on a single piece of a4 unless you use a teeny tiny font3 break down the pallet of ignored proposals into duplicates trolls and ideas totally unsupported by the playerbase and we have a deal i know many people will never be happy with the csm for various reasons but like it or not the ceo of ccp specifically asked us to fly over for an additional summit to discuss a number of things it seems the people who matter those players who contribute to the csm process and those within ccp who make the decisions feel there is value in what we do haters will hate no matter what
point 1  as you said they are not implemented but in developmentpoint 2  again 150 items not implemented which maybe can go on a a4 piece of paperpoint 3  ok i could have added duplicates trolls and unsupported ideas to not discussed  ignored and used as paper aeroplanesbeer matsso obviously anyone outside of the csm process doesnt matter i would think everyone would matter the fanbois to the haters as they all contribute in one way or the other and why bracket this response as a hater i dont hate the csm i just think money could be better spent without sending you guys out there for by all reports  accounts is argueing around a desk and drink huge amounts of alcoholbut as a poster advised earlier a job as a coat stand at fanfest or a coat room attendant i remember having a helluva time finding my coats in the years i attended
due for release well before fanfest unlikely even if you use duplex the point is that players raised these proposals through the assembly hall csm discussed them and added them to the list it is counter productive to add duplicates and badly thought out proposals to simply clutter the list hence point 3sadly and i blame the forum software there isnt a very good way to search the existing proposals which means we get a huge amount of duplicated proposalsi wouldnt say they dont matter at all however their views have less priority than the people who participate even if that participation is negative comments on proposals those views are frequently useful  it stands to reason that the players who engage with the process get the most value out of iti fully understand that people believe the csm process is a waste of time or money partly because they see no tangible results many people dont realise the amount of time it takes to get a feature implemented from idea to release longer than a single csm session once ccp decide to schedule a feature which adds to the what have you done questions of the csm in addition the role of the csm has changed since csm4 to reduce the emphasis on purely raising proposals to instead include more discussion on upcoming features and ideas of course there is also a pr aspect to the whole thing which we cant ignorethe best answer i can add for the worth of the csm that is that the senior eve producers have been in discussion with us for weeks about a few important issues and that the ceo valued our input so much he requested an additional summit if he didnt feel it was worth the money to fly csm5 over for a 3rd summit this year then he wouldnt have asked would he during that summit he personally spent over 3 hours discussing a great number of things with us
well my thoughts and opinion remain the same as soon as you put it until i see some tangible results how many years has it been sofar rather than points ive read in the minutes produced which appear to be a then v us rhetoric rather than specific measurable achievable realistic and timebound agreementsthe few items that have been added sofar tbh are negliable iefully deployed  summer forum timer reduced to 2 minutes  summer view the fittings in ships in your hangar without boarding the ship view contents  summer align to bookmarksmajor issues seem to be still discussed and back logged on a continuous basis so ill close now and still reiterate i dont think the csm in general is of no benefit however i do not believe whatsoever the gain outweighs the cost in a tangible sense especially with the state of gameplay re sov issues and that clickfest of pi what were they thinking lmaoadded to that ill also be quite impressed when issues raised by the players are treated with respect rather than the ones where csm has a personalcorpalliance interest in  but again what can you expect from politicians in rl or game life ill close now as i think ive derailed the thread enough and for that i apologise  i still would like a cloakroom attendant though at fanfest if i go
for most of the csm stuff i have been impressed but my reasons for voting for csm were based on their priorities which have unusually been avoided and i am merely concerned about the consistency of csms i think it would be great if pre elected priorities were mentioned at fanfest and compared to what csm have done or mentioned it would definitely restore faith in ccp and players will see csm for who they are lets see who wanted a free iceland trip and who wanted the game fixed and most of all who has stayed honest to their wordi for one would love to know why certain major issues have only been mentioned by a few csm yet ignored by others i havent focused on last years priorities as much but i am well aware how blob warfare has been a constant issue with little or no discussion i understand dominion was meant to fix most of the problems in 00 but clearly failed so i cant really mention about previous csms dedication and influence so i will just use this term as an exampleplus since this is all political i am sure spending extra time proving to players how all not just a few csm have been dedicated and true to their word
dear csm delegatesim writing to you today to request your help i have seen the progress that you have made with ccp in prioritizing updates and new features for the eve community like many others we are impressed that you were able to dig so deeply into the corporate machine that is ccp and bring about change that the community has demanding for so very longin the next csm term i request that delegates make improving the corporation management game mechanic a high priority i understand that this issue is not a low hanging fruit issue however it is an issue that needs to be addressed as the system is now corporation management uses a poor implementation of the role based access control model you must go through endless pages of roles and rights and click trough a sea of check boxes to enable privileges to corporation members this can get quite confusing after a while as you lose track of what privileges you have enabled and disabled especially when the privileges can get quite complex on top of all this ccp has a second management system based on the mandatory access control model this compounds the confusion by adding roles and rights on an individual level as wellmy request is simple update the corporation management system so it is more in line with other usable systems like those found in forums andor content management systems a good example would be the user management system found in phpbb3 these improvements should be extended to the title system as well to allow ceos and directors more flexibility in assigning customized titles to members furthermore this system should also be extended to the alliance management system so that corporations can be managed much in the same way individuals are managed on a corporation level i hope that this post gets the ball rolling in the right direction and that progress can be made before the start of the next expansionthanks for your timezen
we have a proposal in the backlog for an overhaul of roles and grantable roles which is still on our radar and has been discussed a few times recentlysadly like other changes that touch so many other parts of the game it is likely to be a difficult thing to get implemented but well bring it up again at the december summit it is our hope that eve gate can be extended to bring some of this management out of the game client the current corp ui is utterly horrible but that might be wishful thinking for now
thanks for your post zen i second what teadaze saidit was discussed at the june summit as well ccp is aware of the need for a revamp but its apparently a very big project that cant just be done in bits and pieces all we can do is keep bringing it to their attention fwiw if i could only choose one big revamp ui project for ccp to work on the corp management stuff would be it
do people who say omg this would take codin actually have any experience with codinghaving done actual game programming before something like the change suggested is mostly one or two variable calls and a formula ogod teh coodinzthat annoyance aside all you need to do to make eccm useful is have it reduce the effect any ewar has on you aside from ecm which is already effected by the sensor strength personally i think the scan mechanic should be changed to the probers sensor strength versus the targets signature with cloaking effecting the probed signature while not eliminating it completely save for possibly covert ops cloaksmy two cents on the issues
supported again change pos into modular systems like t3 cruisers
still no fix so im going to start bumping daily
noand im going to let my money do the talking if they do push forward this remap for plex business in incursion they can expect to see my subscription canceled until this feature is removed indefinitely if that is the direction theyre going to take this game if ccp is having money issueswhich i find hard to believe raise the subscription fees you will loose subscribers obviously but you will lose more and eventually the majority of the player base by making this game a cheap mockery of its former self
noone of the reasons i started paying for a subscription to eve online was because it did not have the microsubscriptions it starts with stupid little things like clothes and hats and whatnot but then someone will infiltrate something like a new module or 2 then a new ship then this then that pretty soon in order to even be competitive you have to pay extra for extrasif a game cant stand on its own with its base features then it deserves to fail cant tell you how many times i have played a demo or trial sub in a game only to find out couple weeks later that if i want to do more than kill sewer rats or be cannon fodder for more advanced players i have to fork over more moneywant that fancy 1 attributes hat give me  need the more advanced ship to clear that mission so you can get the pass to the black market give me  heres your pass but wait all the items in the bm are microtransactions
nosome of us remember the various promises you made at fanfests and in blogs throughout the years and you have a terrible record for keeping your word ccp and yourr core player base remembersput in mt its already there with plex imo  which you also said would never happen once and you completly turn you back on the sandbox that is eve and you will lose everythingi know you ahve vampires coming and are not afraid but that does not mean we have to like it
nope
like i said care to elaborateill elaborate assault ships already have a 4th bonus its resists someone already explained that just a few posts above yours go check it out
i support some sort of change as the current mechanic allows for extreme amounts of exploitationstation games indeed see the most egregious use of neutral rr giness but even alts in nonallied corps should suffer some sort of prolonged consequencei think at the very least the 1m redock timer should be in place this would eliminate a vast majority of the opportunistic station gankers as they are spineless in general and would not engage in such behavior if there was actual risk of them getting their logistic ship popped
 teadaze  failed 1 for 8 againstyou see  learn other weapon
good thing i have the fotm pulse lasers now
i totally support these ideas
supported
not supported while there are so many outstanding game play issues that need huge amounts of work once those are finished perhaps
i support this
 have you looked at railgun sizes vs projectile sizes latelya 425mm railgun is a max sized battleship turreta 425mm autocannon fits on a cruiseri think its a safe bet projectile rounds are bigger
rail charges are accelerated to many times the speed of projectile charges the cartridge must contain a significant amount of propellant to make this happen in addition in order to pack near the same energy they need to be much larger hence the 1400mm vs 425 etc both sizes are pretty arbitrary and ridiculous but whateverparticle blasters similarly dont need to fire as much stuff at the enemy consider1kg 95 u235 projectile  88250000 mj1kg d2 fusion projectile  576000000 mj1kg matterantimatter annihilation  90000000000 mj
what railgun charges dont contain any propellant theyre fired from railguns do a google search for railguns youll like emalso if you look at the measurements and graphics of the different ammunition ingame the projectile rounds should be way bigger than hybrid charges based on the listed diameters and the proportion of length to diameter shown in the graphics
those numbers are not really relevant because railguns dont use fission fusion ot antimatter charges they take energy from the ships capacitor whichever way it got tere and use it to accelerate a chunk of metal the hunk of metal melts partially during acceleration which is why it looks cool the way it does and hit its target no explosives involved except for antimatter ammo as much as i enjoy discussing the rp perspective of this could we focus on the effect it would have on game play
100 support on all 6 points excellent work bringing all the issues together its easier to grasp the extent of the hybrid problem and possible solutions in this format
honestly hybrids just need to do something different lasers have high dps missiles have higher but lagged dps projectiles have alpha strike hybrids have effectively no niche from a balance standpoint sure what the op suggests would make them better honestly i think the hybrid ships are a large part of the problem
while gallente ships are certainly part of the problem hybrids themselves being fixed would go a long way toward making them better in my eyes as it is now the only gallente ships i fly anymore are drone boatsi mean when you think about it gallente ships suffer from the same lack of a niche that their weapon system suffers from they dont armor tank as well as amarr but theyre not as fast as minmatar what you end up with is a ship sort of halfassing it not quite fast enough not quite tanky enough the other races ships are more specialized for their purposesanyway i agree with the ops proposed changes i especially like the idea of shorter reload times rails that damage both armor and shield simultaneously and better tracking
i agree that ammo changes could allow hybrids to really be a hybridi suggested something similar to the projectile changes 3 range groups but rather than damage type flexibility as you get with projectiles you could have different tracking and firing speed adjusting the alpha for similar dps within each groupthis would allow you to pick slower firing ammo to give more alpha with less tracking a faster firing ammo with less alpha but better tracking or a jack of all trades with no tracking or refire bonuses within each range bandi also suggested 5 second reload to allow changing from long range to short range ammo to give better situational flexibilitycap use should be looked at as should the ammo sizesnow that roflkits have been looked at i think it is time for hybrids
i actually didnt think about thattand i think its a great idea nobody sane will spend 10 seconds reloading for 5 more optimal it usually isnt a deal big enough you dont see much difference between uranium and plutonium charges there is little difference between thorium and lead tracking and firing speed could on the other hand be immensely useful mind if i add it to the original post
first off thank you for posting a well reasoned topic with some positive changes1this argument actually holds a great deal of water and im pleased you brought it up because its something i didnt really notice before2i like this idea alot hybrid reloads absolutely slaughter the dps of gallente ships3ill up you one more step and say the whole sig radius algorithm needs revising so that blasters work without being broken and able to hit orbiting cruisers the tracking issue is a tough problem because the math really isnt well understood it seems to me that even though sig radius is supposed to simulate a larger target area its really just an abstract number and what the formula is really working on are two euclidean points this needs to be revised to take into account how large a battleship orbiting at 2500m would actually be in terms of surface area to a tracking turret it would take up a large portion of the sky in terms of arcseconds and would likely be extremely easy to hit4i think ccp are working on some t2 ammo tweaks but i have no idea what they have planned i feel that blaster boats should be focusing far more on optimal range  the falloff bonuses given to many hulls are quite nonsensical blasters should have a very low falloff as realistically the plasma from the charge would lose cohesion rapidly5i dont know if hybrids necessarily need to be better scorewise than projectiles but blasters in particular need some kind of clear advantage for the risk involved in getting a gun platform into range in order to do damagealso hats off to teadaze for being the first csm type i can remember whos touched the hybrids issue thanks editthis is a very good idea also i remember when i was first learning eve and wondered why the hell there were so many different kinds of hybrid ammo that did absolutely nothing afaik the only types that are used are antimatter lead and sometimes i personally use iridium for range because lets face it the t2 ammo sucks horribly and iron hits like a wet noodlei keep coming back to wishing that railguns also had some kind of shieldpiercing or shield bleed capability perhaps thats something that could be done to buff the long range t2 ammo when it gets looked at
as much as i would enjoy shieldpiersing and i am afraid that it might be overpowered i mean if you have a drake with 700 dps passive tank and a ceptoraf with rails tackles it and kills it just by damage bleeding through shield is that fair i am not sure
lots of awesome ideas here and i totally agreed with that hybrids need fixing badly but its not just them its also the ships that use them that for example have very hard time staying in range for the blasters to hit so in short fix the whole gallentean race look at all ships stats bonuses how much its is used and for what etcespecially the diemost and the ishnotfittingtarishtar need some luve also missiles on gallente ships arejust not right oedityeah and fix the most important part about gallente ships being the slowest with the shortest guns that just does not fit iemake gallente ships the fastest yes that means faster than minmatar ships ps dont fear to make hybrids overpowered as they have the most penalties of all weapons so ammo use cap use so in return they should be better then the others
feel free to add it as another possible fix i havent quoted numbers etc because that is something for game design to look at however i would say the max alpha from a railgun should be less than an arty for example and that a blaster should have the highest dps of any gun at point blank rangeas with all csm proposals we cant promise ccp will implement the exact solution provided here think of them more as guidelines
1 the drawbacks of ammo size can be intentional because of other strongpoints of hybrid weapons there are no strong points i would like to change that firstand roleplay reasons can be easily fixed like the unstable material contained in the charge needs a very large powered protective container for transport2 like the idea as a general game change to make weapons more diverse change load times of hybrids to 5 seconds and also change missiles to 20 seconds also double the capacity of missile launchersthat way we have 4 flavors of weapon systems based on another factor currenty we have normal systems and overpowered lasers judging by this characteristic3 tracking is a major problem for blasters mostly caused by the great speed web nerf webs got nerfed by 50 and now blasters are realy unfairly underpowered they need an almost 100 boost to tracking just to bring them inline with the prenerf status which would mean that you can hit things if you web them still cant hit anything not webed also all weapon systems got hurt by the web nerf so the number shouldnt relay be 100 but still atleast as much that a bs can hit another bs while orbiting it4 agree simple math 25 on half plus another 25 on the other half is not a total of 50 its a total of 25 so yes that needs changing to 40 regardless of any other changes to hybrids 5 agree blasters need a major dps boost current status is that you get maybe 20 more dps in exchange for something like 45 times smaler range exact number for dps boost needs to be thought out carefuly and also depends on point 3 if they get a tracking bost then a minor dps bost is needed and if they dont get the tracking boost then their dps should be insane because you cant hit anything anyway6 rails are wierd the main problem is that they suck at medium ranges wich is a problem for galente pve because at pve ranges of 2070km acs and pulses double the dps of railguns with better tracking for pvp they can be used as snipers on extreme ranges and then work mostly fine i cant propose a good solution to them
imma kill myself i just crosstrained amarr bs and guns to all 5 as i hate how useless hybrids are and now everyones on the improve hybrids train god damn im all for it but it couldnt have been 3 months sooner no
the omen has  poor fitting skills and i can easily fit tech 2 guns on all the other races gun cruisers why not on the omen tooyou can get 5 t2 fmps fitted with an mwd and plate but that does require max fitting skills and a acr
heh over the past 3 years ive been playing the game i mustve made like 5 topics about boosting omens fitting stats all i could ever get was a bunch of replies with that one got omen build with an ab and a bunch of resistance plating on battleclinic or the one with beam lasersits awesome that this finally kicks in an omen with a rack of medium pulses 800mm and a mwd is something that would easily become my favourite cruiser
oh lol how stupid are you im sure caracalmoavexorthoraxstabberrupture all need filler items like adaptive nano platings because they cant fit anything you cant fit tech 2 gunsmwd800mm plate no matter what on perfect skillsits like this ship is fiiinnnnneeeee you only need perfect fitting skills to fly a basic tech 1 setup forget about rigs though and dont put tech 2 stuff in it or teh univers asplodes ksrsly this ship had 4 turret hardpoints back in the day now it got 5th to deal competetive dps but no one bothered to calculate how much that actually requires to fit so it was a mistake just fix it theres no reason to argue over this
wow the emorage in here is awesome these are t1 cruisers at the end of the day and your trying to shoe horn all that t2 gear onto it im not saying that you shouldnt be able to fit t2 gear to t1 but it is difficult it requires a lot of skilling and in the end still probably requires some kind of fitting modrigi am honestly for boosting ships when required especially fitting requirements but when i cant see anything wrong with a ship i am going to say nooh and yes those are expensive guns use your brain and fit the nest ones down if you cant afford them
your aurgument fails so you turn to insultsgood job there buddy you are almost at a five year old maturity levelnope the other t1s mentioned in this thread fit fine its just this oneso required is whathow bout when it is the least flown direct combat cruiser thats usually a hint the next ones down happen to be five mil your grasp on market concepts seem to be as bad as your eftfu the ones before that wont fit with early to middle skill level and a large portion of your fit was meta 4 and costs millions again for a starting level cruiser try not to make it more expensive then the navy versionat the cost you describe it would be cheaper to buy and fit a prophecy or harbingerbut go ahead and make more assumptions and link more overpriced eft fail fits it only serves to bring home what 90 of people in this thread agree with and bumbs it to relavence for new people
well and the caracal both that and the omen require more fitting mods for a tech 2 fit than any of there equivalent cruisers vexor needs no fitting mods to t2 fit neither does the arbitrator stabber bellicose blackbird celestis probably spelt wrong only the caracal and omen
at least it has the assualt fit and the heavy sniper fitbut it is sad that the caracal can not run a hamlsemwd wo fitting mods like the 220mmlsemwd stabber can and the 800mmmwdelectron vexor which can load three to four types of droneskinda sad the first true ham ship you get is the drake it is an excellent cruiser weapon and caldaris main weapon and it can not be fitso much balence so little threads
saw all these thumb up pics and wanted to do one to on a more serisos note i thing this is a good ideascorpionidae
well tbh the omen has a sniper fit too  see below the problem is that it cant fit hbls even without a tank and with fitting modsbut imo the bigger problem is that it lacks the saving grace of the caracals amls quads should be pulse lasers not beam lasersso im supporting but id like to see quads transformed to pulses with the relevant changes in range damage and trackingomen beams5x focused medium beam laser ii aurora myt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivelarge azeotropic ward salubrity isensor booster iiheat sink iitracking enhancer iifaq phase code tracking subroutinesdamage control iireactor control unit iimedium antiem screen reinforcer ilow friction nozzle joints imedium energy burst aerator i low skilled characters can change this to a shield rig and it should fit with awu iv
to be quite frank i really like the caracal it performs great in the right hands and along with the stabber its a compact little cruiser that flies like a slightly oversized frigate im really happy i have this kind of ship option in gamebut if someones looking for a brawling missile t1 cruiser id see a problem since caracal is the only candidate
wondering whether the a csm could take it onboard and present to ccp to be able to right click a non market item and select a view avail contracts tab in the menu presentedbonus of this  to be able to view contracts for a particular item not available on the market without having to go through the contract search option

show me on the doll where the bad orca touched you johnny
oh well at least i dont feel so bad about being podded all the time 
it would be nice to have a cart feature in the regular market as well
supporting a change thats been asked for repeatedly and iirc even accepted by ccp themselves and added to the backlog
supported
supported
signed ccp could you possibly try and look at these things instead of developing buggy trash
supported please no microtransactions
supported or not its pointless now as its already been decided as they say its all over but for the crying i guess we cant win em all carry on
belchi would ask you not to troll here but i have a feeling you are going to stay for a while and bash the hell out of my thread say your peace dont  foot around it attack the argument dont waste your time with trying to attack my alt but if you have nothing better else to do i cant really stop ya
heres the thingif ure a new corp planning to pirate in low sec and u cant even survive against just your war targets in high sec how would u survive in low sec where everyone is a potential threat let alone 00 there r still plenty of corps out there that accept newbies and the only reason ppl war dec u is if u provoked them in some way and smacking in local is reason enough especially if u cant back it up or handle the consequences
my corp was wardecd because we killed a stupid ninja salvager provoke is just a loose term in eve especially at the price of 2 million or 10 million if you are already at war with 4 other corporations i have been wardecd over stupid things and at 2 million its just easier to do so towards new guys normally any pvp corp will accept new guys with at least a little backbone and the urge to destroy everything in sight within reason i claim shenanigans if some corp requires some x million skill points before a person can join if you have a good cooperative attitude you can get in and in hindsight dont make a newb corp if your corp is filled with newbs join an older corp get some skill in learn a few things and once you have some experience then open a new corporation you dont open a shoe store if you have never sold shoes before durhcommon senseonce again this just reinforces the fact that 2 million is garbage for a wardec oldermore experienced corporations can easily afford 100 million if they split it down the line even if its just seven people in a corporation that is only less than 15 million a person a week whether or not if it should stack to be at war with a completely different corporation is up for discussion maybe 2550 mil for an extra wardec cost for initialization which stacks
i get what youre saying anna and i dont disagree hell i think too many corps make the move to low sec too quickly without learning everything they need to know to survive down there and that ends up in many a dissolved corp like i said im not against high sec war decs if one newbie corp wants to dec another and fight it out im all for it but as of late its turning into a damned decageddon the issue is 3 pronged you have pvp corps decing high sec noob corps for easy kills noob corps hiring merc corps for revenge against other noob corps and just plain dc griefing where you dec a noob corp just to make em hide out in dock sure the decd corp can always go out and fight but some 3 monthers in caracals arent going to do much against a corp with 3 times the members 10 times the training and 20 times the pvp experience flying t2 and t3 ships that kind of crap just murders the learning curve which is already extremely deep in eve as it isall im saying is that if you want to have fun at the expense of a corp that can barely fight back just because you want reward with little risk then you should be offset by a higher price tag it wont stop those with money to burn and it wont stop those who really want it regardless of the cost but it will hopefully cut back the amount of grief deccing and encourage more corporate growth which we need to keep the eve economy flourishingevery noob corp allowed to flourish now is a much richer target further down the line
so you would support removing level 4 missions from highsec
why not just increase the payout not lp when running level vs instead of nerfing level ivs in high sec
in regard to my last response to lordelfa boosting level vs doesnt remove level 4s from highsec and imo if your running level 4 missions your not a newbie or tinkeringas far as im concerned for an mmo to be a real sandox pvp game every real isk faucet into the game not specifically directed at starter characters should come hand in hand with an open pvp environment this was the case with uo before the split with shadowbane darkfall mortal online and probably every other sandbox mmorpg worth mentioning while im not arguing here that any of those games were great they all hadhave problems its apparent that eve despite claiming to be cut from the same cloth in reality seems to be a lot closer with pve themepark games of the eqwow model when it comes to pvp  pve dynamics every argument i make here on these forums is to move away from that to a more true pvp sandbox model your suggestions on the other hand aim to make things even worse and take things even further towards the themepark style of mmo where pve is separated from pvplets face it players like you and players like me will never agree because we want fundamentally different games
sounds good

definite support from me just the kind of details oriented thing that helps with immersion
this is a good idea
dudetachyon beam turrets modulated to the xray frequencytheres just so much physics fail there
how if i may ask does this apply to my proposal
because youre trying to apply real life definitions to a game please please dont do that
what is the difference between a gauss cannon and a rail gun
gauss cannon is also known as a coil gun high direct current is switched through a coil or sequential coils and the magnetic projectile is pulled between them by the induced field the coil is switched off when the projectile reaches it so that it is accelerated instead of slowedrailguns consist of two charged rails that have a conducting projectile placed between them the projectile conducts huge currents basically shorting the rails together which generates large magnetic fields around each rail since the current flow through the projectile is perpendicular to the magnetic field generated by the current in the rails the projectile is accelerated in the third axis railguns tend to propel the projectile somewhat with a charge before energizing the rails as the high burst current in some cases 300a can flashweld the projectile to the rails if it is not moving fast enough to spread the heatmagnetic force is generated by moving charged particles take your right hand and stick your thumb out and curl your fingers your thumb represents the direction of current travel and your fingers represent the magnetic field direction around the conductoralso see inductors magnetic force on current carrying wire magnetic force on charged particles etcalso not supported because proposal is bad
 implying that a fictional world must abide by the rules of the real one there are much better things to be complaining aboot
so one of the hybrids uses a coil instead of railsdoesnt change the effect and creating there own group for a high meta gun seems a bit over the topjust means we have a coil gun
someone explain how a damage control works in real world terms 
damage control rlthe one in our ship mostly use robots and nanobots instead of people running around like wwii warships but the principle is the same it cut oxygen inflow to burning compartments and instead sent fire extinguishes gases or open them to the space seal bulkhead leading to damages areas reroute power to secondary circuits when the primaries are damages and so on
jesus christ another look at me im smart irl i find discrepancies between internet spaceships and rl thread
them meta 3 railgun is named coil gun witch would make it use coilswitch would also make it a second gauss gunso that one needs changing alsoand since this is the asembly hallnot supported because the op is probably the only eve player that cares about thatand also because theres a lot of unrealistic elements to this game in case someone didnt notice
i fail to see why anyone would rat in a system without sov even nowadaysits pretty simple imo change local mode to delayed for all of eve local shouldnt be an effortless intel source
full discolosure i am a stealth bomber pilot i still think sb pilots need some kind of enemy to keep us on our toeswhen im not playing eve im usually playing uboat simulators and in those games my worst enemy is the destroyer  possibly one of the least popular ships in eve my proposal is that this ship type should be made into the dedicated cloak hunting ship through the use of one or two new modulesthe first module should be equippable only by destroyers or destroyer hulls although they might be overpowered on an interdictor and when active would look something like an interdiction sphere perhaps with a range of maybe 3040km  this sphere would not have any direct impact on ships within it heres what would happen youre in a destroyer with this module active and a cloaked stealth bomber strays within immediately on your overview panel but not in the gamespace you see purifier 29km appear you now know that a stealth bomber is within your spehere and can send a warning to your fleet however you cannot lock the sb due to its cloak and you can not see the bomber in the gameworld so you dont immediately know which direction its innow the hunting phase beginsa secondary attribute of this module or perhaps a feature of a second module would be a mass simulator as any cloaker knows passing within 2000 meters of another object in space will decloak you the masssimulator module would only when active have a range of maybe 5km and would basically act as a spherical object of that size  so that any cloaked ship which comes within 7km of it is decloaked this mass simulator would consume large amounts of cap think mwd cap drain so that it would be used specifically for active hunting and not as a passive deterrantwith these two modules working together you could firstly detect the presence of a bomber and then by flying your ship small distances in various directions could determine the general direction of the offending cloaker then either your destroyer or squad mates in interceptors with mass simulators could burn in that direction and have a greater chance of decloaking and hopefully killing the enemyi think this concept or something like it would make things interesting for both sides because its not a simple push butan decloak bomer ability but would challenge both sides to try and outwit the other it would give destoyers a specific role which as ships made to kill frigates they are already suited to but would still allow brave or cautious sb pilots the chance to try and evade the detection spheres and make their attack run regardlesslet me know what you think
i actually like this idea it will force sb pilots to stay on their toes when near enemy ships but if they safe up away from normal warpable objects they can still perform other duties like gathering intel and sitting afk in a system to annoy the farmersthe only problem i see with it is that it makes slipping past a gate camp extremely difficult since it wouldnt take much math to figure out the optimum arrangement of ships to cover the entire 12k warp in sphere with anticloak however as your proposal specifically says stealth bombers this would still allow covert ops and blockade runners to slip through so that might still be okalso there would have to be some distinction between active cloaking ie i turned on my cloaking device and passive cloaking ie i just jumped through a gate the module should only affect active cloaking but i dont know if the game engine makes a distinction between the twoi like the idea but id like to see it further refined before i offer support
a stealth bomber pilotcreating a stealthnerf cloaking thread riiight what about cloaking transports covert ops frigates or force recons they chose to fly them instead of their noncloaking counterparts for a reasontheres no outwitting anyone here at all its still gonna be the same gate camp this burn towards the cloaker asap and blob him to death only u want it to be easier u want easier ganks adapt and get a heavy interdictor bubble
there are a few problems with your idea 1 just because a stealth bomber is fast and cloaky does not mean that everything that cloaks is fast and cloaky transport and recons also the man people that fit cloaks to hacs to ninja into 002 if a dessy could uncloak things 7k form it then all you would need is 5 or 6 to cover most of the gate anything that jumps in cant cloak3 anti stealth bomber already exist we call them dramiels and taranis 4 and the 00 proof t3 a tengu that cant be stopped by bubbles can cloak and cant be scanned down your anti clod thing will make a lot of caldari ninja carebears sad
not sure yeti like your first idea it is interesting for both sides without being to overpowered though you might consider to make the cloaky ship appear on dscan for the destroyer pilot when it appears in his overviewyour second idea might be a bit difficult to implement without shutting down gates with itwhat about a 3sec anticloak pulse with 7km but also with a 17km falloff that neutralizes any other anticloak pulsesjust to clarify this 7km decloak every 3 secs and no other anticloak pulse within 40km in the 3 secs following the pulseps if someone thinks that cruisersindus with cloak should not be affected by this another t2 cloak could be added which is immune to anticloaking but needs like 75 powergrid
check out my stats on battleclinic if you dont believe me i dont have thousands of kills buti dont want easier ganks i want an exciting gamethanks to everybody else for the comments this isnt a well refined idea i was just thinking about what makes the stealth bomber idea compelling to me and how it could be made more interesting and dynamic there are obvious problems  i hadnt considered the effect it would have on for example blockade runners or recon ships  mainly because i cant fly those yetback to the drawing board i guess
amen
not supported here ill give it a very vehement vote for no
finally i can post here and say no
well how about you can condition clones to be dependent on race so a perticular clone would have the amarr racial tiers and then another clone would have gallente that way it wont matter what your starting race is
orwe could leave it as is and not have any problems switching ships on the fly
to be honest i dont see a big deal about this yes plexes will become slightly more expencive because people will buy plexes with isk to get remaps thats about it might not be a good thing bu does not look like a disaster to me that being said i remain neutral and will not show my support to either proposal or counterproposal
something i saw in an earlier thread made me want to make this suggestion here as a standalone the sin as it stands now doesnt seem to play to the strengths of the dominix class its built upon a t2 dominix should have its attributes geared more towards drone use what id like to see is the removal of all turrets slots and bonuses and have them replaced by a bonus that grants a 99 reduction in cpu and capacitor to drone control unit this would require the sin to need 5 of its 7 high slots to fit drone control units and make the sin a true drone boat which plays to its strengths better as a mini carrier of sorts thoughts
i think you misunderstand the purpose of the black ops battleships
seeing as its main purpose is that of a bridge maker and its base stats are worse the the tech 1 dominixi would say its a covert infiltration ship and not a frontline warship at alland therefor shouldnt fight like one
where do u get the idea from it is a bridge maker do u know why it is deffinaly not a bridge maker it is really bad in making bridges the current size of the fuelbay makes it impossible they have no real role atm i see way too many trolls around in the assembly hall last few feeks so let me start of and let me be a good examplechanges needed sinsin needs 2000 base power more a lol 8800 ccp did u forgot a 1 in front of the 8800 redeemer has 17000 base power base power on a semi hybrid boat is failremove all turret slots and replace 5  hybrid damage bonus for a 25m3 drone bandwidth usage bonus per gallente bs level and increase max drone usage from 5 to 10 max dps 950 with ogreschange agility bonus to a 75 bonus in max velocity of drone flight time give sin the special bonus of scooping drones from 7500 meters and deploying drones at 5000 meter cloakmaybe a 100200m3 bigger cargohold to fit cap boosters sin is horrible cap unstablechanges in generalrange increase from max 45ly to 65lyrange formula should get an exception that the black op can always jump 1 system jump some systems with  45ly 10ly20ly a to b with 45ly range need to be done manually in the current statestandard fuel bay increase from 1000m3 to 3000m3a bonus should be given to the fuel bay amount when a black op jump portal is fitted it will add a additional x amount of m3 of fuel bay per black op level example adds 3000m3 to fuel bay per black op level the black op jump portal should give a 10 reduction in fuel usage of that module per black op level currently a recon that bridges uses 15001600 fuel while only 6666 fits in the fuel bayif u look realistic to all the black ops u can assign certain roles to a black op based on its capabilities and the capabilities of its racial weapon capabilities the redeemer  phanter gives insta dps on a target form a safe distance 3050 km when used right arazu warp disr  remote sensor dampner cyno ftw the widow is a support ship with its jamms just like the armageddon and typhoon is dps scorpian is support the dominix is a utility boat if u look at the gallente weapon systems u see rails blasters or drones the dominix is a drone boat its primary damage comes from drones the t2 version should also use drones there is only a problem drones are not suitable for this kind of stuff they take time to travel to the target ogres ii are slow this makes it a fail black op it would be perfect to make the sin an anti support boat with 10 drones with max skills  a good amount of high and mid slots for supporting its role that role can be damage remember still slow drones so it needs a drone velocity bonus or anti support with its drones it is easy to kill drones so i dont see an omgwtf anti support pwn machinetry to fit a sin in its current state with blasters or railguns u will see that it is impossible to even come close to match the other black ops survival ability ehp buffer tank 2 x 1600 plates and dps the only way to get it all fit is by fitting 2 t2 ancillary current routers  by that the other black ops get an advantage since they dont have to fit fitting riggs u could say why dont use sentry drones sentry drones are fail the dronebay is too small for multiple encountes  drones loss u cant restock drones from a hauler try docking in hostile space the optial and fall off tracking upgrades are really bad a lol 70 km optimal with 20km falloff lol makes it a big disadvantage vs the primairy wepons from all the other black opstyphoon base power grid 12500phanter base power grid 12750armaggedon base power grid 16500redeemer base power grid 17000dominix base power grid 9900sin base power grid 8800scorpion base power grid 9000widow base power grid 8800why got a semi hybrid boat 1100 power less than its t1 counterpart while the other black op got 250 500 more while the sin is an armour  hybrid boat that needs allot of power alone for armour plates  hybrid guns shield boats widow doesnt need power as much as armout boats fitting a large armour repair system is not a option because it will take 2300 power 14th to get a 350 dps tank with resists that are lower than a cruiser the capacitor isnt exactly big ethercurrently in shortsin  failsin drone speed  failsin with sentry  failsin with rails  triple failsin with blasters  little bit less faili support itoriginal black op topic to discuss stuff in

not supported there are already literally hundreds of modules that can be used on a ship thats trying to open a cyno theyre called guns
really  oh i see you like the hotdrop baitthis is a solution against them end of a single ship which baiting a drake and 15 mothership jump trough the portal to kill a single shipthis is the solution  cynojammer module on ship and no hotdrop and no overpowered coward fightand other thing  00 has cynojammer pos module but no cynojammer in low sec
if you want my support youll need to flesh out this idea a lothow big is this modulewhat can it be fit todoes it need to be activatedwhat if multiple ships have one online on griddoes it use fuelwill it have any drawbacks to the ship with it fitteddoes it have an activation timerhow much grid and cpushould it work in low andor nullsecif there are jammers then wouldnt that make it impossible to use caps anywhere therefore should there be a cynostabiliser to counter the jammer if so what are its statsthink it through come up with a real proposal and get back to us people will take you a lot more seriously if you have a well thought out proposal and are 100x more likely to support it

there is no need to change the cap usage bonus on the prophecy or any other amarr ship lasers are intended to require a cap usage bonus the ship bonuses do not need fixing the base attributes of lasers need fixing
i disagree i think that lasers are very well balanced at the minute its just the prophecy has nothing really going for it other than epic ehp
i would agree if it were not for the significance of armor tanking in the metagame surrounding pvp if you expect to face shield tanked opponents with comparable frequency to armor tanked then they are well balanced however strong shield tanks occupy slots needed for tackling making it unpopular in pvp for amarr ships that do not have a bonus to laser damage projectiles are a preferable alternative when fitting for pvp with the expected bias towards armor tanking especially since that allows for enhanced ehp when fitting autocannons if fitting weapons other than lasers is a sensible option on a ship that has a bonus for lasers then lasers are not properly balancedif there is no issue with the metagame significance of armor tanking then there is no issue with the amarr ship bonuses as they have an effective damage bonus built into the base attributes of the lasers that includes the prophecybase dps of heavy beam lasers is 1625 higher than railgunsartillery with an added tracking bonus for beam lasers over the other two base dps of heavy pulse lasers is 11 higher than autocannons base dps of heavy neutron blasters is 17 higher than heavy pulse lasers but only within a very short range blaster dps drops off very quickly as range increases but remains modest out to disruptor range if you factor in armour resistances the damage advantage of lasers is a distant memory hybrids are balanced to provide comparible damage to both shields and armor projectiles are able to change ammo type to deal with both shields and armor lasers are great for breaking shield tanks but are heavily gimped when it comes to breaking armor tankswithout factoring in the bias towards armor tanking lasers are well balanced with their advantage established in midrange engagements factor in the bias towards armor tanking and webdisruptor range engagements common to pvp and lasers have a noticeable disadvantage that is a systematic weakness of lasers if that weakness is an issue then it needs to be fixed for all lasers medium range brick is the role that the prophecy is made to fill if that role is broken what role should the prophecy fill
current warp tunnel is fine but maybe there also should be some animation on ship change color of an engine flare or some field around a shipso for other players warp of ship will not be just fly out of a grid in second there is also may be some use of knowing that ship is initiated a warp
actually i dont care but 1 
you mean aside from the huge letters across the bottom of the screen that says warp drive active
if you dont care why in  did you post this not supported its a toy for the distant future but ccp has far better things to be devoting resources to at the moment
one year not too distant imho and yes warping needs some work one way or another
anybody knows what are the improvements to pi thatll be included in the next big patch ive read therell be improvements but theres no info about them
have you even checked out the new pi gui on sisi at all a good proportion of the problems that youve detailed are being fixed or have been fixed already check pi features in the upcoming new major winter patch cause this whole thread is not really applicable for csm approval and the assembley halledit go here and read took me the best part of 5 mins to findwinter patch incursion pi improvementsif you try pi in sisi ull also find that idle extractors create alerts in your science and industry window on planets tab and extractors have been totally revamped so that they are more command and control facilities in charge of up to 10 traditional extractors
not supportedi am not a suicide ganker but i dont see an issue with it if you are flying around in something that a dozen people are willing to suicide themselves over even after considering loosing their sec status and their ships keep in mind insurance has been nerfed so they loose more now then you kindof deserve iteven if they did nerf suicide ganking this method would not work all a suicide ganker would have to do is move all their isk to an alt and carry a negative balance
you know i did pose a possible solution to the alt thing
im with develdrin on this one part of what makes eve so great to me is the fact that the game isnt there to make sure you never get hurt too bad or lose things at any point in high security systems there is a definite penalty for attacking a ship without provocation and concord is able to respond reasonably quickly to attacks i dont believe it to be necessary however to prevent players dedicated enough to taking out a high value target via ganking from doing so yes losing ships and billions worth of modules isnt fun but its always a possibility when you undock players dont normally call it an exploit when their titan or supercarrier gets taken out because they did something dumb that resulted in them being tackled outside of pos shields alone and it shouldnt be considered an exploit for a group of players to take down a freighterexpensively fitted marauderfaction ship in the time it takes concord to respond to their attempt to do soif ccp wanted concord to always show up instantly every time to prevent ships from getting destroyed by gankers concord would always show up immediately and have the overwhelming firepower to destroy any ship in one volley this is not the case though concord takes time to respond to criminal acts and smart players make use of this game feature to facilitate ganking if you dont like it no one is making you undock in a ship carryingfitted with billions in cargomods and no one is making you play this game where a lot of what would be considered griefing in other games is just considered a normal event
yeah your right it would work to make the fine cross over to your other characters because noone in eve has multiple accounts
my solution included basically putting the alt in debt what i meant is that if the player wanted to use this character for other activities again the debt would have to be paid either by doing missions or something for concord or paying for it with a mainbeing rude is not very constructive by the way
i think the phrase working as intended comes to mind the devs have repeatedly stated that suicide ganking is a valid tactic and is even encouraged in some cases hulkageddon has the ccps seal of approval on it pretty sure its their favorite in game event
ive been the victim of a few suicide ganks and lost billions of isk worth of goods and blueprints ive never suicide ganked anybody in my life that being said i am against any nerfs to suicide ganking over the ones that they have already appliedsuicide ganking is essential for the economy to continue as ships and equipment asides from possibly ammo have no shelf life theyre in the game until theyre destroyedif suicide ganks didnt exist approximately 5070 of the playerbase who never venture into lownull sec would quickly deflate the economy as goods wouldnt be lost and need to be replacedeve is built around risk vs reward and the rewards of trade far outweigh the risks for those of a financial bent suicide ganking is part of the risks and deserves to stay there if only for that reasonalso suicide ganking separates the wheat from the chaff when youre ganked as ive been a few times in the past you either complain and quit the game or you learn your lesson and become a better playerits like ccp once said  eve isnt built to resemble a cold dark heartless universe  its built to be a cold dark heartless universe itll help if you stop comparing eve to star trek and start looking at it more like fireflynot supported
really according to battle clinic youve only lost around 280 million in the 2 ships that were destroyed and both were in low sec space which doesnt qualify them for suicide gank statusperhaps they were on another toon if not i really hate it when people try to pretend like they were a part of something in order to make their opinion worth more than it is
the one in decon hurt as if it was a suicide gank but technically it was not i took the wrong jump accidentally and lost my navy vexor when i was hauling it to another stationmy main loss was the suicide gank in uedama under my alt krazeek i lost over 10b isk of goods but thankfully only one ys8 ab dropped from the whole ordeal so it was a loss for the actor tooregardless i have been through the fires and they can either burn you up or refine you that is the point i was trying to make

i am so there
tldr mild rantjust because there has been no progress doesnt mean that things like blobs and other big issue topics have not been addressed by csm lack of visible progress is not due to willfully ignoring these things sometimes it simply makes the most sense to spend the limited time we can devote to this volunteer job on other issues being on the csm consumes a lot of time consider how much time a delegate might spend on average each month to participate in eight fellow delegates discussions on matters of interest to themtheir constituents or general gameccp issues complete tasks the csm related to dev planning meetings summits focus groups and other activities that require preparation and have dependencies associated with them complete tasks associated with communicating with players such as writing csm blogs minutes and forum posts discuss csm process and admin stuff boring but necessary amongst ourselves and with ccp discuss topics raised by ccp which often are time critical and thus get priority research proposals from assembly hall that delegates plan to raise for a vote in our biweekly meetings respond to constant emails ims forums posts and forum pms from players with ideas suggestions rants questions etc interact with your constituents to gather opinions ask questions and do research to inform the choices you make as a delegate then consider how much time any of us have left after work family school and life to devote to the csm it usually adds up to the fact that there are a lot more things wanting delegate time than there is time for delegates to spend on them besides time limitations and overshadowing priorities another reason that some campaign promises may not get addressed proactively is because the glimpse we get of whats in the plans for ccps dev resources over the next few dev cycles may make it clear that ccp cannot address a given issue at this timeespecially something as undefinable as the blob problem which would take a lot of time and thought to address in any meaningful wayif it even ever could be admittedly our influence on the big picture plans for eve is like ing into the wind so far maybe the groundwork laid so far will permit future csms more success in that endeavorwant your delegate to focus more on campaign promises ask how you can support their efforts related to those promises offer to step up and do research be a voice lead discussion write arguments and draft proposals that is more likely to motivate delegates to focus on your pet issues than griping in forums i can hear some of you now but you get free trips to iceland why should we do any work we get nothing to that i say this is a community right what do communities do when they want to accomplish something they work on their objectives together many hands make work light as the old saying goes also the trips to iceland arent free when you factor in the value of an active delegates time and the fact that in some cases like mine a weeks pay is forfeited or in the case of others vacation time is used for csm work instead of spending it with friends or family doing something fun compared to camping fishing sightseeing etc iceland trips are work and a lot of it even if you do manage to squeeze in some partying or touristy stuff on extra daysfor which you get to pay the hotel billi suggest everyone who is dissatisfied with the csm run for a seat in the next election should you get elected and participate actively and responsibly im willing to bet youll come out the other side with a completely different perspective on just exactly how difficult it is to fulfill every campaign promise a balanced assessment of how much good was done for the game in any given csm term might be a more useful metricokay rant over damn that felt pretty good
good grief was that rant absolutely necessaryeasiest option is dont make promises you cant keep and also you say if we dont like it we can run for the job i say if you dont like it dont do it rather than rant why dont you lot keep making some update posts in a short bullet point summary format that way we can actually read a small piece of info pertinent to the issues we are interested in rather than pages of minutes only a minority will actually readmy attention span to such things are minimal anyway the major issues will always be asked about but always seem to be lost in pages of verbal spew ie faction warfare seems to have ground to a halt sov is talked about but no action and pi got slipped in how was that possible without csm interaction to either prevent it or at least appeal against ityou either represent us or you will continue being a usp for ccp to aid in pr ect
the point i was trying to make is it is impossible to know when campaigning in good faith on some issues whether circumstances will make it possible to keep those promises certainly anyone who campaigned on promises like i will fix x y and z is skating on dangerous ice since it is improbable they will be able to accomplish that my interest areas are x y and z i will support and push for discussion on topics related to those things as used by myself and others is a much better approachas for bullet point updates thats a reasonable suggestion ill start doing this midmonth for the remainder of the csm5 term here in jita park
well replied
thank u ruleofthebone for getting attention to this subject im running that proposal for 13 months now and u seems to get more attention for it on this way in 3 months than i managed to get in 13 months alot of people are just trolling without having experience with this ship i have edit my first post of the proposal with stuff that really need to be fixed the sin really needs more power grid the rest of the racial changes are optional but i do want to remind ccp that black ops are t2 battleships and they should get some advanced racial stuff in example more drones on sin more laser dps on redeemer and more falloff on phanter the current drone bandwith for redeemer and panther is like having missiles slots on the lachesis hybriddrone race with missiles as primary damage dealing wtf the stuff that really need to be tweeked is the general black op stufflet me hook onto your reply teadaze any ship can cyno onto normal cynos but covert cynos need cyno l5 a 25day skill a 300 mil skill in plex terms there is no other ship in game with a jumpbridge that need to risk itself by traveling trough normal gates to be able to use its jumpbrigecyno do u know regional gates the ones that have 60au warps and the gates are 45 lightyears away from each other it is risky to make those jumps unscouted in a 1b isk slow battleshipdo u know how much fuel a recon uses to bridge the full 45 ly compare that to the fuel bay and the amount the black op itself uses someone must have been sleeping at ccp when they looked at the fuel bay increase no common sence used at all wts common sence on eve subjects 500mil per hour ccp and u got yourselve a new wizkid advizor that can solve most probelms by just using common sence  experiance do u actulay playpvp in evei really hope ccp does something with them in the winter patch i have friend working for pc gamer who wanted to do this article about the csm incompetence for over 2 months now he wants to use this subject among others as example how the csm  ccp relation is since it can be categorized to a certain level of deception towards players and non players i might be able to stall him until winter patch not sure tough
let me be utterly clear  im not saying that black ops ships shouldnt be looked at again im simply stating that they are usable as they are and have had one minor buff already i personally dont believe they should be able to throw multiple t3 and recon ships around the place without support but i know that is what some people want to dothe cost of a covert cyno is irrelavant how many isk worth of training time does it cost to get a titan pilot and titan which is the only other ship in the game that can bridge other ships 1 month training is trivial even compared to the black ops ship itself and that cyno 5 char allows you to bridge into a cyno jammed system which is a unique feature that people keep trying to ignore whilst on the subject of cost a black ops bs is now under 500 mil including the portal gen they are no longer 1 billion shipsi am certain 99 sure that there will be no changes to black ops in the winter expansion again csm would rather they worked on this than some of the stuff ccp actually planned but i digress i also fail to see how this shows csm incompetence there are 100 csm issues that ccp havent implemented yet and a number that will be released soon if anything in the last 6 months csm have had more effect than the previous sessions combined attaching success or failure criteria of the whole csm process to one single issue out of 150 in total is pretty silly there are other stakeholder departments within ccp who have requested features not yet implemented have they failed too but as youve made the threat  get your friend at pc gamer to contact josh augustine from pc gamer usa who was present at the csm4 summit and wrote a nice article about the process josh has my email if he wants to discuss this further accusing csm or ccp of deception is a fairly serious charge and i dont think it stands up to scrutiny
this thread is not to argue that the dominion sov system sucks for attackingdefendingpaying for whatever this is purely to ask when we can expect to maybe possibly see a system support the kind of numbers we were told they would almost a year ago when dominion launcheda system can possibly support 10 people if a group runs high tier anomalies in a group for some reason and people rat without breaking chains in a system with good true sec this is less than a fifth of what ccp promised a 00 system would be able to support and the current state of 00 is exactly what most of us were worried about that ccp would give us the dominion sov system and then quickly forget about it in exchange for something shiny and newwhich is exactly what happened whats the deal ccp
space barbie has priority
do want one of these
we discussed this with soundwave during one of the summits i think it might have been csm4 the outcome of the discussion was that it would be good for the system upgrades to increase the number of higher level anomalies and reduce the number of lower ones because once sanctums and havens are available pretty much nobody runs the low level stuff those people who cant fly battleships can also make more isk salvaging other peoples anoms than running the low level onesweve heard nothing since so ill add chasing it to the list for the december summit
not to mention corporation and alliance tool overhaul
i have read through the proposal linked here are these proposal refined well enough that ccp can make a story out of them or do they need more discussion
we have to make the case for why ccp should make changes to the item in question and once that has been agreed ccp will take the ideas in the proposal into consideration there is no guarantee that they will implement it as described
modular systems sound good imagine the pos shield being a module that you attach to a pos but it only has enough power to support the shield and no other systems remote rep turrets added to a pos drone spewing systems that are filled with whatever drones you desire to control that a pos turret user can control actually add the gun turrets to the pos tower itself instead of drifting outside but can still be targetted and destroyed like outpost subsystems reduced sig radius transmitter etc
imo  big change to help them out allow black ops use in highsec all the ship types can go there and covert cynos bypass blocks sothatd make a very interesting change to some highsec war situations
my sin is used as logistic ship  if it is used at all shield tank cargo rigs cargo expander in low slots and i have enough fuel to bridge small covert op gangs around but the bridge range is much to low for this kind of black op action you can not have more then 2 or 3 target systems in range and even with so many cargo mods fitted you have not enough fuel to move your fleet around cloaky t2 hauler dont have much more cargo spacemore bridge range or much larger fuel bay would help for this kind of black op usei never used my black op in combat because a 40 mio isk dominix  sin even if the sin would cost only 100 mio isk i would still prefer a dominix for combatif you want black ops in combat you should give them a much better tank

this could be combined with the blasters post as hybrids as a whole need a boost but rails most of all
if hybrids are any good at all why do all my pvp gallente fits use projectiles
let me guess  projectiles do not consume cap projectiles have ridiculous pg requirements considering selectable damage type projectiles have almost the same dps as hybrids having all these advantages projectiles simply have longer range

ill let my posting alt give support to this i currently have assets trapped in 00 outpostsstations losing them due to destruction doesnt seem too different ive just a couple of things id like to addi dont like the idea of making it a special ship to wreck outposts it should be possible using conventional means if this means that a titan blob kills it quicker so be it this is a sandbox stop putting artificial limits on thingsif its a wreck make it function like a wreck only a portion of assets should survive wrecking i dont like the idea of the wrecker not being able to loot the station wreck it seems a bit clunky to allow people to access their own hangers from external to the wreck as well what is stopping other people from doing thati understand that it is a ui challenge but it would be good to have various containers available within the station wreck corresponding to different corp and personal hangers perhaps use of the archeology skill to open up the hangers with the hacking skill being used to try and gain access to password protected containers stored within them you could maybe give a bonus to people trying to recover their own materials from the station given that theyd know where to lookid also destroy all clones in the station probably ships too if you are docked youre podded and appear either at your clone location or the nearest empire npc station if your clone was at the station
not necessarily this exactly but something like it or what teadaze has suggested
1 size of projectiles got reduced to make it possible to carry different ammos and considering the higher ammo use this change was done in dominion ammo size reduction on hybrid ammo is not needed since you only need 2 ammo types in general and it is only a issue for longer sniping sessionsaka pos shooting2 reloading time of 10s is fine changing ammo mid fight should present some drawbacks 3 tracking needs a buff however the real problem is the web strength if you want to fix it all with tracking you will create a 25km death zone around any blaster bs instead of just a 10kmlike it was before qrthis is actually the most important point what made most blaster ships not perform proper in her niche role to a point where it makes no sense to use them4 null ammo is designed to keep blasters short range it is not like barrage or scorch 5 a useless rating since it is not based on how this parameters scale ingame but only on raw stats the main problem isnt being far less effective at medium ranges the problem is about being not better off at point blank6 all t2 short range ammos suckproblem of the brutix is not cap in a armor tanked setup it is the miserable range of electrons and the low speed then again the armor tank bonus is pointless on it anyway since the myrm does this far better and it totally gimps the only strong point of the brutix
well there is already a shield damage bleed effect that is mitigated by tactical shield manipulation im thinking perhaps the slowercycling longer range siege ammunition youre proposing would also have a small shield bleed through say 5 something quite low but enough to spook the targets whereas the mid range one would not and the high damage short range charges would again have a shield bleed through but less 3  or you could even go one step further and make the possibility of a shield bleed completely randomthis certainly wouldnt be enough to kill a shield tanking ship by any means but it would provide another niche for hybrid snipers being able to soften up targets more effectively at range
good proposalone issue that is not touched in the proposal is damage type selection  projectiles have a good selection of damage types while lasers have none if hybrids were meant to be hybrids they should have at least a choice between more thermal and more kinetic damage or another set of damage types eg kin  exp
good proposal i support the ideaon the idea of damaging both shields and armor at the same time may be a little much to ask for butperhaps there is a random chance that the hybrid charge will penetrate the shield although not cause damage to it and damaging the armor this effect could have similar chances of damage as how optimal and falloff work with in optimal you have say a 50 chance of penetrating the shield and damaging armor and then hull when armor is down past optimal the chance decreases similar to the current mechanics of falloff
so long range ammo is designed to keep range short while incurring heavy penalties on everything except rangeand other races are designed to have long range ammo while galentecaldari are designed to be inferiorif you are right and its by design then the design is bad and unfair and needs fixing maybe adding 25 dmg bonus in adition to the current 25 range bonus to null amo would be fine then
this idea i never understood with missiles moreso than guns but a flat 10 second reload on every weapon system seems kind of ill thought out 10 seconds for a frigate to reload is considerably different than a battleship taking that time to reload

level 4s arent really an isk faucet to me yes there are ways to easily get 20 million an hour but even then normal players in their carebear mobiles mostly get around 510 million an hour give or take with the decline of salvage prices i have found its better to just blitz level ivs for bounties and agent rewards than to salvage or collect loot even so i rather just do wormhole stuff more iskhr the rewards for level ivs are lower than they were a year ago even with a high quality agent i understand the fact that pvpers want more of an opportunity to destroy carebears but there is a fine line between annoying but fair pvp and griefing with the corp on corp prices are its pretty much griefingnevertheless i agree with the idea of the fine line with pve and pvp but it shouldnt be pennies on the dollar to be an ahat high sec pvp is fine i never had an issue with that i just have a problem with the cheapness is all

an isk faucet  wealth brought into the game that previously didnt existso npc bounties mission payouts salvage and npc loot and minerals are all isk faucets into the game isk made from trading industry or pvp is not an isk faucet level 4 missions are most certainly a major isk faucet in eve theres simply no disputing thati completely disagree about your griefing comment there isnt a fine line between pvp and real griefing because to me if its done within the legitimate mechanics of the game ie not cheating or taken outside the context of the game it is in no way griefing the problem is some players consider any negative pvp encounter that they didnt expressly choose to be a part of as griefing it simply isnt griefing not those of us that have embraced sandbox pvp mmorpgswhile i dont agree with his last comment the pitboss has every right to be responding in your thread hes the leader of one of the larger highsec wardecing alliances your idea is a direct attack on the playstyle and interests of a lot of players he represents you might say well he wasnt very constructive but at first he pointed out that you didnt seem to have a grasp of all the mechanics of wardecs to begin with you also didnt seem to understand what i meant by isk faucet without understanding of what you meddling with your at best wasting peoples time with your proposal even those that might agree with your general sentimentpeople flame on forums like this because really there isnt much point doing anything else i might as well have told you your idea is crap and  off and it would have about the same effect of me writing these long winded posts trying to engage in real dialogue because it doesnt matter what we say the same arguments and calls for change keep cycling around there is in many cases no compromise and no point in dialogue because we simply want radically different things out of a game like eve even if i could persuade you to think differently it wouldnt be more than 24hours before another several people that simply dont get sandbox mmos post a nerf wardecs nerf cloaking or nerf ninja slavagers or some other stuffhowever heres the twist i dont blame you or the flock of idiots that post nerf afk cloaking and other such posts i blame ccp like a lot of developers they pretend their game caters to a wide audience when in reality it does not and cannot span the the spectrum of players they entice to play and pay a subscription if anything eve is leaning your way so maybe you should rejoice that eq in space is not long in fully coming to fruition i just wish ccp and others would be bold and honest about who their game is for if its not for pirates empire pvpers like pitboss players like suddenly ninjas pvpers that raid nullsec sov holders looking for ratters to kill then just say i for one will just move on and be done with it no more xorv essays on eveo
xorv i would say there is plenty of your type of eve left to play should level 4 missions be removed from high sec not at all theyre an important part of learning combat in eve hell as a player barely over 4 months im just starting to do level 4 missions am i ready to competently fight other players in eve not by my judgment eve is not just a big game its a huge game with nuances and skills i havent even begun to understand yet im earning money and learning things but ive only just scratched the surface eventually ill make the transition to low sec when high sec no longer presents enough challenge or story but for now im just trying to wrap my head around it all sometimes i think the eve vets forget what starting out new in eve is like it is a big sandbox and its intimidating and imposing enough without the big kids coming over to kick sand in your face every few weeks just because they think its hilarious to watch you cry i can only dream of what kind of place eve would be if everyone tried a little more cooperation and role playing in this game instead of just trying to see who can one up everyone else in being the most greedy back stabber in mmo history if ccp is moving away from the pvp experience like you think they are perhaps its because they think that too many players are pooping in their sandbox by perverting the experience theyre trying to provide into something ugly
the wardec system is definitely brokenit should cost way more for the wardec it should be more less one sided than it iscurrently any 5 man corp can go around wardeccing anybody for no reason at all this makes their target leagal to shoot so then what happensa the target corp enjoys a little pvp every now and then and they engage in battle if the goal of the war party is the rush of battle they are pleasedb the target corp does not want to engage they stay huddled in stations and basically stop playing evedoes ccp really think this is good for business do they really want war griefers running around and stifling the play of othersthere are very few ways to avoid war you can change corps you can try to join an alliance so that the next time these griefers renew the wardec is costs 50million but to create an alliance it costs 25bn isk you can lay low until the wardec is over this results in players playing less it discourages play and from a business standpoint i cant see that ccp benefits from thisthe current system makes nothing but victimschange it so that actions by players give war rights instead of kill rights when another player ninja slavages suicides a transport or can flips this gives you the right to declare war
well yes when people think isk faucet is when money is generated from nothing i know what you mean but whether it being profitable or worthwhile is when it comes into question when i think isk faucet in your context i think money generated from nothing plus that it is worthwhile this comes into question whether or not level ivs should be gimped and imo they have lost their flavor and context which is why i rat in wormhole space of course this is an opinion and is always open to discussion and flamingsee that is where i believe you are wrong alot of people in high sec goto war simply to stat pads and to attack weaker corps simply for the lulz and to grief of course it makes logical sense to not wardec a corp who is more powerful than your own but even so a good portion of those people who do not wish to fight are newbs or just really like to pvp in low sec are now forced to deal with a new problem granted this is the ever changing ebb and flow in eve but wardecs were supposed to be towards a certain goal to knock out newb corps to stat pad or just to be an overall ahat are goals completely related to griefing from all the corporations i have been in contact with and a few excorp mates i have that do wardecs in highsec for the lulz i have never heard one person say they are attacking us because they want to stop our market control or to take down our pos because they want to stop our ability to crap out ammo etc etc its more of they wardecd us because one of our newbs was jet canning or they wardecd us because we blew up one of their ninja salvaging newblets reasons completely unrelated to the real ebb and flow of eve instead of wardeccing because of economic control or military superiority it is becoming just a way for someone to be an ahat online to people weaker than themand as a side note dont give me the we do it to keep x prices up kind of excuse that is a false security blanket that many corporations use to hide the fact they really just want to grieftowards pitboss i understand that he feels threatened but he had zero constructive criticism xorv your posts are constructive and give insight to the pvp world i respect that i dig it and yes i do believe wardecs should exist in high sec omfg really yes wardecs should be in highsec i will never say they should be taken away i will never say they should cost a billion isk to wardec a new corporation i do not wish to change the mechanics in any other way except the price primarily for wardecs between corporations i can understand the fact that pittboss wants to prevent his wardecing prices from skyrocketing but to be honest this attack is not really meant for him if it costs him several billion a week to run all the wardecs he is apart of then he has the right to protest these kinds of arguments i wish there is a way so that we can increase the initial cost of the wardecs to a higher degree but decrease the stacking costs fighting is cheap war is supposed to be expensive if it really costs only a mere caracal to ask concord to ignore a war between corporations i would love to see the cost for intelligence on what wars the wardeccie is currently in would be nice to turn the tables against themthat is all i am trying to get at fairness
pittboss i will not post my real id on here for the sheer fact that the second i do my corporation will get wardecd i may be a rambling idiot at times but i am not stupid enough to cause my corporation to be a target for flaming you may not want to waste your time on attacking my corporation but i have a feeling a few others might and i rather protect the rest of my corporation from my opinions and concerns
terrible idea
if changing the cost of wardec is a bad idea then change how the surrender worksdont allow the warring corp to set the price read ransom for the surrenderthe only think keeping these idiots in wardec business is letting them think that it is a legitimate profession it is an exploit not a profession make the surrender option at a set price say 4 million it costs you 2 million to declare the corp surrenders 4 million so the war corp gets 2 million but the war dec corp will not be able to reapply dec to that corp againas it is the 2 million it costs for wardec usually results in a ransom of like 500 million how is that fair changing the surrender would legitimize the war profession which i disagree with but at least it gives the victims an out they wont have to stop playing eve for a week because of some griefer
perhaps we are going at this the wrong way i had an idea while i was out shopping today that may be a fair solution leave the price of current war decs as they are but make all war decs go through an actual petition ccp should get a guy or guys who either part time or full time receives ward dec petitions and decides if the petitioned reason is fair you cant just tie ward decs to offenses like can flips or suicides since things like removal of competition are legitimate reasons for war therefor the system needs a moderator of sorts to keep things fair and legal all you would need is simple proof of a transgression or need for a dec send it in a petition and if approved the war dec process would continue as normal price and all the surrender system would go through the same petition and the terms for surrender kept fair and made secure by the moderator this system would keep costs as they are while eliminating the current rubber stamp that enables grief decs
no after reading yours and others responses i think my post was largely a waste of time you think your having meaningful dialogue with me but we arent in way its like were not even talking the same language also just to be clear i make no claim to be a representative of the pvp world especially in eve sorry this is just so wrong i just had to respond war may be expensive declaring war is not in reality the declaration part is dirt cheap

why force the game mechanics in a sandboxif the people want wages then advertise that your corp gives wages idea acomplished and wages paid to those who want them
no offense to you alara but i swear if i hear someone use the word sandbox again in eve ill kill a bunny why do people keep keep bringing up the damned sandbox we get it eve is an interactive gaming environment but im not building sand castles mistaking cat terds for lincoln logs or any other damned thing for the love of all thats holy leave that stupid marchitecture word the hell out of your postslike i said alara this isnt aimed at you personally just at the people using this word in nearly every thread i venture intothat said im not against wages but id have to hear a more detailed proposal before i committed to supporting it
i beg to differ lordelfa eve is indeed a so called sandbox game it is merely a tag to identify it from nonsandbox mmorpgs though whilst wow lotro war aoc aion and eve are all interactive gaming environments only eve is the true sandbox in this list where content and world focus on player freedoms control influence and choice rather than story driven lineair and often pve focussed gameplay with overly restrictive game mechanics in an overly restrictive gameworld im not sure if you have played a great deal of other mmorpgs but if you would have played as many as i did you might actually start to appreciate the term sandbox just my 02 isk
when ccp stops calling it a sandbox so will we i expect until then well simply mock you for your emorage about the whole thingalso on the subject of the op  i sense some hostility from you towards large alliances anyway while were at it we may as well introduce crew wages and ship upkeep as well as docking fees at npc stations scottys gotta eat after all jump fees whos paying the upkeep and energy bills on all these stargates and property taxes based on ship market value and you thought you were smart building all those supercarriers

sandboxes have walls and a finite amount of sandi see no value in ccp forcing corps to pay their members the concept shows ignorance  i suspect a deliberate ignorance given the ops posting history  of how corps and alliances work the members already derive a significant advantage from being in a wellrun corp if the op is as he has hinted many many times unhappy with how his current corp operates the correct solution is to leave it and join one that plays the game the way he likes
the problem is certain people  alliances  coalitions are obsessed with comparing eve to rl to the point where they think eve is reality i just thought it would be good to have ccp add actual rl stuff like wages food hygiene into the gameat least that way people have an excuse to compare internet spaceships to rl
not to derail here but i have no issue with the sandbox style of game play i wouldnt play eve if i did im just sick of everyone using the word as if theyve become marketing puppets spouting whatever tag word of the month ccp has tossed them just pick a different word im getting sand in my swimsuit from all this butt huggingop this is a game and after careful consideration i cant support this kind of initiative as it adds too much rl to my fun time sorry mansandysandsandbox
so you took the time to freak out at me for using the offial term to describe the gameok then i will get you your medication thenso you posted to tell us that you would never play this game if it wasnt a sandboxbut stop calling it that because you are marketing the game to who the people on the forums god forgive we acuratly desciribe one of the points which you say is the reason you play the gameso much condridiction but at least it happened in the sandbox not in seperate realms all one server
you know alliances are free to pay their membership wages for participation if they wish
alara i said it wasnt against you personally dont feel sad i still think youre awesomesauce
well in a manner of speaking this is already possible when dolling out dividends if i remember right there is a way to pay out to the members through that without actually giving them shares even if you dont several corps i have been that pay there members just do it i will admit that they were smaller corps but still the thought is there of creating an easier mechinism for paying them when you want to
what im wondering is if ecm burst takes covert ops ships out of cloak if soso i bring a scorpion out there with ecm burst loaded on it when i get the warning the scorp tosses out a burst the burst reaches to 52km on that hull at 5 skills and you pop the cloaked ship out of cloakcheck the scorpions bonus that bonus works with ecm burst so at all 5s for ecm and caldari bss its 18km optimal 12km falloff 2x falloff  optimal  52km sphere type decloak rangeto reach your 30km40km range it takes far less skills than i have outlined but thats the general ideaif not no big deal but if so im not the only one who knows about this particular ship bonus effect and how you could exploit it to push cloaked ships out of cloak near gates in deep space wherever
afk cloaking seems to bother macro ratters  miners only any decent player can rat  mine without ever having to worry about cloakers
our current options prefer shorter prefer safer and prefer less secure are not specific enough for example if your security status is somewhere between 20 and 45 navigating through hisec can be a real pain if you have low faction standings from running missions it would be really nice if you could simply avoid those factions hisec space altogether when trying to get from point a to point b also in some cases the prefer shorter option might plot you a route through some 00 space youd rather not deal with so id like to see the following changesadditionsmore specific exclusions based on a systems security statusbasically something that gives you 11 options 00 through 10 to check so if you cannot enter 10 space you can uncheck the travel through 10 space option and the autopilot will generate a path that excludes 10 systems where possible similarity you can uncheck the travel through 00 space option if you want the autopilot to exclude 00 space in the route to your destination where possibleexclusions in hisec space based on the owning factionyou have standings issues with gallente no problem just uncheck travel through gallente hisec and you wont have to worry about the gallente police chasing after youof course all of these options would be under an advanced menu so if you like the current 3 choice autopilot system you dont have to change a thing
nothing wrong with this just needs decent optimisation by ccp 1null
edit forgot boxthere is a slider in the menu for changing how far out of safe or low sec but i do want it to be more specific than it is and for a few other options that you mentionedso in short supported
im still pretty new to eve been playing a few months now but this idea keeps coming across my mind im not sure how good of an idea it is but i guess ill find out here goesit shouldnt really need explanation the basic idea is it works much like inertial stabilizers do in terms of effect but it would be an active module and would go in a medium slot much like an afterburner obviously it would work better than inertial stabilizers alonewhile im aware ships already have maneuvering thrusters as thats the only way to turn these would be an improvement they could be named something else to the existing ones like afterburners they would come in different sizes and would need to be matched to the ships massthey should have their own skill called maneuvering thrusters it should have afterburner andor evasive maneuvering as a prerequisite it should increase the duration of the module in the same way that the afterburner skill does for afterburnersmy backing for this idea is it makes logical sense if you can upgrade the main engines to go faster there should be a way to upgrade the maneuvering thrusters to work better as well there are passive and active modules for speed but only passive for agility in my opinion this makes senseso good bad soso
well maybe
it really is hard to say anything since you dont actually propose anything with details nothing on the module other than it being active it could be good or bad depending on the details so all i can say is that this is definitely an idea
well thats because im not 100 sure on the game mechanics to try and suggest a specific number for agility id say put it somewhere around 2 or 3 inertial stabilizers like i said im still new im just suggesting the concept and leaving it up to ccpthe community for the specific amount and balancingi think it should be grouped with mwds and afterburners in that you can only use 1 of the 3 at once you shouldnt be able to turn really well and move quickly maybe maybe use an afterburner and this but that seems unbalanced to me id only say allow that if there was a penalty of some sort more cap usage to make it unrealistic without a bunch of cap rechargers
you could actually make that the 5th subsystem for t3 cruisers that way it can be somewhat pretested before you make a general module or even rig for general use out of it how it exactly would turn out making direction changes without utilizing main thrusters or something will have to be seen but at least could give some nice additional graphics effect doesnt even have to be tied to the current agility game mechanics actually if you go beyond making it some sort of active inertia stabilizers it could add a whole new element to flight mechanics out of my head imagine it enabling a carrier to do a 180UFFFD turn without having any actual forward speed eg
so basically the afterburner equivalent of inertia stabilizers huh i like itcant really see it being much practical use but i like it anyway
meh its a nice idea but with the current combat system itd have little to no effectadvantage if its a rotation only as your ship has to combat inertia before it can increase any traversial to affect hit types but if they were used as a type of strafing module then new manual controls would have to be made or a multiplyer key in conjunction with arrow keys to manually control the shipi could see hacs using this to boost their traversial quite considerably and other ships using it to remove a targets traversial so guns hit better that does induce a nice additional manual control element in combat situations i like the name of situational thrust theory as the skillbook and it should have a lot of prerequisits evasive maneuvering 5 definitely as one afterburner 4 as another nav 5 and acceleration control 4editing for support and id support it if it was manual control only so that hacs and ships using it to gain a traversial speed bonus would have to constantly manually control it no autopilot control
i do like the idea but it should auto off line itself when going into warp because other ways that module would let ships insta warp which is terribad
i would like it as a module for some of the courier runs i occasionally get in the mood to do
bump
i think id rather have an iskprinting bpo as my useful xmas gift and hell yeah some use for melted snowballs of old would be nice as well
pretty simple right now 50 of the modules ex rigs and cargo drop when a ship is killedthis doesnt do much to encourage piracy and pvp because if you kill say a 100m isk ship with 30m of fittings and 10m of rigs your expected revenue is 15m plus possibly some salvage which amounts to less than 20 of the total value of the kill given that you probably need to risk at least as expensive a ship of your own to make the kill and that its relatively difficult to get a fight out of someone who doesnt want one i think this system disincents pvpitd help if the drop rate were increased make rigs drop sometimes too and possibly figure out a way to increase the salvage value from player ships and hey maybe pend insurance is in cahoots with pirates theyre good for business you know and could make cash payments to players who blow up ships these would all tilt the equilibrium towards more pewpew which is the goal of this proposal
roflso how is having to pay out more than was spent on platinum insurance good businessits a good idea to get to know how the game functions before criticising itplus if i blow up a bank and 50 of the money burns should i get the rest of them money and the money the building cost to make the answer is no because the whole is not the sum of its parts in this case the isk cost of a ship includes the work invested in it to change raw materials into functional and usable tools if its non functional and will remain non functional then the isk invested in it has evaporatedbtw not supported
this whole proposal reeks of fail in particular the parts about rigs dropping and the notion that an insurance company would pay to have someone make them lose money in fact you should probably rethink this proposal entirely and forumlurk for awhile
there fixed that for younot approved
so i am a troll for having an opinion on the role of black opsarnt you judgementalwhy dont you take a look at what you are supporting this would allow it to put out 942 dps with bouncer ii at up to and over 90 km with rigs you really want to unbalance the races by supporting this idea congrats you found a way to overpower gallentecall me a troll all you want i am not gonna support the ops suggestion of a 1000dps 100km sniper cloaky jump ship
well hell alara beef the rest up as well im not trying to unbalance them add a debuff to drone damage disable its ability to use heavy drones or even eliminate a few high slots to restrict the thing to only 7 or 8 heavies tops im all for balancing 
i see you like the nonsequitor heavens forfend overpowered coward fight thats game mechanics working exactly as intended however dont like it kill their cyno ship faster
i know where you want to go with it but i dont see what it will solveoutside 00 it will have no effect since 99 of cyno boats are neutral usually in noobcorps so you will still have to take aggression to quench the cyno  in which case you can just shoot everything ie as it is nowin 00 it will only affect the very few places where nrds is employed outside those a neutral is likely to get vaporized regardless so proposal is of little consequenceyou have lived in blobland for too long i fear pray tell how you propose to kill a cynocarrier damnation plate abaddon etc when the hotdrop is made on your 2030 man bcbs gang in lowseccounter suggestionmake jamming the cyno with a directedtargeted module increase fuelcost by a lot for all jumps made to said cyno orthe extend exit sphere of jumpees to 5075km when jammed instead of the current 255km less attractive option in my mindboth still allow for s to fly around with their rulers to measure their epeen every five minutes but also provide a little sand in your eyes o be used by a victim
oh my what game you palying  you saw the new videos when 1530 sc jumping to one single drakes in low seccheck itkill faster cyno ship  oh my open  jump 01 sec need to jump use on a plated ship and you will kill the cynoship when everyone jumped in the systemndrs  does he have something to do with cyno module option  nothingcyno jammer module its an opportunity against hotdrop or when the blobbers want to baiting if you dont want to using dont use it
you sure you dont want a death ray gun module instead with same fitting stats which can instapop any capital in game there are capitals in game fact live with it or gtfo and live in highsec adapt or die all over againnot supported
your fears are silly if you cant quickly pop the cyno ship then you engage knowing that in the time it takes to drop it it can bring anything down on your head from a single carrier to a fleet of nyxes and titan bridged battleships thats a deliberate part of the game and mechanics working exactly as intended trying to fix whats not broken because people object to others being able to throw superior force at them is shall we say less than compelling
that was nice back when there werent groups that had hundreds of moms and over 381 titans in the gamei do agree that the mod would need to be something bigger if it was on a frigate like kessy coul could literally make the system impossible to jump into and i could see the moms replacing a slot in their highs with them so they couldnt be counter hot dropped
i think you misunderstood me in lowsec you have no way of mitigating hotdrops zeroin lowsec you can and will get dropped when in a lone cruisernullsec merely supersizes the whole thing with carriers acting as combatcynos and scstitans being shat out rather than carrierdreads  end result is the same more or lesswith status quo the only option in lowsec is run blob or die the blobbing is normally not possible as lowsec crews are normally rather small which leaves just running really contrary to popular belief dying is not an acceptable strategyyou cannot kill a cynoship in time for it to make a lick of difference excepting of course that the capital pilots are drunk and asleep at the wheel but basing balancingproposals on people not actually playing the game is neither here nor thereor perhaps you have a bcbs fit that is able to dish out the required 34k dps to kill the 14m ehp neutral cyno platform when not part of the 100 man fleets you seem to consider the normhope that made it a bit clearer for you
no game mechanics dont suddenly get broken just because theyre still operating as intended but there are larger groups eve simply isnt fair as such eve not being fair is not and will not ever be a problemagain you are wrong you can pop the cyno ship if you cant do that then you can risk engaging whatever may be able to cyno through and even then you can fly aligned and you are not talking about mitigating hotdrops but eliminating them with the push of f1 which is exactly as it should be if someone brings superior force you can counter it you can die or you can run if you normally fly with a small group then the flipside of that is you may have to run from bigger groups to say nothing of the fact that blob is a meaningless term here used to simply mean counter force with equal or greater force if you need to do 34k dps then looking to do it with 8 or 12 or 20 or ships is a lot easier than with one if you cant manage to fight back against greater odds then tough luck for you red in tooth and claw and all that
nc advocating to bring bigger blobs to fight the blob who would have thoughtanyway the module would mostlikely abused more than it would be useful that said  not supported
yes 8 or gasp two whole squads worth of people is a horrible blob and being able to alpha a cyno ship is something only a dastardly dastard could possibly think up nice trolling though i guess
80 people is small gang roam righti guess you are so active on the forums because nobody wants to fight you anymore
trolling then more trolling nice not very good trolling though im afraid of course i said 8 not 80 the hint is what we in the business like to call a zeroand if 80 people were required in order to counter an enemy force then thats game mechanics just like if youre flying an omen and you meet up with someone in a pulse apoc youre probably going to end up dead whining while evidently satisfying for some doesnt actually solve anything if you go out on a roam youre not guaranteed not to meet up with an enemy that can project more forcenumbers than you can and which you cannot overcome this is eve you are not guaranteed fairness you can adapt you can lose or you can chose another niche where you no longer have to compete with the same forces on the same dynamic if you dont like it go play wow they have instanced dungeons there and the sides are kept even
2 suggestions for name changes1 old accounts not being paid  inactive accounts with names being used up should be freeed up if someoen is not paying for their timecard  why hold their toons name put in a timeframe with a couple emails to them and no renewal or activation on the toon the toons name gets released to paying and playing customersthat toon gets renamed to some generic 1234sdafsd name by ccp and if ever that toon gets back online  they can change their name to a name that is not taken2i wouldnt care if i had to pay 10 or 20 to change my name  but i would pay it i hate my toons name and would like to change it to be forced to start a new toon and lose all that skill time is undesirablei know its in the eula but i dont understand why  if anyone has you bookmarked  they dont get a notification email of a name changesimple  and ccp gets some extra coin for the deedthat is the end of my rant
i completely agreeon both counts
i will vote for myself
very open to abuse ooo i need to change my toons name so i dont get suspected of being a corp and alliance thief ill just not pay and play for a few months then come back change name and apply to a new bunch of unsuspecting loosersthis would meen any1 with a suspicious past could wipe the slate clean of their less than attractive past deeds
geeshizzlei see your argumentwould you think it would be fair to allow 1 or 2 renames that way it cannot be abused i would just likehope you put yourself in my shoes i wanted to try the game  so i did picked a name  played for a bit liked the game  paid for it and now stuck
lol it stard your name for some reason when i cut and pasted itthe stars were not put there by me
lol i know its the forums auto swear filter thing which is wierd 1 change would be enough i know a few people who named themselves with corp tickers on their game names not realising they couldnt change it so tbh if u started and realised u made a bit of an f up then 1 name change should suffice there should be an alias tag to the name like corp titles but with former names
i agree with recycling the names used on trial accounts that were never activated in fact they should recycle the whole damned account  youre out what 14  21 days of training and play time max if they dont activate that trial within 6 months can itthats about as far as i am willing to go
1 to 1st
geeshizzlei would go for 1 name changethats all i needwant 
1  i would only accept the recycling of characters and accounts for unactivated trials that are out by 6 months or more if i leave for x months because of a problem or crisis in my life i dont wanna come back to my name being hamburgerstand1234 after paying for my account for 2 years with my name2  as for number 2 i can agree with 1 name change and your old name tagged in there somewhere but this gets suggested almost 2 or more times a weekoh there is another problem with doing the first as anything other than i suggested it would allow people to get out of there name if they did something really crazy gee i robbed that alliance go inactive for x months and lookie here my name disappeared and i still have the charso i guess i could say i support the intention but not this implementation
ahem
the current system makes nothing but victims the wardec system as it is stifles the play of many and decreases their enjoyment of the game the war party always has an advantage because they declare war when they are prepared the victims only start preparing when they get the notification of the impending war the process is completely one sidedthe war party often harasses the victims in order to extort funds this game is rapidly becoming a game of scams extortion exploitation change it so that actions by players give war rights instead of kill rights when another player ninja salvages suicides a transport or can flips this gives you the right to declare war who cares about kill rights on the spot if you out mining and someone suicides you oh wow you have the right to try to kill them often times you are not going to be prepared at the time instead it gives you the right to declare war against the aggressor when you are prepared not when they are this means you cannot declare war unless you have war rightskeep the cost the same if you change it to war rights doesnt really matter thenthe important part is to end the ransoms for no reason some other player should not have the right to hold my game hostage unless i do something against them the current systems stifles the play of many while they are under a wardec if players wanted to pvp they would go to lowsec nullsec why even have highsec if everyone can run around declaring war without reason or provocationas matter of fact i have a secondary proposalif the system is not changed i propose war week everyone during that week will go around and declare war on as many other corps as they can afford this will create chaos and hopefully force ccp to respond
the only reason peeps post this stuff is to troll or looking to get flamed probably a little of bothyou are painting a broad brush stroke for the reason or the lack of going to war and you are making assumptions based on your little tiny view of how things work in this here universeessentially what effects you obviously is detrimental for all so it has to be tailored to your view of how things should be
my little universe lolwhat about yours and who is the real troll add something constructive or dont trollif there was a method that i could survey all the ingame players i would and i bet you the results will show you that there are two distinct sides to this issueside 1  those who enjoy causing grief on other players through wardec they think it is all part of the game and there is nothing wrong with it its fine with them because they continue to get paid ransoms from corps that do not wish to play in their game they call the otherside names and flame them when they try to fix a broken systemside 2  those who want to play their game without the interference and disruption from others in highsec they think the wardec system is completely onesided they think that the original purpose of the wardec has been subverted and exploited by those who want to try to make fast isk by ransoming others rather than doing the work themselves the purpose of separate security levels of space is to provide areas of different playstyle the players who are good at pvp and really enjoy it go to nullsec the players who want to explore and get their feet wet in pvp go to lowsec those who want to play in highsec dont want to be bothered with your pvp if they chose to pvp then they go to lower security space simple enough for yaall the wardec system achieves is it forces players who do not chose to pvp on their own to either pvp or hide from the war when they are hiding they are not enjoying their game can i speak for everyone on this point sure i can if they are hiding they dont want to pvp get this straight some people dont want to pvppvp should not be forced upon themif they are hiding from the war how can they be playing what are they doing while sitting in their station make market offers setting skill ques you want to pretend that this is enjoying the gamesurveyif you are a wardec company how many of your victims actually want to come out and fight youhow many enjoy the engagementdo you get ransoms from those who enjoy the engagementi say with full confidence that you will only get a ransom from a corp that does not enjoy the engagement and does not want to pvpif everyone enjoys the wardec system then why do ransoms existransoms only exist because many players do no want to pvp if they did want to then they would just fight you and not pay a ransom
either youre a complete choob or a troll but either way i dont want you in my eve also wardec incoming oh thats right youre in a noobcorp
to troll is to post something that might be believable and draw out emo raging responses to perpetuate the thread into an epic gotcha however an opposing view albeit somewhat gruff to your position is not a trolli posted a gentle flame please note the difference and then we might be able to have a discussion about why you feel based on anecdotal evidence the game mechanics should shift drastically to your point of view
well then by your definition to troll is to post something that might be believable and draw out emo raging responses to perpetuate the thread into an epic gotcha however an opposing view albeit somewhat gruff to your position is not a troll why then did you cal me a troll my post is only a viewpoint on game mechanics and not something to catch a gotchabut on the other hand you have yet to reply to any of my points or present a counter argument you seem to be on the troll unless you present a counter argumentplease since you are so much the wiser point out where i am wrong give the argument unless of course all you can do is flame and troll
pro tip if someone war decs you that you cant handle hire someone that canor make sure you have enough experienced pvp players in your corp to defend against such groups of peoplecorps that are simply full of noobs tend to be targets for this because they are defenseless no surprise there
too many wardecs happen on new industrialist corps and corps with few and newish players no real challenge in shooting a new player that spent their training towards the industrialist side of the gameand as for hiring a defending corpnot everyone buys isk through real money to have the few billions to hite others while having 3 months on their characterthe system needs a review in order to at least reduce the bashing and griefing of totally defenseless parties
highsec is noob space if youre big enough to get grieferdecced then you should leave noob space
this is true and i would add that regardless of whether you are defenseless or not you should have the choice to pvp or not that is the purpose of having high security spaceif i have plans for manufacturing or inventing or whatever i might not want to pvp at the time even if i am capable of defending myself i may choose to pvp at another time and if i do there are plenty of places to go look for it
i think the op might have the beginnings of an idea here i just cant support the proposed solutioni do think that many industrial highsec corps need more than 24 hrs to prepare for a war and that those who thrive the tears of carebears need some more red tape in the way for wardecs i just dont know how that would work but im open to ideas just not this one at this time
noyou do not get sanctuary in high sec high sec is safer not safethe war dec system needs to be reworked yes not neutered and this is what you are asking for flag pvp
personally i dont want sanctuary but i dont care to pvp really it has been nothing but loss and annoyance ever time i deal with a wardec it usually means i get to pay for a month or more but not playsince you have agreed that something needs to change and the author suggested something you dont like why dont you make a suggestion of how it could be made to work in your opinion otherwise what you have said is nearly uselessback to the opening post  as for myself i dont like this current proposal as it doesnt let the legitimate corps run wardecs as they should a boost in notice maybe closer to 48 hrs to war and a significant hike it wardec costs plus shifting it to be paid daily would be more appropriate in my opinion something more to the tune of approx 100 mill per day instead of 2 mill per week at that cost it is enough to make you not want to go crazy but it is not unreachable once again though this is the point of view of somebody who really doesnt care for pvp
it is an issuewhy are links longer on a larger planetplease explain how the size of a planet determines how close structures can be built to each other on that planetthe size of planet earth does not impose any distance limitations on how close i can build one house to another i can put them right up against each otherwhat about the moon is there any limitation to the distance that buildings could be constructed following your logic shouldnt they be closer on the moon since the moon is smaller than earthnothe size of the planet does not determine the distance between structuresthe only reason that structures appear to be further apart on a larger gas planet is because of the distance of one pixel therefore this is a graphics problem the size of the planet is expanded so that the structures can not be placed within one pixel of each other because of the size calculations of the planet this creates a longer distance of the links the links should not get a longer distance just because the structures cannot be placed closer than one pixelif the average distance of any other structure on any other planet is about 20km for the closest you can get then why should it be different on a gas planetthe only reason why you cant place a structure closer together is because of the distance of a pixel not because of the size of the planetall i propose is that changes be made to the calculations so that i can have links that are 20km apart just like on any other planet
the reason this happens is the pins sizes and thus the minimum distance apart you can place them are scaled directly tied to the size of the planet they becomes in essence larger as the size of the planet increases ccp needs to decouple that scaling so that the minimum distance between pins is independent of the planet size
exactly avoida
guys make your own threads in the ideas place please not in an assembly onealso bump
there should be a intensive refining array t2 or something that does not refine at 75  25 loss  but refines at the skill of the person who starts the refining processesallowing that person to skill up that ore to level 5  because level 4 is really all you need in high sec  and that could bring the refining  up to something like 90i am not asking for 100  just something better than 75 with something that uses your skillscheers
a cap usage bonus at medium platforms makes very little sense as a whole the cap usage amount is just not that big and is especially nonsignificant when you factor in cap boosters which are kind of mandatory anywayin case of prophecy the bonus allows you to shoot longer but whats the point in investing into this when your dps is that pathetic its like tanking a ship which does not do anything useful on the battlefield oh wait thats exactly the second prophecys bonus both of the bonuses of prophecy make the ship look like a heavilyarmoured extra durable infantrymans rifle which yet projects 1mm bulletswhats the point in having those attributes in a weapon which is a priori disposable prophecy is a cheap tech1 shipthe only purpose of cheap and disposable weaponry is to do damage thats it
ship of another player
why not  maybe its a good idea there is so much another good ideas on forum which i like but dont care too 
what if i want to test loot tables and chances but can not be bother to run to all regions of eve
maybe i was wrong in assuming everyone thought it was the mechanics that start decreasing the effectiveness of point and click masses that eve is missing judging by other peoples responses but if the realistic los and physics cant be implemented a stabilizing mechanic is needed usually aoe damage and nondamage both area and targeted mechanics fill this role but aoe in eve has either been too excessive see old dd or far too situational and limited bombs being limited to one class of ship and smartbombs are more aura effect nondamage suffers from the same area effect limitations lol ecm burst or actually lose overall effectiveness as fleet size increases not to the point of being useless but ecm in a small gang is radically different than ecm in a fleetand i really wish the forums let you review the thread as you replied i dont remember the other points i wanted to address and i dont feel like having multiple windows up to forum effectively
finn youre arguing with a group of people who honestly think ccp has a desire to stop large scale combat which is so patently false it isnt even funny their own cognitive dissonance prevents them from seeing that their view is in fact not one shared by the game developer or a very sizable if quiet part of the gaming population ccp wants small gang and large fleet warfare to effect sov that was the promise given in dominion granted it failed because anything done well with a small gang is done better with a large one they cant even realize that their classification of blobs is simply a group with more pilots than them if you want forced teams that are always even go play wow for christs sake wars in eve have always and will always be won by blobs get used to it
i think we should stop using blob to describe a larger force blob  more than node capacity anything else  superiour fleet sizeim still of the opinion large scale fleets can materialize in the absense of current standings and firmly believe that you dont need a multiregional conglomorate to experience great fleet pvp i wouldnt care to wager on developer opionion myself theyre going to work on whatever they deem worthy of their time and the playerscsm really dont have much to do with voice their opinions and hope some kernal of it reaches ccpat the end of the day theres going to be large naps small naps and alliances scattered here there and everywhere in between but the bogus opinion ccp is only interested in propping up this perpetualnodecrashing machine is pretty silly
5 years ago the server couldnt handle 200 people the servers are constantly being improved so the amount that breaks a node are higher and higher so your point allows for much larger fleets than you think it does and when they have the ability to dedicate several nodes to one system it will theoretically remove the cap of how many the system can handle
its an old eve whine and im surprised im not more used to it by now tbh we have a large number of allies and a highly motivated player base that wants to pvp so we form large fleet they blobthey bring fleets that are larger than strictly necessary and blob we just want good fights and cant help it that so many of our members rally to ctas we have ehonor and are interested in ensuring good fights are had by all although we fly the best ships we can instead of rifter swarms they have no ehonour and blob and they only care about winning at any cost then why remove them and again you changed the subject earlier when your proposal came up and never did explain exactly what you want 1 remove ability to set standings and you gut a significant portion of the core content of eve alliances can no longer determine who does and does not have docking rights in their stations and anybody launching an invasion can stage out of your own stations your poss cant be set to autofire on reds so they can simply camp out and gank people or you can set your pos to fire on everybody and then even people who you want to be able to sit there are at risk of being blasted to dust 2 standings still exist but the icons for bluered status no longer exist has absolutely not effect at all as anybody with two brain cells to rub together has an overview set up so that they never see blues unless they specifically need to seetarget them for some reason nobody here at all has said that you do nobody said that its been pointed out that largescale conflicts are part and parcel of eve and in fact a major selling point of the game itself its also been pointed out that you can hardly have largescale conflicts while somehow demanding that each side practice some sort of victorian degree of properness and restraint syx already pointed out exactly why caps dont work and youve gone on repeating that anyways it doesnt matter if the cap is hard or soft its totally unworkable and your focus on the attacker and not the defender likewise makes no sense if a system can take 1400 pilots before the system starts to see serious lag and the defenders bring 1399 pilots and they have absolutely no reason not to then a 2 man attacking fleet is a blob under your metric if the defending fleet doesnt bring as many pilots as they can and then they lose well they have mighty mighty ehonor and theyve also lost significant assets strategic position momentum and morale you can not buy ships with honor points to say nothing of the fact that node death is arbitrary and circumstantial as ive pointed out several times and youve ignored several times a system thats reinforced and sees combat right after downtime will perform a hell of a lot differently than a reinforced system that sees combat for 12 hours straight and has the gates littered with hundreds or thousands of abandonedlost drones and hundreds of wrecks and cashing a node is hardly the end of a fight nodes get taken down and put back up all the time then people just scurry to log in quickly and reform and there are many many stages of lag leading up to that point including but not limited to jump lag minor module lag moderate module lag major module lag crushing module lag systemwide desynchs etc etc etc server instability is simply part of eve  happens
so basically because nc can blob 5 times more than any other coalition by default they have won eve so really 00 is broken and all anyone needs todo is focus on spam naping in order to wingame overfact of the matter is this blobbing is the issue people want skill  numbers otherwise ccp should prevent sov from changing and make it permanent since no other coalition can be bothered to lower themselves to mass naping and people prefer to recruit skilled players over statsalso lets not forget that goons were so obsessed with bob mass naping in the past that together with the nc wanted to rid the game of this type of game play so whats stopping this happening again well because if nc dies another nap fest will replace ittalk about becoming what you hate againeither change the mechanics of fleet fights to favour skill  numbers or announce nc won due to more numbers and will eventually nap all of 00 because of this ccp speed up the process and just brand them sole owners of 00 aka new empire because pvp is something that needs to be avoided
deja vu all over again
youre ting up two threads now with the same jibberish but at least this one is actually about blobbing unfortunately youre just as incoherent and uneducated here as you are in the other thread that is completely unrelated to blobbing or fleet tactics at allthe problem with allowing small numbers of people to overpower large numbers is that if small numbers do well why not bring more with the same abilities as those few and overwhelm even moreoh look the cycle has begun againyou cannot stop people from working together
i am aware of that cycle which is why i stated already doing rock paper scissors wont work because the blob can just bring more of what the smaller force iswhich is also why i am not keen on new ships designed to counter blobs i am speaking of ways where blobs hold a risk without smaller groups sufferingif you think about it only lag poses a threat to blobs but since it also affects small gangs too it hardly is a blob counter
yah most people dont really mind the ability to focus fire and such they mind that their opponents can bring more people to focus fire which is just simply not faaaaaaaaaair of course strangely they dont go around offering 1v1 to all the targets they find as individual ships march out to the line of battle like ancient samurai accepting honordeulscuriouser and curiouser to be honest im really not sure thats the case nobody is forcing anybody to engage in the massivescale grudgematches that are many large conflicts instead of packing into a system to take an objective its still a somewhat after the nano nerf valid tactic to get together a small gang and go hunting and hitting the gtfo button once a force turns up that you cant gank i think thats the main point that some of the people who are upset are losing sight of if they cant manage to outfight a larger group either they need to adapt or failing that they need to find something else to do if i cant compete with an industrialist syndicate that regularly strips all the asteroid belts from entire constellations and has 100 people constantly running invention jobs with maxed out skills i can either find some way to compete doubtful accept that i cant compete but still do my best in my niche or find another niche or evidently i can demand that ccp eliminate corps abilities coordinate effort that seems pretty popular recently a fanatic is someone who cant change their mind and wont change the subject look you just spoiled a perfectly contentfree ragerant with elementary logic wtf is up with that of course this is the basic issue and why some people are left raging against human nature math the laws of reality what have you even if we get to the holy grail of perfect small gang combat and good drugs for everybody the first group to double their opponents numbers will stand a very good chance of mopping the floor with them looting the field taking fewer losses and being able to more easily afford more of those kinds of fleets which means theyll probably run more of those kinds of fleets which means that someone somewhere will realize that if they cant match that doublesized fleet on their own that if they team up with some other guys that the doublesizers were kicking in the shins then maybe they can fight with even numbers and hell if they can gather together a few more of the doublesizers enemies and get them to work together then theyve got a very good chance of stomping those dastardly doublers right into the ground except of course the doublers will be doing their best to try to find a tacticalstrategicnumerical edge too its funny that those who are demanding that skills should count more for numbers have evinced none of the skill required for them to outfight greater numbers and instead what they most often really mean is that ccp  people who can cooperate better than me and as always there is already a game with millions of subscribers that keeps instanced combat as scrupulously fair as possible and no guild can blob any other it even has elves
when you figure out a way to turn lead into gold you let us know kuntil then maybe stop ranting 
alchemy
which in eve is the reason my alliance now owns the most profitable region in the game i am down for more of this
so all this naping it truly is about protecting your oil
i really dont see the reason for arguing against people joining up trying to take away the ability for people to work together is attacking a symptom not a problem finn and ed are right in that if ccp intended to ever put a hard or soft limit on numbers they wouldnt be so focused on their one server ideal my harping on tactics and strategy is because its a self rectifying cycle you can still amass enough force to overcome a strategic advantage but as the force expands it becomes harder to manage if the fcs and wcs manage to employ the proper strategy with the larger force then of course they should win thats why i said the mechanics are necessary even if it allows the larger smarter force to be more effectivei dont know i just have an issue with fleet warfare seeming like 2 wraith and bc fleets coming head to head sure one might have 22 upgrades compared to the others 33 but in the end it comes down to numbers and who focus fires correctly

ive requested in the csm internal forums for dr eyjo and the rs crew to have a look at this thread
im so coming to hang out in the csmroundtablespahm channel its been a while since you had one of these and i endorse this product and service
not sure if weve ever had one of these o
ill be there as well
there have been csm members answering questions in premade channels for this purpose before maybe not with this level of involvement though
there were a few candidate roundtables organised by mynxee which a number of us took part in during the csm5 electionslooking forward to this one
im a bit confused about what the point of this isthe csm has approved what 200 proposals by now and yes that list includes things like a rebalance of field commands  why doesnt the nighthawk get more grid and another midslot and a higher base shield recharge to compensatei understand that you dont want cromo effectdouble dee showing up to ramble about their own hairbrained schemes but are we not to ask about particular proposals that have already been approved and gone nowhere if not whats the point and honestly even if we are whats the point of that hey remember that stuff that we have been asking for over the past two years we still want itplease provide some examples of questions that you think are appropriate because your example of a longstanding balance issue as something that is not to be discussed is totally baffling
i believe csm is more than csm5 onlymany hours of hard work has been done also by csm2 3  4howevercsm4 had no role at fanfest as fanfest 2010 was moved to 2011i will attend at fanfest anyways with or without csm badgecsm is a great team of various dedicated people and im glad i was able to be a part of iti would love to meet the whole teameditbtw will meet yall in december when csm5 will have their 3rd summitmaybe play some live poker oedit 2last fanfest pete mckay organised charity poker for childs play at fanfestmaybe we can have a csm pokerteam and a ccp pokerteam and an isd poker teameve players that join the tournament can try to knock out our teams and if they succeed ccp will add some bonusses for charity childs playim in for team csm and im sure alot of players would like to kick some csm ass extreme
if csm pokerteam loses then mazz and mynxee will have to strip
if there is a poker game i will crush all comers
yes but even with that it doesnt begin to compare to the cash you can make in complete safety in empire why the  move to 00 if empire is still more profitablethe sanctum changes will increase the amount of people a system can support by about double thats still less than half what they said systems would be able to supportedit i do not think sanctums are the answeryour post has literally nothing to do with what this thread is about from any angle read the op and respond accordingly or sit and spin you ty troll
sheesh i actually have to somewhat agree with the op well to a certain degree at least i would want to argue the point though that the system support aka theone pve element of dominion expansion needs to be the focus of change i think pretty much the vast majority of 00 inhabitants can agree that the major revamp dominion brought us didnt turn out exactly to be what we did hope for one way or another but should we really arguepush for some minor tweaks in the area of income per system onlyi do think that way we would simply risk ccp throwing us a small bone by say doubling the number of highgrade anomalies and try to sell this as a major fix considering theres so much more that needs to be adressed in 00 that would actually mean a negative effect coming thru knowing how it often runs having scored such a great success ccp would then prolly refrain from looking at nullsec issues for 18 months im not trying to say here the issue raised by the op is unimportant or negligible but it should be the major point of content that the whole postdominion situation is kind of found wanting not an itty bitty point here and there or to put a more controversialaggressive spin on it the whole postdominion situation is turning out to be unsatisfactory at best system support just being yet another symptom of the whole issue tldr  ccp needs to address the whole bag of problems dominion graciously dumped on us not just patching up a little hole here and there when the whole boat is sinking
as for the it guy above i agree with you i was more pointing out that ccp put this new sov system in then promptly forgot about like they do everything else despite constantly promising us its designed in sucha way that lets them improve it easilythey did it with numerous other things before in 5 years we may see a new sov system that sucks less with more reward but i doubt itoff topic quote removed zymurgist
theres a bit morewhats currently on tq is lacking other important and vital mechanics most importantly a way for holding corps to directly benefit from people killing npc in their spacethe system taxation array as an ihub upgrade is long overdue and the same goes for treatiesthe underlying problem is that nobody seems to care for 00 at ccp at this point the lack of balancing work support and game iteration is a very clear statement in that regardas for the players supported there is one problem if you just increase anomaly spawns there is no good way to tell if someone is occupying an anomaly you have on scan or not resulting in a lot of overhead since its impossible to coordinate even if everyone is in a fleet and on voicecomsimo agent missions are the vastly superior option due to their ability to scale well unless the scanning and fleet ui gets an overhaulwith that said i very much agree that moderately increasing havensanctum spawn rates would be a very good idea
well we do get this new incursion  now in 00 as well so im looking forward to yet another big screwup in the next expansion instead of some needed fixes shrug fits the current ccp agenda it seems drop new stuff on the players no matter if they asked for it and ignore what they are actually asking for at least if 00 is concernedjust wanted to add this to the topic because if you happen to do anomalies in one of those affected systems it can screw up the ccppromised ratios even more apart from all the other issues it might get you
actually you are wrongcsm concerns real life time dedication and effortits a job that consumes around 16 hours a week
yes please
pos supposed to mean player owned structure not piece of shi
i second this proposaleditone thing what about ability to use normal jump portal generators instead of just covert ops give them 99 reduction for fitting and we would have a mini titan for a 10th of a price and smaller jump range that comes with itthis would also justify the small fuel bay and other drawbacks that bos have although sin and panther would still have useless bonuses that need to be tweaked
general fix for them bos  increase fuel bay andor decrease fuel consumption of portal  increase base jump range or give a bonus for jump range or both  remove penalties for using cloak but not the ability of using cov ops cloak cloak velocity bonus should be replaced by said above jump range bonusspecific fixes  sins agility bonus is lol sins mass is lol sins agility is lol sins grid is yet again lol change those for something more usefull like a drone bonus or a hull repairing bonus since thats more useful than current bonus panthers speed bonus back in the nano age was good with the nano nerf not any longer change it for a tracking bonus or a falloff bonus or whatever
1 for unnerf the bo
reposted from sm15 reduction in fuel need for jump drive activation per level of bo10 reduction in fuel need for covert jump portal activation per level of bo20 increase to scan resolution per level of bo 20 reduction to cloaking device velocity penalty per level of bo 10 increase to jump drive and covert jump portal range per level of bo role bonus  no targeting delay after uncloaking and 25 velocity bonus whilecloaking device is equipped  passive bonus special bonus  black ops insertion  black ops ships with an equipped covert cynogenerator can lock onto a system star rather than on to a cyno field  covert jumpportal generator cannot be equipped for this ability to be active  this is a passiveability enabled by the equipping of a covert cyno  but in turn disabled by theequipping of a covert portal generator
no edit see below okay if items are tradable and destroyableand by the way some people seem to forget that we already have some cosmetic microtransactions for years changing the portrait 10 and moving character to another account 20you might also count plex as microtransactions since you can use the isk to buy a ship you couldnt have otherwise for example due to lack of time for playingfarming iskthe main difference  and the reason why plex are a good thing but microtransactions like 10 for that hat are badwith plex the value gametime stays in game and can be used by another playermost bought items ships are produced by players not seeded by ccp indefinatelyanother thoughtif microtransacted items are allowed to be tradedcontracted this would result in some interesting thingsif the items are destroyable it would create a constant demand for those items similar to plexthe iskprice of those items would be tied to and will most likely also influence the exchange rate of plex   iskconsequently the relative iskprices for those items will be set in stone by ccp and wont allow normal supplydemand market dynamicsexample if fancy hat costs 10 and fancy dress costs 50 fancy dress will always cost 5x the isk as fancy hathm thinkin about it like that i have to elaborate on my original answerif microtransacted items are both tradable and destroyable like plex it might be acceptablethis would just make the evecommunity as a whole read the people okay with spending money for items or isk pay a bit more for eve in general without creating an unfair advantage for people with more moneythis is what we basically already have with plex
i am very much in favor of adding micro transactions for cosmetic purposes i would like ccp to make more money from people who wish for whatever reason to change how they or their ships look it will be more money for ccp and no cost to how the game is played it will indeed be cooler to see many different ships etc neural remap i agree thats not cosmetic but its not so bad mainly im glad you can get these items through plex and therefore through isk i hope they keep as many of these microtransactions through plex as possible that way it at least has some bearing on the eve economy allowing people to make micro transaction through plex as opposed to being forced to pay directly is something we as players should strive for that way players who want to acquire this stuff with isk can do that for example if you buy a plex it may allow you to buy 3 sets of clothes and 1 redo of your face credit with a plastic surgeon or 1 gender change or bloodline change etc one plex may also allow you to reskin 60 ships or something or you can make different bundles for each plex if you fly many different fits of the same ship having different skins for each ship fit may actually have some practical use
no
yes take your time and make eve better i dont want shiny new tools i like eve and want play the game as it was promised and everyone expectedno new expansions anymore until the game works bug free as everyone expect itmake better whats there
the bizarre thing is that if the ship being repaired shoots a neutral or a stargate concord will kill the remote repper ship too so the aggression consequence chain is already there and recognized by npcs seems like it would be easy to apply that to gates and stations
ask him if i can have his stuff btw bump for my thread
supported
not supportedthis is the only reprieve from a failing war dec system that needs an overhaulwar decs are out of hand and need to be changedthe cost of war dec is too little it is too easy to declare war against anybody for any reason and most of the time the reason is to extort ransomthe neutralalt remote repping is the last line of defense against griefers you can not change this without changing the wardec system and putting more restrictions on declaring warotherwise just line everyone up in a row like ducks and start picking them off i mean really how patheticly easy do you want it you dont want pvp all you want are easy targets and easy money through ransomssuggested fix 1 stop pvping in empire2 stop playing station gamesstation games are nothing more than a dps raceunless you have a remote repper bring a rr into the picture and you actually have to think about tactics and come up with methods to counter the counter attack without the neutral rr the agressors the wardec griefers will always win i assume thats what you want anyway easy victimsstrongly not supported the wardec system needs to be fixed
some statistic facts from top20
i think megathron is that high becuase of tracking bonus  which somehow fix blaters by its own
as a preoperative transsexual im not sure whether to be shocked insulted or amusednotsureifwantjpgehh whats the worst that could happenoooh bad move bro
support because this is hilarious i would love to see csm voting on this and to see who would vote yes
agree
i support the trial account removel only
just as the tiltle says ffs its by far the ugliest looking ship in eveccp you did an hell of a job with the scorp do the same with the moa please dont change it throw away the current model burn every backup of it and start from scratchi know its not high on the priority of things but put it on your when theres time todo listedit it seems that the moa has some competition on the ugliness contest so im changing the title and proposal
love that sexy moa hull1 for the metal asymetrical giraffe
i was always under the impression that caldari ships are supposed to be ugly as sin with their dedication to efficiency and nononsense and what notthen again if it were up to me i would change it so i support this
moa is one of my favourite hullspleaaaase dont touch it
its a hell of a job not an hell of a jobthatll be 50m for the grammar policethe moa is ugly but atleast its finished unlike the aeon which is 75 built but the moa could still use a new model it is pretty bad
moa hull is easily the ugliest ship hull in the game
currently why would anyone fly it its ugly and hybrids suckif they make it pretty some people would fly it because hybrids still suckafter they fix hybrids i will fly it because hybrids will not suck and it will look sexy
yes the moa is ugly i can barely move myself to pilot one the model doesnt seem to follow any sense of logic
there is a difference between building a ship with a utilitarianistic point of view and building a ship to make the design intentionally appear as an afterthought there is no efficiency in a ship when all its parts are separated in random directions and seem to hang out in their own area in real life it would also make a ship incredibly hard to repair as the entire ship is made up of random unique pieces made to cater simply to the chaotic design of that particular shipalso i hate the moa hull
yes please and all the other goofy ships
it looks unique and any look topics are lost from the beginning since youre not a space ship designer living thousands of years from nowbeside this game has a milion more important problems than designing new models no ones going to look on 90 of the time anyway
i dont need to be a physicist to see that some eve ships will fly in circlesi dont need to be an engineer or an accountant to point out how much wasted space and materials there are with some eve shipsi dont need to be a military expert to point out the awful combat profile of some eve shipsi dont need to be a rocket scientist to say the moa and many other eve ships look bad

updated and fixed some gramatical errorsthis proposal was written to cover the eventuallity of a new microtransactional payment system being introduced to eve online currently it seems ccp is ignoring the outcry and votes regarding mts and they will introduce them whether the playerbase likes it or notthis proposal is not for microtransactions but meant as a guideline for ccp to follow so that they dont break the game anymore than they already will by introducing them to the gamethe proposalthat microtransactional items can only be purchased with plex or if necessary a more granular currency that is sourced from plex exclusivelythat all items purchasable using microtransactions be destructablethat all items purchasable using microtransactions be vanity onlythat ccp defines and publishes a set of descriptions and rules as to what can be or will be purchasable via microtransactions prior to this payment systems inclusion ingame and that ccp strictly adheres to these rules as closely as is possible for ever morethat the csm must be notified before any new microtransaction or microtransactional mechanic is introduced to the game to avoid any more marketing nightmares and oh we didnt expect thatbefore any microtransactional item or microtransactional mechanic is introduced on the test and live server ccp releases the details and reasoning via the csm to the playerbase to gather comments and suggestions before its releasethat ccp actively monitors the effects of microtransactions on the cost of plex and the market and acts accordinly to ensure there are no adverse effects using all resources at their disposalmicrotransactional items or the microtransactional currency can only be purchased with plex exclusivelyall mictrotransactions can be bought using plex or if necessary a more granular currency that can also only be purchased with plex ie if a hat could cost 12 a plex you wouldnt have to waste a whole plex to buy itmicrotransactional purchases are destructableif someone buys something via microtransactions then that item must be able to be destroyed by other playersmicrotransactional purchases are vanity onlyitems directly purchased via microtransactions have no effect ingame other than looking coolie you can buy a pink hat buy a new paint job for your ship from a colour palette specific to its race account services etcdefined rules for items than can be purchased via microtransactionsccp defines and publishes a set of rules and descriptions for what items and the types of items that can be purchased via microtransactions and they will follow these rules as closely as is possible changes to this definition should be published before it is rewrittenccp notifies the csm before the introduction of any new microtransactions or microtransactional mechanicccp will inform the csm before they introduce anything new to do with microtransactions and use them as a preliminary sounding board before this information is released to the playerbasepublish the intent to introduce new microtransactions and microtransactional mechanics to the playerbaseccp will publish details and reasoning behind new microtransactions and mechanics relevant to them to the csm to be passed onto the playerbase to get feedback and suggestions before they are implimented and releasedwhile i would not expect ccp to follow every item on here i believe that these few guidelines would help keep the playerbase happy and curb much of the fear surrounding this issue microtransactions are coming whether we want them or not and we need to make sure that they do not unduly break the game or our communitycerbus
while i doubt the feasability of the full slist i like the spirit of it supported
once it goes in the flood gats will open ccp has a very very poor recrod of sticking to their word especially when more revenue is concerned  so i think its better to try to stop the whole thing and if that fails then we know that any process of concession is also doomed
ccp has already indirectly announced that microtransactions will be introduced through interviews on external websites and to the csm during the october summit while theyve yet to confirm which microtransactions theyll introduce you can now use plex to pay for some services new portrait and character transfers although i doubt there is anyone that will complain about these as they have no real effect ingame except for the power of 2 which is available to everyone anyway the eurogamer article inparticular is an interesting read see page 3 specificallyfor some reason i do not think ccp will find the results of the crowdsources and other assembly threads to be relevant and the gates opening is inevitabletd
we will evolve just like everyone else we will certainly not become a dinosaur that has not been our stylethis quote made me laugh following the pack and doing what everyone else is doing may be good if you bruisness model is to maximize profit over teh course of a few years but what has made eve such a great game is because they have historically defined the terms of evolution this is a sad quote really conformistand the devotd loyal player base is exactly what is being thrown out with the bathwater here i speak from expereince having seen a huge number of oldtimers leave over this mt stuff bad bugs and poor patches are one thing mts are another
im not sure all your bullet points are realistic however supported in the spirit of ccp actually having a public policy with regard to mt in eveand to announce updates to that policy when it changes when asked about details related to destructibility tradability etc for vanity items ccp indicated such decisions hadnt been made i find it difficult to understand why they would go forward with such a controversial thing before ironing out the details so that they can communicate clearly with players about it and so that the community can understand the full impact of such things on the gamewith regard to plex only for mt items that doesnt offer any granularityit will force everything to be packaged in bundles valued at approximately one plex in the world of vanity items in particular this seems a bit inflexible and will force people to buy a bundle of items potentially consisting of 99 stuff they dont want just to get that one item they do want
it should imply that any new granular mt currency would be sourced solely from plex to ensure that it can be also purchased with isk via plex aswell as plex via real money i will reword it to suitcerbus
microtransactionsbye bye ccp
when you trade a plex you are trading 30 days game time and swapping for iskthis isk isnt generated from nowhere same as buying a character  someone has spent the time to train itswapping a plex for services can be ingame cost to out of game benefit and out of game cost to out of game benefit but it doesnt effect ingame being able to purchase ingame items soley from rl money opens up the out of game cost to ingame benefit which is where things get dodgey if these microtransactions use plex then its pretty much the same thing that happens now as long as these items are destroyable andor vanity only if they use another currency to make sure that the plex market isnt unduly effected then this leads to the darksidei havent yet seen ccp mention if these microtransactions would use plex or not although its probably a sure thing but i hope to gods if they do turn to the dark side that its paved with plex and not cashthe biggest problem other than that is that ccp says this is only a testcoughsure it isdidnt you just get a massive million dollar cash injection from your shareholders investers is this the reason for the double dippinghmmwtf ccp
you are right the isk is not generated from nowhere it is generated from rlmoney instead of using that isk to buy things in the ingame economy and keeping the economic system closed to the outside world every economic transaction ingame now does not have a solely internal economic mechanism to explain it but can be influenced by th real economey outside in effect all the economic analysis in eve is completly broken because of this spacific data is usable but is also corrupt it would be the same if we tried to measure todays economy but also include some kind of religious metaphysical currency into the mix  ie the reason you are rich is because god loves you and rewards you with money so love is now a second curency and invisible currency that can be used to get real money with character transfers the problem is different because charactrs are a product of the game  klike ships or mods the end remains the same though real life money is converted into isk and spent ingame to purchase ships mods andor more characters characters in this case is just a productbasically with the way plex works right now eve is not a sandbox and the addition of more ways to use plex will continue to degrade that to the point it becomes a mere marketing scheme should the plex market be taken out and characer bazzar terminated then the game will return to being a true sandbox again it was oncethe debate on what is and what is not spacifically a mt is academic the effect it has in the game is very much evident in the requests people make in th suggestions forums and the culture that has emerged in the past year of people taking for granted the isk to dollar ratio and profiting ingame off of it i cannot see the difference between rmt and plex other then who makes the money and how accountable and controled that process is  but the end result is the same money buys isk
alright i was talking to one of my out of corp buddys lately and he mentioned a problem he was having he currently flys in a small section of low sec  no names  and regularly must transport large quantities of what ever to that system how ever roaming gangs have been a problem even when flying a hard hitting escort fleet most gangs auto lock the indysoccasional freighters  pop them and then try an get the cargo  all while the escort trys to defend and while they usually obliterate most of the attackers the indys usually suffer ship loses and no bsbc can hold that much cargoto this end i suggest a new moduleflying techniquein any space movie bigger combat ships generally defend smaller ships by shooting fast and actually getting in between the attacker and the target acting as a physical shield due to the current setup of the eve game engine i doubt that that can be effectively done so i suggest 2 optionsoption 1 skilled based ability  you select a right click option to defend and as long as you stay with in 35k of a ship you take 20  skill level of any damage inflicted to that ship does not affect other ships that are defendingoption 2 new module  a special ecm style device that projects a bubble 35 k wide any ship inside this bubble cant be targeted with the exception of the host ship  but at the same time cant target anything itself ships may elect to not receive this bonus through a right click menu option
lol  mobile rr safespoti do agree tanking is something that would be interesting along the lines of your option 1 but as a module mostly because eve seems slow to adopt the tank  dps  heal mechanic partly due to tankingnot existing and logistics being a bit straightforward and needing more spso sure 1 to the spirit of this thread if not the specifics
option 2 would be best anyone within the 35k skill dependent bubble would be unable to be targeted the ships inside the bubble will be able to lock the ships outside but only the ship that is powering the bubble can be targeted from outside once inside the bubble everything is fair game the ship would be a t2 ship cruiser sized hull any ship within the bubble will be unable to receive rr support from inside or outside the bubblethis would not be over powered because the ship with the bubble would be able to be killed quite easily when the bubble is up the bubble would also make it impossible for any of the ships inside of it to be repped making any logistics ships in the bubble trappedor you might have to install a special form of eccm on your ship to be able to target outside of the bubble while it is up
manual flight controlorbit the shipsor other closer and faster  or farther and slower all goodplease give us a reticle and manual flight control option let us seperate the real skilled pilots from the rest out thereallegiancegame from microsoft very old one in fact does well with thissorry about that just figured it would be an easy comparison
the cost to the server would not be worth it could you imagine the lag it would cause if the server had to follow every direction change of every pilot in system not supported
unfortunately eve is not set up to be a flight simulator theres too much happening on the servers as it is to add the extra overhead of accounting for what could be second by second changes in direction from all the pilots in the systemadding this kind of support would basically require them to rearchitect the game completely not supported
1 install freespace 2 install freespace 2 3 4 profit
eve cant possibly handle all the calls that would be necessary for suchas an alternative buy a vaga and learn to manual fly using that a la lern2tranversal
lolallegiance was a great game though
this would be such a nightmare no
lol  not the least bit threatened  first before you want a major overhaul of the war dec system  1 show the masses you have a grasp of whats going on and whats going wrong  i posted a few questions to help you get that across but was met with  reported  lol  please leave  right now youre another hey this game is great  im gonna play it for the rest of my life  but this is what you need to change  to make it that much better for everyone  trial pass player2 post with your main  if youre so confident and back you words  why be scared of repercussions  if not  youre no better that every other trolling alt out there youre trying to gain support  credibility helps this subject has come up every few months for the last 5 years  trust me  no body knows how borked the war dec system is better than i do  but  ccp has shown its not a priority of theirs  so save your breath anyways  good luck in your crusade 
supported wars cost corporations isk and profitable corporations are more useful to concord than nonprofitable ones
well pitboss i can understand his fear too many wardecs have been started by people against other players they couldnt create a constructive argument against on the forums its both petty and amusing considering that this thread is mostly about putting cap on that kind of bs however pitboss is also correct this is an important argument and to fight it you need proper credibility posting about it from an alt is kinda like throwing stone with notes tied to them through your opponents window and expecting them to think you are more than just a mad man
and the second i do my corporation gets wardeced no thanks i rather just deal with people like pittboss than to cost my entire corporation a months work of annoyancetowards the general idea of why ccp doesnt have an interestwhy not what is more important than adjusting not changing code to match the growing isk inflation within the game i understand that ccp is busy with other things but even so there are many items in this game that are halfdone or completely and utterly broken yes the game runs decently with minimal bugs which is what to be expected to play a game without major worries but when it comes to changing code than piling more half baked code ontop of each other bad things are going to happen yes wardec prices are not on the priority list but why is dust 514 more important than fixing the tremendous amount of lag for fleet battles or the amount of minute bugschanges that still need to be fixed like adding probes to overvieworiginally impossible due to legacy code removing the cost for suicide gankers removing the insurance for selfdestructing and many more the only change was the pnerf some time ago to the wardec system which forced alliances to stop instadecdestroying corporations without it costing them an arm and a leg and a few kidneys considering the fact its easier to wardec multiple corporations at once to keep the stove burning even so the relative cost is still cheap compared to the amount of people in said alliance nevertheless this did not stop the cheapness towards corporation on corporation wardec pricesmaximum wardec pricesb  n 1  w  1  2 million  3  1  3  1  18 million per week which is still cheap maxed out on both endsi claim bs if fixing garbage code is least important than adding more modules to the system i know that adding more code to something that doesnt work at 99100 is going to cause major problems later major problems i understand that fixing wardec prices is not a priority but why can it not be considered past face value
provoke is also a relative term here because theres no universal right or wrong in eve its all in how players dispense their justice to him u killing him was aggression no matter how justified your reason was but dont get me wrongim not saying u shouldnt have done it but when u already have a corp formed and he tries to tear it apart theres a simple solutionmove to an npc corp u dont have to say goodbye to your corpmates cause thats what public channels r for i still use them after i left minethen the target corp shouldve already known what to do when war decced because of experienced leadership durhcommon sense maybe if the aggressed no longer have the option to pull out of the war but they do so it works just fine
and that is exactly what you will get if the wardec system is not fixed is it the policy of ccp to discourage player owned corps or do they desire player owned companieswhat is the point of making goals and trying to build up a company if some yayhoo can come along and harass that company until it pays a ransom why would anyone want to play as an industrialist why would anyone want to play as some form of harvesteryou will end up with nothing but the pvpers left all your easy targets will leave the game for some other gamewhat sort of game will you have then how much business will ccp lose because of itthe wardec system is used for nothing but ransoms it needs to be fixed
not supported the war dec mechanic does need a looking at but this is a bad ideathe only reason people get decd in the first place is1 they ed someone off2 they look like a juicy target be this isk tears or both related3 someone has been hired for the dec linked to point 1the whole it being used as a grief engine welcome to eve online you get a 24 hour warning telling you that someone doesnt like you and if you dont heed the warning and run around in your 10 billion isk ship then you only have yourself to blamefrom what i have seen most corps with newbies in will have a few vets and you see posts in cp from time to time the newbies who are suited to this game asking what they should do and players always give them the usual advice of flying cheap use alts etc
signed id base it off of how many people are in corpalliance and how many corps are in alliance though
its way too small personally maybe its a small complaint but imo it could be largerlook at the size of the aggression timer its much larger and in colorthanks image of the current session timer 
oh visual size i was thinking you wanted to toy with the duration id personally like to see a countdown instead of a spinning circle but making it larger is a good step
to be totally honest i always wondered why something so innocuous and yet so critical is so tiny also it could really do with perhaps appearing in multiple locations and as mentioned with different display options i myself like the spinning but others want numbersviva la ui improvements
yeah i didnt even know what that was until you pointed it out i thought it was my computer loading graphics
supported kinda hard to see with all the other icons maybe not a displayed timer but at least in color and distinguishable
ayup
yes it should also show the countdown without having to hover over it for those ocd people who need to switch ships in the first possible momennt
thisi suppose local was designed to be a social tool but as it stands today its nothing more than a brainless friendfoe assessement toolediting here to also state that local denies all cloacked operations of their role maybe you cannot see them but you know they are there
indeed it would have to be an option that could be enableddisabled at will and then youd need to put a system in place to ensure that there are no free loaders
id love to see this implemented at the corp level vs the alliance level this would be a big thing for pos keepers
awesome antiblob feature
in general i like this ideai would tend to think the system would be more ping based like sonarbut i love the idea of giving the destroyer another role besides salvager
good idea its gonna take some work to sort out but i hope to see it implimented
i got an idea how about give the dessies a modual that can find the sb on the dscan like janos said when active and sucking cap but they will have to use it to pinpoint their distance and location in space and once they get their range and degrees on dscan down to 5 they can fire this decloaking thingy that takes like a charge and some time to charge up before firing and 50 of the dessies cap and give the modual a long cooldown the shot will creat a decloaking zone at the distance and degrees on the dscan decloaking the ship that may be there for lets say 30 seconds maby also make it have a minimal range off grid so it is stuck to having to use the dscan range thing to bump the sbthe effect can be seen on the system map so probers can quickly probe out the cloakie ship and jump it but a smart cloakie ship will just warp away thoughsee it as some kind of depth charge though jumping between safe spots or staying off the dessies dscan would be the best way to avoid itpson second thought this may be a bit usless or op depending on how it would be introduced
after spending months training for mining and mining upgrades and a buddys toon spending the same amount of time for missioning it is very apparent that i took the wrong path in the same amount of time he can make more than double the amount of isk missioning level 4 missionsi understand that macro miners are screwing the market for minerals but there must be a solution so that someone running missions and someone mining in make close to equivalent isk for me i think i am gonna park my hulk and start the missioning routea possible solution reduce the amount of ore that is in high sec roid fields significantly making it so that a hulk can mine it out in a couple of hours  this forces real miners to move around and would discourage macro mining thus increasing the price or ore and in turn all products on the marketthats my 2 cents any comments
answer sansha incursions killing the macro miners
i couldnt agree with you moremining ark in a wh while someone does a sleeper site still brings in 15th the amount of isk value they doccp has clearly shown they do not want to  or cannot do anything about macromining1 hour of minining should bring in the same amount of isk vs 1 our of missioningi dont understand why they skew the bountys on missions so high  but leave the ore return so lowskilling up in mining is a complete waste of time in my opinion as well
lets seeas a miner1 do u need to train guns or missiles so u can actually shoot something else thats not a rock2 do u need to heavily train shieldarmor skills3 do u need to train for capacitor recharge so your tank doesnt cap out4 do u need to train for weapon upgrades regular and advanced as well as electronics and engineering to even be able to fit your ship to handle a lvl 45 do u need to train the social skilltree for better agents payouts and standings that actually gets u lvl 4 access in the first placedidnt think so and thats not factoring in training battleships or hacs hell try training for a marauder or t3its a lot more expensive to lose than that hulk then ull have something to really cry aboutps your solution wont even discourage a macro miner at all when they just move to different belts
annalets look at the time it takes to skill up vs all the skills you mentionedpar for par hour for hour  weeks for weeks in 1 month  3 months  5 months i can guarantee you the time trained for skilling up a miner vs a pve mission runner  the mission runner is always aheadi do not agree with your postmy hour of play should be the same value as your hour of play
1 then calculate the whole thing if ure so sure or should we just all safely assume ure talking out your ass2 furthermore why should your profession be just as profitable when its so easy to the point where it can be macrod so u can afk the whole time bet u didnt know that huh 3 u dont agree fine u wanna be lazy like everyone else fine deal with everyone else lazing it up and flooding the market with tons of cheap ore and minerals
annai do not disagree with what you are saying  thus parking my hulk and training all of the skills you mention above it will allow me to get not only isk but lp and standings for my time it will also allow me to get implants federation ships etc for myself with the lp as opposed to buying them from market the rewards of mission runners go way beyond miners and the risk of losing your ship is pretty low not very many missions have warp scram ships and when they do your drones make quick salvage of the frigs that have them not only that everyone can check out what the mission is about and how to go about killing everything online before they even start the mission the non existent ai that enemy ships have and the consistency of resistance makes a mission runner just as mindless a task as a minera mission runners skills will also take them to other aspects of the game  low sec null sec wh space miners require mission runners  pvpers  with them to do any of that
thats the reward of active play and more skillpoints spent to access lvl 4s see how that works1 it still takes time to train t2 drones to swat down the smaller ships try using t1 drones and see how long it takes to kill an elite frigate either case its still more risk to face lvl 4 rats altogether than frigate belt rats that never warp jam2 the fact still remainsu cant afk in a mission without missing rat kills afk for 23 hours with macro mining u dont miss anything at all but im glad u totally ignored the skilltraining comparison mentionedit further proves my point1 yes u need combat pilot skillsets to mission because active combat should be rewarding not automating a program to shoot inanimate rocks which dont shoot back while u do something else2 u cant turn the same char into a low sec pirate unless u plan to mission in low sec and if u think low sec missioning is so glamorous try it the pirates there will thank u for it 3 unless ure stupid u dont need a blob escort to babysit u even as a miner because no one with a brain requires anyone else to go anywhere safely in your case though maybe u would need one
lol you seem angry and aggressive to a simple topic like this fact of the matter is if every miner out there does what i am gonna do you will not be able to buy your fancy mission ship cause there will not be anyone mining the minerals to build itmining is a necessary evil in the game  hopefully the removal of macro miners will help solve the problem
annei will try to prove my point without calling you an assstupid or any other childish name calling as you have done i will try to keep this forum have a little respect between its members and its dialogi simply stated that everyones time is equallets start brand new toons if you ar able to skill up gunnery for 1 month and i am able to skill up mining for 1 month  the return on investment roi should be closeits not remotly closeyou state you need to activly be there to missionim pretty sure you could go to a mission and tank a mission for quite a while without firing 1 shot and without losing your ship just as a miner can click on a roid and walk awayyou need to activly lock on to new targets  roids run out and need to be activly relockedore needs to be moved to a can or somewhere as wellyour point of using a macro is void in this conversation as macros are against ccp policy and against the eulaso wether you go pew pew some rats or pew pew some ore  the return is not equalnot even with t2 crystalshave a smurfy day
high sec is noob space if youre still there after playing eve for months and youre not a war deccer or market trader then youre doing it wrongnullsec has much more valuable ore and youll rarely die if youre smart join a corp that holds nullsec space and youll make a lot more iskalso eve isnt about making money thats what reallife jobs are for eve is a game do what you think is fun in it
slimythe comparison started for us when in a c2 wh comparing the ark vs a 100 anom sleeper sitei have not ventured into null sec yet testing the waters in a wh i only wish i skilled up in pve first and then mining cheers
im merely pointing out the obvious something that even u r mentally unable to even understand fortunately fact of the matter is ure not everyonesry to burst your bubble therefore there will always be miners despite what u wish in your fantasy land remove the macros first then talk about profitabilityrespect is earned not given apparently ure used to having things your way all the time without even tryingthinking but too bad its not the case here so based on your posting whats more appropriate for u troll carebear ignorant stupid or all of the aboveits not remotely close because it takes more than gunnery training to do a lvl 4 not that ud know anything about this1 tanking mission rats does not make u isk2 oh nou have to relock on a new roid cause it finally ran out in 1530 min when u couldve survey scanned it beforehand poor u cant imagine the stress ud be under having to relock ships every minute or less 3 so go train gunnery to replace the strip miners go into a lvl 4 with your hulk and tank all the rats and kill them too if u think its as effortless as u make it out to beand your babbling of rules is simply babbling because rules r meaningless if theyre not enforcedrefer to the rest of my posts for once next
time to fly a drake with this fit
then by all means go for it that way u wont have to worry about finding something else to do while shooting rocks
it would be nice to be able to show our planetary installations in a separate window to allow for monitoring andor tuning the installations during those long freighter hauls without losing track of the surroundings and my route
you can still see your overview theres no problem here
well i first ran into this when i was flying through space and switched my wallet division in my corp to transfer isk from that division all of a sudden i couldnt jump through the gate because i had session change from changing the wallet division ok i can understand cession change for changing ships in a hanger or docking and undocking as it takes time for your pod to move between ships but seriously why is there a need for session change timers on corp wallets
its session not cession
oh right spell checker lied to me whoops wrong char

very recently in a dev blog some things about the incursions were outlined as followsccp has always prided itself on being a sandbox game where people can choose their own destiny and create goals and act toward them now before going further i will admit i liked the idea of this expansionin theory but now not so much it is one thing to give people tools and opportunities to get them to work together because they share common goals but it is an entirely different thing to force a situation where they must work together to accomplish something that they care little about before they can continue on it chips away at the sandbox and lets sand out we need more sand not less and this seems like an instance ccp is letting sand out i dont think there is any pvp corpalliance out there that is going to be fighting and when an incursion happens theyll ask for a cease fire so they and the enemy can go kill it before resuming their battle it just doesnt workas to the penalties themselves from an ingame role play perspective they dont even really make sense a reduction in your shieldarmor resists ok did the sansha tow some sort of tcu with them that somehow gimps our ships perhaps they went to wormhole space and brought back with them a pulsar or something if this penalty occurs it needs a logical story reason behind it and i have not seen one yetreduction of weapon damage i can almost see this one being okif it was restricted to the incursion site maybe the sansha could just have uber resists and this would work out to where you would feel you are doing less damage but like the above since it affects a whole system there needs to be reason behind it and again this feels like you are letting sand out of the box and forcing a situationcyno jamming now this one i can actually see happening since the sansha are capable of opening wormholes on their own it is not too much of a stretch that their wormholes create intense spatial distortions in that system that might throw off the cyno signals for large ships covert cynos are fine because they only allow select ships to use them so i figure they work on a very tight frequency below what normal cynos work on npc bounty reduction again this seems forced and aimed at mission runners specifically though the argument could be made that the first 2 effects are also this as well do player ships somehow lose their signal to concord does concord say fu there is an incursion that is more important again what is the reason behind such a changeso what could be done how about this set of penalties instead
could this be the end to botting lets hope so
how about we try it out before whining and saying it sucks i actually think its a good ideaalso if you think about reduced resistances and reduced damage this would mean that shipsstructures with normally a lot of hp and low resists would gain some usefulness in this situation since hp is not reduced augoror navy issue anyone loljkalso since both sides of a battle are affected by this the battle will go on like normal except in the case of shipsstructures with a lot of hp and low resistsand yes im sure concord does say fu there is an incursion that is more important since were fighting for the freedom of the galaxy not just some puny one shot mission if you dont like it then of course you can blow up the sanshas and get rewards from concord for that or go do your level 4s in a different system for a while
yeah ive tried using the slider but its not very specific or precise on how it works i mean theres no specific way to avoid 10 systems but not avoid 09 systems etc
at first i thought this was going to be an autopilot warp to 0 post but its not supported
let us set the sec status we wat to travel in yes
i had my standings screwed with gallente for a while i hated having to check each systems sov before hitting the switch
support those downtrodden by the empiresor who have midrange offensive security status
the faction police dont do that much damage still supported
they can if you let them build up i tested it in a rifter once i was 80 km away from the nearest faction police mwd orbiting them and they basically instapopped my rifter that being said you still can get by them in a nano ship if they arent already on the gate
i would like to be able to change my ap settings without going to the map

id like to keep it like afterburners so it would off line the moment you enter warp so youd have to enable it again out of warp it would allow you to enter warp faster as it would let you align faster youd still have to get up to speed and it costs a mid slot for the purpose of warping it only seems worth it for industrials and any ship doing couriereven in the case of using it for warp it would be the same as using inertial stabilizers faster not instant using both together would be interesting though that may be near instant for something that already was entering warp quick frigate sized ships mainly maybe make it disabled by webbers or something if you fill your lows with inertial stabs and you have both an afterburner and a thruster theres not much left in the way of defense or offensewhat manual control what is this i dont eventhat is really over complicating such a simple module its no more than an active version of inertial stabilizers that means you can turn faster thats all it means after talking with some people in game about it i am start to lean more with letting it be activated with afterburners otherwise itd only ever be used for warping i still stand by there needing to be some sort of penalty if that is the case or maybe add it as a role bonus on ships that would benefit from it so interceptors or something would get role bonus able to use afterburner and maneuvering thrusters at the same time so it needs a penalty to use both andor a role bonus to use bothanother option id go for is keep the penalty from inertial stabilizers when using both an afterburner and maneuvering thruster using it alone no penalty using it with an afterburnermwd 20 increased signature radius what it seems to me that this would amount to is being able to orbit something closer without losing speed
so basically an active mod that makes you align quicker i suppose it would be useful on ships with atrocious align times i believe titan pilots like to have a 100mn mwd for use to make them align quicker correct me if im wrong in that case so this could be useful on pretty much all capital ships an orca and haulers so you could save your low slots for cargo expanders while being able to boost your align time im not sure what the drawbacks should be but im thinking a sig radius boost like istabs so that you dont become invincible to gatecamps
correct me if im wrong but most ships sub cap barring orcas and freigters have relatively good align times ccp made changes so that the align isnt what takes the most time its the compensation for inertia that takes a while and if this is an auto version that counters inertia drift then be prepared for the barrage of minmatar ships that use it to get their traversal up to a rediculous amountit would unbalance the game for sure sbs would be relatively uncatchable with a new faster align time as would inerceptors the only way you could restrict it would be putting a biiig cpu penalty on it but then ud have to augment all bc ships and above to have bonuses in cpu reductions to that specific module a lot of work for ccp for suuch little differenceconvenience
correct me if im wrong but then they would already be able to do that by just using inertia stabilizers or low friction nozzle joints which have the same effect as the suggested module
afaik yes which kinda makes this module null and void except id guess the op is suggesting an active version of an inertial stabalizer that has a massive negative inertia multiplyer waay above and beyone the 20 u get from a passive inertial stab iii guess a multiplyer of 50 to inertia when active which is kind of insane even with a stacking penalty p
its a good bit yes but also its an active module which means it uses capacitor and a mid slot that means having something else turned off ie your warp scrambler webber afterburner etc that also means having 1 less module such as a shield booster extender invuln field etc toss on an afterburner and with the proposed penalty for doing that youd be easier to hit as well i also said it should be equal to about 2 inertia stabilizersand yes it actually says that it is basically an active version of inertia stabilizers did you even read the original posti dont believe it should have a stacking penalty with inertia stabilizers if you want to sacrifice all your slots to aligning fast then so be it youll have almost no offensivedefensive power and will be targeted quite quickly in most ships as a result so yeah no different than putting a ton of speed mods to run away yes you can run away easier but in the event you are caught and pinned down you die fast it doesnt come without a priceregardless as i said in the third reply made to this thread the actual balance of the module should be left up to ccp it would require extensive testing on the test server to see what the actual effects would be on the game and to choose a value that is high enough to be worth the cap cost and penalties but low enough to not be insane
should use as much power as an afterburner with the same cycle time as a mwd making it vulnerable to neuts
ill admit im not thrilled with the idea myself but i do see how this is an obvious business decision that doesnt ruin the game im supporting because they are allowing people to do this with plex and not just a direct money payment to ccp i find it unlikely that i will use this feature myself but i probably would have when i first started i hope ccp continues to make any microtransactions available through plex as opposed to direct cash only
erred
err day im hustlin
for great justice
yeah fix the omen

the idea is rather simple if you deal with contracts a lot and usually the same items this can be very useful you usually have different settings for every search for example when i look at caldari navy ballistic control system market i put 70mil as minimum price to get rid of all pesky buy orders and i limit the search to the forge region it quickly becomes tiresome when you for every search have to change region minimum price search phrase and sometimes more why not give us the ability to save search profiles with complete settings for the item we wish to search for
as a market trade alt i support thislet us market warriors have our contract fittingsi could reduce the number of sticky notes i have with settings listed on them for different items
a lvl 5 skill of our choice would be nice
a nice gift of say 1m sp would be awesomefor all chars on an account not just the one with the most sps or atleast make it something you can put in the redeemable items so you can choose which character to put it on not have ccp pick it for us
very good idea and proposal  1
yes please
sounds good
add a new itemnamesansha communication jammer who can use it sansha effectwhen sansha invade a system they deploy a communication jammer and the local chat channel is disabled
i wont be an asshat to the original op about this but rigs are integrated into the ship which is why they cant be removed after placement if the ship goes up the rigs would go with it
lol no
im surprised to not see more support for something so useful easy to implement and without a downside
the sin is in fact terribly balanced when compared to the other bops shipsits actually just more effective to pack the high slots with large autocannons and neuts than anything else
my point exactly
in current form absolutely notas a carrier super carrier mod with 10 min cycle requiring fuel with the negative of the triage module but none of the bonus of it  no warp no jump no drones no fighters no bombersmaybe not likely but maybeas for skills i would say a minimum of the followingelectronic warefare vcyno field v new skill to slightly reduce fuel cost per level
obvious troll alt is obvious
oh and for the claim that server stability shows us when something is a blob so although neither crashed the node the smaller fleets were more of a burden than the larger fleets go figure it seems to be part of a trend but im not sure if its increasing or not essentially there are a few very very vocal folks who have been outmatched by numbers andor superior firepower and believe that the best way to deal with it is to have ccp directly intervene to protect them hotdropped nerf cynos lowsec cynos or titan bridging outnumbered nerf standings fleet sizes or the overview and so on and so on its weird especially since most of those whines come prepacked with the blob snarl word as as some of argument winner what do you mean that if they have twice my numbers i can either adapt bring equal or greater numbers or ill probably lose what are you some kind of blobby mcbloberson blobermatic its like were being invaded by people raised on world of warcraft people who simply do not get eve at all
in every game where territorial control counts if diplomacy is left alone the game is going to become a bipolar world game designer can contrast this fate in some way with world shaping or more stringent rules of player movement it is possible in principle to change gameplay in order to prevent a north vs south scenario in eve it would possibly require too big of a change changes in world shaping nerf of capital mobility more and more nerfing and after these things the game may be the same the game would be more boring logistics will be more difficult there would be less pew pew in the end im perfectly fine with the us vs them north vs south scenario this is the political landscape that can fire the spark for huge and epic wars that everybody would like if the package hardwaresoftwaregameplay were able to handle it small gangs and solo players have lowsec empire and wormholes to play with but in my opinion small entities should have the ability to live in 00 hiding under the radar with their logistic and industry without being a threat to bigger forces like smugglers like piratesright now living in nullsec conquerable requires at least a pos and blue standings the least object you can own in space has 10mil ehp reinforce timers and requires a lot of resources or money to work that is it costs a lot to own these things but you also get a lot why cant we scale down costs and effectivity replacing defence with stealthiness and little costs once i had an idea about this that would not interfere with territorial warfare but could add a nice slice of gameplay

id like to know how big each market is i am in the rig market so i do particularly want to know how big that one is but im curious about them all how many x sold per month type of thing
id like to know the stats on the player bases view on microtransactions
heya allsome of these questions will be answered in the qen that should go live this week regarding the rest of the requests  i will keep an eye on this thread and use the ideas as sources for stat in the coming months the form of publication could be the next qens devblogs or something elsekeep in mind that i cannot promise that all questions will be answered and i cannot promise it will happen fast

i can confirm that anything regarding stats will not happen anytime soon p csm is still waiting for some data we asked for in 2006
according to the tyrannis credits research and statistics is a ten person department made up of eight researchers and two internal affairs overseers they should have plenty of available manpower and oversight in that department so why so much delay whats taking up research and statistics time
because theres not much we can tell you about specific proposals either due to nda or because theres simply not much to say issues that have been approved by the csm and ccp have gone into the development backlog the fact that they havent been implemented yet is because so far other things have taken priority when it comes to development time i want to avoid the whole roundtable to digress in 2 hours of players asking what about issue x and us answering its in the backlog similarly using the roundtable to say hey i have an idea can you guys bring it to ccp will only get you the answer of well look at it after the roundtableto get answers to questions like that its more effective to contact delegates directly outside meetings its ok we dont bite instead focus on the general process is the csm delivering what you the player expect from it are we giving players enough information and do you feel represented if there are problems and people feel certain areas of the process should be improved how can we do that also if there are major issues in eve that we need to discuss with ccp that have escaped our attention so far my hope is that after this roundtable we have a better view on what we are doing right and what could be improved and how
i was 4th last timei was brainstorming myself on how the eve poker tourmnament can be improved at fanfest 2009 it was unlimited rebuys the first hour all real money was for charity i would suggest some inprovementsin iceland its illegal to play poker  pokertournament with real money and prizes charity poker is allowedthe winners got a medali would suggest the following for eve fanfest 2011 pokertournamentadministration fee 2000 iceland kroner this money will go to charitybuy in 5 billion isk eve money 1 rebuy of 5 billion isk and an addon of 5 billion isk 5 is just a numberi guess you wont break icelandic laws when you can win ingame money  now there are 2 optionsthe isks will be used for plex charity and if so ccp will hand out prices like unique ships items blueprint etcor just have the isks as the poker prizepool so the winner can take a 250 billion isk prize homethe end word will be for ccp they need to like and adapt the ideaconceptfinal words i really enjoyed fanfest poker and it was good for charity alot of money was collectedit was however kind of pointles poker as there was no prize at start last minute 3 medals were called inpete mckay was an awesome pitbosseditccp could make the poker even more fun to put bounties on csm and ccp pokerplayers in case a player was able to knock the csm or ccp player out of the tournament bounties can be ships and ship items
no dear you will have to stripalso i would love to be on the csm poker team
judging by the direction this is heading to i guess we can expect a metrosexual csm strip club cd
i guess we have stephan meissa trebor mynxee and me for team csmat the december summit in reykjavik we can work this out if theres any time and energy leftif ccp likes it too then im available to help set this up for fanfest
im impressed that the tactic has been used for years given that tcussbus have only existed for 6 months and this is the first long downtimeno other element of eve has ever revolved around the mechanic of a lengthy online time you need to defend them forlol at all the people saying its never been an issue before  it couldnt have been this is literally the first dt over 5 hours since the mechanic was introduced
except for that huge dt a few months ago when everyone got those bonus skillpoints
can someone please go through the ccp middle management and sack the people that are pushing eve towards being dumb broadcast content
after browsing through the evelopedia im at deadend in the search for the csm 1 meeting minutes and summit reportsthe closest information ive found so far is located at evecsm surely there were more than three meetings in the first candidacyalso missing in action are the csm 2 summit reports would anyone happen to have a link to that information handymuch appreciation in advance pods and podettes 
id say low sec is the a good fusion between low income of high sec and low security of null in so far it can be considered to be the hardest and most deadly environment for players and corporations out therein a way it is the worst of both worlds a place never to be assimilated by high sec or null sec way of livein so far thinking of worsening it might eventually give a good suggestion for improving itokay enough with mad arrab like babblingbefore anyone ask im a total carebear so dont hope for too much pew pew suggestionsive read some suggestions so far but id say although they sound good they are not very exciting a lot of them are bit clichUFFFD at the momentcriminal underworld gangs onlinesmuggling infusion with stalkerprivateer gameplaypirate agents and pirate stations burning seas in space fresh from the carribean is what ccps vision has to be since 2003low sec being borders between empires can i get storm troopaz with blastaz thencertain ships only buy able in low good so while you drive around in your pimp machariel can i pimp my typhoon with paint so far the low sec suggestions seem to walkt three pathes turn it into a pseudo version of high sec just with better incometurn it into a pseudo null just without the hassle of politics and alliance land grabbingturn it into some place where players can play some game other than eveto be honest ive yet to realy see any suggestion that will work and give low sec any incentive to populate itto be honest ive got no suggestion that wont do that also and i dont think i can offer one but ill try anyway
the first question that has to be asked how did low sec become low sec not only game mechanic wise but also background wise i wont say anything new anything exceptionally which hasnt been said beforegame mechanic wise it is there to provide a training ground for small corporations and alliances to consolidate before moving into null a place that is a bit rougher then high sec less save and gives players opportunity to learn new survival techniquesin so far it was a total success players that cant stand low sec would most likely be a failure in null and those who can stand low will quickly see hey its better in null and move out in so far low can also be considered a population filterthat worked as long as null wasnt too crowded and there was still a little bit of space to conquer explore and exploit without too much politics to care aboutnull has evolved when politics became a driving force null sec owners suddenly had a need to refill ranks quick they couldnt wait for some arbitrary filter to provide them with forces recruitment became head hunter job and the forum the filter statistics and tables full of numbers replaced the need for some game zone that acts in some membrane like way in a way the recruitment board has superseded low secbackground wise in eve where there is a multinational ultra powerful militaristic police force financially backed by the mayor empires through concord meaning the direct enforcement directive how can it be possible that a lawless space like low sec is even able to existthe same way as in the real world fiscal and political reasonsfiscal as having the direct enforcement directive established in a certain system will cost billions if not trillions a year so a solar system that hardly provides a million a year in taxes and is not part of any trade route is hardly worth the monetary pressurepolitical as when concord is democratically controlled by all empires  it has forces in  then still vetoes which no uno like organisation can really exist without will not always but sometimes stop necessary decisionslow sec can be considered to be the hypocrisies of concord and ded here both fail to control and ensure anything not out of inability rather due to the very nature that both are made ofthe grinding machine of the amarrian expansion would be put to a screeching halt through inner circle diplomatics yet in the same way increasing security of some fringe system of conflicting political interest will be vetoed if it hasnt been already curtailed to the same screeching haltalthough i doubt any of my conclusions are the same one ccp came to when they designed low sec and you can be sure i came to the totally wrong ones some possible conclusion can be made about low secccp has tried to manipulate this filter by lowering the income in low sec and thus create a push towards null in so far they have turned a wheel on a mechanism that has slowly but steadily been replaced through tools provided by the community in the same way changing income establishing some totally new market or some game mechanic that doesnt exist outside of low sec wont necessary increase its populationstorywise the introduction of some pirate agents and bounty hunter guilds that only exist there might be clichUFFFD and eventually look less like an interesting new story development and more like some bmovie if it fails then it would be better to not fail in some obvious way cause it sucks rather end up a worse failure as twisted ending of some other story developmentif carebear is about doing what you know you already have won and pvper about knowing what does hold a possible win lowsec has to provide more of both and at the same time make it harder to have any of the two  and that didnt work in the past doesnt work currently and will most like not work in the future either
so any visions of my own hmm no not realy well so far i got a idea that doesnt need much new game mechanic just mostly using existing ones however doubt it is going to be establishedpersonally an idea of limited control over a system and a limited ability to increase the profit is most likely something that would move lowsec again in the direction of being a training ground for current day nulland a right for the controlling group to shoot first and answer questions later without having to deal with security hit would give the system a slight might makes right feeling of null without making it entirely nullhowever each of the pathes would mean that something is gained but something else stays at the typical low sec space levelfor the possibilities to increase the profit that might be in three directions in form of higher paying agent missions better payment better lp given outin form of higher amount space resources better ores and dropsin form of higher amount of planetary and moon production for the controlling faction it should only be possible to achieve either the maximum for two and sacrifice one of them a suggestion what three extreme combinations might be and what they meanfor higher paying agent missions and higher amount of space resources you have seen the light of police intervention and help though the system is far from safe all pod pilots will find here a place where they can ensure a reasonable living standard to deal with the harshness of low sec space agents provide a lot of money for various pod pilots those support a industrial backbone that helps to bring in money necessary to support a strong military backbone just the population has not really started to move in here maybe you should have considered increasing the standard of living for the average workforce well neither you nor concord lives on those colonies yet with each passing day it starts to become obvious that by cooperating with ded you might end up in a jurisdictional conflict while sentries are buffed in the sector your right to shoot anyone decreases until you can shoot only those with negative five or worse security standing while shooting anyone else will get you a security hitfor higher paying agent missions and higher amount of planetary and moon production the controlling faction would work with the aim of creating increasing the living standard of the simple worker the controlling corp stands for helping the local population and thus factionalism sacrificing space based profit in order to help the non pod space based population although now that you secured the system and the unwashed masses look up to you as a guiding light in such dark times where the government is far away you wallet is not as you will need to import a lot of resources for keeping this state even worse secret services of other empires will have an eye on you and some day you might suddenly find yourself on the wrong end of the faction militias weaponryfor higher amount of space resources and higher planetary and moon production the controlling faction would work in allegiance with profit security of space is neither an interest nor savety of people working here ruthless economical exploitation of the system is the main aim here problem is you forget to repair the sentries and gleaming over all this numbers you forget to check the immigration of pirates starting to settle your system and no everyone is so in bliss of richness to even care about telling concord about their barges being mindlessly slaughtered by sociopathic pod pilots out for wantom destruction system becomes more like null security hit when killing another player decreases sentries are less dangerous until becoming a mere joke
corruption isnt a system corruption is a state a state means someone is in power in so far power corrupts  in straight forward logic that is true im not sure it is that simple after all no one will be corrupted because there is money however everyone can be corrupted because he wants or wishes for somethingi dont think my idea is realy complete or usefull in the way i presented it but it might be a possible way to give the carebear side some reason to get to low sec while not making it a pure carebear paradise

yeshell nono seriouslyyou know team fortress 2 they invented microtransactions and a new shop for cosmetic and items you normally would play or trade for it weeks im not playing this game anymore because of this it ruined the whole game cccp listen to your fanbase and never ever invent this keep the normal pay to play system you are making enough money of this already so why would you want moar money
you already have a thread to stand on your soap box about the war dec system  please get out of this one to cry your tears

well this is my main  and i dont write checks with my posts that im not willing to pay for ingame  so keep hiding behind your alt   any time you want to war dec my alliance  please feel free  you know where we hang out  we enjoy farming your empire dwellers to pay for our real war decs
 thisalso damps dont have a residual effect like ecm jamneutralizing entire cap doesan arazu cant cycle through an entire fleet with much more achieved than losing cloak ability and aggressing all the deployed dronesresidual is 2x the cycletime please arazu is not even cap stable at comfortable range also damp scripts cannot be swapped in cloakdefeats the whole purposeour dronebays are not superior at refilling our lost flights from roaminglongrange combatcan we have special speed bonus for the mwd on all our drones sentries mwd around toooneirostracking links are too frantic to deal with in combat and its the worst logi fitting ever lacks grid and proper 2ndary bonustracking links should be area effect do not stack on each other also affect enemy shipsalso adding plates to our close combat ship hulls to apply dmg results in increased sluggishness in ship handlingmore agility on the base hull not more speed just nimbleness and mass reductionand then our guns dont track or beat high dps comparisons for longshort range weaponsboost gallentegallente victor
that alone would be enough to make this thread more then worth the effort it would defiantly tell us who should be on the csm and who needs to go

i think the biggest problem with hybrids are that there are no good mid range gunsammo it you look at must small to mid sized gangs must are fitted to fight at 1030km at that distance the hybrids are just no good blasters cant hit and rails cant do damage compared to other weapon systems there can hit in that range
a proposal on hybrids i can generally agree with altho i wonder if all the changes combined would be a bit too muchtds idea on reworking the hybrid ammo variation concept is very interesting indeed
i agree hybrids could use some love i like the idea of reworking the ammo similar to what they did with projectile ammo also hybrid ammo needs to be smaller
i give support to pretty much any attempt to bring attention to hybrids some thoughts on this proposal though1 the ammo size isnt as much a problem for small and medium ships but i can remember way too many times when my rokh ran out of ammo on pos bashes large hybrid charges are ridiculously large2 if ammo changes are used to boost hybrids similar to how projectiles were changed then i can agree with altering reload times its not really that important though3 tracking is one of the many proposed changes for blasters it makes sense though i dont think its going help blasters as much as most people hope4 t2 ammo would probably be looked at if ammo changes are made no big argument here5  6 i dont like using some arbitrary number to try and dumb down this problem even if it is derived from the turret damage formula its just trying to put too simple a face on too complex a problemalso i wish people would stop suggesting shield penetration why are you trying to fix one aspect of the game by demolishing another
ok guys i got the solutionswap minmatar and gallente play styles minmatar gets blasters so they can dodge around with their speed and shield tanks and apply wtf damage let them keep their racial ewar with webs and tps and such give gallente projectiles but let them be the slow armor tanking race that they are they can keep their racial ewar with long points and damps and stuff it would be awesome also gallente still gets drone boats hell we fit autos on most gallente ships anyway how bout we give em a bonus for it i dont care what you say gallente is under powered you can  stats all day about dps range ehp and cap consumption but you cant deny that 90 of the ships you see are either non gallente or an ishtardomimyrm proteuss are sweet but rather rare blasters should be setup where you can disengage if you want to similar to how minmatar is setup with close range projectile ships you can either fight at range or go nano and get in close with the ability to disengage close range hybrids dont offer you this choice because of the ships they are tied to with minmatar getting hybrids they can get in close and fight but can also dictate range if needed because of their high speed and shield tank gallente wont be able to dictate range but their guns will be much more effective considering their ship attributes you can justify it by saying some crap like gallente and minmatar are bffs now and like to tell each other their deepest darkest secrets regarding weapon bonuss or something i dont know i dont care but fix something
ok guys i have the real solutionthis topic has been posted several times before in the assembly hall please read the sticky of hot topics of the assembly hall before posting repeated topics there are two hybrid topics already floating around in there one for rails and one for blasters please post in those threads rather than making new topics
support 1 damned right they should be smaller and i dont care if projectiles got reduced to make up for carrying more ammo hybrids should be appropriately sized to make up for having to carry cap booster charges to keep them running2 totally agree this would give hybrids the ability to more easily switch between pathetic but at least some damage at typical engagement ranges and facemelting but pathetically short range if we can rub hullsi also think that the fitting reqs on blasters should be lowered significantly gal ships have lower grid than any race other than caldari which happen to be the other race crippled by hybrids sucking and at least they get to use less grid hungry shield tanks rather than the insanely grid hungry active armor tanks that gal supposed to usethe fitting reqs at the small level are just brutal and medium isnt much of an improvement lasers got it pretty rough too and should probably be adjusted as well but thats a different subject either that or bump the the fitting reqs on small and medium autos to be more inline with the other short ranged weapons so that ac users have to chose between tank and gank like the other races do

this was my first cruiser and i loved it after i learned by painfull trial and error i sadly moved on id love to see the omen shineyou have my full support tk
this
 no if i use real money for a ship upgrade it better not be destructable much less scoopable if i paid for it is mine periodalso lol at you for telling ccp how to run their business i like microtransactions it helps me gain an edge if other players are not that serious about the game then so what they didnt want that ship anywaysnot supported
we need this i wouldnt mind renting our hangar slots and what not to people below me reminds me of the feudal system in medieval europe
boobs
not bad
true enough but whats more likely to actually be implemented 
i think the concept of a more defined hierarchy in pos roles and access would be a very good thing not sure i agree that personal hangars would be though it is a pos not a station there should be great risk and thought put into allowing others access to your pos
whats next plex for sp and next how about remove the gametime you get from it and instead make it needed to fly anything bigger then a t1 cruiser on top of the subscription how about after that being able to buy a special ship for alot of plexs that not even concord can stop and the only way to kill it would be by paying plexs to get the counter ship that is only good against ityou kind of see my point this wont go anywere good i dont mind plex for game time and i also pay for my game by buying plex off the market also plex for neural remaps does not make sence plexpilots licenes extension or something like that
at least the macros can plex remap into hulks and orcas using their rmt moneyseriously seriouslyi am disappoint
it would be fun to deploy the bubble and fly right at the attackers they lose target lock and you get to pew pew with blasters especially if they brought something big to the fight like a carrier sure they cant lock nor be attacked from the outside but if you reduce the big dps from a roam then you have changed the dynamics of the fight considerably something like this can be used as a weapon tooway too op for ecmi would favor a sensor strength modification bubble rather than a total blackout that way ecm become more effective for the defenders
i bolded the conceptual error you made for you i seriously doubt someone forces him at gunpoint to regularily transport stuff to that very place and you are aware what both your options would do to large scale battles involving capital ships i can already see the supercaps escorted by their mighty shuttle fleet which soaks up the damage
slippery slope fail you should have gone for the worst case scenario with the most imbalanced application of the idea which is obviously a drake blob with nothing but defender missiles x 7 and the tanking module fully tank fitted and the module splits up the damage equally between all the tanks on the target as well as reduces it to the damage the smaller ship would receive
tactical miner  this ability is friendlyfleet only nothing happens to hostiles target locks should they enter the bubble as it is mearly a mechanic for you using your ship as a shield as the eve engine  as far as a know  cant actualy do this atmdlardrageth  instead of attacking my reasion for creating this idea how about looking at the idea itselfkabaal ssylistha  not sure if you read this but any ship using the module pilot settings is not affected by any other ship doing the same
option1 a battleship defenced falconoption2 the hic like ship will save any a dying ships from being poped not only industries then they will have no loseescort the freighter with ecms and neuts clear the way with ops
i did was just commenting on someone elses comment forgot my sarcasm tagsand yeah i read itthreads on this usually say something along the same lines of limiting it but i always preferred dr to a hard cap i already 1d to the idea of putting meatshields in

nice interesting idea also i like the combinations what else you could do with such a thing1

yes i am not trusting the timer much anyway any improvement in this important thingie is of much more value then shiny new grafics on old ship models1
is it too late to necro thisstrongly support it would eliminate all the guess work of is that sniper near that bm it wouldnt eliminate the need to actually make the bookmarks nor would it increase the number of bookmarks it in fact it would probably decrease the numbers needed since you would be able to more optimally place them rather than having redundant bookmarks because you forgot you already had one near there
this would be great it would be a lot more useful to see exactly where your bookmark is relative to enemy positions than to guess
simple cool and would be fun to seesupported
tbh im all for changing the level of opacity in the warp tunnel graphics so u cant see outside untill ur practically out of warp that will combat the issue of seeing yourself plowing though world at faster than light speeds without causing cataclismic and irreperable damage to the planet although seeing the whole star system move while ur in warp is always awesome when u actually stop and marvel at it the problem is even something like that isnt going to stop you seeing yourself warp through stargates and stations which does screw up the immersion a bitits a difficult one to call s
supported if they also make objects solid for ie asteroids i lost many a shipback in the day trying to dodge attacks by going by a roid only to find i am being shot at through the dang thing stations as well
well for example you can ctrl a to select all items in containers etc makes it very easy for can flipping solets say you do a ctrl and mouse cursor over a ship and click it then you can target all ships of that type within range up to your ships max targetsor do a ctr shift and click on it on any ship within range and target all ships within range up to your ships max targetsinstead of clicking on or ctrl clicking each one seperately can ninjas already have an advantage why not give all other pilots an advantage of speed targeting
umno i choose my targets deliberately and unless the game is going to be smart enough to pick them in the order i would id never use the featurebesides which if it targets all rifters how do i tell it not to target my allies assuming they are flying a rifter justno half formed ideas belong in features and ideas so they can be refined before being brought to the assembly hall
i also cant imagine ever using something like thisif you are actually piloting your ship range can be many things is it your targeting range optimal range some sweet spot in your falloff ships within range that are traversingmoving at a speed that you can hit the ship you are orbiting vs other ships in range how do you tell it to not target ships that are too close to youjust seems like it would be easier to hold down ctrl and click on the things you want to target in your overview like you can already than to use a clunky method like that picking targets is not as cut and dry like selecting inventory items in a jetcan is
i know this can go in all kinds of directions but here is what got my idea wondering around my little brainsay for example a mammoth can be researched and invented to go from an industrial to say a rocket boat say for example it can be converted to specialise in the defender missile a stand alone platform to take out incoming rockets missiles torpedos as we all know defender missiles dont auto target this would i think do very well in fleet allaince warefare encountersnow i know this idea can go many various ways and get quite complicated but just keep it simple kind of
you want when you invent a mammoth bpc to receive a defender missile bpc that will block all missiles or a new ship that blocks all missileshow the  an industrial is going to transformed to a rocket boattrololoolololo010 work harder please
some very good idea especialy the 7  fw zone between empire at wars 
sandbox noundefinition a place where nice kids come to dig in the sand and build sandcastles and trade pokemon cards and nasty kids come to beat up nice kids kick over sandcastles and steal pokemon cardsalso may refer to a place where cats crapi dont really see how this doesnt apply to eve
an open world is a type of video game level design concept where a player can freely roam a virtual worldthe term is sometimes used interchangeably with sandbox and freeroaming however the terms open world and freeroaming describe the game environment itself and allude more to the absence of artificial barriersseeing how it is a term for an open video game and eve meets that descriptioni would say thats why

this is assuming a resolution on the announced plex for remap comes aroundccp seems to be making more uses for plex these new options have nothing to do with game timewhat i propose is instead of plex for remap that you pay in isk to an npc stationthis would create a much needed isk sink300 mil for remap and add another 200mil after each remap for 1 year so your 3rd remap  after the free 1year remap you currently get would be 700mil or a total of 12bil total in total for 3 remaps for that yearif plexs continue being used for more and more options in game or items the price will rise vastly as it is now though its a market trend and not an issue this means soon a cap ship will be as simple as spending 30 of your real life moneytldrinstead of plex use iskprosisk sinklessen plex inflationconsplex drops in price maybeisk sellers might sell moreinb4 trolls flamers and other eve forum things try to be constructive
so it has been a while since i have really read the ingame news articles this is mainly because my main source of them was simply opening the igb however with the introduction of eve gate we lost the home page that provided us quick access to fun and colorful newsand internet memes aside i do not really need to eve inside my eve i purpose that ccp restores the original rss style news page as the default igb homepage because wasting all that amusing content in 5 submenus is shameful
i second this as its something i normally read all the time when spinning in station

what im confused so far a lot of good feedback via evemail for this anymore thoughts
whyyour assumption that the roi lolbusiness speak should be the same is the reason your argument doesnt hold water your time as a player is no less valuable than mine but just like in the business world your choices determine your roi not simply being present and accounted forthat aside the roi of your time spent playing a game should be measured in enjoyment not game assets its not our fault that you seem to consider them to be the same thing

was trolling thru the fighter and fighterbomber models viewing them and was wondering  why are we not flying these cool little models  woudnt it be cool to hop out of the pod and strap into one of these little monsters and link up and jump around with a carrier where you could have a first person view as the pilot kinda like the pc flight sims  could lead to some epic battles and yet a new eve experience  yes im having a battlestar galactica image here but it would be to cool to be able to do such just a idea i had  im sure others have had it as well please dont flame me to hard 
dust xpac 1first person sim fighter game
the game will not support a fps style spaceship game with twitch based combat maybe if they worked loke frigates i dun know
i would prefer the real carrier idea posted lots of times beforethe idea that a carrier is realy a carrier not a droneship with bigger dronesso you dock up with a carrier in your whatever ship an jump around with some other player controling the carirerbut thats not going to happen anytime soon too much work for ccp
as a noob i originally was thinking that carriers work like thatsame with rorquals i really was thinking i can dock inside those ships and they will jump me around i was pretty much disappointed that it works in a different wayand if you look closely into the fighters they all have pilots sitting inside

1 account 1 char 1 upping
i was on a long long hauling route and noticed something interesting with checking back and forth between the star map and the game uino matter where in three dimensional space any two stargates are linked the stargate is always oriented to zeroi see stargates pointing in all kinds of  zero orientations in missions so i know its possible to point them into any orientation the star map already has the orientation information in regards to this correction it would be 1 to have the stargate actually point in 3d space to the interconnecting systemsimple right
wrong and also pointless not only in practical game terms but also if you read the backstory
backstoryin order to connect two jump gates a trialanderror method is needed often lasting many years this is because the tentacle created by the tensorfield cannot be controlled or directed in where to openhardly seems like it would always be zerobesides there is nothing to suggest that the physical pointing of the gate must always be zero nor is there a suggestion as to why all the gates are on the relaxed zero interface
it would go along with the current push for greater realism from ccppod walkingalso it would break up the monochromatic aspect of gates besides the racialbased models1
i propose that csm adjust its approach to communications with ccp as i understand it whats missing are organized thorough position papers on hot topics under consideration by ccp case in point microtransactions csm has solicited player thoughts on the topic and gathered wealth of feedback it feels strongly about the issue in its notes of meetings with ccp it is also clear that csm repeatedly stated its concerns about microtransactions however those concerns were stated in the course of facetoface discussions with ccp when making a forceful cohesive argument on the spot is difficulttherefore i propose that csm add position papers to its array of means to communicate with ccp here is how this would work csm learns of a highly important issue be it from players or from ccp csm solicits player opinion on the issuecsm then prepares an educated organized and forceful summary attempting to reasonably reflect player consensus on the issue csm then submits this summary to ccpbenefits this approach would 1 make csms arguments to ccp forceful raising their effectiveness 2 educate players as to the core concerns of csm and other players 3 create written accountability benchmarks against which csm could measure ccps adjustments to the game eg csm says microtransaction are bad for this and that reason and states so unequivocally in a position paper ccp decides to ignore csm position and goes ahead with implementing microtransactions bad things happen csm now refers back to its position paper and says see we told you so in an unequivocal manner right here overtime ccp would be compelled to pay attention to position papers because they leave nothing to misunderstanding and are good evidence of why ccp should heed player feedback
go back to killing stray sheep with a tengu also try reading the csm wiki at some point
all we need is some clear statments ccpwe want microtransactions because players we dont cause and then somehow argue about whats betterand come to a conclusion o
recently it has came to my attention that people obviously want combat and are getting nervous about the huge amount of titans being deployed this isnt a dig at it i am sure players are well aware all nullsec alliances favour super cap production and mass produce themthis proposal is to introduce monuments so rare that if an alliance captures one they will be allowed to anchor it within a system increasing bonuses to a specific alliancethe bonus will apply to one system and will affect one alliance only it will increase speed damage output optimal range falloff by 100 and all resists by 50 of everything associated with that alliance including starbases while in that systemin order to anchor such a monument 4 artefacts must be claimed which will randomly spawn in nullsec which weight 10k m3once all artefacts are brought together they can then be assembled in a system they must be assembled in space and require 24 hours to be completeduring the assembly the monument can be destroyed so it must be guarded the monument will in effect have 1 million hit points and when destroyed will drop 4 artes after it has finished being assembled it will have 5 million hit points and if destroyed will drop 4 artes monuments can only affect alliances who own space in that systemthis is just an example of an idea similar to how war occurs in a different game i have noticed that alliances at least in that game risk everything and i mean everything to claim such rare stuff either because they dont want enemies to claim it or because they want it themselvesi feel if something like this was introduced where something of great value yet rare was obtainable people would fight over it probably not a great example but im open to ideas dthinking about it now i think the main reason people arent fighting is because theres nothing really to fight over maybe this thread is best of in fi
this is why drugs are bad kids mkaymindflood not even once
perhaps if alliances had something rare to compete or fight for maybe blobs wouldnt be such a bad thing i think the problem is the growth of production and lack of usage thats ing people offi dont think people have a problem really with blobs i think they just have a problem with blobs continuing to grow at the rate things are going to quote someone from mcsomething of rare value needs to be introduced that will allow alliances to clashthen again saying that judging by the comments here the bigger blob will always win heh
they got somewhat lagged out i hear thats a common feature with regards to eve
well not all statistics are created equal eg number of caldari pilots older than 2 years is a couple of lines of sql system with most ore mined might be impossible or very expensive to analysei would like some stats mostly scopeepeen and quartile or decile would be much more informative than just meanpilot age or sp for instance eg 25 less than 3 months and 50 less than 7 and 75 less than 26 monthsi would be curious as to the alts   with 1 2 3 4 active accountsi would also like some insight into isk but with corp wallets and alts i am not sure there is much accurate information to gleen isk per email address eg collapse all account info as much as you can some day in the life would allow some interesting if not statistically significant info pick a day and then runs some stats on it that might be too expensive to do every day dont tell playerbase but pick a day and then make a copy of the data eg on this date here is the breakdown per category hilonowh of fitted ships and pilots  5m sp 510102020404080 80 spmissions by level lp generatedconsumedbut most any stats are interesting
going to emptyquote myself since the recent qen bases faulty conclusions from snapshots and id rather have valuable data than garbage
yes the idea is to have an objective measurement of ships that are underpowered so that ccp can know what is in need of boosting
no this needs to be based on percentage of price change not absolute price change there are some items in eve with such a low perunit price that 001 isk price changes are perfectly legitimate
knowing how many botters  macros get temp banned and permo banned each week would be nice to know tbh
i may be biased but id like to know more about the courier contract market in evemonthly amount of courier contracts broken down in private vs public high sec only vs low sec and 00 volume distribution of courier contracts collateral distribution of courier contracts trip distance distribution of courier contracts regional differences in amount of courier contrats starting and ending in the region interregional vs regional courier contracts total amount of volume moved pr month amount of rewards paid pr month private vs publicand probably more
what i would like to knowof items which have t2 bpos still in game what percentage of the last years markets were made from the t2 bposwhat percentage of capital ships produced since dronelands introduction have been made in the dronelandswhat volume of the total mineral market from the past year is made from reprocessed alloys reprocessed t1 drops and from mininghow many t2 bpos are still in eve ie have not actually been destroyedhow many accounts are regularly online for more than 16 hours in day

we need to get enough feedback from players for and against positive and negative to add weight when we discuss this at the next iceland summitcertain people within ccp are quick to class any negative comments as bitter vets so the more people who respond with reasonable concerns the better

what if they are the same people fixing lag rockets sov and low sec
the people pushing eve in this direction are not the day to day developers but they do have the power to change it all they have to do is flag their concerns directly to hilmar it is my understanding that he has an open door policy but that staff are unwilling to bypass the management structure which is causing the information blockagei could post exactly which people in ccp believe that awesome gameplay in eve should consist of facebook game ripoffs like planetville and that incarna should be full of minigames and plex for outfits but it wont do any good those people really truly believe that they are providing awesome content and that all the industry awards back them up they class anyone who leaves as just a bitter vet and believe marketing can simply gain new subscribers to compensatemeanwhile the core game that attracted 330000 subscribers is being ignoredbut even this will be ignored as a bitter vet ranting so honestly what is the point
well maybe the best thing that can happen to eve for its long term future is that in the short term a loss of subscribers to prove to these idiots that think the facebook games such as farm i have no life or friends and am a very sad git sville are a really bad ideaalso i suspect that when swtor comes out its is going to hit players numbers not just in this mmo but in quite a fewi am hoping that bioware do an amazing job and just blow people away to show these idiots that people do not want want mini games and to be able to buy everything right down to your underwear via micro transactions but want a polished well designed and well written mmo

i know the minutes were published i just cant quite remember where ankhesemtapemkah was secretary back then and i dont think shes around to askdid you check the csm1 meeting threads
i was thinking the same thing reading the first few pages vectors or whatever the new information is  should only be displayed on the players ship and the locked targets to reduce clutter and let us very easily decide which ships we want to pay attention to new info should also shown on any ship selected or hovered over in the overview so you can check on distant ships or fleets or even maintain eyes on a nearby ship if you get jammed or sensor dampedi agree that semicicles dots or other shapes would not be as easy to read as a simple vector we would have to mentally combine a dot direction with a semicircle graph magnitude to visualize the vector in our minds which is just as much work as we do currently cut out that middle step and use vectors much less overhead and very intuitivecurrently when using the tactical overview and hovering the mouse over a module such as a gun webifier ecm jammer etc  there is a shaded sphere displaying optimal range of that module in the new system add an icon or sliding scale on your targets depicting tracking when you hover over your guns or a percentage chance to land a jam when hovering over an ecm module etcglad to hear youre onboard with the idea this might turn into something exceptionalj

aha so we see the truth exposed behind your proposal all you want to do is make lifestock out of all the empire dwellers you dont care about the fight all you want is easy targets to take out your frustrations from failure in null sec if you want your war targets in empire to be so easy to kill why dont you just go shoot rocks with mining lasers i hope everyone can see through your manipulation you dont really care about the game or its mechanics all you want is easy moneyyour proposal makes it perfectly clear that the war dec system is only good for exploiting newbies and industrialists it only makes it legal for higher skillpoint players to exploit the lower sps you must feel like a big man to run around and ransom defenseless people way to go such a sense of accomplishment you must have i bet the rats in missions fight back more than most of the people you try to targetthis proposal is not only a bad one for high sec but it would also negatively affect null sec this relationship between null sec and the farming of empire for funds through the war dec system needs to be examined it points to the glaring failure of the war dec mechanics

yes null is designed to not overlap with barrage and scorch and keep the short ranged theme of blasters while helping out in critical ranges610km or 1824km in fights you where you will not end up at antimatter rangesexcept from being literally broken since nobody would use faction am when null does nearly the same damage it would also create a rather large window where blasters out damage anything what is rather bad considering that kitting should be a viable optiona frigate also can change ranges far more quickly than bs the effect of losing 910k damage in a bs slug down is not that different from what you experience with frigs

blasters have less range than ac or pulses so giving them the same bonus to range on t2 that the other races have would not make them overlapsimplified optimalfallof numbers on best mediumsdps t1 ammoac 108 pl 10bl 68t2 range ammoac 164pl 22bl 108bl new 12  with new bonus of 4040so how would that make them overlap with barage or scorch blasters would still have almost half the range of scorch but atleast the ammo bonus would be consistentit makes no seance that amarr get 50 bonus to range and galentecaldari get 25 bonus to range with the same penalties the weapon balance is worked out at the base weapon stats t2 ammo should only tweak it a bit in this case 50 more range and some penalties to go with that hybrids get the full penalty but only half the bonus thats brokeneither remove half the penalty maybe remove tracking penalty on null or give the full bonus of 50 range

i support this completelythis character is a fairly new one and at the moment only has about 22 mil sp engineering to 4 atm and i can only fit 5 t1 beam turrets on it that are of the second smallest amount of powergrid taken for beam turretsfocused modal medium laser 1 i cant even fit an armor repper on this boat this is ludicrous i may not have perfect skills but with engineering at 4 i should be able to fit 5 of these lowpowergrid requiring beam lasers with an armor repper i honestly feel like i wasted my isk on this and now i have to go buy a different ship fix the omen plz
omen omendamage control iienergized adaptive nano membrane iiadaptive nano plating ii400mm reinforced crystalline carbonide plates i400mm reinforced crystalline carbonide plates i10mn microwarpdrive ij5b phased prototype warp scrambler ilangour drive disruptor ifocused medium pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency mhobgoblin ii x3see what i did there its cheap has no rigs and good stats vs cost requires low skillingthere is nothing wrong with the omen try more intuitive fittings instead of i must fit an 800mm plate and a mwd and super powerful weapons tie brother thats what makes it so greatselinate what is it youre trying to achieve with a beam laser  mar fit
yes i noticed the lack of dps on it maybe because there are 2 destroyer sized plates and no heatsinks dont worry one of the other 8 cruisers with tank and dmg mods will be along shortly to put it out of its miseryoh also there ewar boat gets only 50 less dps then that fit with a td 4 small nuets and a 6000ehp better tankno rigs and full flights of anti frig and ecm drones so you managed fit it all together and there support ship pwns your frontline cruisertry again your bumps keep getting more of the lil thumbs up
300 dps isnt to be laughed at when you can completely out range blasters and dropping 50 dps when switching to scorch in only one second and hitting out to 20 km is an epic achievement can you post your arbitrator fit so i can compare please
absolutely supported i like the omen very much for its design and have tried using it several times in pvp the only thing it can really do is kill frigates
standard arby fit4 small nuets1 td1 warp disruptor or scram1 stasis web1 mwd or ab1 1600mm plate2 eanm1 dcu ii510 hammerhead iis510 warrior iis05 ec300 or ec600swith the tracking you will have trouble hitting anything optimal makes scorch useless and a vexor can get similar dps with out blasters then that fit
yeah the arbi is a great ship but those tds are useless vs a missile boat small neuts have no range and when flying in a fleet ewar boats are the primary targetsmy argument is that you can fit an omen competitively in its class better skills allow for better fits a low sp player shouldnt be able to easily fit their ships hell high sp players struggle i dont put top tier guns on any of my bcs
unless they are any other race then ammarnot really and this isnt about top teir guns in the least it is about a little more fitting leway for a ship very few people flyas of yet you have not posted one good fit that isnt rediculously expensive complete or had fitting mods to fit the smallest sized gunsethier way compared to the rest the fitting on this ship is really poor
omen is finenot supported
that would get killed by most of the games cruiser line up to be honest as it has a fairly terrible buffer and fairly terrible dps
supported lp store ui is cruel
no just no microtransactions are mostly nothing but badhowever since i do look at both sides the only thing that i can see that might be useable in microtransactions is stuff you can get in your quarters for wis whenever we get thatnone of it should effect gameplay especially the pew pewedit my support for this money grubbing option is currently holding up the tacoma narrows bri oh wait yeah
noif there are microtransactions for actual game related items like ships or ship fittings there is no point to playing its stupid it creates an uneven playing field and give advantages to people willing to spend 100 dollars a month on this game no only that but inherentally the ships or items you would by buying would be better then anything normally avaliabul ingame making a game people already pay for pointless to play because someone can send ccp 15 bucks for the superdestroyer shipin short dont do it
original post updatedlooking for more comments and support
definately on the idea of repeat attempts just add a field no of attempts with a max time limitwould be a continuation of the other industry job styles and wouldnt hog every slot in one go
hm your proposal even if it improves the current situation will still be a clicksink some sort of pve thing against a bundle of dialog boxes and a stop watchadditionally there might be all kinds of implicit issues with the ui that may make it slow and bulgy  like checking if x slots can be assigned if x blueprints and materials are available in the selected hangar if x jobs can still be created by the player etcas far as i understand it the problem is rather that you have to restart the job every time manually at all if jobs could be configured to autorestart after completion until they run out of materials or research slots thatd fix it wouldnt it
do want
eve can already handle missile interception and target occulsion they are just lagtastic
how about you actually read the second part of my initial statement as well i think it is a bad idea for 00 for starters unless you can absolutely guarantee it will not lead to yet another increase in lag or even more blobby warfare both these risks i see quite prevalent with what you suggest and thus with best regards still opposed to it
why dont you use logistic pilots in your support fleet to protect the industrials like any sensible fc wouldnot supported there are methods already in place
so protect in the dictionary you use means much the same as ing into the wind does in mine
i look forward to seeing drake blobs execute this null sec war is tedious enough without indestructible blobs what youre describing would fall under some sort of lets call it for lack of any other description logistical support ccp should create a skill set and matching ship that would allow certain pilots to absorb no remove damage they can fit thingys that will remotely repair either armor shields or hull yes brainstorming here they can call the ships logisti wait a second  fixboats yeah thats it ccp we want fixboatsjust an idea
that has to be the most ed idea ive heard yet oh wait its notits just an another idiot troll thread
it is real easy for me to hit the report post button please stop the trolling and insults in my threads if you are incapable of leaving constructive feedback then do not post at allany part of this not clear
youve got to be prepared for your idea to be shat on if you air it in public nothing says criticism here has to be constructive in that vein go eat a  this is perhaps the worst idea ive heard this week i think i may have gotten dumber clicking on the link to see your postwhy doesnt it have to be constructive im not entirely sure constructive criticism for a idea such as this is even possible wardecs are an adjustment to a mechanic designed to soften the impact of coming into a game with rules that might not be familiar to those who play hello kitty onlineeve is meant to have pvp if you want a zero pvp zone i do think you are in the wrong game why do you think have a nopvp zone could be a good idea here eve is founded on being able to interfere with and destroy other players activities
snip please keep it civil spitfire
of course you can hit report post but you get th same as cromoit will be mostly your posts that get nerfed
how about no
this is such a bad idea that id almost suspect cromo came up with it it really is that awful
totally like it ofc you need to add something for 00 as well there how about one plex buys you total invulnerability for all your sov mods for a month
tldr they have low pg and bad dps they are broken fix themlonger versionat first let me define what i mean when i say that some ship is broken if ship a is made for specific role and it is bad for that role therefore no one likes to fly it then its brokenmost if not all caldari gunboats are dedicated snipers they receive bonuses for range unlikely to other races they do bad dps as a compensation this concept looks nice on paper maybe when bunch of guys were creating eve they thought that its an awesome idea but its not whole line of ships is broken by this wrong assumption for some reason ccp thinks that having extra range is such a huge advantage that its worth to sacrifice  everything else caldari gunboats shoot further than other ships from the same class but they are very slow have limited pg bad drone bay bad dpstake moa as an example and compare it with rupture moa is unable to fit full rack of 250s while rupture can fit 720mm guns and still has power for 10mn ab rupture does more dps is faster has decent drone bay can choose damage types etc only advantage moa has is range same goes with ferox eagle vulture only rokh is ok its not popular because of shield but this is another topic reallyso what is suggested fixmoa 1 needs pg enough to fit 5 250mm railguns without any kind of powergrid boosting module2 needs 25 m3 drone bayferox1 it also needs pg boost not as badly as moa but still 2 dps of ferox is miserable 6 gun slots is not a huge upgrade from moas 5 slots ferox really needs 7 turret slots like brutix or 8 high slots like cycloneeagle1 to keep eagle in par with other sniper hacs it needs pg enough to fit full rack of 250mm rails and mwd all other sniper hacs can do that why cant eagle munin can even fit 2 heavy missile launchers together with mwd eagle actually has only 3 effective low slots as long as a 1 low is always occupied with rcu2 well thats pretty much it eagle may easily become op due to its huge rangevulture 1 seriously why would someone snipe in a command ship there is no point in giving to vulture 2 range bonuses swap one of them with rofdamage bonusrokh is fine but it will shine if railguns get fixed and why does it have only 50m3 drone bay apoc is also a dedicated sniper but it has 75in addition to that i need to say that all caldari and gallente ships are affected by broken hybrids for caldari railgun fix is particularly important rails really need damage modifier boost this simple modification would make them actually usable
signedalso add another turret slot to the merlin right now it looks like it was designed by a minmatar saboteur who wanted to force all caldari gunboat pilots to waste some time training missile skills while at the same time omitting any flexibility
double signed
nope caldati are fine as they are no need to dumb down the game even more by moving towards even less variety dont like caldari gunships dont fly them that easy
immature jokes aside i wouldnt mind if the whole thing got a little a lot love
1 you should explain why they are fine2 bad ships dont ad variety to eve3 i dont fly them actually very few people do
incessant anticaldari whine detected
that makes less sense than a penny
i see what you did there
add explosion radius like 500m so they can be more usefull atm defender missiles  trash so only way i see to make them more popular is by adding some kinda explosion to kill more than 1 missile inside 500m range
not really stealth drake blob nerf detectedas much as id like to see defender missiles actually be worth usingthis doesnt seem like the right way to do it
 wouldnt this make every single ship capable of fitting a fast firing missile launcher immune to missile damagethat doesnt seem right p
sadly these have been brought up multiple times and many ideas on them have been addressed to fail unfortunately even though they could be a good better than they are defense nothing has ever been done about it to date

most excellent ideaoverview option pleaseand id like fries with that
the only bm idea ive seen almost as good as removing them altogether
instead of having the arrows for anchoring pos structures change size when zooming inout then should stay the same size on screen so one can zoom out and place mods with one movement instead of having to zoom in so you can see the arrows move the mod 1 screen lengthwidth zoom back out and reposition the screen and then zoom back in again so you can click on the nowtiny arrows
empty postin
god damn ccp send this guy a consultant fee because this is a better ui change than anything youve ever come up with
do it
i can take a dump on my keyboard and come up with a better interface for just about everything in your game you horrible failures
a smelly way to put it but i do agree that at least the pos interface stuff is in dire need of a revamp
the eos it needs love125 drone bandwidth ktnx
why it isnt a feild command shipthe astarte is the combat ship if anything the eos needs a stronger tank it is dmg you want the astarte is the one you want buffed
debeastify  de4startifyhm 
the eos should be a dps powerhouse like the vulture or the damnation rightthe problem with the eos is the bad ganglinks not the bad dps
learning game mechanics helps fleet command ships are there to use gang links to boost a fleet missiles on a damnation for example are pretty much just for killmail whoring or annoying fast tackle dps is gravy and its the nerfs that have hit ewar in general that hurt the eos boosting the eos by giving it better drones is a bit like boosting the hulk by giving it a laser capacitor bonus
yes please  i guess the link bonus needs changing i for one welcome any changes to information warfare links which imo makes the eos 
one of these things is not like the others one of these things just doesnt belong can you tell which of these things is not like the others by the time i finish my songcommand ships skill bonus 10 bonus to armor hitpoints and 3 bonus to effectiveness of armored warfare links per levelcommand ships skill bonus 10 bonus to medium hybrid turret optimal range and 3 bonus to effectiveness of siege warfare links per levelcommand ships skill bonus 75 bonus to medium projectile turret tracking speed and 3 bonus to effectiveness of skirmish warfare links per levelcommand ships skill bonus 15 m3 extra drone bay space and 3 bonus to effectiveness of information warfare links per leveldid you guess which thing was not like the others did you guess which thing just doesnt belongif you guessed the eos is more ed than the others then you might not be as ed as the eos yourself
ive already made a thread about it that somehow didnt get noticedwhat is needed to fix it is to make all command ships get bonuses to all types of gang links so a eos can also use armor com links and get bonuses for itoh and yeah the eos probably needs its bonus changed thats true
even more terrible idea but hey sure and next we make all bcs have the stats and bonuses of the drake right if ganglinks on the fleet command ship of your choice ie eos are so terribad get a t3 cruiser and use the ganglinks there not like t3s are slowly stealing the role of fleet command ships already anyway
ahh ye the ships too close i hear ya on that the other points well i wasnt looking for anything complicated like that just simply as i put it but the too close ships ye that cuould be a big plus as it would target all ships in range and u wouldnt have to manually click the ones too closei guess im just not as coordinated as that seems like alot going ont clicking ship after ship once you get into the mix i would much rather just bang multi target ok those are in range pick the guns etc for whatever targets and if they are too close i was not paying attention i should have burned away a bit to kite em or whatever the case may be
except directed at the speaker there are far worthier threads to troll with far worthier attempts at itanyway on both points you bring up1 random inventing is actually the most plausible way i can see ccp implementing it as in you start research on blueprint x and you have a 80 chance of blueprint y 15 for blueprint z and 5 for blueprint qq not the most elegant way but until they change how items work its probably a reasonable solution once you iron out the specifics of what researches into what and is a good way to quietly seed some new ships in a more natural way than is done now2 defender roles are something i personally want to see but defender missiles really cant be worked on until such a role is fleshed out to be more than one piece of ammo for one weapon system affecting only a small portion of enemy offensive capabilityand theres nothing wrong with the idea of turning indys into war vessels from a realism standpoint i have a big shiphm lets throw some armor on and add guns i wouldnt have felt the need to say it if fail troll hadnt mentioned it though
to the quote  did you even get what i was saying to both replies and i wasnt trying to troll defender missiles just use em as an example and ye i dont do rd yet just thought it was more specific than random like that
you want an answer that will draw people to lowsecuse these ideas 1 btw  however allow for the overlord of the section to be bribed for protection similar to concord in high sec use the insurance policytype interface at a pirate spaceport to buy some level of protection ie 05 06 07 07 09 and 10 level of security that is only active in their controlled territory just imagine a spawn of bad ass npcs you ratted for years coming to your rescue from a gank in lowsec because you bribed them for protection the tears of pirates would never stop flowing as the bears delighted in the chaos hey empire pays for concord to keep the peace why not make peace for hire in lowseci do like the ideas posted but its never going to work as long as there are epeen gank blobs looking for their next thrill at someones expense as the great bear once said  i play the game to entertain myself not to entertain you fix that and you will have a higher population in lowsec in no time flatlets face it there is only one law enforced section and two lawless sections i think it should be one law enforced section one quasi enforced section and one lawless sectioni like the idea so i will support it even if there are no changes to the security of players from gank squads
support the general ideagenerally support most of the individual ideas not 7 unless entrances to lowsec are more diffuse i dont like the idea of making gate camps better i would like to see that sort of pvp heavily nerfed to be honest doing stuff in lowsec should be dangerous not so much traveling to lowsec in the first placei would also like to see standings to factionscorps have a significant factor in the game and most certainly including pirate factions things like access to stations and their services
bumped as a reminder
the csm convinced ccp of the benefits of delaying the expansion for additional polishing and bugfixing and the miniexpansion which we get meantime is basically made up of csmrelayed featured is this going to be a roundtable or a party 
whats meant by microtransactions pay a dollar and get your cargohold filled with ammo pay a dollar and get a bonus million skillpointsi certainly hope thats not the casesigh i blame the wow sparklepony for this
if it is strippoker people will just lose to me because theyll be desperate to stop me taking off clothes thats an unfair advantage that i neither want nor need
ive noticed that theres an imbalance when you look at races in terms of ships using a specific weapon system caldari missile trained characters have very limited options when it comes to choosing a ship they want to fly lets take a look at some statsamarr  laser ships 1 assault ship 2 battlecruisers 3 battleships 2 cruisers 1 heavy assault shipminmatar  projectile ships 2 assault ships 2 battlecruisers 3 battleships typhoon mixed with missiles 2 cruisers rupture mixed with missiles 2 heavy assault shipscaldari  missile ships 1 assault ship 1 battlecruiser 1 battleship 1 cruiser 1 heavy assault shipthe similar situation is with gallente hybrid ships but gallente also use drones which you have to train no matter what race you fly plus you must have drone skills to fly any carrier in other words youll have drones trained no matter what race you flyfurthermore there is only one nonfaction pvp viable ship in any race that use cruise missiles  raven and only two that use torpedoes  typhoon and ravencaldari players that decide to specialize missiles as primary dps have a lot skills to train and too few ships to fly the only option is to crosstrain to minmatar where they need to have decent gunnery skills too if they want to be ready for pvp which requires too much timei would like to see csms opinion on thisthanks for your time
you fail to realize that your approach is a bit too theorethical here im afraid for starters the actual slots on a ship dont necessarily mean you will fit the module therethen theres ship bonusesfor example amarr afs can both mount lasers sure alas the vengeance get missile bonuses though why the hell would you mount unbonused lasers thus youd be better off with acssame with minmatar sure they got turret slots on both afs but also launcher slots ever heard of split high slots on minmatar shipsand that minmatar players have to train both missiles and projectiles due to the high slot allocation on many of their ships is totally negligible or what get a gripincessant caldari whine spotted
typical anticaldari whine detectedanyway assuming all weapon systems being equal but separate lol i would personally prefer a switch to the one main preferred weapon type for each race with a preferred secondary showing up on some ships but not in near a majority as the caldari presently have this would allow tweaking of the ships into more specialized roles especially for the missile ships which rely mostly on the attributes of the nonguided and guided missile systems themselves to play in different styles as opposed to the ships lending themselves to a specific style arguably the versatility of the missile boats is a bonus so its not so much a whine as what i would personally prefer stylewiseand if it comes across that way my opinion is not to say the off brand ships existing is a bad thing at all relying on one bag of tricks has never worked and all ships using one weapon type would be unrealisticsigned caldari missile specialist
well its not theoretical if you take into account that caldari have one missile battlescruiser and one missile battleship  two most common ships used for pvp even if you have high missile skills youre still stuck with drake and raven that makes game for caldari players monotonousyou got the point about afs i wasnt looking at the detailsyes i know about split high slots on minmatar ships mentioned rupture and typhoon in the op but if you train large projectiles you still at least have the choice between tempest and maelstrom until you get missiles trained amarr have the full set of battleships as dedicated laser boats even gallente have a short range and long range hybrid battleship variations with hyperion not being that usefull but still its better than nothing
crosstrain
what youre basically asking is to spread the raceship distinctions thin so that everyone gets what they want and homogenizes the ship pool to an extent that there are negligible differences between ships of the four empires theres a fine distinction between balance and flavour what you perceive as an imbalance describes a particular distaste for the flavour balance will never be achieved in any game but a dilution of flavour is sometimes made in the name of balance if that happens the long term game becomes blanderbeing limited to a few decent missile ship is fine for caldari i see no issues there expanding the ship options for missile specialists can only be done in 2 ways  introduction of new ships or radically changing the bonusesslot layout for minmatar and khanid ships the latter change is unacceptable as it amounts to a dilution of flavour aka caldari ships will no longer be unique in terms of effectiveness when using missile wepons youve got only one left
yes it is possible to crosstrain ive been in the process myself since despite having gripes about the status of the game i still do play it and make the decisions to help play it the way i want i never saw a disclaimer in the eve ads saying that balance was determined racewise by pve effectiveness vs pvp effectiveness and for such a dedicated amount of training time saying that its fine because you either got lucky with your choice had a friend tell you min or gtfopvp or what have you doesnt mean because the solution exists doesnt mean its a good solution assuming yes assuming that the game can never be balanced is never a reason to avoid attempting to do so if you can argue for the stat quo being more balanced than an option go ahead but given most lolposters have such a misguided view of what being balanced saying it cant be done is at best a loliwin statementanyway like i said the two weapon technique the caldari seem to have taken on is versatile if more demanding skill wise the issue is represented best to me by ships like the merlin the shield resist bonus is weapon neutral and awesome no argument there then you pair it with a bonus that by its very nature doesnt effect half of the weapons it can equip then theres the lack of modules that cross the missilegun barrier for improving effect and you get a ship that will never quite make up for that problem even if it makes a valiant efforttldr  crosstrain isnt an answer people forget that just because it is technically possible to learn all the skills the time spent in skills that are designed for the same purpose piloting  combat should have similar effect equal time in racial piloting  equal time in weaponry skills should equal at least a reasonably equivalent amount of effective ships you can fly for both pvp and pve
dominion touted so much but failed to deliver any but the most basic things ccp seems to get the major stuff out the door and never look back on any of their expansions all that little stuff that was cut and left on the dev room floor would have made dominion excelent if wishes were horses wed all be eating steak jane cobwell ccp keeps wishing but there aint any steak on our plates yet
im not a bitter vet but i can see that this will end badly
jw not sure if there were minutes published after csm1 summits such as we have now i did find this old dev blog of xhagens that summarizes results of the first csm summit looking over that blog and the associated comments thread you can see how much csm has evolved since thenin quite a lot of ways and how it hasnt at least in some players minds lol
not a bad listid probably remove 50 of the items to give the critical items which have been ignored for years more focus
bump
not supported suicide ganking is as valid a reason as legitimate pvp to lose a ship based on the idea of keeping this as a sandbox and should not be penalized any more than other ship loss
supportedit makes absolutely no sense at all that insurance policies should cover getting concorded
no
no hell no putting microtransactions in eve will ing destroy the game
ccp fix blaster range its been a huge problem for gallente pilots for years
no no no the problem is tracking not range up the tracking so that we can hit at the shorter distances we fight within extending the range would just make blaster even more like pulse lasers
it will blur weapon differenceblaster needsmore trackingoptimal  falloff is the shortest in the game why is it challenge to hit an appropriate target at native range small dps boostdps advantage should correspond with range disadvantage pulses shoot 85 of blaster dps at 300 blaster range  it is not fair comparing null vs scorch and barrage ammo difference is more insane small dps boost is needed to compensate approaching time where a blaster boat gets damage without counterattack more agility for gallente ships gallente boats tank armor  it means ships are penalized with speed and agilitygallente boats are blaster boats  it means they must approach as quick as possible at their tiny optimal rangebut these two sentences contradict to each other ok fastest ships are minmatar ships lets give some agility not speed to gallente boats to move fast linearly
make stations like t3s where you can choose which modules you want and thus altering the appearance i support this though instead of just changing the colour scheme small details should be added a kronos shoulndt just have a lighter hue of brown than the megathron it should have a bulkier hull and some stasis webifier extension

not letting this off the first page
omen is in desperate need of a buff you cant fit anything resembling a tank or solid dps on it at the same time its really unfair to newbie amarr players that if they want a solid t1 cruiser they need to train dronesewar early on for the arbi
supported omen is long overdue for some love
i agree i skipped the omen during my early life because of this issue
i loved the omen when i was a noob the only reason i changed to a maller was bacause i could not find what i wanted with the omen 
yesits about timemaybe even an annual purge every new yearsomething
to bring it back upi want ccp to remember about this proposal
i say a hearty no to any transactions used with plex beyond account affecting onesif ccp wants microtransactions of any type perferably only vanity if at all then let it be funded with isk and used as an isk sink something we need
this proposal is to cover the eventuality that they do introduce new mts to the game which going by their communication are guaranteed this doesnt mean that i condone them but if they are coming we do not want to see them just make anything and everything purchasable through what ever new mechanics they introduce to allow mtsthis proposal was written as a guide line that ccp should follow to ensure they dont do more damage than they already will when they introduce microtransactions
so let me get this straight if you pay x number of plex bought with real money for a ship it should never be destructible  if thats how microtransations work i will be rofling till the cows come home drop 100 on a insert bad ass shipfitment here and go hunt titans in my indestructible ship yea thats a great game mechanic thats like a duel were if one cowboy pays x amount of money the other guy is given a gun that has blanks in it if modules are also indestructible does that mean i can over heat foreverso what happens when me in my indestructible ship attempts to blow up your indestructible ship i would like to know do we just sit there shooting till we run out of ammo what are your thoughts on thisyou say that you want an edge over the other players you also go on to say that the other players are not that serious about the game im sure anyone that pays 15 a month for a game is serious about it thats 180 a year for a game what youre saying is that you want the ability to pay more then the other gamers to get an edge over them why would someone continue to play a game that they now have to spend hundreds or even thousands of real life currency to stay competitive thats on top of the 15 monthly fee theywe all ready play you lol about how he is trying to tell ccp how to run there company you need to step back and look at ccp as a company right now the only game ccp has out on the market is eve online if eve online does not make them enough money to pay there bills ccp will fail as a company and close its doors who is paying ccp the money they need to keep making there bills every month we do as paying customers for eve online we are keeping ccp open if ccp is thinking of rolling out a game mechanic in there only game that could potently make most of the player base quit said game i think hewe hashave every right as a paying customers to suggest to ccp what hewe thinks is a safe way of going about it kind of like letting ccp know that if you do it this way we might not quit your game because of it if mt is implemented the way you want them to be i hope you will have fun flying in empty space you wont have much to shoot at after that update edit added my support for this great set of guidelines they should act as safety hooks for the slippery slop we just walked out onto
yes there will still be a fair amount of clicking however i hope to lessen the clickfest and bring the industry process more inline with the amount of effort required to do other tasks like fitting a ship creating a contract etcim not sure i see what you do each of the checks you mention already happen and either succeed or fail gracefully the goal is to eliminate running these checks two five or ten times individually and only running them once as a whole think about how we can group turret slots in combat there is only one stack of guns for the server to calculate and think about lets treat industry jobs in a similar fashionthis would be great and i completely agree the only consideration is that almost every public industry slot would be occupied for much longer time periods and reducing the chances that slot can be turned over to another player however this option would be perfect on a pos as those industry slots are private by nature
i like it original post updated with the ideathanks for the feedback keep it coming this is already sounding better than when it started
1 in loving memory of all small reasonable yet gamechanging features youd expect in a polished finished game
hi guys if you really support this proposal we have a november 2010 prioritization crowdsourcing here is the wiki list  list and here is the the thread  thread and according to the wiki learning skills is at 113 enter a list of proposals that the csm should prioritize
not supported solution looking for a problem
how about giving freightersindies a percent increase of armorshield rep amount per level
failing at trolling and not realizing the tactical difference it makes to be able to prevent a portion of damage as opposed to having to apply a heal after it hits 2
additional failing note adding a stupid idea into another and then trailing of wiht your own degenerating idea does not show a high iq level this idea has nothing to do with damage reduction  simply damage redirection the ability to use your ship as a living sort of shield to protect another less ehp gifted ship
or you could just stop failing and use a blockade runnerjump freighter to get in with no need for an escort or use webs and ecm to clear tackle and web into warp or use tanked haulers especially deep space transports and logistics plus maybe a bit of ew to keep them alive there are plenty of options out there if you fail to use them a skirmish fleet should be able to take out your weak valueable haulers and then gtfo
no
nevermind all the rude replies you got i will try to be a bit constructive about ita mechanic like this would break the wardec system altogether one of the largest if not the largest reasons people wardecc each other is to be able to pvp in empire space offering a mechanic to bypass that would imho plainly make wardecs meaningless what would be the point of deccing if your target can only take up a collection from its members and it is only about 6 mil per skull in a 60 man corp which is nothing at all for most players and virtually kill the dec for a month i am sorry i see your point but this will not add anything of substance to the game
just give them lasers
its impossible to find any use for most caldari gunboats except eagle and rokh
i approve
my ferox wants a word with youbut it wants a small pg buff even more supported
i think most of these problems would be solved if rails didnt suck so hard but at the same time im a pretty much pure caldari pilot on one of my accounts and its a terrible problem that we have 1 missile battleship 1 missile battlecruiser 1 missile cruiser and however many frigates it is that use missiles and caldaris the missilecentric race and the hybrid ships that the caldari do have are pretty patheticedit forgot to click support the first time around
the real problem with caldari gunboats is that hybrids are easily the worst weapon systems in eveedit and lack of powergrid
pretty much this
towards 1  because they still sell in quantities and if they were totally broken they wouldnt take a look at market logs in jita eg apart from this rather simplistic answer bonuses and role is working as intended the main issue is really the general problem with hybrid weapons systems not the ships itself have to agree there with the goonie a couple posts priortowards 2  that may be your opinion alas before you can prove that all caldari gunboats are in fact bad and it is not more of a weapons system issue that is a nonargument apart from even a terrible ship adding variety just not the one you would prefer variety is by no means tied to quality or performance sorry think you got your semantics wrong theretowards 3  so all the sales of their hulls are solely for reprocessing and insurance fraud i dont think sotldr  terrible idea tweaking caldari gunboats to compensate for issues with hybrid guns best way to throw the whole balance even more out of the window how about you focus more energy on rebalancing hybrids instead
even if mediumlarge hybrids were super awesome most caldari gunboats would still be crippled and nearunfittable
this bad tracking bad dps uses cap uses ammo extremely onerous fitting requirement weapon system plus low grid ships  fail
i updated the first post with the two proposals so far feel free to comment on them etc etc
november 2010 prioritization crowdsourcing csm list contains lots of duplicate proposals and the votes are spread across different ids for the same issuesproposalsjust a few nonexhausting examples22  23 blackops improvements  blackops improvements part 2 same proposal  different csms51  52 drone implants  drone improvements40  154 corporation bookmarks  shared corporation bookmarksdear csm members imho you should do something to merge  bundle the duplicates so the votes are not being wasted
i think that directors ceos and fcs should be able to have a different color of chat in a given chat window appropriate to the task at hand ie such as fleet and corp channels etc
colored chat in the wrong place can lead to things like thissee what i did thur
totally supported id also like customizeable paint schemes for ships so i can have a hello kitty marauder paint job to go along with my pink chat lines
this also i would like to be able to set things so that your own text appears different to all other chat text but only on your client finally contact chat looks different from non contact chat
this thread is pretty funny considering players can already chat in colour no idea how it is done nor do i care but i have seen normal players do this many many times so im thinking its an exploitjust checked my convo logs and funny enough they showed nothing not supporting since whats the point you will only get morons typing in really  colours cough double dee cough
now that incursion testing is underway thanks to the latest patch and news that the proper expeansion will come out fully in january some thought should be taken into account of the test cycle so to speak of incarna since this will be one of the most major changes to eve online since its launch even though as ccp has said this will not change so much as the core eve gameplayas providing a more personal aspect into the gameccp has made no plans or annoucements reguarding testing for incarna but i just would like to be the first to propose since you are a bridge between the players and ccp to encourage ccp to make a longer test cycle of incarna then any previous addon to date even if the first test builds for sisi is buggythis would make the long term players have a better chance at providing real feedback and suggestions and as the latest email sent to players who have not been active in the past few months more effect could be made into making more players aware of the tests as i think there still may be a number of eve online players who do not yet realize that features of incursions are available to test now it just seems in my opinion that incarna will benefit the most from player testing and player feedback and i hope that you would recommend to ccp to bring incarna to sisi as soon as possible even if its in a half finished state at first just to give exposure to it and allow us to feel like we have input into it tooexpecally considering that some of us have been waiting to try it out since 2008 thanks
came expecting a thinly veiled attempt to delay incarna left pleasantly suprised
incarna has no interaction with the game beyond avatars and rp elements why does a graphical chat system require testing
i fully support this however the longest test period will only happen when it goes livepatch the patch anyone
well if things were perfect that would not be necessary because ccp did strenuous qa before deployment of each patchexpansion as we all know that is not exactly happening so yeah supporting this even if i wont put my hopes too high it will actually lead to anything i seriously hope that will not lead to being spammed about betatesting stuff i could care less about fine with me if people want to spend the playtime they paid for on sisi i dont care i would most likely start to care in a negative way if any kind of pressure or even regular spam to play unpaid qa for ccp would be applied ccp doesnt want to hire people to properly test new stuff and instead uses sisi for that  fine their calli dont want to be bothered with playtesting stuff i might not even be remotely interested in  leave me alone with that my call
yes
heynot true jump clones are realerreh
ive got to admit to being pleasantly surprised by that reply damn
i still dont see how you think a gauss gun is not hybrid just because its not a rail gun does not mean its not a hybrid its probably one of the closer associations to a hybridtype that the game has hot all hybrids need to be a rail gun they are hybrid because their charge group is in the ammunition and the energy is provided by the weapon not supported
the original purpose of plexes was to make buying time with isk easier for more people as they are right now they are like everything else in the game adn easily manipulated i really dont think you should be able to flip them because it artificially inflates the price and that means less players can use then thus affecting the playerbase and ccps bottome linemy proposal to fix this is to make a patch so that when a plex is sold it is automatically applied to your account this makes it forfill its intended purpose without screwing over peopel who have like 500 of them sitting in thier hanger this would be good for both the players that use them which was what was intended and ccp
basic economics proves your premise unsoundhigher price  more incentive for people to buy plex to sell for isk the more people who buy plex and want to sell it the lower the price will bealso this is eve pvp doesnt just involve shooting stuff
i have 4 accounts but only a single char in jitaany other hub i use that single char to buy 4 plexes and contract them out to my alts on other accounts your system would give me 4 months on 1 account rather then 1 month on each of my 4
it also defeats the primary purpose of the plex  providing game time for people who dont want tocant pay with real moneyif i can buy a plex i obviously dont need to use it purchase game time since the plex at least in usd is more expensive than just paying for my accountnext stupid idea
buy low sell highif you get your way then the market would be gone for making a profit in plex no
this is a really neat ideaas others have said if it has the caveat of being able to showhide on the overview then i fully support this
yes
im sure this has been proposed before but i am too lazy to find the threadi get tired of having to go to a pos to see how much fuel is in it what i am proposing is that there be a new feature implemented into the assets page of the corporation window that allows you to see the fuel levels in your corps poss that are up currently my corp has a few poss up all very far from eachother and that makes it hard to check the fuel levels on them efficiently it doesnt have to be anything fancy just the exact same page as what it shows in the pos management window at the actual tower should be something simple to do
yum
ive always thought local chat was detrimental to the true tactical potential of pvp in eve i think this would be a step in the right direction
you do know that the local channel is technicaly created by the gates as your ship contacts them when it enters system somethign along that lore the current argument that removing local is both good for pirates as well as carebears is a load of bull as it is a none pvp ships only defence is knowning 35 seconds before the hostile can get on grid that hes in system so unless your ok with giving the indys tank equal to or greater than there size counter parts noadditionaly the if you dont know that theres a cloaker in system it cant hurt you also fails as it adds another layer of security to cloaked ships as they dont show up on dscan and untill it hot drops a sc fleet on your head you wouldnt even know it entered system  over powered much
i had reservations supporting this because it gave sov holders a means of keeping local but after reading mchief117s response hes persuaded me to lend my support to this proposal
well even if they make roids colidable objects which i think they are the combat system will mean nothing solid or not will get in the way of shots regardless of where and when you move between those objectschanging the combat system so its a dynamic hit detection based will melt the ccp servers and prior to that induce sooo much lag that people will emoragequit right left and centre maybe one day in the future hmmmno what im talking about is planets moons and possibly just possibly gates and stations so when u enter warp and traverse through to your destination you dont noclip through objects long enough to notice that uve done soeven inducing an effect when u go through something would be enough bt god the whole moving through an object like youre in a 3d modeling program or nocliping on a fps game reeks of sloppy game design and an unfinished and unthought out game mechanic
empty quotin
anyone who considers themselves to be any better or smarter than the rest of the community because they have figured out blobs win this game are either bat insane or misguidedthe issue has and never will have anything to do with winning eveas a video game the priority off the developers and the community  irony to maintain a relatively fun environmentthe issue with large scale warefare is that the novelty of it wears of rapidly sure eve is unique in that how many other games give you an instance where 4000 other people are fighting the same battle but lets face it these battles are not playable and the influence of individual players on them is negligableim not saying nor is anyone else i believe saying remove blob warefare i think the stance people are and should be taking is yo lets not encourage blob warefare any more than it already is by human nature these make belief added bonuses to naping gigantic coalitions only make things far worse in day to day gameplay and when wars kick upand half of eve turns up to the same system to watch a loading screenas a game this should not be exclusively trying to mimic rl or provide insentives for people to waste their lives doing things they dispise see seiging towers etcit should promote an environment where individual players have a real and substantial influence on the game preferably more regularly than they do now it should also promote a style of play that the servers will be able to handle and sustain with growthabove all it should promote a style of play which is funedit clinging to a model of this game that is inherently not fun because you think you have figured out something that everyone else is yet to is pretty silly because you are assuming everyone is satisfied being bored out of their minds so long as they are winning
thread cleaned of some offtopic posts and replies to trolls please remain on topic
folks can of course check eve search ah wellheres a bit of a refresher howeveryet again minigin is trying to pretend that tens of thousands of people have no idea that theyre not really having fun but he knows and that the game theyve been enjoying all this time isnt something that theyre actually enjoying evidently tens of thousands of people participate in blob warfare because they cant be trusted to make up their own minds as to what they enjoy or how they should play the game as arguments against blobbing go the i can read your thoughts and youre not really enjoying what you think youre enjoying argument is shall we say unpersuasive the standard troll response at this point is that anybody anywhere has said that lagnot loading gridserver weirdness is fun its a pretty good sign that your entire argument is completely bankrupt when youre reduced to arguing that youre doing all this for other peoples benefits who dont want your help or agree with you that you know better than them what they enjoy and more importantly that your quest for ccp to alter how they are allowed to play the game is more valid than their simple ability to join largescale combats or refuse to and only engage in smallscale combats trying to rewrite reality is likewise not a valid argument against blob warfare it is telling that minigins argument against blobs already based on telling tens of thousands of people how they really want to be playing if they stop listening to what they think they want and listen to what mini says they want people now have to ignore that there are actual bonuses to having a larger team while the make belief bonuses like mutual defense and coordinated attack simply dont exist screaming in all caps makes an argument gooodof course its almost like this is a game where a mass of multipleplayers gather online and those who want to accomplish great things on their own must whod a thunk it actually accomplish them of course rather than going down the ghsc path or the haargoth path or being a really great fc maybe we should all be hoping that ccp will alter the game to help usthen again i heard that in the near future some game developers are going to create some games that actually dont require a mass of multiple people to play them and not even an internet connect i think these may be called single player games in which an individual player not only has an impact but theyre the sole driving force and they dont have to worry about not being significant despite them not doing anything thats significantperhaps when these single player games come out some people will no longer require the games with a mass of multipleplayers who are online to let them have substantial influence even if they havent figured out how to influence anything substantiallywe can only wonder there is a fundamental problem when someones entire argument is based on mindreading a denial of reality and a claim that ccp should directly intervene in order to protect people who want to be able to achieve something in eve without actually being able to achieve anything on their own the idea that blob warfare remember a contentfree snarl word has to be dealt with so that people who cannot achieve anything noteworthy as individuals can feel like theyre impacting the game world simply misses the point if you want to be able to impact the game world you have to be able to impact the game world asking ccp to help you is an absurdity if folks want individual impact and theyre unable to impact the game as individuals its not ccps fault let alone groups cooperating
let me ask you two questions first of which the answers i already know then i will butcher the consistant and ridiculous thought pattern you have been using to seek to not defend your own view or galvanize this game into a better one  which should be why you are posting on this forum  but instead to protect your own agenda1 do you have any significant impact on the game you play would your coalition be any different at all without you2 what do you have fun doing in this game aside from mistaken feelings of pridethe problem with your reasoning finnagain is and always has been that you jump to conclusions far to quickly and seek to use invalid conclusions to support your agenda in threads gone past your entire argument has been hinged on other people trolling you being crybabbies to ccp or having serious mental illnesses now these all may have negative connotations to you but none of these actually disprove a well reasoned argument simply restating them over and over will never change thatin this post you follow some of your previous processes a mistake many people on the internet make they believe the use of caps is screaming i wonder if you really are that convinsed that whenever someone types in caps they are sitting at their computer with veins popping at their heads yelling at you surely this could not just be emphasis of an important point you then seek to use your invalid conclusion of this to spin negative connotations again not to do any real debate  just to discreditps if i had a dollar of every time you said yet again before leading into something i have explained about a dozen times and you keep using the same ridiculous argument for i would have almost 50 bucks by nowone more time for the boat man i spose i know you arnt having fun because i have been you that is to say i have been in the nc and i still have alts in the nc so i hear you when you are complaining about the game i hear you when you talk  about ccp i hear you threaten to quit the game if things dont improveto me it sounds like you guys are having loads of fun so when i come here and say yo this isnt fun and am met but such fierce resistance that you are i can totally understand whypss the fact that your only real examples of changing the game are through what has been heralded by popular thought as the most ed game mechanic in existance insta disband of alliances at directors hands makes me more worried that you really do want the game to be at a stage where the only changes can occur via such ridiculous means
its funny that you keep hammering on the point that what youre doing must be fun because it seems to me like youre trying to imply that everything else isnt so silly of me but if that were true then something would be wrong also whatevermy main argument against gigantic blobhugs like the one that kept iron afloat for about 6 months too long is that when you blue up everyone for 100 jumps you arent playing the game youre having a gentlemans agreement not to youre sitting in your little outposts in vale and tribute and tenal and whatever and youre sipping your tea adjusting your top hat and telling all your friends how much fun youre having  90 of the time  because there isnt a fleet going on and theres a hostile roaming gang outside your outpost you two are too busy bleating about how much fun fleet warfare is when youre forgetting the obvious reverse which is when you only feel safe leaving home with 600 of your buddies how often do you undock at all
btw the fact that so many of the csms got elected on promisses of looking into blob warefare coalition issuessov issues i think its fair to say that this isnt a problem that a meer handfull of people are havingthe real question i am here to ask isnt if this is a problem because it clearly is but how csm plans to address this issue or if they simply plan to let ccp ignore them and the playerbase that elected them
ill bitemethodology1 have you made any effort to aggregate accounts at the player level2 have you made any effort to distinguish between mains and alts3 have you made any effort to incorporate 1 and 2 into your stats example do you really think 11000 toons fly kestrels as a combat ship no 10980 of those are cyno alts how many of those 11000 have cyno field theory trained how many have their kestrel fit with a cyno lighter and ozone in the holdi imagine youve made some effort in this regard for marketingcustomer retentionsubscriber acquisition but you could put a lot more meat on the bones of your stats if you could break out alts and secondthird accounts you may have 300000 subscriptions but you dont have 300000 subscribers4 given significant academic interest in virtual worlds have you engaged in discussions with economics research departments at major universities ideally with an eye towards enabling some sort of research projectslastly not to be a jerk about it but i cant help but wonder5 of the 10 people on the researchstats team how many play the game read log in 23x per week and actually do stuffbotsmacros1 how many accounts are logged in for 15 hours a day 18 202 how many toons have  80 standing with these agents of those how many have  5 million sp 3 million how many overlap with 13 what are the nullsec systems with the highest andor most consistent bounty production ore production4 how many accounts per month are banned for bottingmacroing im not the first person in this thread to ask it because the general suspicion is not many at allgameplay data1 ships produced and destroyed complete list destroyed by playersrats2 modules and rigs as 13 or perhaps most common fits i dont need you guys to run a query to tell me that the most common fit is going to be a drake with t2 sprs and a bcs or two whats the most common arazu fit muninn i suspect there is a modal fit for higherskilled shipsanyways this is all i can think of for now
the trouble is you get statistical outliers like cyno alts and scout alts distorting the figures
this
i would like to knowhow many player starting to play with trial account per monthand how many of them deciding to pay and playhow many player paying with plex
more like wasting a plex to do an additional stat remapat least thats what ccp was planingbtw regarding not able to tell stuff about the accepted proposals by nda if i understand you correctly ccp censors the stuff the csm can tell the players by gagordering them when they dislike what it would bewhich kind of embarassing stuff would come out if they wouldnt
hybrid guns balance csmfix blasters csmhybrid guns balance csm meetingblasters 20maybe take a look at blastersjust saying i know its not what your looking for but i cant make it the roundtable meeting to bring this up if you guys would come up with a solution for this big problem that keeps being brought up i would very happy saying us blaster boat pilots to learn another weapon type is not a solution like what the meeting minutes sugest sorry but we expect more then that the blaster 20 thread has 20 pages of ideas that would go along way to making blastershybrids weapons better is it right that pluse lasers get 85 the damage but with 300 more range yes they have worse tracking but they have longer ranges thus not needing as much tracking just take a look most people arent looking for more range there asking for more tracking here is a quote from blasters 20 thread page 20 that gives a good example of what people are saying in the thread and what there asking for is it asking too much that this get brought up to ccp again this effects many players of eve and needs to be looked at now this needs to be kept in the spot light so that ccp knows that they need to look at this this effects half of the races in eve its not a small problem its effecting 1000s of players in game please spend some time on this i would really like to see ccp gets this fixed by the summer expansion this should have been fixed a long time ago on a side notethank you csm for your hard work on getting microtransactions either out of the game for good or for cosmetics only thats some bs that needs to be primaryed and killed
no ccp generally only imposes nda for features which havent been announced stuff that could be considered advantageous to competitors if it was public knowledge proprietary corporate data such as future plans or financial or legal data and most of the time advance disclosure about which csm backlogged items are being worked on for a given patch the latter is typically due to wanting to avoid player disappointment if a particular item doesnt make it in since many factors impact the ability to achieve development goals i am not in favor of this approach regarding status of csm backlogged items being worked i think players should be told whats in the pipeline because i think they are smart enough to realize that saying that is not a promise but a planccp does not otherwise attempt to gag us from telling players things which would make ccp uncomfortable if that were true the june minutes or for that matter the october minutes blog posts tweets and forum posts from myself teadaze and a few others would not be nearly as critical or cuttingly analytical as some of them have been
maybe you can remind them of the multiple threads in the assembly hall on microtransactions and get everyone to place their votes during your round table there are over 1000 replies with peoples viewsno plex for remapmicrotransactions  yes no cosmetic onlyalsoguidelines for ccp to follow to not break the game even more after introducing mtscerbus
umm how exactly is this a feature you bridge in a bunch of recons covert t3s and bombers to do what exactly take down the cyno jammer thats not going to happen cuz if you could beat the defenders with recons you could just bullrush it with bss which would be cheaper and kill the jammer faster the whole jammercov cyno thing is kinda pointless when the ships you bridge in cant really do anything of consequence so yes it is an ignorable featurein further commentary on your points about the bo jumping fuel and balance you are forgetting the fact that bos have an atrociously poor jump range it is truly terribad that is drawback that balances out its incredible ability of a subcap able to bridge and use both cynos and gates having to have a hauler tag along is just too much its yet another anchor around the neck of bos they shouldnt have to deal with that the crap range is bad enough dont get me wrong id love to see dreads and carriers need fuel ships too but then id also like to see logistics be difficult again and i think jump freighters were a terrible idea but that is never gonna happen so at least make it equal and remove logistics hell from bos
sure it is each race has a combat profile for their ships and that varies by race and by their ships if you can fly all the ships in the game you can choose what ships you want for what situation there are going to be some ships that are crap thats just the way the game works
of course that im crosstrained and i will continue to crosstrain to other races thats not the issue to eve junkie like myself however newish players that get into the game through pve mostly choose caldari missile ships if you are new to the game and have missiles as primary dps when you get into pvp youll soon see that your possibilities are very limited and that you are basically stuck with drakeraven combination for at least couple of months that could be discouraging for new playersdont get me wrong drake and raven are relatively good in what they do but as a dedicated missile pilot you are still stuck most of the time at looking at a drake or raven when you undock to get a fight having 2 or 3 fits that are remotely viable and in drakes case no possibility of active tanking like in every other race simply said you dont have choices like other races dothanks for the responses so far positive and negative
ill just comment on the above paragraph specifically the statement a game can never be balanced does not imply leaving out the balancing exercise nor does it imply that something is impossible to do what it implies is that as soon as you balance something another imbalance pops out as players adapt to the new play rule and unexpected loopholes form take a look at the eve mineral basket t3 salvage and t2 moongoo scene it clearly demonstrates the bottleneck effect no matter what sort of balance you apply to it in the t2 scene with technetium replacing dysprosiumpromethium you will soon realize that it is a never ending chore as such balance hammer should be always be wielded cautiously and should only be applied to to things that are noticeably out of whack or seriously out of whack  instead of trying to fulfill every noobs insignificant whim out therei leave you an exercise take the case of the dramiel and drake which many forum posts have been making noises lately figure out which ones the result of a balance exercise and which ones is the result of responding to changing tactics
for the misunderstanding when you say something can never happen it is saying its impossible to me call me an idealist but statements with such a finality and reeking of defeatism tick me off and if you didnt mean that then take it as an overreaction on my endfor the exercise  it comes off as patronizing for future reference but ill bite anyway i dont know the history of changes completely so i wont say im an expert on the specific matter if i had to take a random guess the dramiel would be the balance change and the drake the tactics change primarily due to the drake fleets being relatively new and the dram being lauded since when i first began playing
soseriously so what if some new players get discouraged and have to skill for something else as you point out caldari are the princes of pve which is well and good and why many new players skill up along that path but its not that long to get into another race either iirc its about a month to get into a perfectly decent t1 fit apoc and times are somewhat similar to get into other ship types as well to say nothing of how the whole but new players might not like it meme misses the point if people cant handle making choices and differing skill paths and so on eve isnt the game for them sure when i first got into eve i was also pretty disappointed to learn that it would take years to skill into a titan and even then id probably never afford one i was also pretty disappointed to learn that all the best mods cost more than i was grinding in an entire year of pve should i then have been given an officer fit titanobviously a bit of disappointment is naturalcaracal is a decent throwaway cruiser crow is a pretty nifty interceptor as far as ceptors go ferox isnt bonused for it but in the days before they added the drake most folks skilled for caldari flew it before they got to battleships and so on to say nothing of the fact that active tanking a pvp ship is rarely a good idea anywaysif someone likes the game and wants to expand outward from missile boats they can do so pretty easily its not like the strange people who roleplay caldari and refuse to fly any other hull
dont get me wrong i see where you are coming from op i just dont really see the great merit in your argument unless you want to head towards a direction where basically each race got the same ships only differing in names and graphics effects for their weapons and that with all due respect sounds boring as  i am more than willing though to trade the amarr pilgrim for the caldari falcon and the armageddon for the scorpion likewise to help the caldari with gun issues and just for the record  as a nub i used to fit on both maller and prophecy projectile guns because it works in fact better that way than with lasers so similar issue there as with the afs just to illustrate the point that not the poor caldari are the only ones with ship issues theorethical fitting options do not automatcally correspond to what you do in game same as with my points about afs in my last posti steadfastly believe furthermore that your point about the handicapped training for caldari due to is not quite right sure if you factor in the training for all available caldari ships on a high level plus crosstraining that might look that way but the other races got similar issues for example the whole bunch of missile support skills for the few missile boats amarr have the general issue that as minmatar you have to train both shield and armortanking missiles projectiles and drones well and i could name even more tbheven if at first glance it might look like an overbearing burden to you unless you can back that claim up with a bunch of conclusive numbers i dont buy it looks to me more like working as intended of course if a ccp dev wants to chime in and contradict me by stating that in fact caldari ships are totally broken
thank you for your responses and critique this constructive argument helped me to see something i havent until now as my original idea was not to complain but to see why your input is valuableofc any further input or point of view from someone else is appreciated
i have a great idea to combat suicide ganks without any of the changes suggested being implementedcreate a cargo scan jammer one simple active high slot module that will keep those looking to snoop out of your business if a potential ganker scans your ship and gets jammed it means 1 of 2 things either youre carrying something valuable and you want it kept secret or you are luring them into a potential gank mistakethe gankers keep saying that high sec isnt safe and there should be risk for reward well here is theirs if you find a ship with an active jammer take a shotyou may get lucky or you may get taken fair is fair
id just get rid of insurance completelypersonally i see no need for it if you lose your ship and you cant afford to replace it then you shouldnt of been flying it in the first place
thisthe massive influx of free isk from insurance makes ships more expensive for everyonegive noobs free insurance for there frst 3 months in game to hold there hand a bitafter that your on your own
not sure why people killed by concorde ever got insurance payouts its like me crashing my car into a shop front stealing all the contents of the shop then while im doing this my insurance company is putting the cash into my account so i can then go buy a getaway car how stupid is that
exactlysupported
i like my idea better than insurance nerfsthen again i also like sushi
no
no a subscription model plus microtransactions thats a little to ham fisted in my opinion
no
no
amazing that a 21 page thread isnt on the csm list
teadaze is bringing it up for the csm now that they have gotten rockets some attention but it will be part and parcel of a larger hybrids fix
supported
it is obvious that dramiel is overpowered frigate which has an unique position in frigsize ratingdramiel has a very wide range of targets and has good ability to escape from a battle this ship has a good damage and also has a chance in many cases to leave the closefight and escape it would be logical to cut the dramiel speed in 1015 dramiel faster than the fastest interceptors while still having good fitting solutions has good dps like assauls ships imho it is to much for one ship
oh  someone has some balls you are going to get flamededit but you are right look at the cynabalvagabond almost the same speed so therefore shouldnt the jagdaredevil be close to the same speed i think so i support this nother edit i ment to say dramiel not daredevil
the dramiel is hilariously overpowerededit fix some of the currently underpowered faction ship while were there
yeah i agree the dramiel is overpowered and it has really hurt frigate pvp in a lot of areas the main reasons for this i think is it has the best slot layout it can easily fit a dual prop setup with a medium shield extender giving it almost twice the ehp of a standard dcii taranis while also going twice as fast similar dps with much better ranges kiting ability and ability to leave twice as agile and capless weapons as well as a healthy portion of its dps in drones which work at 60km and dont rely on the dramiels tracking it is very similar to a taranis while having none of the ranis weaknesses and it is very difficult to kill a dramiel bearing in mind you need to be able to stop it from leaving while at the same time being able to actually kill it which is something which seems limited to bait fit abscramweb afs like the ishkur or jaguar and such ships die to a counterfit dramiel with lr disruptor anywayin my opinion it needs to have the drone bay nerfed or needs to have the slot layout changed so it cannot easily fit dual prop and mse
not supported dont nerf the dramiel buff the frigates that need buffing if you nerf the dramiel you nerf the jaguar because my jag will kill a dram any day buff the hawk and the rest of the garbage
if you nerf the dramiel you nerf the jaguar because my jag will kill a dram any day you are a  a dramiel would own any jag anyday and if it couldnt it would just fly away
wormcruor and the subbucus all have lol dps and speed when compared to a dramiel
funny my corp mate took out a dramiel with an ishkur funnier is i used my curse in a mock battle with my corp and made a dramiel no better than a bantam ps curse is win
think it must be 20strip claw with mwd 4000msstrip dramiel with mwd 5000ms
an ishkur or a jaguar can kill a dramiel with an abscramweb fit as i mentioned above assuming the dramiel is in the breadbutter dual prop fit if the dramiel has abscramwebmse he is able to run although has to do it a bit earlier than he otherwise would however it doesnt mean the dramiel is not overpowered the fact that it can go toe to toe with assault ships while also being faster and more agile than interceptors with more escape options is what makes it overpoweredalso claiming that your curse shuts one down is irrelevent as a curse equally shuts down every other frigate in the game and additionally is not related to the dramiel since it is not a frigate and therefore not really an argument to this proposal
lol

so still no mention of rails or blasters despite there being a csm wiki page for them and there being 2 or 3 quite large threads for them in the assembly hallhow come they are not mentionedwhat is the justification for leaving them out againedit spelling
if the csm wiki page is an inprocess proposal point me to it that i have missed ill add it but this prioritization is limited to items that have gone through the full csm processon a personal note as a gallente cheeseeater im all for another look at hybrids

daenna chrysi40565782114124125201a possible solution to 82 for fighters with pos an array that can control 2 fighters at one time to prevent over use the array should use both power grid and cpu large tower should be able to have max 5 such arrays for medium towers array that can control 1 fighter at one time small towers would get an array that can control 2 combat drones at one time one array should have enough room for the ones in use and extra 10 in large 5 in medium and 10 in small

afk indicator a good idea despite the cons you could possibly make it so that the indicator is seen based on standingsaggression timer increase for caps good idea you could possibly make time of aggression based on ship sizealliances should be allowed in faction war however the alliance should determine which faction its member corps will join from an alliance level corps in an alliance should not be allowed to choose militia status but the alliance should be responsible to choose on behalf of their member corpsautopilot settings for faction war is dumb if you are in fw and autopilot anywhere in eve you deserve to dieactivating self destruct should only generate a km for parties involved nothing more no effect on combat performance or whatevercovert cynos should be immune to cyno jammers it is covert after all black ops jump range should be increasedcurrent bounty hunting system is redundant bounties should be collected based on ship kill not pod kill just like with npcs they should be also converted to bounty contracts that people can accept and complete this will create a real bounty hunter profession in eveill return to this later when i have a bit more time

and how fast are they compared to each other can the omen with its armor tanking mods get inside of its range and stay there or can the caracal kite it with impunity im purely an amarr pilot so i dont know the answer to this question i do know however that when i was first able to fly an omen for pve fitting it usefully was so difficult that i got into a mining ship and mined for enough money to change to a maller instead and 3 rcus with a very light omnitank for resists and one plate makes for a deceptive ehp just use anything but em and youll be doing very close to full damage against it
jesus how many times does a single person have to disagree with a point in a single thread we get it man you think the omen is perfect and needs no changes whatsoever
supported
also any pilot that been biomassed unless that happens already
heh i did ask this few times and ccp always gave we want to keep our all players history so cant do thatttttand i understand like this  ppfff dont bother us with these things u know wer lazzzyyyyy1
purging characters that are over 3 years old and have never had a paid subscription would be a great thing for cleaning up character names and even saving ccp some database space it would be nice to see how many accounts would be effected by the purge and what benefits it might give to ccp at the least
good idea
do want i heard they were removed because they were causing server side lag which was frankly the most baffling thing ive ever heardbring them back please long trails was the main reason i trained up interceptors before anything else
do it
supported and bump
a cruiser sized version of the phoenix hull would be ubernot identical but that sort of shapesolid looking
not supported i fcking hate the moa hull but if they were to change that they would have to change almost every other ship in game i dont know who designed their ships they are probably brain dead
supported  yes they should have to change every other  hull out there the scorpion got fixed so should the moa and uh what else how about the freaking bellicose like please make the ships look cooleditsome ships look cool to me like the stabber but still have ed engines in weird places ccp should also take off the big engines on the side of everything like wtf
there are worse hulls and the moa is kind of uniquethe moros on the other hand
personal hangars the whole point of this is privacy it will create a better hierarchy system and create a better system of control and power i wouldnt assume any problems would rise
o fellow lemmings and capsuleerswith the upcoming expansion i fear we will get our tiny butts kicked by the sansha in high secso far concord has barely helped us out in sansha related incursions and we even got betrayed at least once by a concord pilot sutola endomawhere she became a slave too nation slave endoma01even the empires have yet too formulated a coUFFFDrdinated response like they once did in the good old days eve chronicles  sanshas nationthe least they can do is help us capsuleers deal with this upcoming threat with some political support and adress the ban of capitals like carriers and dreadnaughts by concord gm grimmi i believesince political will is tight into day by day issues it will not be strange that the populace of new eden will cry out for more protection once sansha start hitting harder and the empires response is a bare minimumalready we see that political pressure toward concord has made it possible that a few capital ships are allowed too remain in high security spacehail cribba hugsso when concord assembly hall policy is clearly influenced by the empires political will i wonder if its just a matter of time untill we see more capitals in high sec pretty plz ccpi understand we need too discuss pros and cons for this proposal and i figure these have already been talked about in the past but plz feel free too run through them againbut for heaven sakes think of the children ppl they need protection from the monsters that is allalpha 1
nice reasoningalso i dont understand why capitals are still banned from hisec since concord frgates have doomsdays and instanewts also ecmi would like to hear cons of capitals in hisec since i cant figure out any real problems with that
nice try very nice try actuallyyou want capitals back in highsec because of the rp element and pvewell capitals were removed from highsec for a reason no need to go back in time
nice reasoning indeed dbut you missed the fact that you cant go into incursion sites with cap ships 3 on top of that incursion systems are all cyno jammed 3
why were they reoved from highsec
veldspar protection act of yc 107
and what is that
id love to see some capitals back in high sec myself if for no other reason than just because it would certainly make high sec wars more fun and capital ships more numerous i imagine they were worried about capital ship mining abuse by macros eh
they were removed because carriers were like freighters are nowand inb4 highsec wars are cap blobs
i want capitals to camp jita 44 237 as well if only for the epic whines to be had
sub capitals are allowed in high sec what do you think battleships are
someone undocked a carrier with some 10000 shuttles in the ship bay from 44 and jettisonned them all the node didnt like that
i am guessing their account didnt like it much either
make all of highsec 00 issue solved
ever wanted to mine for several hours straight without having to touch your computer well so do many of the people who want capital ships allowed back in highsec
fixed
although i have no personal beef with learnings and i understand why they were put in so newer players to train to use stuff faster right maybe i am wrong i have to agree that this would be the best measure for all of eveno new players do not have to sit and train learnings for 2 weeks  a month to get things done however it would benefit themanyone ive tried to introduce to this game ive had them make their character a month in advance and then train learnings to 54 before starting starting p
why remove them make them unavailable to any toon that is younger than x amount of skill pointsthe argument that new toons skill this for month 1 to month 6 is solvedthey are only available after a toon gets up to  example 15 million skill points new players are forced to play as if they are unavailable you play long enough you have additional skills you suddently canhave requirements forremoving them  not supported
this is ridiculous are you even aware of how long getting to 15 million skill points would take without learningstraining anything takes way too long which is why people feel forced to pick up the learnings in the first place they should be removed and skill training times brought down across the board number one reason i hear of people quitting who just started is training nothing for a couple weeks in order to train anything at not snail speed is edand for the trolls spewing the eve is supossed to be hard lulz garbage it should be hard to play not a test of endurance of who quits because of not being able to fly anything first the way things are it is very difficult for a new player to enjoy the game and older players have an unsumournable advantagethis is ed and terrible design if ccp ever wants to get more players and make eve a more successful gameget rid of this terrible design asap please
no micropayment no plex for anything
no
clearly sarcasm is lost on you ill put it plainly 1 create a fleet with six ships in each squad 2 put each of the other ships in the squad in your watch list3 when one member of your watch list becomes primary but your defensive bubble on it absorbing 100 of all directed damage use logis to repair and repeat until dt have food and drink delivered and tie a bladder bag to your leg because unless you self destruct or are met with a significantly larger fleet this will take a while
professor screweyes heres an alternate scenarioi fly my falcon which is fitted for maximum ecm power eschewing any pretence of tanking its all ecm and hypnos boosters with something like 2k ehpmy 4 friends flying with me pilot heavily plated dominixes with this damage redirection module their dominixes each have in the order of 60k ehpwe get into combat my friends activate their damage redirection module on my falcon in order to blow my falcon up the enemy will have to do 240k damageas opposed to your scenario where no matter how many ehp my friends could restore to my ship every second the enemy would only need to deal 2k damage in one salvo to blow up my falconthis singlesalvo damage is often referred to in pvp circles as alpha strike or alpha for short there is a very real difference between tanking versus dps or tanking versus alpha you must realise that a damage redirection module is not in any way shape or form equivalent to a remote repperanother application of a damage redirection module would be rr smartbombing bs fleets with logistics support the battleships cluster in close together the rr orbit them tightly and the bs activate the damage redirection module on their assigned logistics ship so now not only do your attacks against the logistics craft get mitigated by the crafts speed and signature you also have to chew through the vastly superior ehp of a plated battleship with your mitigated dps in order to destroy that logistics vesselusing a module such as this to simulate the effects of line of sight is  to my thinking  an acceptable compromise except when it comes to having multiple ships redirecting damage from one target if it was implemented this damage redirection module would have to act like a tractor beam  only one should be allowed to be active per targetin the meantime option 2 appeals to me somewhat though id prefer such a bubble to cloak all ships inside it in the same way as a prototype cloaking device does as opposed to a covert ops cloaking device ships inside the bubble would be able to target enemies but doing so would decloak that ship yes i love the arbitrator in starcraft of course id much prefer option 1 was replaced by actual lineofsight firing rules due to the opportunity to explore creative formations as part of space combat tactics
i like the second option
so what happens when i use my two nyxes and three aeons to guard my supertanked hicitt virtually every unimplementable andor stupid idea imaginable regarding fleet mechanics
it would be like a hic only 1 type of ship can use itsay t2 bc and with a bubble around itany ship inside the bubble will be unable to target anythingthe ship making the bubble can not get rrso if you escort an industrial you can get the industrial in warp inside the bubble but the bubble is useless in big fleet battles
for escorting freighters bring plenty of rrescorting dst and indis  make them fit cloaksif you run into a camp cloak the indis and have your excort fleet dispatch teh attackers
not the whole corporation just the one character that uses the plex
alright thanks for clearing that up however that still makes things too complicated what if for example two corps at war square off in empire space and some pilots on either side have the protection you are suggesting does that mean that if anyone in the opposing corp takes any action against such a pilot they will get concorded while at the same time the pilot that has the protection is free to fire away at the wartargets if you want it to work then you should make it work both ways iow having this protection simply places you outside the wardec you will yourself get concorded for attacking your wartargets otherwise i can see this getting horribly overpowered as plexprotected gangs can roam around looking for wartargets and be more or less completely immune to them it will simply be too powerful in my opinioni still believe you have a point but that this is not the way to go about it an alternative idea could be to somehow use isk in order to buy immunity to locator agents during a wardec although it is arguable if not even that might break it somewhati think that it is better to leave wardeccs as they are the only thing i would like to see personally changed is the price tag  i would not object to the price for all kinds of decs being multiplied by quite a large margin look at thisraise wardec prices
i really dont want a micro transaction that makes it more difficult to kill someoneperhaps instead use the concord lp points that you will be able to get from doing incursions
no
yes many caldari gunboats need more powergridi dont know if caldari railboats really need more turrets or dronebay they are obviously designed for snipingim fine with the fact that caldari railboats do less damage at point blank then other races ships but they should deal competetive damage at typical fleet rangesfor example the rokh should reach 170 km with cn thorium with a sniper fit to compete damage wise with t2 ammo of other races damage bonused shipsso yes pls more range for caldari t1 and a different secondary bonus for caldari t2a plain buff to railguns will probably make gallente ships more interesting but certainly not caldari railboats
no not supported1 we need to rebalance hybirds as a hole first before you work on ships2 stop crying about pg on shield ships you get higher cpu lower pg armor ships get higher pg lower cpu thats the way it is

it seems nobody is interested that the votes are being spread across mutiple duplicating issuesone example again22 black improvements csm  currently 17 votes as of 20101115 1556 eve time23 black improvements part 2 csm  currently 23 votes as of 20101115 1556 eve timeboth articles suggest similaroverlapping changes to address one and the same issue black ops are not popular not useful have no meaningful roleif you combine the votes for 22 and 23 the black ops imrovement issue could easily turn out to be the top votesome people have read 22 some have read 23  i doubt that anyone have read all 203 proposalswhats the point of the voting if the list is full of duplicates  overlapsi still have a lot of respect towards csm and csm5 in particular but this twisted voting process worries me
errrfix it nao
id also like to point out that 49 docking games fix csm and 9 aggression timer problems csm are also both similar and overlapping proposals which suggest fixes to neutral logistics and dockingundocking games
i am tempted to release the current vote ranking as ive created a small app to calculate the votes i am pretty shure csm has similar appas of nov 15 2010 2130 eve time 16 assault frigates 4th bonus csm it the top vote but16 assault frigates 4th bonus csm has 118 votes with total of 23653 points rounding each iteration to 2nd digit22 black ops improvements part 2 csm has 81 votes with total of 16046 points rounding each iteration to 2nd digit23 black ops improvements csm has 58 votes with total of 10223 points rounding each iteration to 2nd digityou could do the math but 22  23 combined have 199 votes with total of 23876 points so this should be the top vote but it is not
not supportedall we wil get is colored spami will in a blink support the folowingif someone is not as lazy as me and posts this as a new proposal
not supported on the grounds of oh christ fck my eyes
supported only if coloured chat is only in corporation or private channelsi dont want to see people pretending to be isd members in public channels neither do i want to have my eyes made to bleed by double dee posting in red in chat i am reading
not supported because of the rainbowtext
thread in generalwas told to post here about the transparency we were promised yet denied we demand a dev blog about ccps unethical treatment and business practices from internal affairs via a dev blog
u mad
i have run idea past the ideas forum in this thread i think it has gathered some feedback to be posted under csm proposalsin the nutshell i think eve size has become too small and would benefit from increased amount of space both in 00 wormhole and core systems empire spacethank you for attention
size isnt your problem density iswithin any particular system and its hundreds of cubic au theres only a few grids worth paying any attention to everything else is just dead and empty or at best is a public bookmark to warp togive systems more weight more things for us to do inside them and your issue largely goes away
require an account password to be changed every 30 days from date of account creation deny login until password has been changedan interview with jared psigoda a well known goldfarmerrmt broker in which he states this would stop most accounts being hacked
very not supported this would make the game too annoying to play i already have ten random passwords like that for school dont wanna deal with that for my spare timealso i would think the issue of people not being able to get in their account would be a bigger problem for csm and their customer support too
or just dont be stupid about your passwordsorry but my pw for eve is a randomized string of 16 lettersnumbers i dont want to relearn it every single friggin month
hoe about we change rl so we cant do that omg there should an assembly hall in rl my proposals right thereedit and yeah kamikaze frigs xd
i support all things that run along the line of capital car bomb also seriously ccp make a module in game that does what that bs just did to drop the titan and support fleet
yes yes yes yes do want then i can just fly a super cap into the enemy capital staging station and killing a few hunderd caps and thousands of ships and modules in one blow with only the build cost of the super cap as a loss wich is low
wow i never even noticed that tiny little thing lmao
yes please
ccp will probably do something literally ed to enforce the use of incarna for things currently done within the existing eve client its too easy a solution to the problem of not having any compelling gameplay ideas well find out in a few months if my doommongering is justified
i have to agre with tea after seeing the beat them with a stick for invations you will probly have to got to market hubs inside stations or go see your agents in person now or something lolz
hope notcsm was adamant that lame crap like that made no sense dont agents have phones after all we should be able to call them from our podsit is 20000 years in the future right and should be specifically be avoided forcing players to do anything in station that they could previously do in their ships will do nothing but  off everyone who has zero interest in incarna and no plans to ever step foot in a station that is probably more players than ccp thinksconsidering that after four years of putting resources on incarna they plan to design code and test game play hopefully something more substantial than an eve version of some alreadyexisting thirdparty minigame in a mere 8 months or perhaps slightly longer if incarna is also delayed due to the incursion delay id say asking for additional testing time on sisi is a wise idea the sooner we have something anything to respond to on sisi the betterslightly tangential unfortunately csmsand most likely playersdefinition of gameplay seems to be different than that of the incarna teams i have created a thread on our internal forums to specifically discuss incarna gameplay and am waiting for torfi noah and anyone else working on incarna game design to engage there
if ccp can show us how this is more than a virtual chat room with pretty new colors i would support this thread as it stands people have been asking for years how this will integrate into the game beyond cosmetics and have been met with silencei still believe this is simply a tech demo for wod launching and staying even more half assed than faction warfare
thiswith the information we have incarna is nothing more than a ghost for meps i dont believe in ghosts
agreedthis forum should not be troll bait or have scewed numbers
1 as already proven the term blob is a meaningless snarl word and arguments advanced for fixing it are baseless 2 fixing sov is good nobody who understand game mechanics is on the stop cooperation bandwagon there is no problem there is a problem with people who can not or will not adapt and can not or will not vacate a niche once theyre no longer able to compete and want ccp to wave a wand and help them rather than playing eve to accomplish things in eve which is why ive said time and again that there are and should be many valid playstyles and if someone doesnt have fun at one they should try another odd how you made such a mistakedo try to explain though how a is fun for some implies and thus b cant be fun for anybody there is someone trying to dictate what is and isnt fun its not meinappropriate comments removed jericho your argument has been debunked on its merits time and time and time againif youre not lying show the syllogism you claim exists and has a major or minor premise that you suggest actual nonforged quotes by the way any time now a very odd lie as the actual post is right above the lie about it theres something like five paragraphs taking your nonsense to pieces and pointing out that your desire for to have ccp help you accomplish things in eve is nonsensical if you cant actually accomplish things on your own power in eve shrieking mindreading and damn i dont even know what that is you are not a spokesman you dont have a valid scientific sample and no if some people complain about lag then you cant conclude that tens of thousands of players must really not be enjoying how they play the game talk about invalid and unsoundno not even with trolling about how people arent actually enjoying themselves and you know better than them that theyre just feeling mistaken pride how about you let people decide what they want to do in the game and if you dont like it you do something else that you enjoy i know crazyalthough there is something truly hilarious about your view that 10s of thousands of people spend centuries of manhours on a game doing something that they dont like but only you know that they dont like it they dont realize that and keep doing it again a lie about something thats just a few inches above the lie very strange of course you deliberately conflate the social engineering fcing and disgruntled allies ing  up because you dont have a point about the first two and really dont even have one about the third other than that some people dont like the specific game mechanics used in one specific situation well
yes i hear having a good fc in a 2000 vs 1000 man fleet through lag is a great example of people making a difference in eveinappropriate comments removed jerichoand despite claiming i have no proof that people arnt having fun i have provided you with far more proof than what you have been providing for them having fun they dont have a great choice atm they can be bored and win or can have slightly more fun and never have the ability to break into 00 lots of people go for the former
finnagain needs to stop trumpeting i have proved you wrong again and again without actually proving anything and actually read what people are saying before launching into some problob crusade i think the only person who believes your arguments is you and im not even entirely convinced you know what youre saying half the time you just spit out the first angry and bitter thing that comes into your head you appear to have trouble understanding so im going to point it out for you again80 of the csm candidates recognise blob warfare as an issuea good chunk of the csm were voted in on the back of their policies on blob warfarethis means the general player base has a problem with blob warfarethus there is a problemunderstand now

throughout history war has been a balance between having power and being able to use it battles required manpower but also the ability to project itone of the largest problems that faced your thousand man armies was that you needed a balance between having men on the line and spreading the line too thin if youre 50 men deep at all sections of the line theres less men who can fight your enemies at one time if youre 2 men deep at all sections its easier for your enemy to drive a wedge and break through while being attacked from behind is somewhat irrelevant in a game like eve the thing to take home from what battles are like in the real world is that when you bring a large amount of numbers it also takes a large amount of training to use it effectivelybeing killed by a blob id say 41 odds taking into account ship types and experience but it shifts downwards as you bring more people isnt fun losing a ship 1v1 sucks but losing it to superior numbers and superior ships makes people wonder why they bother playing eve at all the main reason blobs are so popular and so successful is that you can get literally anyone in a blob and all they have to be able to do is warp to gates jump through them ctrl click on things and hit f1 the amount of skill involved in coordinating blob warfare basically amounts to the fc being able to call targets and the blob being smart enough to know how to click once or twice and hit f1while i can understand that large scale fights are part of the attraction for some to eve online and i personally find them interesting the fact that theres no downside to bringing 200 people against a single person feels unbalanced theres no skill or training necessary for fleet members to engage in blob warfare and thats what makes it so easy to dowhile i love eve for the way it brings people together eve should not be a game where all it boils down to is whoever has the most people in their alliance wins its this reason that there are so many power blocs why would you join an underdog and be guaranteed a loss when you can join one of the big groups and almost never risk your shipeve is a game about player skill from playing the market to knowing how to fit and pilot your ship i see no reason why fleet engagements should be any different if a change was made yes it would mean that various alliances would actually need to start training their pilots in more then lock primary hit f1 but i and im sure many others honestly believe that large fleet battles would become much more interesting and involved then they currently are with the result being the large majority of players having more fun
youre welcome to show how any argument ive advanced is either invalid or unsound the general avoidance dishonesty and simple obvious lying that some posters have used in order to ignore my arguments is however prima facie evidence that if anybody could have rebutted let alone addressed them they would have one might notice you didnt for examplebandwagon fallacy again youre welcome to actually address the arguments and show how theyre invalid or unsound something tells me that wont happen howeverthe bandwagon fallacy is not called a fallacy because its a really really awesome argument if tomorrow 80 of people thought that the sun was made of a gigantic butterscotch candy it still wouldnt be if you can address the actual logic involved itd be much more cogent than nuhn unh off topic comments removed jericho
a second ago you were arguing that the game is fine because many people dont have an issue with it now you are arguing that many people having an issue with it is just a bandwagon fallacy
that is a lieive never said any such thing if you claim youre not lying quote it another lie and another one where the actual post youre lying about is right above your lie again what was actually said
i believe minigin is referring to thisalthough i cant be sureperhaps its best if certain parties in this thread took a break and stopped accusing each other of lying and instead focused on trying to make the game better for the majority of people  as thats the goal of this forum
he might be but if thats the case then hes lying my quote is about how mini was againclaiming that 10s of thousands of people whove devoted centuries of manhours to a game and often log on by the thousands in order to play for hours at a stretch arent actually enjoying their playstyle that doesnt touch on at all the claim that the game is fine because many people dont have an issue with it in fact it doesnt touch on whether or not the game is fine at all but whether or not people are having fun despite minis claim that he knows better than they do whether or not theyre having fun i have advanced numerous arguments about game mechanics and the lack of any objective definition for the snarlword blob theyve been scrupulously ignored and instead honest misunderstandings like minis keep getting trotted out like how he ignores that one of his compatriots has based his argument around the bandwagon fallacy and instead goes on the attack with another fictitious claim id be happy to take a break from pointing out that other posters are lying if theyd stop lying i hardly think its unreasonable if when someone lies and invents something that i never said that i point out that i didnt actually say it
while i respect where you are coming from im not at all impressed that you pick peoples posts apart and respond to small sections that you want to and and less impressed again that youve done the same to my response that was seeking to diffuse the bickering in this threadarguing about whether or not minigin is lying has so far led to you saying he is and him saying he isnt theres very little ground to be won here what i said was that instead of arguing about whether someone is lying we should be talking about how we can make eve a better more interesting game theres nothing gained by constantly attacking other players when the aim of this thread was to bring to the attention of the csm that people voted for the current csm because of their priorities and amongst those priorities was addressing the perceived imbalance or lack of interesting gameplay in blob warfarei like good thread derails as much as the next person but id wager this one has gone on long enough and you start look foolish for continuing it
i think youre the one ignoring logic here finn the logic is that this is a video game and at the end of the day the objective is to have fun if 80 of the player base are saying something needs to be fixed then obviously logic would dictate that it is not a fun mechanic
please can you point out this 80 of the player baseby name not i know a lot of people that want if fixed so it 80 of the playerbase that want it fixed take a poll or ask ccp to take it knowing that only positive replies ie blob warfare need fixing against total players number count as abstaining usually mean that the person isnt interested in the issue the basic problem is that the players want small group to count and make a difference when they are the people trying to do that but hate it when they are the large number of players suffering because a small group can destroy what they have done put it another way we all feel that we are the hero of the tale so we should be capable of fighting and winning against overwhelming odds and all the other players should be the conprimaries in our tale or the enemy cannon fodderbut that work in a single player game not in a mmorpg asking for changes in the game mechanics so that smaller groups get stronger than larger groups is following the hero mentality exactly because this is a video game and at the end of the day the objective is to have fun you cant pretend to put your fun above other people fun and be capable of destroying alone what 10 people had done or that a group of ten could easily destroy what has required a group of one hundred to create and so on sure there will be less fun for those that want to conquer destroy and so on but increasing their fun would be at the expense of the fun of the people that want to keep what they have so fixing the so called blob warfare would be reducing the enjoyment of the game for those on the blob side to increase it for those in the nonblob side ie taking from 100 to benefit 10 not a good idea
from a practical business standpoint this is not quite true if for example the 20 who love committing blobbery would all quit the game if the blobs were destroyed but the 80 who hate blobs and want them fixed would still play even if they were retained the rational game design team would keep the blobs its not just numbers intensity factors in as wellnote that i campaigned in part on introducing game design changes that would break up or highly modify blobs but not to attack blobs perse though i personally dont like that kind of fleet experience but because i felt it was needed to fight lag still do btw
spineless like the rest of csm thus far you get to iceland realise ccp are people rather than things on the internet and you go soft i dont feel sorry for you you should have put your name in so that you can advocate for your beliefs and for those who voted you in if this was ever more than a free trip to iceland for you step up and do more no one cares if ccp ignores you but you practically arnt trying atm go do something radical like get all the csms together and refuse to meet again until you are taken seriously cause some drama cause some scandal make ccp listenuntil we see you trying you will get no easy relief for hey guys im for you but ccp wont listen anyway
some solid research would be really nice come on the economics team are some pretty smart folks they know or should know at least that in a game like eve taking a simple snapshot and then not even really analyzing the data is worse than useless take for instance the x percent of players are in empire during our snapshotits utterly useless without analysis how many of that x percent are above say 1 million sphow many of those not over 1 million sp are on accounts that are 2 years old how many of them have placed more than 25 buysell orders in the week leading up to the snapshot how many of them are on accounts with one or more characters that was in nullseclowsec at the time of the snapshothow many of them share ip addresses with an account that has one or more characters that was in nullseclowsec at the timehow many of them are in a ship that has a cyno and lohow many of them are in noob corps and are skilled only for haulinghow many of them have not been active since 2004and so on theres great potential for the economic newsletter to really elucidate the nuts and bolts of eve and show whats going on but ccp has not been using it to anywhere near its full potential and yah its about time that someone gave us some accurate figures on macroers reportedinvestigatedbanned not rmters necessarily but macroers doesnt have to be the qen but outside of publicity stunts like unholy rage most of us get the impression that nothing is being done
id like to see the number of missions given out by agents for the reporting period broken down by region with the top 10 agents named and shamed
id like to know how many pages ive sniped
can you post a post summary of the questions and answers as discussed at the round table
well release the chat log from the moderated channel after the roundtable so those who are unable to attend can see the questions and responses
damn thats exactly what i was going to ask is anyone at ccp really in doubt whether they should increase its powergrid other than that nice initiative i wish it would be of any usefulness
no we just cant tell you everything ccp tells us for example weve known for a long time which csm features would most likely end up in incursion however in order to correctly manage expectations features may be dropped at the last minute we cant tell you right awaythe nda exists so ccp can tell us things they cannot tell the general playerbase yet and is of great use to us the june summit meeting minutes showed that they do not use the nda to censor us when our opinion is not a positive one
jimm mayfield1251712037916116348
i dont know if i will be on for this but things i would hope are discussed1 is csm really having an impact on the shaping of this game2 if so how  if not in what way can we achieve a better voice for the playerbase3 state of 00 that is to say everything from stagnant sov  coalition systems  supercap production rates  instant travel etc4 how we can get more people and more groups out into 00if i hear one more csm make an excuse about why nothing will change rather than how we can either convinseforce ccp to look at issues just do the job you have been elected to do if you cant please step aside for someone with a better idea of how to get things done
if you think for a second that pl as an organization is smart enough to develop a method to hack eve but stupid enough to both publicly acknowledge and link to it on our website you have the intelligence of a sack of hammers
i have had enough of these patches like many other capsuleers i propose that csm should petiton ccp to roll back to pretyrannis no one really cares all that much about pi its a cool idea but its secondary to getting a stable client how about you do some work on the mac client so that when i turn on audio so that i can hear my damage alarms the game doesent crash while fighting npcs causing me to loose my ship and to add insult to injury some incompetent pos gm tells me there is no evidence in the logs aka i would have to actually do work to help you so go away even when i offer to provide video evidence that its a client issue but thats another issue tldr lets go back to dominion until ccp can get their  together and make an expansion that doesnt need 5 patches
when one door closes another one opensnuff saidso i disagree with you
even if we assume that would fix allmost problems with current eve it would never happen for a very simple reason the pencilpushers at ccp would never allow it as it would create a massively negative pr for the company the risk of appearing to be a company that totally screwed up the further development of their main product will be seen as way too risky no matter how bad the actual progress turns out to be the laws of corporate management wont allow for it or in other words welcome to 21st century capitalism
now that the item ids have all gone 64bit along with various other changes i doubt a rollback is technically an option without having to revert the database to a months old backup which would be even worse than letting pi limp on till incursions
if you were going to roll back why on earth would you choose dominion
well i think that the 64bit schema for database entries was a rather simple modification and could be applied do dominion i think the roll back to dominion would be good because i felt it was good enough and an acceptable release i agree with the fact the pencil pushers at ccp wouldnt be down for it maybe i was just hoping that ccp could put aside gaining money by adding new shiny things in the short run and focus on maintaining their subscription base in the long run its sad to say but i can picture a day in the not to distant future where people start quitting left and right which basically forms a cascading effect of ragequits because mmos are not fun to play by your self
there has been a lot of talk about whether its right for people to receive a insurance payout when they have had their ship destroyed via concordepersonally i would like insurance removed completely from the gamei wouldnt even allow insurance for new players as this can easily be abusedif you lose your ship regardless of how and can not afford to replace it then you shouldnt off been flying it in the first placejust wondering what other people though about this
nonononono
yes just because i like to be differenthonestly though i dont really care if they happen or not i mean after reading this thread it becomes painfully obvious that the fan base has no faith in ccp to do the right thing so you might as well reward them with exactly what they expect i suggest you start by selling ships with unlimited health and ammo after all if youre gonna go out go out big
no
hell no 
yesi can already start an account buy some isk and buy a 60m sp player all in one day thats a hell of a lot more than a few remapsgp

nerf dramielcut off dronebay medslot decrease speed cpu pg it will be more honest by aligning with other faction frigates
here you go balance fractions until the cows come home
it is a mark of imbalance that all the faction ships with serious usage in pvp as judged by the qen3 are angel cartel ships drams have every single good thing that a frigate can have besides a bomb launcher no other ship of its class even comes close to competing with it except the daredevil which is essentially a dramiel killer that cant catch a dramiel in the first place
10
supportedall the angel ships really needed to be looked at twice before release amazing that ccp can have the forethought to release some ships as prenerfed to hell and back and yet somehow completely overlook these
supported i would say either slow it down or take its ability to fit dual propmse with an mapc fittedeither that or bring the others to its level the dramiel although very overpowered at the moment doesnt need to have alot done to bring it back in line certainly doesnt need to be sledge hammered by ccp which is what will happen inevitablyedit cheers for suggesting a fix that wouldnt kill the ship off as something different to fly dont want it going back to the days of having a turret bonus and more missile slots than turrets
remove the drone bay and increase mass by 10
pick up one med slot and reduce the speed itll be ok
since ccp messed up and kept billing me keeping this account active i shall bless the forums with my opinions on such things in the assembly hall starting with this threadnot supportedwhy because if a hauler can kill a dramiel then it is not op i do not have hard stats and numbers to throw at you to support that just simply lol at haulers killing fotm faction frigates
so you think that just because some noob was in a dramiel and got killed by a badger its not overpowered ive seen an omen take down a harbinger doesnt mean the harbinger sucks just means he was ing noob you  or that the omen pilot was like 100m sp
fail fit is dumb the dramiel is overpowered compared to other frigates besides the jaguarishkurvengeance meaning that truly the other frigates are the ones that are underpowered cruor sucubus worm pfft  ships compared you need to buff them dont make the dramiel a piece of crap like the rest of them it is perfect as it is you need to bring the others up to par
at issue is the weakness of the other faction ships i assume hope that sansha ships are going to be fixed in this upcoming release as they are often subt2 in function blood raiders ships are also lacking compared to t2 ashimmu v curse for instance gurista ships are fairly good but could still use a small boost angels are the only ones that really scale up from their comparable t2 ship cynabal v vagabond for instancedont nerf the dram just fix the other pirate faction ships

wild 00 dominion coming out oneclick sell multiple items if im going to vote on anything id appreciate you bringing out a current list wild 00 is wormhole space click and sell a stack and youve got oneclick sell multiple itemshow unimportant is that anyway you must be referring to everything in your hangar which is a completely unrealistic expectation i cant even imagine how hard that would be to code and with all the complaints about lag lets just say it would be counterproductive everything i looked at is either implemented or redundent or uneccessary and potentially problem causing though ill admit i only clicked here and there on the list my point is im not sorting through all that to find a few valid ideas or suggestions i would ask that you truncate the list reasonably and consider the validity of many of the suggestions and ideas there having people vote on all that and sending in a list of most wanted additions and changes is i think going to lead nowhere and end up with a lot of unsatisfied frustrated peoplecheers

yes its the list of current csm open issues minus the ones known to be in the incursion pipeline there are duplicates but it would be presumptuous of me to make decisions about whats a duplicate and what isnt without consulting the full csmthere is a mechanism in my vote tabulation code for combining similar items into a single item and i am gathering lists of related items based on player suggestions the final decisions about those combinations will be made after consultation with other csmstime is limited  we have to get this data into ccp by the end of the month  so i felt it better to do the combination afterthefact so as to give everyone more time to notice the thread and vote the perfect is the enemy of the good as they say

very supported omen is easily the worst cruiser as it is now fix the amarr bonuses while at it
if anything ccp needs a digital legacy policy which results in characters and their history being kept after the death of the user
might be more interesting if they added a nickname field which can be used for corp etcexample mrblogs1298103981 could nickname himself blogs in corp or maybe even john smithdeleting characters or their names is just going to lead to some terrible problems annoying as it iseditalso it may upset some people if their now deceased friends are renamed to amarr citzen 4532352 and another person gets to use their name
destroyers indeed lack the edge they should have over frigates which is a shame considering that should be their rolei agree with the improvement on grid not being able to fit all railguns on a cormorant is frustrating as well as the removal of the penalty to rate of firei would consider a rebalancing of modules as profitable remove one high slots add a low or midslot depending on the ship
yeppers
i have to agree though the moa isnt as bad as some there are quite a few ships that are even less than pleasant to look at the gallente ships are the ones that are generally the worst for me imicusoh jesus christ why atronlooks like someone sawed two different ships in half and glued them together catalyst thorax vexor  dominixjust for their freaky face textures really and alot of other plainly mediocre designs ones that look distorted with no real direction or reason aside from to tick all the boxes on their makeagallenteship sheet anyway after the scorpion redesign i was under the impression that ccp was already initiating or atleast thinking about initiating the process to sharpen up the older hull designs and although id appreciate shinier ships sooner id much rather have ships that actually functioned atleast to an extent usable reworked hybrids afsdestroyersgallenteshipsingeneralfaction ships rebalanced and that goddamn lag all need to adressed as soon as possible and i fear that ccp would be far happier avoiding the situation by making lots of pretty 3d models instead of doing something actually useful
screw that ccp leave my vexor alone seriously i love that ship
wasting time
heres the deal oh people who say this is a waste of timemodelgraphic designers are not coders asking them to redesign a ship means coders will have to focus on existing content rather than new content as new content usually needs new models so if you want ships redesigned for aesthetic purposes you should be in favor of this if you want the code monkeys to be fixing stuff rather than making new content you should want the graphics people tied up on things other than new content simple as that
supporting pos thread 1245
ok so does anyone have a real answer why caps cant go to hisecso far there are 2 answers1 someone jettisoned 10000 shuttles from a carrier in j44  you can do that with say 10 orcas now they have ship array 10x smaller also freighter also any industrial full of small secure cansso answer 1 fails as the reason sounds fun tho2 somehow macro miners would abuse capitals for miningwhat with 3 mining lasers on a dread after mining 237 for 6 months that macro wouldnt have enough isk to buy a plex for 1 month didnt realy calculate but thats closeso answer 2 fails as the reasonanyone old enough to know the real answer
common sense using them to run mission and in wardecs would be too overpowered without any reasonable counter to them you cant suicide carriers the same way you can suicide faction battleships if you want to play with them you have to also risk losing them it also gives people incentive to move out and try new things
most missions have gatesso isnt the logical answer to add gates to other missions and not to ban capitals also im pretty shure marauders do the job a bit better than carriersas for hisec wars like everything else in eve you counter them with your own capitalshisec wars would change for shure but why is that necessarily a bad thing
sorry vel lol that was supposed to say some not sub fixed
to the op dude to is spelled with one o not two unless youre like me too which you werentcaps it highsec meh if its no supercaps allowed sure why not just dont let them run missions or be capable of targeting roids in hisec so theyd be for pvp  incursions  logistics  posbashing only although that would require letting caps into incursion sites which would be rad
lol no worries dear i did wonder what you were talking about
i say yes also concord doesnt guarentee their protectionbut if you attack it your flagged to the corp just to be farecept the veldnaught of course
oh you think ask chribba how much he made off the veldnaught each day if you think thats the case i think he had said at one point he was pulling in 100 million isk a day by leaving it mining while he went to work 2953125 veldsparminute 292k iskminute 175m iskhour 402m iskday 23 hour days 6 months of mining wont buy 1 month of plex try about 1 day of mining will buy 1 month of plexgranted ccp nerfed the cargo hold of dreads so you cant afk mine for anywhere near as long as you used to be able to but you can still do about a hour in a dread before having to dock and dump the ore so you can only go afk for an hour at a time so the afk income potential is less but still fairly noticeable income for having to dockdumpundockwarplockengage modules every hour
what about supercaps in highsec then with full functionality i mean would be the next logical step right insert random trolling this whole ideasuggestion is getting worse the more i think about it
my main gripe about capitals being allowed into highsec is threefold1 yes it would vastly change the dynamics of highsec and not for the better highsec wars already have issues with neutral remote reppers an issue that will only become worse with the introduction of carriers and supercarriers not only will they be able to rep large amounts of ships but anyone stupid enough to actually shoot a carrier or supercarrier will be killed by the capital unlike normal logis they are not defenseless2 since capital class ships are such force multipliers your only choices are to bring in more people or field your own capitals this will exacerbate the problems of blobbing and capital proliferationmore than that not everyone in highsec is so organized or wealthy to perform either counter and so a great deal many people will find themselves outclassed andor outgunned 3 major alliances will use highsec as a sanctuary for capitals youd have to declare war against the alliance in question to take out their holding poss which will be very expensive for your average corpalliance at least in lowsec you can do a surprise attack against a pos and only have to worry about gcc timersother thoughts it would be way too easy not to mention relatively riskfree to ship materials and ships around empire space effectively raising the entry barrier to be an effective trader youd need your own carriers and jumpfreighters to compete macrominers would love to be able to field 15 to 25 mining drones in a ship that cannot be suicide ganked in a reasonable way not all missions have acceleration gates ex blockade missions you can bring any ship into those missions
player pirates mainly and the followup introduction of motherships and titans sealed the deal
i read a thread whining about how railguns are much worse than the other turrets my opinion doesnt carry much weight as the only turret ive ever used is hybrids and i quite like them impossible to hit enemies close up though well anyway hybrid uses cap ammo whereas projectiles and lasers only uses one of these two components couldnt we do something unique with cap and ammo together now im not really sure what the difference is between a coilgun and a railgun so ill refer to the prototype 425mm gauss cannon which is a coilgun when you fire the coilgun a magnetic projectile is fired away if we do not include the coils resistance then the force of the projectile would be the same as the energy used to fire it e  mv22 the activation cost of a caldari navy railgun is 24gj thats a load of energy now we cannot determine the velocity v or the mass m of the projectile as apparently the hybrid charges are weightless which renders this formula useless now imagine having but one hybrid charge for each size calibre ie 250mm 350mm 425mm etc and with a constant mass lets call this charge 425mm iron slug to determine its damage you would have to increasedecrease the energy you use to fire the slug the more energy you use to fire it the more higher velocity it will have as the weight is constant which means higher damage to determine optimal and falloff you would have to calibrate your guns in some way i havnt thought this through really as i wouldnt want balance issues but still be correct rpwise i think it could be fun with a different kind of weapon where you can alter damage and range with your cap there would be no reloading as with lasers as you use the same charge all the time thoughts
sure lets also take into account conductor losses maximum safe capacitor ripple current wouldnt want to blow up your ship emitted emi from switching and magnetic field generation heating losses in wires and switches projectile magnetic flux density saturation etc etc oh and theres the fact you can only use iron ammoas much as i want to improve railguns adding a bunch of math and crap isnt the solution
guns in eve are about as unrealistic as ccp can achieve that said the problem with rails isnt rails specifically its caldari more specifically caldari ships they are intended for caldari are the range race which they give up dps and alpha for this means rails have to suck compared to lasers or something
i thought i was able to do so at first
the learning tree does imo alienate new players and bog down veterans alike its essentially 2 months for increased training speed which should have just been there in the first placeim all in favor for completely removing the learning tree altogether but refunding the sp in the process so they can be better spent elsewhere and as recompense base training speed should go at the speed of as if players already had trained the entire tree to 5
do thisalmost triple base attributes giving players a free remap to applychange learning skills to be 1 attribute increase per level learning skill toochange implants to be 1 too 5 implant  5fixed with minimal impact on current mechanics
wholeheartedly agreenot supported
very supportedlearning skills add nothing to the game but a extremely frustrating period that scares people away from personal experiencemore people more good times for everyone involved eve should be about skill flying not about skill waiting to wait some more to maybe fly something in a month or so
the problem with learning skills is idiots keep telling new players they have to have them now i tell new players to train them when they dont know what else to trainis it good that ccp wants to replace them i cant say it shows they at least understand the hole new and old players dug for themselves game longevitywise i maxed every learning skill i invested the time and money to do it i did it informed of the pros and cons of doing it and because i saw it as a good investment long termtruly the types of players that quit over training learning skills are the types of players that would quit anywayi think the problem is the stigma attached to them not the skills themselves
vote 2010 is underway and we only have the option to say yes and add our opinion of priorities to the csmccp interfacei would like to see the option to vote no on specific itemsreasonthe list of options in the source list has a few items that i do not want implemented so much so that i want badly to vote against themthere are two distinct categories of passionate issues1 issues that request changes that impact player interactions directly2 issues that request changes that impact player interactions indirectlyindirect player interaction are observed through game mechanics like industry mining hauling etcthe problem with direct interaction changes results in the loss or gain of pvp combathere is the underlying issue with a yes only vote  players will vote on their personal desires to improve the game they want to interact with pve players will naturally vote to improve the game environment to better their experience pvp players will also vote to improve their game experience the problem is that pve players vote to impact the game through indirect changes ie change mining change missions change environment etc pvp players will vote to better improve their chances to dominate their opponent directly ie aggression timer killmails wreck loot etcvoting only yes for each of the issues does not balance the wants of the community although a pvp player might want better ways to dominate others will specifically not want to see that issue implemented therefore if a no vote is allowed on say 3 issues it is likely that the pve players will have a much stronger voice against obvious issues that unbalance the game while pvp players no vote will be diluted into the volume of other issues that would be viewed as less important the process that i have observed for the pvp player is that they have very few obvious options to chose from and their voice is heard much more resolute than the diluted pve vote pve players have way more issues to vote on and have way more diverse interests therefore the pve vote is disperse in comparison unless the issue is passionate this might be the single reason we have observed ccp giving so much love to the pvp pirates because there is no way to specifically voice opposition in this process pve players need a mechanism to balance the voting process and bring resolution to the diffusion of our voice against direct player interactionsin summaryallow 3 no votes to the process i realize its too late for nov 2010 but it should have been done a long time agoit should be easy to implement with counting player name1234567no8910 using the forum bots used to count the votestldr  nope not this time read itfirst editit seems that there is a viable alternative to a no vote for csm prioritizing some suggestions herein indicate that putting the power of no in the assembly hall will result in the same voice necessary for the community to express wantstherefore part b would be to either allow a no vote in csm priorities or a no vote in the assembly halltroll repliesno not madno you cant have my stuffno this is not personalduh its a cool story i knowno just plain  no
very supported
you raise some valid pointspart of the problem is that there is a tradeoff between making the process quick and easy and accuracy of the data received the process could require everyone to rank all of the issues but that would be so cumbersome that only 5 people would vote and 4 of them would be altsthe idea of antivotes is an interesting one the question is whether the additional complexity for the voters not for the poor bastard who tabulates the data is worth the added accuracy especially when you consider that this polling is used as advisory data to csm so the judgment or lack thereof of csm members comes into play at a later datei think it might be interesting to test antivoting on a later prioritization to see what the results are probably the easiest way to do it would be to have negative votes be negative numbers ie 37 is a vote against item 37however i think the other csms need to think about this and give their opinions
it may be possible with the current system to identify voting patterns using an automatic classifier such as autoclass which nasa used to find two different classes of infrared star in the galaxy and have the humans identify patterns as nullsec pvp hisec pvp industrialist and pveim sure the members of the set of people who vote on balance destroyers are more likely to vote on review black ops than make mining interesting for exampleonce the easytoidentify groups are discovered determine the highest ranking requests from the two groups and build a combined list rather than simply selecting the most popular changes overallas an alternative to automatic classification have a twopass system where we first nominate a bunch of issues as being pvepvpindustryflavour and then start the process of nominating issues for developer attention then pick a few issues from each list which rate highest relative to the other issues from the respective listmy opinion is that negative votes will be too easily gamed
i like how this thread easily splits eve players in 2 categoriespvpers and mission runnersanyways yes this would be a nice option to have
nowhybecause thats not how the system worksthe list of issues there is filtered by the csm those are the issues the players and the csm wantyou are not voting yesno in that thread you are only voting for the priority of the issue and you cant have any valid reason vote down a priority and by doing so postponing the issuebutyou are right there should be a vote no option but that should be handeled in the issue threads by giving us a thumbs down option or implementing some other better voting system in each thread simple polls maybethen an proposed issue could be voted down and never make it to the csm prioritization listthere were proposals for a thumbs down option i personaly think thats not good enough we need a real half automated voting and issue tracking system adjusted to fit eve purposes forums are not sufficient with any ammount of adjustments
20 seems nice
ah false dichotomies despite most of the blather in the op i support the idea that assembly hall needs the ability to downvote ideas as well as upvote
i was attempting to point out that all of eve is pvp however there are two types indirect and direct it is unfortunate that to avoid blathering ad nauseam i had to resort to simple illustrations and the colloquial use of pvp and pve i understand that its not a simple this or that issue its hard communicate to a diverse audience and acknowledge known concerns in one concise post i did not want to be concise because its my post i am more of the  say it twice in two different ways to reach more people  kind of person
while i dont agree with the rationale i do agree with the conclusioni vote yes to be able to say noami doin it rite
facepalmwhy do people keep insisting on arguing the easily countered point like theyre some kind of game design guruheres two counters ill just crap out1 increased damage to blocking ships through reduced resists and higher signature increases exponentially for additional blockers range on modules should be within 10k even for bonused ships2 limitations to number of activated modules same range as aboveif a fleet is designed to tank it should be able to tank if your fleet designed itself for dps and tank then grats you didnt bring enough dps or alpha tldr  i can use internet abbreviations too presenting alternatives is one thing slippery slope arguments of infinite doom and easily seen abuses doesnt amount to much more than herpderp when you can present a solution if you stopped for 3 seconds
 or your fleet could jump in ahead of the hauler clear any hostiles and then have you jump in
yes as another fleet chews up and spits out the token defence you left while the main force is ahead of the haulers
or you could have one of the escort fleet you know scout ahead ive heard that works well hard to kill an indy ship if it isnt in the same system as the camp after all
i hate to be a stickler about scientific jargon that i have relatively no true grasp of however something i would like to see changed would be form high school science classes when i was in school scientific fact when a star is moving towards the eye it appears redder while a star moving away from the eye is bluer in appearance this is how scientists detect how a distant star is moving in the skies though while i know its only a small detail i believe that if when in warp the light around you is compressed therefore increasing the frequency in which you are exposed to it low end frequency of light is blueindigo in appearance while high frequency is red in color i find that would only be a minor change that would bring a little more realism in to the game itselfby expression when moving in warp the light coming in to the eye in a forward direction would begin turning read rather then a blue appearance due to an increased frequency while the same light from behind moving away would appear more blue in hue form a decreased frequency from the visual light spectrum anyone agree that this would make sense
sounds good on paper but it would not make for a pleasent game play experience there is nothing realistic about matter traveling faster than the speed of light so that problem would need to be solved first at speeds sufficiently close to that of light the effect of doppler shift is extreme enough to render blue shifted objects as white and redshift objects as black not an entertaining view of the universe
its called red shifting and we already have such a phenomena albeit subtle in evewhen in warp look towards the front of the warp tunnel and youll notice that space it is slightly bluer likewise the back of the warp tunnel is slightly redder than the surrounding space
thisthough i think its no where near as pronounced as it used to bewould support making it more visible
wait you want to see the rest of the universe the way the mortal proletariat do no thanks im a demigod and much prefer my elite perspectivethat basically means that pod technology explains the lack of realism sort of like sounds in space
technically in warp you shouldnt see anything at all from behind you since you are now outrunning the light in that directionfortunately this is a game
that brutix has 370dps almost as much as a good t1 cruiserand that on 15km range thats just around 200 dps at 4km which is as close as you are going to can get in an armor riged bc and thats if youre lucky 6km dps around 100 so a maybe 200dps brutix with a active tank of 400i didnt say its impossible to fit i said it lacks fittings because a fit like that sucks compared to anythingim not going to look at the hyperion numbers but the same thing applies only with that you wont be able to hit anything ever because of large blaster trackingall caldari ships can fit a rack of the smallest railguns no problem and youre trying to support this thread by fitting the smallest blasters to prove a pointmy point still standshybrids need fixing first then issues about ships should be raised because now theres no problem with caldari gunboats theres a problem with hybrids and all ships using them except maybe megai do also apologize to everyone for the ot
you said try fitting them with an active tank like their designed and i did just that you  and those fits do exactly what those ships are ment to do the smallest medium rails on a ferox do not and that brutix fit would easily own a blaster ferox so yeah think before you speak derp
try activating the drones facepalmgallentean drone boats should not have a huge amount of dps coming from the guns if they can fit 5 drones of the size theyre designed for15km range you have an mwd scram and web to slow your opponent down as you get in close to face thembrutix and hype are fine
thats like saying it works because sometimes the other guy fails epically lets be honest if the other guy allows a brutix to get within scram range hes made a big mistake or hes an idiot in general blaster boats are only functional when camping jita station or ganking an afk ratterminer that does not make those ships functional outside those situations which any other pvpfit ship can also handle they are useless unlike every other pvpfit shipedit the hyperion does have drones so it is functional for rattingmissions
lets start a new actually not really newtopic about blasters suck but in this topic we should whine about ships unable to fit guns that would give them limited advantage over other ships seriously to actually outrange other weapon systems you need big guns and you cant bit them and it you fit blasters instead of rails besides general problems that blasters have you get bad dps problem tooccp should observe real player combat to make conclusions when range is more important than gank tank speed and so on idea that some extra range is such a huge advantage that they need to break every other detail of the ship is silly
taken from an idea in the ships  modules forum id like to suggest four new items for our friends in factional warfareeach race has a specific damage that it faces a lot of in factional warfare the amarrians fight the minmatar and need explosive resists the gallente fight the caldari and need kinetic resists etcthis creates a resist tableamarr  explosive resistcaldari  thermal resistgallente  kinetic resistminmatar  em resistlets add a damage control module designed to mitigate that sort of damageracial navy damage controlarmor specific damage resistance 19armor general damage resistance 14shield specific damage resistance 15shield general damage resistance 12hull specific damage resistance 67hull general damage resistance 58

ur posting in the wrong forum
dammit i need to get more alts to vote for my own ideascrapi dont see the vote against option for some of the ideas listededit to remove distracting comment and thread hijack
relax guysi know there are some duplicates and errors in the list i had to get it done quickly so i didnt have the time to go through and combine some issues that are largely duplications of each otherhowever the vote tabulation app i wrote to do these prioritizations has a system that lets me combine votes for similar issues and i will go through and carefully do that after the voting is over so all the blackops stuff will be combinedand yeah its smart enough so that if i decide that the blackops stuff gets combined someone who voted for both 22 and 23 will get credited with a single vote for the combined item
thanks for the clarificationanyway i believe that organizing such csm votes and providing the required tools should not be entirely csm members responsibility  you are not obliged to be software developers if ccp really wants to have effective and transparent csm they should invest 12 manmonths to create some tools  eg online voting system
thanks for the link but i cant see any reference to something like 204 new online voting system csm regarding the forum improvements  yep i know they are long overdue and i could share some old structured suggestions of mine
wait whatyou mean that the plethora of ui modification requests may or may not be combined so all the different mods that i voted for will be null and void beyond onethis thread has validity in that we do not know what will be combined nor will we have foreknowledge of wasted voteslooks at the calendar  noted the date is not 412010serious
defender missle should be able to target missle not fired at you thats what i miss without this they are pretty useless 
what really needs to happen is for defender missiles to be removed from the loot tables they are only good for melting down after all and ccp supposedly decreasedremoved meta 0 from the loot tables defender missiles are the equivalent of meta 0 reprocess junk

most of it makes sense and i would support the ideas if you would unbundle them for instance i dont know what the deliver all thing is about
this did not turn out as i intended it to do please remove this post

are u kidding add the alliance to you contact drag it to the dialog when you want to use
supported11 neuts in xyz systemwho are theyinstead of dragging a name just link the alliance that would be very useful

omg yes

thisno seriously get over it this is a game and ccp is just a game company its not the end of the worldoh and change that we demand to i demand in the ops post and its fixed
might work better if you werent alone and if it didnt come off as a joke no seriously is the joke posting some sort of meme i dont get what is this this would be like watching thre discovery channel about whales and you sit down all ready for a nice hour of learning  when suddenly bam omfg whales are creatures that ive in the ocean and the population is in boats are evil when ice land is fishing and that is badthen you get your ass off the floor where it landed when you were blasted off the floor an hour later and your like wait what was that aboutdude op if you have a point make it you have no proof no links no ing nothing they want it in the dark yes thats how a forum works however now you can post the censored info and email the proof to the csm they are the cops now they wont get censored if you have something certifiable i know it sucks that you want to be the knight on a white horse but instead send it to the cops because the cops are the players we voted into power then post here whats goign on and be a ing adult about it because right now im just writting this off as a trollgame companies dont want mass panic thats why its called internal affairs so hand it off to our shotgun the csm and let them post about itnow if ccp censored a csm post then youd have some forum rage p
first of all ccp is completely within their rights to do whatever the hell they want to in eve online they own all content within the game including your characters and all your virtual assetssecondly even if there are gm alts in it alliance i would be surprised if there wasnt given the size test used obviously bull tactics that clearly works around intended ingame mechanics to gain an unfair advantagenow your main arguments are that it was done before and nothing was done about it done by others and nothing was done about it but this is assuming that all other disputed sov claims using maintd tcus were both of similar size 14 goddamn claims and against an alliancecoalition of comparable size more people an alliance has the more they can spam their petitions from what i understand gms arent particularly proactive they generally require petitioning in order to solve player disputes therefor the quantity of petitions and the overwhelming nature of tests gambit already shows how much of a disproportionate sway an alliance like it has in this case without ever needing to take gm alts into account in comparason to smaller alliances dropping only a couple tcus in again smaller alliance sovreignty where theres much less likelihood anyone would bother caring let alone create a petition against ittldr the entire situation is a nonissue op is silly
this whine thread is about a wardec that was retracted by a gm internal affairs investigated and found the gm had made an honest mistake now a bunch of people who are not associated with any of the involved parties are demanding that ccp publish the whole sordid affair as a devblogbut your final statement still holds true 
im sorry but i didnt read any of that in the op thus my original point
ccp kills animals for furpetpeeve people for the ethical treatment of pod pilots enjoying evenerf bob
in more detaillet us see the modules fit to the currently active ship when inside the station environmentshow the hullarmorshieldgrid statistics the currently active ship when inside the station environmentallow configuration of how modules are displayed  used grouping and ammo management would be nicethis all without having to open the fitting window
whythe fitting window does everything you just described so aside from i dont want to click the button what problem does this change solve
pretty sure the fitting window was created so that you could see everything you just described while docked and undockedid like to hear your ideas for seeing the fittings without a fitting window yeah something about i want to have a fitting window but without using a fitting window is what im picking up in the op

on my last tour around the outer rim of the known galaxy i found that most systems were empty places a lot were unclaimed between alliances  most likely as buffercontested zones for the most part  emptylooking for some quiet time try the outer rim
the main issue is access to these spaces as a balance i propose systems that havent seen much pvppve activity ie systems with low upgrades be given a higher weighting and have more 00 to low sec and 00 to high sec wh links
you forgot requiring players to provide a 64 bit key that changes every minute and is randomly generated by a keychain attachment
tbh they should remove all pw restrictions like the new you must have letters and numbers bs
really once a month is too much this isnt like your bank password write this one down in your wallet if you need to remember if you listen to the interview the comment is that 90 of hacked passwords are due to people using their same email addy and passwords on community sites while it might be easy to say this only happens to dumb people that isnt much comfort to those who have been hackedif you hate rmt you should hate hacked accounts because the characters iskassets get funneled into more rmt
yes but your solution isnt the only one to the problempersonally i would pay for a keyfob attachment before id support this idea
ive found forced password changes result in users setting passwords which are easier and easier to bruteforce
the problem is that when forced to change passwords in this manner people start using stupid things like password1 password2 and so on which would strike me as easier to hackbruteforce in the long termi know that when i have to deal with things like these the sheer amount of passwords i deal with bank different labs at school work makes me end up setting them all to the same and to rather ed things that anyone could guess like passw0rdid support a reminder to not use the eve password in other sites and not use the password here that you use in other sites when you make an account or a keyfob if we are gonna get into hi sec territory
forcing password changes often just makes people pick worse passwordsi dont want to be punished and have to deal with bull password changes because someone else set a crappy one and got their account hacked not supported
nowant to be forced to something go visit a domina i suggest
yes following the advice of a criminal that is still doing the crime is the best way to goif you force people to change password every month the end result will be people choosing easy to remember and so easy to break passwords and you think that people will not follow this routine this is a even numbered month so the eve server has password1 and the community site has password2 next month i will switch to password2 for eve and password1 for the community server
id just love to see bounty hunting become a more involved part of the game something i can sink my teeth intoive been thinking an awful lot about this being a big fan of boba fett im sure everybody who plays a game like eve is also a big fan this is the problem everybody wants to be a bounty hunter everybody would want to be boba fett so you have to cut down on the number of players fielding bounty hunters so the game doesnt just turn into one big bounty hunting game and everybody ends up with a bounty on hisher headfirst of all bounty hunting is not really about killing it is about locating and turning into the authorities assassination is about killing so assassination could also be worked into the game as in a similar way as i will describe belowbounty hunting should not depend on the type of ship you fly i like flying a frigate or a cruiser and i dont want to have to use a battleship just to kill a bounty because that bounty is always flying a battleship id like to be able to fly my frigate and tag the bounty with a module that launches a tracking device that reports the ships location to ded or concord then that character would remain tagged for two days to a week and whenever they come into high sec even if only in a pod then concord would pop themthink about it does boba fett go get a bigger ship in order to get his target no he stays in the slave i and turns his target in to jabba the hutt who paid for the bounty however bounty hunting is also not just about staying in a ship boba fett needed to get out of his ship to get his target so since incarna is on its way then bounty hunting that doesnt involve the player killing a player directly in a station can still allow the bounty hunting mechanics to work bounty hunting that involves identifying and tagging the target for the proper authorities to deal with stays with the concept of walking in stationsthe skills involved should be very time consuming to train a player should have to dedicate his character to being a bounty hunter just like mining mining really is not fun or beneficial unless you train the skills way up and dedicate that character to mining rather than combat different ranks of skills would allow for the bounty hunter character to locate targets in station via the station computer records just like a mix of locator agents and the trade mechanic the bounty hunter can gain access to station flight plans in order to locate a target in ever increasing range radiating out from the station hes athaving standings with an npc corp at a station would also affect the hunters access to information also npc corps could issue bounties on players that fly into their systems with low standings and only hunters with high enough standings with that npc corp can take those bounties standings could also add to the time intensity to being a bounty hunter again to force players to really have to dedicate a character to that and so not so many bounty hunters flying aroundi think issuing bounties would work better if there was a legitimate reason to issue the bounty id imagine it wouldnt be too hard to keep up with certain things that would validate a bounty if a player steals from the corp hangar then that could be recorded and when a member of the corp places the bounty he can select the reason from a list and the game mechanics would be able to see that yes that player took stuff worth so much money and therefore a bounty of a certain amount based on the amount of the stuff stolen could be issued if your ship was destroyed and you issue a bounty the game mechanics can see this is already in the game that a certain player did destroy your ship hence you have a real reason to issue a bountyof course null sec would be a haven for those with bounties thats the idea you are forcing a player underground restricting his movement
theres a problem with polls though put out a poll asking people to vote for whether or not theyd like 100 billion free isk an officer fit nyx and a pony and a lot of people would say yes doesnt mean that the game drastically needs everybody to be given a small horse

wrong thread p
ok so ive been playing this game for over 5 years now and to this day i have been unable to get past the furst level of any complex due to the fact the rat that has the key is always deadevery single timeexmple i just logged on after dt and there was 3 people in local i jumped in to the complex rat dead key gonelook its redicules it makes it so that if i want to get a pith a type for instance i have to pay a redicules ammount of money for one why why why why cant ccp make complexs instances with a cooldown so tht everyone has a chance to play them its not just the loot ive never been able to use this part of the game cos they are just farmed to death please guys raise this with ccp do somthing about it i just wanna play a complex dungeontnx ajdeathgiver
despite the tears this man has a point ive never been able to go past the first room in a complex because the rat containing the key has been killed hours previously and never respawnsfix please shouldnt be that hard for thisalthough on reflection ive just remembered i live in 00 and havent tried to run a ded compound in probably a year or longer
very true these need to either be instanced or fixed in some way its ridiculous that people can hang out in the complex harvest the key and destroy the gameplay in it for everyone the rats in there respawn so should the key
i think you severly overestimate how much new people care about whether bittervets who hate everything and most of whose main contribution to the game is scamssuicgankinglulzdecs play or notinb4 yeah gallians but there are some happy oldvets like tamber who make this game great i somehow dont see those quitting cause there are too many shinnies and too many new people that dont like surprise buttsecs in high sec tho
op i dont know who you are nor do i care who you are but i am pretty sure you are an idiot and know nothing of software development or have ever read a dev blog
well i never claimed to be involved with software development but i have read many dev blogs i based my estimate on the 64 bit data base conversion timeframe which as far as my understanding goes was not a huge project no need to be a  about it just let me know what you think about the proposal not me i dont care what you think about me
a rollback of the codebase is not technically feasible according to ccpeven someone like me who has been known to make outrageous modest suggestions from time to time doesnt have the anodized titanium nuts to suggest they do that even if i thought it was a good idea which i dont after 35 year in the software biz the mere thought of rolling back my own code more than a day produces prodigious and persistent palpitationsand you want 6 months the poor bastards who greenlighted that decision would find themselves bound gagged loaded into an authentic longboat doused in gasoline launched into the nearest fjord and given a traditional viking funeral and that would be the lunchroom staff giving them a quick and merciful death while the mob of outraged devs was distracted burning down ccp hq
in my software development experience rollbacks are for immediate reversion to a previous known working statetypically in response to a patch or something that utterly breaks critical functionalityyou dont rollback software to versions of six months or two years ago or whatever it is completely nonfeasible from both a technical aspect and due to the impact on usersthink about that impact for a minute since it would be absolutely mindbogglingly impossible to unravel all the interdepdencies and progress and gains and losses associated with player activity to cherrypick the ones that matter and should be preserved the only choice would be straightup rollback to an arbitrarily selected database state from the dominion timeframe that means that everything players have worked hard to build since thenalliances corporations sovereignty poss agent standings pi as  as it is etcwould all revert to what it was or wasnt because much of it didnt even exist in dominion everyone loses everything they have gained since dominion thats just stupid it is not possible to address that in a way that would satisfy the majority of players subscriptions would plummet as people ragequitlook as wanting as eve is for iteration and polish of existing features as unthrilled as some of us are about the direction ccp is taking it as irritating as fleet lag is for some of youyou can still log in and have fun the game works maybe not as good as it could work or as we wish it would work but it works and latelyat least in some areasthere has been really good focus and progress on some areas of the game that are crying for itseriously a rollback to a gamestate of monthsyears ago is a suggestion that cant even be taken seriously not for something as humongous everevolving and interdependent as the eve universe
caldari ships cause lag because of missiles apperantly  so they cant really make more missile ships and make lag worse can they
i think what you are failing to realize is that everyone who flies minmatar gallente and amarr complain about how the best weaponships for pve are missile based and how they have to train this other weapon that they have no use for outside pve to maximize iskhr honestly you should be happy that not only do you have the best pve ships but also dont have much else to train to pvp fairly well this is why there are so many people with caldari skillsif you were to complain about hybrids being the other weapon system for caldari and being pretty bad i would accept that complaint complaining about missiles not being an end all be all is a stretch
personally i think youre trollinim willing to admit i could be wrong but thats my initial impression
trolling in what wayat moment there are lots of threads about people complaining about the way insurance workspersonally i see no need for it and i think it would solve a lot problems if it was removedhow is this trolling
1 for obvious troll
im seriously lost herei honestly can not understand how i am trollingplease can somebody explain to me how talking about removing insurance is trolling
it just strikes me as a idea so terrible that it must be a trollwould completely support ccp getting rid of insurance signups and it just refunding automatically for ships tho

this 11 well maybe not so much the hull repping bonus but point well made
not supportedgot owned by one no need to nerfthere are plenty of counters for dramiels
there are plenty of counters for dramielswhat kind of frigsize counters for dramiels do you know in lowsec and in 00 space plz because some usable in low not usable in 00
or will change dramiel dronbay from 15 to 0
the dramiel needs a small nerf but only a small one it needs its drone bay removed falloff bonus removed or speed cut by 1015 pick one and only one some of the other faction ships are fine some are not the ashimmu bhaalgorn and entire serpentisangel lines are wonderful ships i wouldnt touch either as they represent exactly what the pirate faction ships should be however the cruor and pretty much the entire sansha line need some lovethe phantasm for example is a pure dps ship and yet it does less dps than the hacs its supposed to be superior to it needs a nice 5075 damage boost over what it currently has if it gets that then suddenly its a very appealing faction cruiser as such i would remove its tracking bonus in favor of a double damage bonus i would also add an additional turret to it 2 effective turrets due to role bonusthe cruor suffers from silly bonuses neuting bonuses are of no use on a frigate hull but the web bonus is great for a frigate as such i suggest dropping the neut bonus in favor of a web range bonus this would give it both a strength and range bonus to webs a very powerful comboi cant comment on guristas ships much but they seem to be very popular so my guess is they are fine as for those who think the ashimmu is crap its not crap just different it is not in direct competition with the pilgrim or the curse its a totally different beast and one that i like a lot you could boost its base speedagilityhp and i wouldnt complain but its bonuses are exceptionally powerful in the right hands i wouldnt dare trade the webneut amount bonus for a neut range bonus nor would i trade one of them for a web range bonus i have a cynabal dramiel bhaalgorn and tons of other shiny ships and yet ive run around in an ashimmu almost exclusively for the past month that says somethingedit forgot to support

summary the gameplay feature in null sec should be not limited to huge fleet combats only but at the moment roaming fleets benefit not really much to the alliance if it does that is probably kill some ratters and experience of combatfor realistic aspect it is hard to image that a rogue fleets intrude the system everyday but cause no loss to the vintim even no benefit for theirselvessolutionsoption 1anomaly spawn from the system holder there will be an anomaly spawns every 3 hours or more or any detailed time depends on the military level the anomaly will spawns a structure proteted by elite pirate frigates always the purpose for pirate frigates is to prevent the afk cloakers and the hitandrun tacticalonce the structure is dowm the military level of the system will be decreased by a precentage58option 2attackable ihub compounts low hitpoints means easy to get incaped but easy to repair also after the repairation there will be a reinforced timer to prevent repeatingattacksthe attackable ihub compounds will not be the current ones but some new little bonus to the system which apply topros encourges people to fleet roaming and locals to fight with the enermiesconsif the locals cant fight with the roaming fleet always then they will suffer from a lack of anomalies which will expand the gap between losers and winerstaking a system down may requires many stikes but ratting the military level back is fast and easyconstructive suggestions thank you i know it is far from a complete idea
because roaming into enemy space with a dozen ships and ganking a jf orca ratting carrier or a faction bs isnt enough
supported guerrilla tactics should be encouraged mechanics wise
going to start out with a link here to the previous thread this more or less continues and take a moment to laugh at virt who said this would never happenanyways the new ts mothershipi refuse to call these supercarriers because its a stupid ing name seems uninspired it has a lower ehp than a hel with the dps of a nyx and a jump range bonus thatleaves it able to almost jump what a carrier can but farther than anything else i dont really see that bonus coming into any useful effect beyond getting further out of combat after an op and back to ratting asap instead i propose giving it a titan esque bonus of 30 jump range to every capital and supercapital underneath your command slot in the fleet that shares your system when they initiate the jump this would not only give it a role but would make sure that these fragile supercaps are actually used for more than anomalies also they look ed but that can be handled another day
supported
i will support my own thread
good idea supportedshould it also affect titan bridge range im leaning towards no
i would also lean towards no lets make the titans jump themselves forward
dont think eve needs a direct boost to super capital hotdropping
supported
supporting a real fapital bonus
pffft fapitals are meant for sanctum farming why would you use a drake fapital for anything elsesarcasm
i like the idea a lot anything that would cause them to actually be used is a good thing
this is actually a pretty good ideaboosting the ability of supercap fleets to bounce around the galaxy annihilating everything in sight probably isnt a good move though unless theres some further modifications to their abilities restore a little balance between supercaps and regular caps first and then itd be an excellent modification
editnvm i did some more research and i changed my mind
if it happens i will sell the jf
thanks for the positive feed lots of you like the idea of carriers in high secwhat will happen about the price of them in high sec ill gues they drop alot if youre allowed too buy them there
neutral remote repping carriers in high sec niceeee no thanks
lies carriers get most like 50 shuttles at best what you are thinking of is when they put tons of shuttles in a freighter popped the freighter and smartbombed the shuttlesthe only reason ccp is stopping capitals from coming to highsec is bigger bullies punishing smaller bullies literally they dont want capitals to be used in highsec wars hell highsec wars are scum enough capitals can only improve the situation infact moros camping stations in highsec would fix highsec wars immediatelysupercaps have no business in highsec im sure everyone can agree theres no real reason for plain caps being restricted anymorethe reason they got banned originally was because people could tank concord and gank people in highsec thats fixed so lets get them back to highsec
your right giving all the jita station campers 510 capital neutral logistics guys is a great idea really are you kidding me hell 5 caps with 2 rr each is  what 15000 every 5 seconds hisec would be the lamest place on earth
a coil gun or guass cannon is a type of projectile accelerator that consists of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a synchronous linear motor which accelerate a magnetic projectile to high velocitya railgun is an entirely electrical gun that accelerates a conductive projectile along a pair of metal rails using the same principles as the homopolar motorthat said i actualy put forward a proposal to rename the prototype guass cannons so that the guass cannon could become its own weapon typeit would be cool however to be able to tune your shots but the only real advantage rails have  and its pretty small is that they can deal any damage type lasers are pure em thermal and projectils are kineticexplosive i would make it a standard set of 4 slugs with a modifyyable setting for the guns for range
are you mad hybrids have always been able to only deal kinetic and thermal and projectiles despite always dealing kinetic damage can choose damage types for example they will always do kinetic but they can also choose to do emkin emexpkin etc
this is patently false hybrids are easily the weakest weapon system in eve they dont excel in any area except hitting a stationary target that is within 5km
and this is why we dont listen to you  because you have no idea what youre talking abouteditemp ammo would like to have a word with you
this seems like a fun idea instead of different ammo ranges put a slider next to guns that determines projectile speed by using moreless capmore cap energy means more speed which translates to more damage but at the same time more recoil ruining your optimal due to error this would make them equivalent to lasers as far as choosing range goesthis doesnt help any with the main problem railguns have though while their dps isnt that bad the fact that they can outrange tachyons easily doesnt mean anything due to 250km range limit and annoying probing mechanics
op has a fairly good idea shift to cap stable for a structure shoot shift to high damage high cap for an alpha strike considering all the things that can modify cap or hybrid damage i kinda worry about the end result of such a mechanic also considering the current size of the overheat button i worry about how tiny a slider for the guns would actually be

do this ccp take this solution
bad solution since it removes an important decision from the gamebetter solutiongive every char after subscription around 2 mil of sp at his disposal the owner of the char can decide then whether he would rather like to fly a fancy ship emidiately or invest the skill points in the learnings you get 54 for 2 mil sp but i bet people would still complain since they would still have to make a decision and face the consequences
i like your solution but wouldnt it give instant skilled alts for a whole variety of things for instance a market alt freighter alt or even cov ops alt would all be either trained or almost trained within the free points combined with free trials it would give throwaway alt a whole new meaning not to mention insta suic ganking trialsi think the idea is to make training faster and more accessible to new people not provide infinite skilled alts
not at allthat why i said give every char after subscription around 2 mil of sp at his disposal on the sentece is maybe a bit f up d so the trial would still keep its purpose you would still train with bonus on your trial and thus have the opportunity to try different things as a new player however after you swith to a paid account you would reveive those 2 mil sp as a welcome gift so to say you could still create insta skilled traders but not for free the only difference to how it is now is that you dont have to wait for two months or to pay for a char transfer however to be honest i am happy with the system as it is right now it is just if they necesserily want to change the system this would be the only viable way for me to do it all other proposals i have read so far simply say give me the learnings for free and reimburce me with the juicy sps i have invested so far in them so i can fly the titan sooner its not like the people dont like the learnings they just dont want to pay for them
in theory i agree with you in practice the current method of measuring player support is stupid and cumbersome enough as it is we should be using an ideascale type site that allows votes updown instead were using these garbage forums and having people post commadelimited numbers using up to 3 chars per account on the honor systemif ccp really cared what the players wanted dont you think they could design a quick popup voting frontend in about two days they do it for the csm election how hard would it be to rejigger it to allow people to vote on proposals not veryhowever ccp doesnt really care what players want they want to design space barbie and console games and theyre happy to take your money to fund that development while they let you vote on whether they should think about making black ops eafs afs or field commands not totally worthless six months from now pick onealso santa claus is your parents they just eat the cookies and give you presents and the guy at the mall whose lap you sat on is probably an alcoholic
a good compromise might be to reopen the locked older threads and request that all relevant parties involved with any implementation read the entire thread in good faithi think that would be a good check and balance to a popularity contest and would probably head off some unforseen circumstances and unintended consequences at the very least
this is simply false the division in terms of ideas along these issues splits between players that want more sandbox and open pvp and those that want more themepark and pve free from pvp they are diametrically opposed and both will be interested in indirect changes as you put them both will also look for changes that directly effect the other group both are equal in terms of this form of votingi dont support your idea because the voting system is flawed to begin with since many players including many in the group you identify yourself with have multiple accounts also theres very few non superficial changes that i think wouldnt have strong opposition therefore giving negative votes real clout is a call to hold onto the statusquo ultimately ccp needs to decide whats changed and whats not they can serve us all best by making clear strong design choices being upfront on why they make the choices they do and the direction they wish to take the game  not by counting votes
ccp can easily eliminate most griefer decs by making highsec very fruitless and putting more isk into lowsec as well as by adding more lowsec and making more entry points into highsec so that lowsec is safersince highsec is noob space if youre big enough or rich enough to be griefer decced then youre too big to remain in noob spacethus i propose that ccp make more lowsec systems and increase the number of entrypoints from highsec to lowsec nerf highsec missions again possibly with a cap on highsec bounties reduce or remove the cap on the number of wars that corporations can declare increase lowsec rewards
awesomesupportedalthough the second point needs to be stronger and go way further
having an incentive to get out of highsec if you really want to earn isk seems like a logical idea
not supportedmainly because you encourage the use of a stick to get people out of where you dont want them and into where you do presumably so you have more targets stealth i want more people to shoot whinepeople dont go to low sec because they dont feel safe and cant effectively do pve which is a product of the people therepeople dont go to null sec because if they try to establish themselves they get stomped on by the alliances and it turns into a job rather than a gamethe sole solution should be and only needs to be buff lowsec change missions to require more pvp fits change mission npcs to be more like sleeper npcs add worthwhile features that only exist in lowsec im not talking just level 5 missions and ore but other stuff too and add more routes into lowsec so theres less chance of running into a gate campedit theres far to much nerf this  nerf that in eve and not enough buff this to make it worthwhile if you continue to nerf everything everything becomes rubbish and nothing is worth doing
not supported
i have to agree with sin its time to stop looking at what needs to be nerfed to get people to move and start looking at what can be reasonably buffed to accomplish that goalconsider thishighsec wh space and nullsec are all to a greater or lesser degree safer and more profitable than lowsec so why the hell would anyone go therethe issue with lowsec isnt that people dont go there  the issue is thay have no reason to go there nerfing high sec wont make them leave  theyll just adapt and make do or theyll quit the game you have to get them excited about going into lowsec ill be honest the only reason i ever go to lowsec is because theres a shortcut to jita that runs through rancer nothing else in lowsec interests me enough to put up with the risks of lowsec
have to agree with skinsin on this one not supported
reread and thought of itpersonally i will agree to lure more people into low sec and it will make eve a little more entertaining after all
i honestly dont care about getting more people to lo butbountieshighlownullthe ability for someone to be able to shoot you should factor into the reward hugely
im with buffing lowsec as well sure the 00 crowd will cry about it just like they did when bs rats were added to lowsec but more needs to be done
not supported high sec is nerfed enough buff lowsec not nerf high if anythingthere are a couple decent ideas like more entry points into lowsec but overall i dont see anything ccp could do to make low anything other than a gate camper hangout
not supportedonce again  i have nothing against boosting low sec as long high sec player dont get their style of play nerfed taking fun from one group to give it to another will cost ccp player and doenst take into account that despite the pure pvp intention eve is no longer home of only hardcore pvp fans or pvp fans at all id say war dec price should be raised to a amount which mirrors the wallets of the deccers and a variable fee for each ship taken down in high sec as insurances are often a topic it is only logical that the value which is payed out by the insurance would be taken from the war deccers corp mercs get payed like this  pay 100 misk for the wardec and replace me every shipoh and about the noobspace true noobs start there but there are more advanced player there then you think i saw loads of exnull players who have retired to highsec or experienced player who just dont want to go to low or null sec
less stick more carrot
this proposal suffers from a lack of good understanding of what a grief dec actually does on a broader scaleas well its the pitboss sacred duty to cleanse the universe of carebears wouldnt want to be mucking about in his fun
im not proposing removing level 4 missions the only change would be that people would get less isk for killing highsec npcssince the content would remain exactly the same nobodys play style will get nerfed theyll just get less isk for missioning in highsec
you obviously havent spent much time in lownull sec then im part of a nul sec alliance and the mear mention of any ship withing 30 jumps of are home systems causes a froth of hunting gangs that corner them and reduce them to constituent atoms the main point of this post is being able to do something to protect your smaller ships once your caught saying you shouldnt have been caught is not a smart argument  as every none consensual pvp pirate will agree to as they find plenty please refraim from posting any more use a scout posts as they are not constructive to the idea
this is the assembly hall not features and ideas discussion forumif you come here without a well thought through proposal  expect to have it shot down in flamesthe problem with this proposal is you are requesting very powerful optionsmodules based on a specific scenario  escorting vulnerable ships  without any consideration such modulesoptions would have on the other 98 of eve gameplaythere are allready plenty of ways of moving goods safelly even in null secdo we really need the devs spending huge amounts of development time on yet another 
im in the same alliance as you ive also been in null sec for longer than your character has existedyour comment about a ship being within 30 jumps leads to everyone running out to kill them is because we are in the nc nc space is not the same as any other part of null secneuts bringing haulers through nc space are committing suicide nc pilots on the other hand regularly fly their haulers around nc space unprotected we have caps cyno alts titan bridges and jump bridges for a reason in low sec if you are in a cloaky hauler you shouldnt die everim also a freighter pilot hauling ihubs and fuel around null is fairly safe with proper alliance support read titans and scoutsusually when we catch ships and kill them they are flying alone ive only once seen an escorted hauler fleet die and thats only because we hot dropped themi really really dont like collision damage ive been in blobs in eve long enough to know that idea would go bad fast
from my perspektive if someone uses bots to sell the isk for real money ccp sometimes finds them they ban them and remove the isk from the gamebut if you run a bot in a remote 00 system and use the isk only for yourself ccp does nothing even if you report them on multiple days for the same reason they still are online every day flying from belt to belt all the timethe only 2 reasons i see1 ccp only bans bots involved in rtm because it allowes poeple to pull money out of the game other bot doesnt decrease the profit of ccp2 i only cant see them be banned because ccp doesnt tell anyone also the devblogs talkt most of the time about rmtbotsgreetings hyperzerg

in so far as low sec is an arid wasteland of piracy where people stay only for the shortest amount of time possible and usually on their way to somewhere else unless they are setting omg pwnz0r peeveepee gatecamps and there is no realistic way to change the situation and make these spaces useful for anything boosting ratsmissionsetc good luck these are activities the masses need some kind of protection to do and where for a long time it has seemed to be an interest of ccp and lowsec denizens to attract more people to their lovely lands i propose this innovative solutionget rid of lowsec altogetherwhy1 no good way to populate it if you nerf high sec people will quit playing not develop a sudden interest in getting ganked2 not enough points of entry generally there are chokeholds where the aforementioned camps are ran for fun and profit and empty space everywhere but3 this dearth of population in potentially very interesting areas the rancer pipe for example scream of wasted potentialhow to fixmy proposal involves a few things1 players tend to either hang in concord space or claimable space thus make low sec into either this is either concord on everything but 00 or make everything 04 and down claimable2 add access points and jumps to connect more systems with nullsec minimizing the current chokeholds and providing alternate routes3 make poss in claimable space less than 05 but more than 00 be not discriminatory in docking rights but providing taxes and docking fees of a reasonable amount to prevent removal of docking rights via lol 300 mill fees to sov holding alliance providing an incentive to hold these lands4 everything else in lowsec stays about the same except perhaps increasing mission payout and bounties with a  going to sov holder no moons are created in these places howeverresultgive a better transition for players between concord and sov territory encouraging landowners in important pipes like rancer to provide protection for neutrals and creating a use and potential for the vast amounts of space that are currently nothing but gate camp playgrounds where people only usually go by autopilot accidentsalso put interesting high stake wars in more easily accessible places for the new and newish players to experience while creating new business opportunities for established alliances and players via supplyingprotectingpirating the newly interesting lowsectldr sov in lowsec taxes for holding alliance more lowsechighsec connecting systems higher mission and ratting payouts in lowsec than now
low sec wont ever disappear theres 2 thing which need to change to fix low sec1 remove gate guns replace with system wide concord npcs who do more or less same dps but are destructible and no ewar this gives some security to lowsec beyond stations and gates2 create antipirate incentive my suggestion is faction warfare mechanics for pirate vs antipirate bringing antipirates to lowsec creates incentive for piratesthis does one major thing pirates cant sit around all day on empire gates and get away with it which really bring nonpirateantipirates to the space
1 is covered in the make it claimeable proposal with the idea that this will encourage sov holder to provide protection making this be done by players and not npcs but i agree with the idea there must be some protection and gate guns are pointless garbagei like the idea for anti pirate fw maybe a concord faction for lp towards concord ships the concord cruiser is beautiful and its a shame we cant fly it anti pirate fw would give a incentive for people to hang out in low but doesnt really address camps thoughalso supporting my own proposal
sov will make it 100 times worse the only lo sec systems that will be claimed will be by the big 00 powersyou thought a battlecruiser sitting on a gate was bad try a super carrier it would just increase the blob out of null sec and ruin small gang piracylow sec isnt perfect but it is wild space with no bubbles and using the map function you can navigate it fine this would be a bigger excuse not to go down there
no i dont think that caps or super caps should be allowed over 00 and i apologize if the proposal is unclear on this although 01 to 04 would be claimable the idea is for players to provide concord like services for them this is also why no moons should be created here or other null sec mechanics brought in the profit should be in encouraging people to use the systems not only those in your own alliance via taxation and not so much on just holding themso there would be no super carriers but perhaps sov holder fleets guarding gates and roaming to make sure no shennanigans happen and or warping to gankings you know player provided securityby not being too profitable compared to actual null smallmedium alliances may claim these systems also giving easier intro to holding territory and spreading it to more playersfinally it creates a market incentive to run good systems if you dont people will use other better protected low sec systems encouraging effective protection since it would be tied to profits
supportedlow sec needs some sort of security right now its less secure than null gate guns dont do anything
thats the ideal but the chances of that are slim to none they would just turn around and shoot anything that moves if penalties for this are put in they will have the sov holder be an alt and continue anywaythere are a ton of pirates who would abuse the mechanic for there gain instead of providing protection and that will continue as long as killmails hold value of anykind the people who want the protection are just not around in the numbers or willing to provide the supportkillmails are just worth to much as a commodity to make it valuable
i do not support your idea but i do think low sec needs a makeover i think some parts need to become npc space without npc missionhigh true sec something like syndicate everyone can dock its the same as lowsec clusters now
well in my view the market would ensure that things change if there is an incentive to providing security and you want that incentive you have to do at least as good a job of providing it as the neighbors and with no jump bridges capitals or other 00 mechanics people would actually have to hang in these systems and actively guard them thus encouraging active participationbut lets say this doesnt happen and people just harvest killmails even though holding the system and making it functional to missionrat in is more valuable well then things stay about what they are now and it is my belief that at least in some places things would change for the betterthere really is no way to abuse the mechanic especially if updates are provided even via the news blurbs at logion of what lowsec systems are safer as people would gravitate there and away from noob killmail farms as they do now
except the issue that null sec ratting and anoms are so much more valuable so for the low low price of setting a pirate corp to blue thay can effectivly shut down the gate meanwhile any group that wishes to create an effort to dislodge the pirates will be blobed out of existance by the null secers our corp even now has a similar deal with a few lo sec corps which allows us to travel a dangerous pipe without resistance you can bet that most lo sec regions will begin to operate this way shutting down many of the pipelines making even harder for new corps to enter null any money they could make from taxes would be more then easily off set by the massive ammount of isk flowing out of null secall in all it will make gate camping much worse and make getting a foothold in sov even harder
nice troll not supported low sec is just fine ive lived there 2 years and have no intention of leaving also there are tons of entry points the real choke points are to null sec though amazingly about half of those are directly from high sec to null sec thats not to say low sec is perfect it could use some tweaking but the basic mechanics are good if you think its a barren wasteland take a look in hophib lvl4s amamake arena egghelende arena auga fw sahtogas lvl5s aschee lvl5s kamela fw houla fw tama fw get the idea there are tons of low sec systems with very large populations most of low sec is devoid of life but its the same with null sec and even much of high seclow sec need not be removed it needs to be expanded we need more fw navies to join id love to join the blood raiders that should be added the minor empires as well like ammatar mandate and thukkar tribe these are just some basic ideas and they dont delete the game for large numbers of players your proposal is about as likely to happen and rational as me requesting the deletion of nonnpc null sec
mission rewards bounties insurance and overseer personal effects i believe adding new isk to the overall system of eve is bad it devalues it in some way some isk disappears such as buyingtrading npc goods skill books clone costs paying for insurance sovereignity costs etc modules ships  moon materials only add items that are paid for with isk etc its the isk that is the problemthere are other isk sinks such as players leaving although players returning can also be an isk faucetthere should be steps taken to destroy sources and eliminate isk accumulationcould such measures include removing overseer effects making some missions require a bigger fee so if you fail a mission you lose millions remove npc trading remove insurance entirely from the game and reduceremove rat bounties so only the itemssalvage are the reward make plexes able to be destroyed more easily what could be done to reduce isk entering the game
well since ccp really seems to want microtransactions have them use isk instead of plexhow about changing facelifts for plex to facelifts for isk maybe adding name changes for isk this would need to be recorded on a character history or other nongame affecting mostly thinggs for isk not plex
the big disadvantage of the client is a huge number of windows needed to solve various problemson other hand not all of windows are needed at the same moment for example while scanning one of the windows needed to trade in jita  others etcmy suggestion  save the settings of windows layout and the ability to quickly switch between themto this end in each of the saved settings are stored position ui elements and their statusthe switch can be added to the neocom and give the power to assign keyboard shortcut
basically virtual desktops
i proposed this exact thing a while back and i think it would be a great improvement over the current clusterfck of ui windows there are right now
actually you have it backwards as the star moves toward you the frequency of the light wave increases which is a blue shift anyway not that it matters but in warp normal spectral light would be at such high frequency we woe not be able to see it it would be a total blackout or the ship would glow from the intense bombardment of high energy collisions glad its just a game
no thats corect the red shift is what happens when you have a high frequecy of light not a high wavelength the blue shift happens wen the frequency lowers thus when relitave speed comes in to playsay for instance oosun1 you sun2sun 1 and sun two have the same chromatic value of say green for instance dont ask me how a sun can operate with such a high copper contentwith a visual specturm exactly the same and the output exactly the sameas you approach the speed of light towards the direction of sun 1 the wavelength is compressed thus givving the illusion that the frequency has increasedthus turning red while the wavelength of sun2 has elongated givign the illusion that the frequency has lowered thus turning blue due to the time that it takes to complete a single cycle in the frequencywhile i would agree that it woudl look pretty bad visualy to make it entirley factual where warp eventualy turns you in to a hadron colider particle and every thing behind you is black and every thing in front of you is white i just think it woudl be a little more comforting to see the warp bubble switched to make a little more sense
no its correct as it is it would appear bluer at the front and redder behind its you who has it backwardsto those who claim i am wrong look it up or if youre absolutely too lazy to bring yourselves to do it ill post a link or something
ah yeas like i said before my science and space knowledge is wrong i did do a look up on the red shifting subject and what you say is corect moving away form something makes it red and movign twoards makes it blue i concede that now thank you for bringing that to my attentionheres the proof hes right guys
nope ull be running into light that had already left the star a long time ago so looking behind u while in warp would mean ur technically looking back in time but im sure we all knew thatthinking thered be no light at all behind you would mean uve only considered the light thats left to reach u at the time ur warping around and not all the light present and flying around prior to you warping all over the place bt yahh as u said its only a game after alli vote for seeing giant pink space elephants when warping around to add to the fantasy that im playing a game and not participating in real life p
if you read the back stories you will find somewhere  cant remember where  that once you are in warp you are actually inside a total vacuum warp bubblethat means no mass inside the bubble  except you   no enery either of any sortno em radiation  no vacuum energy  nothingthe fact that you can still see is due to the fact that the pod computer generates a vr image for your brainno need for red shifts  blue shiftsand btw go read your science books again becauseheading towards something  higher frequency  blue shiftheading away from something  lower frequency  red shiftallways believe everything you read on wiki
bring back classic red shift this current excuse for an effect is bad
ok how about they make eve silent cause there is actually no noise in space in rl
obligatoryeve has soundobligatory
i just wish these tunnels generated a visible effect not necessarily as obvious but ala babylon 5 would be nice
part from the fact there is sound in space duhsound leaps across a vacuum after all
proposal  log off all characters after 1 hour of player inactivity a minimum of one keyboard command sent to serverpros emphasizes that shipscharacters dont work without players consistent with the antibotting rules incremental reduction in ccp variable expenses even if only saving the expense of sending chat information market update information etc even 14 of one percent improvement in those incremental costs might mean the ability to hire an additional contract employee for 6 months small improvements are not useless moderates angst slightly moderates certain grievances that give some players a distaste for the game because of percieved inbalance and rl principles of what is model competitive play while at the same timeallowing existing afk tactics to be used by players not completely absent cons eliminates an existing game mechanic intended or not that has been adopted as a tactical tool in terms of surprise and psychological warfare  people may want to have a recent chatfleet history to returnd to when the return to play after a few hour break and this would prevent that creates a hardship for some players who might have many clients open or be tabbed out of the game and forces them through the tedious process of logging back in if they forget to check in once an hour might give another advantage to cheaters with technical knowhow to fake a player at the keyboard response
this will also hurt people who are providing covert surveillance of stargates or jump bridges well be on voice comms for a long period and being logged out after an hour of watching the gate simply because all communications were happening outside the game doesnt seem like a fair cop to me
no
hell no
1 first of all why would u think macrosbots cant make keyboard strokes fyi programs dont have to physically hit the keys to do so2 hardly worth implementing when it all boils down to afkcloak whining3 competitive this isnt world of warcraft where lines r drawn and matches r controlled this is eve aka cat and mouse baiting and above all terrorizing your victims no matter wherewhohow many they hide behindif u cant even handle the thought of someone who cant even hurt u then wow is that way
this is an absolutely awful idea
cons outweigh pros in this noand personally i play eve with a mouse not a keyboard go find an fps if you wanna play with a keyboard
do you realize that tech ii and tech iii ships already have built in bonuses for these types of resistance built into their shield and armour resistances and tech i ships have a bonus like this built into their armouractually the built in bonus is more significant than the difference that you are proposing

was looking for a skill to train and started to bite the bullet on doomsday operation 5 and noticed that it requires energy pulse weapons the thing has been not aoe for over a year as an easy fix maybe remove energy pulse weapons smartbomb skill since the dd is not a massive super smartie any more
after a bit of thinking how about this1remove energy pulse weapons from doomsday operation 2make it so doomsdays require the racial capital weapon at v ie judgement needs capital energy turret v ragnarok capital projectile leviathan citadel cruise erebus capital hybridthis will increase the training time for people to gain access to a titan but shouldnt affect current pilotsso supported only if another prequisitry is added
there is nothing wrong with the doomsday prerequ
you are really sure that loosing eg amarr cruiser 4 wouldnt lock out amarr bs aswell

please introduce a means of converting cash paymentplex into security status andor standings increasesthis is the only useful application for the plex for  that i and probably many others would be interested in and would be well worth the effortthank you
plex for sec status get
this is a great idea
how much sec gain per plexi cant see this abused at all
not supportedhuge chance to abuse it with no drawbacks for getting into negative sec status or faction standing
sliding conversion rate how about spending billions to get max standings that seems quite negative
after the t1 insurance nerf its about time
maybe there will be a limit to how high your standings can get by using plex
this would be awesome i would suicide gank freighters all the time if i could repair my sec status with plex bad idea
plex for sec status no mate i dont think sonot supportedlax
not supportedif you have done wrong in high sec you should have to put in the time to fix your standingsotherwise i will throw in 20 bux next month and go pod a bunch of hulks without any loss
isk not plex plex inflation is crazy having people with irl money getting rich in game by spending 100 on plex is stupid1bil for faction standings raised from negative to 500 and every time after that year add another 200mil too italso no sec status raise for any amount have fun ratting
seeing that i clicked the wrong button and i actaully do not support the threadi am giving a thumbs down post somehow to offset my support for this ideaoops
real bad idea no
we are moving into microtransactions era adapt or die supporting
a lot of these naysayers have pretty weak arguements against imho but there is a lot of negativityperhaps a lowimpact solution rather than outright buying standings or security status indefinately there can be some restrictions only being able to reset standings or security status  ie to 0 being limited to how often it can be done ie 612 month intervals harsher secstandings penalties if you pirate after buying back your secstandings ie pirate resets sec status to 0 goes off and suicide ganks a hulk within the 612 month cooldown period gets double the sec status drop has to pay double the amount to get it back to 0with certain restrictions in place there shouldnt be any problem even so i dont really foresee pirates willing to spend billions of isk a month just to keep himself in highsec  this solution is more for the casual gamer like myself who may find himself wanting to increase his sec status without having to spend weeks changing his entire gameplay to do it
you can edit your postnot supported for this reason
lets think this throughit would take about 1213 t2 fit battleships to do this first of all so thats about 15 billion isk down the drain then theres the cost of plex for each pilot  another 45 billion or soso if youre up to spending 6 billion isk every few days to gank some freighters then by all means please inject this into the economy and drive down plex prices
the ability to run races which allow you to set waypointswarping to planet 2 in jita or docking at a station also setting rules such as no combat allowed or no high sec
this has already been done by other people whats stopping you

if some useful csmrelated features come out of the expected forum redesign for free or close to free then that is one thing but i for one would feel more than a bit guilty about proposing that ccp divert devhours into something that basically benefits 9 players as opposed to the players as a wholebesides i can whip up apps like my vote tabulator in my sleep im so old i dont write code anymore i just remember it and type it in again and it has the benefit that if a new feature is needed i can just hack it inps me saying i decide was just shorthand ill make a list of the possible combinations based on player feedback and run it by the rest of the csm before actually making them and will post the raw data most likely
any time line on the deliverable rough estimate maybe
take this idea make it chance based like 15 chanceallow only 1 defense missile to be shot at oncethis means they will be worth something stopping a volley every 6 volleys or we

but at least people calming to represent 80 of eve players will have something behind them or much more probably it would be show that they represent a tiny minority and what they say is mostly hot air
csm is an example of why majority isnt always right easy way to see this is well get 2 people 1 from a huge nap and the other a nobody get them to say identical proposals and the guy from the huge mega nap will get mass supportedmy early work as musical fist was to prove this every now and then i would make an identical thread of a famous person interestingly enough my ideas were hardly supportedbesides when a nc is running for csm they spam vote for me and always get in how else do you think darius got in a few terms ago it clearly wasnt because of skill  logicfortunately this term theres a few decent csm people who actually care about eve and not getting another free vacationtrolling part removed jericho

i think all that there is to say has probably already been said but stillaccepting the caldari for pve amarr for face melting gallente for mwding then exploding ect ethos does more to homogenise the field of play than anything when someone questions nullsec pvp crystalising into drakescimizealotguardian encounters or vagabonds and dramiels becoming the dominant force in small man skirmishes the first answer should not be lol crosstrain then you scruuuuuuuubs ccp should be constantly striving to balance the game as otherwise it marginalises a massive portion of possible ships and fits as well as the players who put the sp into using them thus destroying the rationale of each ship is situational when clearly some situations are far more likely to happen than others theres simply no debate to whether level 5 in amarr battleships is currently more valuable than level 5 in gallente battleships obviously factions shouldnt get carbon copies of eachothers ships but there should always be atleast a one ship per faction per general situation without being too much of an obvious weakness to your fleet or just plainly being too innefective to be there hi there brutixferoxhyperioneagledeimosoneirosbasiliskect it isnt just a caldari thing thoughi personally think were fine on having all the bases covered and torps can be used with all bombers too btw theres serious issues with destroyers as a whole class electronic attack ships as a whole class hybrid guns and lets be honest gallente ships in general its really just endemic to the balance situation as a whole
no
no
no
no itll change eves model of what you put into the game you get out
i should have never trained for gallente its so demoralising to see so many posts on hybrids go unnoticed come voting time  hybrids are not even recognized as a problem i wonder why are gallente a minority of the player base
because someone at csm didnt do their jobthis threadissue can be found somwhere on the csm wiki and minutesi am too lazy to link it nowbut if you read that you see that the csm member said that blasters need more range and pointed to this threadmost of the csm disagreed that they need more range so the issue was abandoned and i agree with them boosting range is not the answer then blasters would just be the same as ac and lasersi am like you amazed that noone in csm read the whole thread and that noone raised another issue about it
i think that cut the speed by 10 and reduce drons from 3 to 2 will be enough
it bascially rules in fw   and many people dont bother trying to fight one
daredevil you know the frigate that trumps every single frigate out there as in blasting them to smitherines instead of running away from themnot supported
confirming everyone in support of this idea has had a dramiel touch their weewee
im not supporting this but on a technicalitywhat we need is not dramiel balance but universal balance i want to see a large scale attempt at rebalancing every ship in the eve universe the problem is this would be an enormous job and the question would primarily be where the hell do we startthink bigger
after 19 years of marriage this is probably true only in the technical sensemy wife is getting me a tshirt that saysi only do what the voices in my wifes head tell her to tell me to do
this need moar bump tbh come on its easy to implement benefit to gameplay is great dooo eeeeet
awesome idea is awesomesupported
supported basically a good idea i want that too
great idea reallysimple but effective

simple and effective ideas supported

just do something anything to fix hybrids already it has been years
instead of 3 range groups like projectiles how about just 2 range groups short 50 and long 60
one of eves challenges is to find a connection to people youre fighting against while in battle since the ships are miles away they arent exactly right in front of you unless you do a lookat or happen to be flying close to thema great way to increase the level of immersion and player uniqueness is to display the actual ship instead of a static icon each ship thats targeted displays as if you were looking at them from the direction of your ship any custom ships if they give us custom paint or decals in the future would show up also give us a quick expand button that quickly expands one target to a larger window showing the targeted ship as its flying around and the player whos flying italso when the ship blows up the target should stay there briefly while the explosion lasts at least until the debris shows up it would help make battles much more fun i think obviously all of these new options could be turned off if the user wants
i like this
why not
love it
i like it
or rotate the module so you can see the entire model like a heads up display on a real starship showing weaknesses and other things about the ship you are shooting
yes or at the very least an icon which communicates the class of the ship i can barely tell the difference between a titan icon and a drone iconedit i misunderstood the purpose of this but i support it anyway
yup i could see the 3d aspect possibly adding client preformance problems but it could always be an option to toggle it on or off and a sencond 1 to a way to tell what class frig criser etc it is
only if it can be turned offi sometimes play eve on my old laptop and im shure not all players have newest hardware
supporting dis just imagine what the alliance tournament would look like then
wtf ppl are all carebears 16  kill another fregate classes106  more afk l4 carebearing owhy really usable things like gallenter ewar or mercenary contractstransferable killrights arent in top who are you people voting for that hello kitty online

nothing in reality will last forever if you repair something it will not be new if you use it often it will wear out the older it gets the more rusty and broken it will become after some long time you need to replace itput a timer on ships and items when they are usedmake a repair in station not 100 so that its new make it something below 100 so that after some time you want to get a new ship if you can afford itthis will boost the market this will generate a logical isk sink
sounds logicalperhaps you should propose numbers though perhaps there should be different quality repair stations that repair it better or worse changing the life expectancy
very nothis idea is bad and you should feel bad
not supportedi dont want to have to buy a new ship after for example 60 days because it aged and is thus less effective
terrible idea this would literally kill 00 every so often you would have to completely replace dozens upon dozens of infrastructure and csaa pos including the csaa itself which costs billions to replace not to mention supercaps would eventually have to be replaced this would be an incredible bane on all but the richest eve players i happen to be one of those rich ones so this wouldnt really hurt me beyond the annoyance of producing ship after ship that takes months to build nearly endlessly to keep the one im using repaired but it would destroy the eve economy
if you dont use the ship it shouldnt age the timer only should count while you are using itmaybe a counter who counts how many hits you got or anything what dont cause lagof course people wont like the idea to buy a new ship after a while using it nobody likes that really nobody wants to become older in real life too we love the idea of being undestructable immortal never losing anything because of aging cumulate isk easily  just it doesnt work that way economy needs aging thats why mother nature let you die after a reasonable time to free up place for something newand of course small tech i ships are aging faster then big expensive or tech ii or tech iii ships its all matter of numbers scaleableof course you can repair ships but every time you need a repair the ship looses a bit of its shinyness and becomes older you can still use it repair it again and again but one day you want a new one
so you want to present a concept to put into the game that even you yourself admit no one wants forwhat
trolling and attention whoring thats my theory anyway
back in my day we didnt have fancyschmancy warp drives or jump gates i remember when i had to travel from amarr to jita uphill both ways in the snow with nothing but a snickers bar and aokay seriously just no
my proposal will solve lots of problems eve has now there will be a logical and fair isk sink the more you have the richer you are the more isk you will have to pay so noobs without isk wouldnt get a big drawback because the cost for the aging of eg a rifter would be marginal and affordablepvp player who often loose their ships anyway wouldnt feel bad with agingbut players with fully overpimped ships cant fly their marauders or supercapital forever just an example i am playing eve for many years now i have one faction fitted marauder which i am flying now for more then 3 years i can do level iv missions with this ship with marginal isk even when i fall asleep during a mission the tank saves me and it happened that i warped back to a station with 5 in hull burning  i just press the repair button and my ship is brandnew again i have the feeling that this is wrongaging will boost market and i am pretty sure builders and industrials gonna like that idea its an isk and mineral sink the eve economy really needs
no the eve economy doesnt need this when there is hyper inflation there isnt any now then say that it needs something like this but still not this because aging is the worst concept of this type you could bring into the gameif you take a look at markets most things sell at very little profit over their production cost and inflation on most things other than plex is minimaleve has an excellent system for stabilizing market prices its called station traders and an excellent isk sink people who hoard their isk sure it doesnt get rid of the isk for good but it does take it out of the system since eve is limited by skill points in which ships one can fly regardless of wealth even the very rich have a very strict limit on how much of that wealth they can use for anything practical anywaythis means that traders already keep isk out of the system and prices low and thus even though the amount of isk is expanding its not creating pretty much any problemsyour proposal would destroy accumulated wealth for no practical benefit and effective detriment people would quit en masseso very no
do you have a screenie of the ships info card from the test server just like to look it over to see its full profile before voting yes or no also lazy
nice writeup and great idea ccp already stole your idea the first time around ed so they should totally steal this one too totally supported
although i dont mind the name supercarrier a faction one shouldnt be completly uselesssupported
i would also appreciate someone from ccp letting us know if the game mechanics would even allow this it looks easy to do from a player perspective but i dont want to waste time promoting a thread if its physically impossible to code into the gamelike salvage drones
i can dig it
10
a version of condi for this
it would almost make this ship worth flying supported
yes
supportedroles and right management really really need a lot more lovepos management like this would be a start still there is much more to fix on that painful issue
nice idea
missed by a lotfirst 30k veld per minute is around 3000m3min on a dread you can get a max around 500m3min so lower your number 6 times thats 66mday then currently the price of veld is less than 70 iskm so your number of 292k isk per minute based on 3000mmin should be 210k iskmin that means lowering the final nomber by another 20so 500m  70isk  60 minutes  23 hours  48mdayalso like you said yourself cargohold got nerfed so you have 5 times less cargo than a hulk wich means you have to warp 5 times more often so you cant afk without a bot wich is against eula and also you warp around a lot slower than a hulk so you would loose a lot of time about chribba i dont know a lot of changes were made in the last years i dont think he mines any moreand back on topicneutral rr carrier  i didnt think of that thats a valid reason not to have them in hisec atleast untill neutral rr agression and docking games are changedso untill then i withdraw my support
bear in mind that properly fit carriers typically field between 600k to 1 mil ehp and can locally rep about 500 to 1000 dps a second even if the aggression mechanics behind rring were changed it wouldnt change much for carriers
i like this idea and i believe i can push it one step furtheralso include the ability to increase cap usage to increase tracking and viceversa that would absolutely give hybrids a clear niche to work within by being able to increase tracking andor range without modsand working even better with themyou have highly viable guns with a meaningful and balanced drawback ie you cant fire your guns if you dont have the cap and ammo of course
supported it would be sweet if it was done like t3 guns were supposed to be done and given scripts to modify them on the fly it fits well for gallente to because they are often considered the jack of all trades master of none race caldari sortof is to
this would be a welcome change that will break the monotony of combatsupported
so ram up to full cap usage for a hideous alpha then be cap dead for the rest of the fight which would actually make llente ships useful as alpha snipers or for rr pos shoots as they would do much more damage for the number of hybrid charges included or settle in for the long haul chipping paint off the other ships but being able to tankinteresting proposalorr how else would this mechanic workintroducing tracking scripts or having some kind of doubled up slot ammoa script might overcomplicate things same thing with other proposals but i do like the idea of hybrids having a slidey scale instead of just a 255075 script that might give them a bit more flavor vs the other weapons whose modifiers are fitted into very discrete objects
heh i want to use 11
god yes please
i know rightplease visit your user settings to reenable images
yeah but how many people joining the game would know about this thing after sub none probably so they would still be stuck in this learning skill thingy where they would quit the game before they subcribed which would make your idea useless this topic is trying to make it so new players can enjoy the game without haveing to go through a bunch of waiting first
yes and no yes in that the option to vote yes on a negative effect may be available there are several items on the list for this round of voting that do not have negative direct interaction counters available to vote for therefore your assumption is falseno in that being able to vote no on an issue will be a powerful balancing tool to prevent indirect actionists pve players from proposing a negative direct interaction idea
i do agree that lowsec mechanics fix is in order increasing the payout for level vs or offering even better quality agents in low sec but nerfing high sec is not going to substantially increase the chances of more people in low sec if anything itll make the vast majority ed off 80 of eve live in high secnevertheless this will not be supported for the original purposes of the op because griefers will only continue to grief because they can this will only make it easier for wardecers to find easier prey this does not solve the problem and asking griefers to play nice will only just make them work harder for the delicious tears of newbletts
people dont go to low sec because there isnt enough incentive reallyno people dont go to low sec because its become a tear wrangling shoot on site  hole even pirates are leaving low sec nowadays its what actually happens when you give a large group of players an area to freely kill whoever they want with almost no consequencefirst it becomes a slaughter house then it becomes a wasteland what ccp needs to eliminate isnt griefer decs its low sec take what is now low sec and split it up between empire space and null sec then open pvp arenas through high sec where people who want to fight can go to fight without all the smart bomb gate camping and pretend pirates that have made low sec the tumbleweed headquarters of new edenor you know whatever i dont actually care but i thought id just give my worthless two sense regardless party on capsuleers
not supportedhighsec already is nerfed enough there are people here who like to play the game more peacefully thats what high sec is forin fact i would like to get rid of 10 people even if they are in a podthey should get shot by concord instantly
what bliss it must be when you run around with such an ignorance getting less isk out of lvl 4 is as much a nerf as taking away lvl 4 and put them into low sec to earn as much you would need to go to low sec therefore my playstyle would be nerfed the same thing happened already to miner when you could earn about 10 miskhr in high sec two years ago its now far less combined with favoring ganker in highsec
not supporteddoes nothing to address griefer decs artificially tries to populate a space that people arent interested in by destroying one in which they arethis solves no problems and creates quite a few
everyone knows there is a ton of macroratting macromining and courier botnetting in this game ccp doesnt do anything unless they link the account to rmtand it sucks i dont want to have to compete with automated programsdoes anyone else remember reading about the game and about say mining and thinking that it would be lucrative and important that there would be escorts for mining ops in dangerous territory its basically for afkers and botters and as such its unimportant and unlucrativei dont understand the previous responses yes its against the eula and yes ccp can ban people for botting but they obviously dont go to ingunn and count the bestowers piloted by laura4398 and fred78927laksjdsupported
1 typically a proposal is in the form of this is whats wrongwhat i think might be cool this is what should be done not wah wah wah i dont read eulas nor know how to use a search function so i want the csm to hold my hand wah wah2 enforcement of the eula is solely ccp  the gms domain the csm has no oversight into this yeah we can complain about it again search function this has been brought up before but its up to ccp to actually enforce their own rulesor have the gms actually play the friggin game so they know whats actually going on and understand game mechanics
yeah this topic is retarted even if csm approved this or whatever they could never actually make the s over in ccp actually do anything its up to ccp alone go make a petition or something oh wait ive done that several times about different things and they do nothing
supportedcapsuleer is a great utility its for me a part of what eve online is intrinsically and to see it go to trash is seen for me as the destruction of a corporation you played in for two years it hurts basically i think it is a real shame to let it goplease find solutions to maintain it
im with the op though id personally like to see low sec become pirate faction space held by sansha angel and the like in this space you would have to pay the faction patrols to enter or leave their space as well as for protection from rogue pvprs players with low empire standings could go there and enlist with say the sansha to fly as part of their patrols and get paid to fly as protection for transports and mining opsthink of it as a wild pirate version of high sec where the concord is a mix of npc and player groups that get paid up front for services
this is what i proposed in another threadthe core problem with low sec is that ccp has allowed it to become infested with pirates who rarely suffer for their criminal actions sec loss is all too easily done and npcs dont react fast enough or pod pirates for it to ultimately matter to these players if they need to travel to high sec
i agreeill put it slightly differently while saying the same thing roughly  id like to see lowsec go even lowersec eliminaate concords presence there and get rid of the sec status hits basically make it npc 00 without bubbles or bombs i like bubbles and bombs just fine in 00  its just another flavor and allows a few different options in fleet size and makeupit would be interesting if there was a way for people to install some sort of lower tech jump bridges without sovereignity maybe one node per account linkable to another player with mutual assentthose player not corporation jump bridges could be a way to lure a few more players in with a method of safe transit perhaps a business of tolls for jump rights and safe pos access by feeso make it more dangerous for lack of concord but more managable to avoid attackcapital combat without bubbles and ban supercaps  idk basically the contes
do you remember when faction warfare came out at first it was truly fun you could log on and get in a fight within minutes you could control the size of the ship that faced you i remember intel being posted on a pirate gate camp and a fleet of disorganized individuals descending on that gate in mass to break it up there are too many cool things that could be done with low sec just off the top of my headcorruption  rather then get rid of the gate guns use your influencebribery skills to pay them off pay off your negative security status make it expensive bribe concord so that you dont show up in local used by pirates and antipirateshire npc mercenaries to accompany youif you were an empire how would you appeal to the populace to move to a lawless area less taxes and greater benefits give low sec absolutely no transaction manufacturing or research taxes boost those taxes in high sec to create a discrepancy that actually appeals to peoplemake npc corporations either all high sec or all low sec this prevents lps from being transferred in my next suggestion  make more exotic rewards in the stores available only in low secfaction drops only available in low secminerals and such only available in low secgamblingpirates vs concord faction warfaremy last point is that people are hungry for small group and solo pvp low sec is the last area where you could really make it happen
also to the guy above add drugg production and trade maybe have certain highsec system have some crackheads who need there blue pills drug running should be a profession imo and manufacture should naturally be in lowsec
that proposal is fairly bad the way the pirate gets punished is there are mechanics there that once heshe kills you you have killrights then you can kill him anywhere without any problems from npcsall your idea would do is encourage people to bring larger blobs to kill single ships so when those npcs spawn the fleet kills them your proposal would discourage small ships and solo pvpto the op low sec is good as it is it may need a little tweaking but largely its great and alot of people love not having the politics of 00 there
hell ya make low sec sov claimable i would love to take over black rise to make our tech moons easier to defend and to completely cut off access to those mission hubs except to blues  this is why this is an awful idea
i would love to see low sec claimable only by corporations not in an alliance give a chance for corporations to dip fingers into sov holdingjust a watered down version of null sec even allow for ihub upgrades
this isnt a bad idea till you take into account that alliances will simply put forth alt corporations and back them with the strength of their entire alliance
i like the idea of fixing lowsec and creating market incentives for it being safer with player provided security or concord either seems a lot better than what there is nowas long as no bubbles or caps it would be interesting smaller fleet warfare and if profit is much smaller than moonsetc big alliances should lose their interest in it soon enough leaving it for smallernewer guys
you can do that already the only difference is that with the changes there would be an incentive to make the systems both inhabited and relatively safe since you wouldnt be able to discriminate with docking rights bring bubbles caps or have jump bridges if you wanted to hold sov in these places you would actually have to patrol them and if you are just trying to keep them closed well you would have no benefit to holding it beyond what you get nowwhat the proposal does is that if a group or groups of smaller corps that feel like patrolling the system want to hold it and make it livable they can and they get passive income from ittldr you can already camp the systems the difference is that atm there is no benefit to not camping them the idea is giving one
terrible idea not supportedhave lived in lowsec for about 2 years and its the only place ive found you can get away from the mouth breathers in highsec and nullsec theres a neat little idiot filter at the edgeslowsec needs more nonpvp incentives not some bastard transformation into 00
this
they have that they are renter corps and pets im a in pet corp o money why in there right minds would they want to live in a dangerous 04 if they have the military to patrol and keep it safein that case they have leverage to live in 00 where all the real money is made and hold sov in systems worth having not only that but if they rent they can easily make enough money to pay there bosses more then could be taxed in low all this while helping to secure sov from primary powersand before you even say it will help secure routes to lo sec you would be suprised how little 00 allainces care need to get to sov take a shuttle or a warp core stabed frig 2 jumps then use the jump bridge by the time your there we will have your pvp and pve ships safe in our pos or outpost via carrier or jump freighterthere is little to no incentive to do this in the least and will bring to much politics into this it isnt a problem to 00 corps but they will exploit the hell out of it and ruin the fun that is losec
i do agree that there are many things in this game that create large isk faucets but i am going to take the opposing matter glass half empty scenario and advise it this waysalvage has decreased in price  therefore level iv mission runners have been nerfed to acceptable levels a decrease in payout means less of an isk faucetinsurance payout has hit pitfalls of annoyance a decrease in payout which has already been implemented means a bigger isk sink for eve if it wasnt for payouts then pvping would be a much harder game for many newbs and seasoned veterans alikewhen you get pewpewboomed you lose most of your modules isk sink which you coveredif pos equipment gets blown up its gone isk sink clones skillbooks insurance payments etc which you already covered isk sink if you want to increase the isk sink i guess the best way to advise is that is to increase the cost of wardecs increase taxes trading increase the cap for wardecs on corporations allow for bribing concord officials for information on people in corporations like who they are at war with for example and there are a few others those suggestions i would support instead of gimping laid out mechanics already incorporated into eve why not add new isk sinks instead
ban all exhumers from high sec helps greatly to stem the isk faucet from macros
no it doesnt unless u count the bounties from the occasional frigisk faucets are basically missionbounty atmthe sinks are taxes sovernty and lost modulessince so many people do missions and get bounties there is a bigger faucet then isk sinkhow to fix this is instead of plex for insert thing here like remap make it straight iskif you paid 400mil for a remap and not a plex then 400mil isk leaves the game spaceif u use a plex then only about 10mil leaves the game space
uhm people dont confuse isk sinks and faucets with isk market earningsalvaging for instance does not create isk out of thin air  you need to sell the salvage on the market to other players if you want to earn anything or you could use it for production and sell it etcisk earned through npc bounties mission rewards overseer effects are isk that a conjured out of thin air by npcsiirc the two last issues of the isk quarterly economic newsletter the isk faucets had been around 35 larger than the isk sinksthats a noticeable increase in the total amount of isk for eve
put aging into the game the more often you use a ship the more you wear it the older it gets the more you need to repair it and you never will repair it 100 every repair will loose some percentagesso after a while the ships and items go old and need to be replacedold items and ships wont reprocess for 100 anymore
in this case you need to reduce the production of goods as well or you will face fierce deflation as long as miners sort of couterweight the amount of new isk with an equal amount of new ore the prices will stay more or less stable
cause there arent also thousands of exhumers macroing it up even in newb systems right funny logic therewhere do u think the asteroids come from maybe ure the one confused when theyre also conjured out of thin air just like missions an isk faucet is an isk faucetsimple as that
ccp doesnt decide how much you can sell minerals or ore forccp decides exactly how much isk you get for killing a ratdoing a missionetc well maybe theres some insurance thing or whatever but thats besides the pointif 500000 macro miners suddenly decided to crash the price of tritanium to 002 isk ratters would still earn 40000012mil isk for a bs rat kill
wrongccp doesnt decide exactly how much isk for rattingmissioning is either because not every rat has a bounty and if they do it still pales in comparison to the loot and salvage gained from them which can still be ninja salvagedlooted maybe if mineral prices actually crashed all the way down to 02 isk or mining wasnt so riskless and easily automated then maybe ud have a little excuse but contrary to your hypothetical situation u made up mineral prices r far from 02 isk so thats not the case
if you mine you need to sell the mins to someone that has to have isk to buy it you cant sell the the mins to ccp for iskso the isk that you get from mining is already in game only way you get more isk in to the game is mission rewardsbountiessleeper loot and insuranace module drops are not a way to get isk in to the game as someone has to buy the module or the mins your get from reprocessing ways to get isk out of game is sov billsclone upgradesnpc goods and insurance i might have forgot some ways to get isk in or out of the game but in short anything you buysell to a player isnt geting more isk in or out of the game
reading comprehension 0 maybe are you really saying that ccp doesnt set the bountis for rats who does if not ccpif as you seem to be saying lootsalvageminerals are isk faucets tell me where that isk comes from
your an idiot and probably didnt understand a single thing in theresound may be able to leap across a vacuum separating two objects made of piezoelectric crystalsis eve made out of piezoelectric crystals no it is not you would not be able to hear anything in eve
as it stands now singularity is great place to screw around try out ship builds go places you havent been before and generally test all manner of things out why not just give everyone on the test server all skill points trained hyper speed training or require no skill points for anything there would be many more adventures to be had if you could go there and fly titans without fear or try out different t2 ships and see if theyre what you want to train for before you do a lot of training on tranquility you may regret later over all though it would be a great way to draw more people to the test server and make things more interesting there why not pull the capital ships in high sec nerf as well who wouldnt want to see how long a titan could hold out against concord there are just too many things that could be fun about singularity that just arent atm its already like a partial eve simulator why not take it all the waymy corp is new and nowhere near having the skills for titans and even then you cant all have them it isnt feasibly or financially sound what corp wouldnt want to go and have a full on titan fight think about it
what part of public test server led you to believe it should be any more or less fun than tq
thats exactly what happened the last time ccp gave everyone all lvl5 skills it made testing bugfixes and stuff almost impossiblethat said  not supported
so what you mean is that people would be too busy screwing around to actually test things out
the issue as dm alludes to is that sisi is just not capable of handling as heavy a load as tq im not even sure its more than one server  the point is you suddenly get a bunch of people over there for the hell of it to blow a bunch of crap up and introduce a lot of load on the environment and itll crash which could interrupt testing other people are trying to do
you should get 2 training cues on sisi your currently active one on tq and the one that you just added on to sisi
new weapon type  tank breakersok we have all heard the many posts lately about drake gangs and how there more or less unbeatable  and yes ive seen firewall well with a little thinking i came up with this idea a third weapon system that specifically targets either shields or armor doing massive damage  but little else to everything else anti shield weapons plasma torpedo  a combination of a laser cannon and hybrid system the plasma torpedo fires a ionized ball along a lasers path towards a target ship  upon reaching close proximity the plasma balls field reacts with the target ships causing it to explode with a far greater impact zone than any other current weapon system due to the sheer size of the impact zone the shields expend a far greater amount of energy blocking the attack causing massive damage to shield hpdust bomb  a small charge that when fired from a hybrid turret explodes mere meters from the shields perimeter showing it with superconductive spikes and dust the spikes cause the shields reflex action while the dust causes massive shorting out of shield power due to arcingboth the plasma torpedo and the dust bomb do virtually nothing to armor or hullanti armor weaponskk missile  more or less a hollow tube with a dense armor penetrating head and hyper powered engine this missiles sole purpose is to hit a ships armor and do as much damage as possible armor piercing rounds  a special super dense round that will punch through even the most heavily resistant armor plates like there where butter the shields energy reflex will cause these roundsmissiles to shattering impact and they pass through the hull like tissue paper causing relatively little damage these weapon systems could function in one of a few ways1 they could simply hit a ship and treat it as a zero resistance shot2 they could simply remove x amount of shield amour hp per hitthis will also negate super ships equipped with these weapons as a full bs equipped with say the plasma torpedoes may be able to drop a drakes shields pretty quickly but it still requires buddies to finish the job  this would also lead to a way to tame the ever increasing drake armies without nerfing are beloved bent panel ship
i stop reading right here you have no clue whatsoever drake gangs can be killed with many gang types even when fighting 200300 of them firewall is just one of them1 lr hac only works reasonable if the lag isnt too bad but you can stay at 95105km out side the range of a drake and melt them2 ahacs requires good teamwork with tackle especially webs3 bs setups that can hit at the same range as drakes set up with proper buffer can be firewall doesnt have to bebefore inventing new stuff maybe start using the options we have already or at least dont use them as reasoning for your ideas
drakes have numerous counters even in large numbers this is an awful idea if one weapon does as you say a massive amount of shields or armor damage why use lesser weaponsto the other dude firewall didnt work against the drakes if you watch the video the drakes spent 910ths of the fight not even firing at them anytime they did fire into the blob whatever they shot at died they ignorantly thought lolsb bs and almost completely ignored the smartbombing bs fleet their allies won that fight it had very little to do the use of smartbombs you can choose to not believe me but you will see in time that firewall is just a dumb gimmick that lucked into the right spot and time what you see in the video is two drake fleets fighting eachother with a ball of sbing bs being orbited around
because if you took the time to read my post you would see the lines that said that none of theses systems where any good at damageing anything they where not designed for ie the plasma torpedo is great for bashing a draks shields but once there down they dont inflict any damage to the armor or hull hence you would still need conventional wepons on an ally for finish it off
and once your tank buster comes out then people will want a tank buster busterthen youll cry for a tank buster buster buster seriously its a stupid idea
ccp have already implemented something like this system with racial resistsshields have a very low em resist and armor has a huge dirty explosive holeboth can be mitigated somewhat with specific hardeners but youll never get a 98 explosive resist phobos for instanceso what youre really asking for is 100 of a specific damage type weapon which could easily be accommodated with the current ammo system in fact its what makes caldari boats preferred for mission running
bombsuse a bomber blob to kill drake blobsalso for killing armor a missile that accelerates toward the ship and warps through it would be awesome
not sure if this has been talked about before but there i go i think that having an afk or inactive alt cloaked in hostel space is a bad idea corps or alliances should be able to install a systemwide anti cloaking device so such device could give out a warning to all cloaked ships in space every 30 minutes like the down time counter if there is 0 activity within say the time it takes to make a cup of tea or take a bio break your ship is decloakedonce in place you systemwide anti cloaking device swack sends out a pulse every 30 minutes if you remain inactive for a further 35 mins this is where the count down comes in you are decloakedU27A2 the pulse time can be whatever ccp deems to be inactiveU27A2 the swack should be anchored to a posU27A2 and the swck should not affect friendly shipsU27A2 the swack should only affect inactive cloaked ships
you dont read the forums much do you theres a anti cloak thread about every 00045 seconds or so that said it probly means that the majority of the eve player base want some form of cloak catching installed int the game however beware that every cloak user from thispoint on will attempt to rip your throught out at the very attempt to remove there sheild of invulnerability that is there cloaking device that said the biggest arguements against anticloaking are that they should not be able to completly bloak a ship from escaping a gate camp and they shouldnt render whole systems cloaknoneusable with the last part being they should require some kind of player interactionthat said i do beleve we need some form of detetion heck we have destroyers that track down subs here on earth why not flying in space in eve
there are some good ideas for making cloakanticloak dynamics more intersting this is not one of them
maybe we could have a similar device that ejects afk players from their pos shieldsor that initiates a forced undock of all afk players in stationor that automatically logs in all afk accountsor maybe your ideas are bad and you shouldnt post
i thought that you could have a special probe launcher for the covert ops frigates it would launch a probe that would scan the entire system for its cycle time of 1 hour you need to remain undocked uncloaked and out of a pos shield if the cloaked ship does not move within the hour you can warp to 0 to it you will come out of warp within 10 km of the cloaked ship so you still need to be able to find the ship if the ship moves at any time during the 1 hour scan time you will be unable to get a 100 on itor ccp could make a pos module that only one exists in the entire game and when it gets destroyed a blueprint of itself is transfered to the corp hanger of the person who did the final blow on the module this would make it really hard to get ships uncloaked but if you were willing you could
i keep seeing these threads and im not sure what to make of them im primarily on the side of no dont introduce anticloaks but i have to admit bias i like stealth ive always liked stealth but i like to think i can still acknowledge if something is overpowered even if i like itwhat it keeps coming down to at least for me is that everything a cloaking ship does it seems like it was meant to do you cant find it you cant see it you dont know what kind of ship it is or if its dangerous or not these are certainly powerful tools but isnt the entire purpose of the cloaked ship to have these toolsthis particular suggestion bugs me because it appears a specialized solution for a problem im not even sure exists in the first placehonestly the little kid in me wants to buff cloaks id like to see cloaking devices activatable while youre gatecloaked just so you can seamlessly transition that initial break bugs me even if its only for a split second id also like to see passive targeting devices work while cloaked to allow a sort of first strike bonus hell i wouldnt mind seeing regular cloaking devices buffed to allow warping at the cost of a larger expose radius but i realize these things would all probably be overpoweredill happily support the antiafkcloaker agenda if i can just see a clear consensus on not just how but why they need to be nerfed and at the risk of sounding like a douchebag the main reason i keep hearing can be summarized as i want to feel safe in nullsec i dont think thats a very good reasonin the mean time sorry i cant support this
 this and lol of course not supported
these are pilots who join a corp with one thought in mindto podwithout warning corpmates the heart of eve is the corp at the present time there is very little a ceo of a corp can do to get revenge there needs to be set in place punishment for these destroyers of corpmates i appeal to the csm to look into this grave matter and take action thank you
please state your proposal in the form of not a whine im sorry but most corps dont have this problem if you spend enought time looking through a players profile and look at there back grounds and they have been appart of 40 corperations in the past ten days chances are that there not gona stick around with you very long
you need to propose somethingwhat punishment and executed how
bellator when something happend you have to get revenge for youve done something wrong as a ceo usuallyin looking for people to hire you look for three qualities integrity intelligence and energy if they dont have the first the other two will kill youyou have to carefully sreen your wannabemembers this wont safe you from someone who really wants to kill a particular pilot in your corp but it will surely discourage the casual approach to it by making it more time consumingregards lax

hii was just talking to a corp mate about overloading and the range you can get from scramblers with the correct scrambler you can reach 20km when overloading in a disrupterscram bonus shipnow that we had the discussion going i was thinking what if we are for example camping at a gate with a lot of traffic and we dont have time to stop overloading remember a scram stops a mwd wouldnt it be nice if there is a possibilty to help the person that is overloading his mods with cooling themi mean there are remote stuff for almost everything shield energy armor sensor boosting this way there is a possiblity to overload mods much longer without having to warp out  repair or repair on the field  warp back inthere are couple of options ofcourse which are maybe food for discussion1 the module slows down the overheating of mods on the target gang mate slows the overheating down2 the module completly stop overheating of mods on the target gang mate but cost alot of cap which means you will need a logistic or something to provide you with cap require more teamwork3 other possiblities which i cant come up with atm
sorry but overheating is meant as a shield not a sword you get jumped and need a little extra damage overheat you run into a pack of reds and need to get away faster overheat its not a i can do this know so i should be able to do this all the time function
with the up and coming release of eve online incursion we cant help but wonder how long the extended down time will be it has to be said that this expansion is set to make all our eve lives just that little bit better if you havent had an opportunity to check out some of the new features i highly recommend you do given the mass testing on singularity today thursday november 18 2010 at 2000 utc now has never been a better time to set up the test serverforget for a second the fantastic character creation or the epic sanshas incursion the ui has never looked and felt so good the last patch left some of us wondering if ccp even listen to what the players what well they have and it is ing greathmm back to the point of this thread will ccp finally you what most it professionals do and under promise and over deliver when i tell my it director it will take 3 days to implement a new system i know i mean one or two days in fact he knows i mean one or two days but i dont want to come up sort otherwise hell just  at menow if a dumb grant like me knows that its important to manage customer expectations surely ccp have learnt over the last 7 odd years that telling us the extended dt will be like 4 hours is just stupiddo me a favour please tell me it will take 24 hours or get more mim slaves or at least make the ones you got work harderand whats more the customer relations department or what ever should be working overtime to put something on i see there is a release of a new chronicle chronicles are always a good read why have 5 new chronicles on the day of release you can redirect users to a temp site i mean one can only read the patch notes so many timesa promise made is a debt unpaid robert servicethe next expansion is set to be a real humdinger thanks ccpmike
i support the general idea behind this keystroke as the op put it should also detect mounce movement and give a popup warning before logging a person off
there are cons i understand and i listed a couple without being facetious a beensy bit with the effort required to log in every few hoursi guess i meant mouse then  somehow click resides in the same cognitive place ase as a keystroke im not all hot and bothered about the thing personally it doesnt affect me really its just that i like rules that dont encourage waste of resources im not an enviramentalist its more a matter of thrift as a virtue or have a competitive dynamic that just doesnt feel exactly right it feels like a two wrongs make a right sort of thing which isnt great but i do understand that not all people feel thati am always for compromise where a compromise that gives one party something with very little cost to the other i dont really see how this holds a dertemined person backhaving someone take a little effort to achieve a goal feels like the way to plan game dynamics but i think people are caught up in what is now not how youd plan in if you were starting freshif you were designing a game from scratch would you  as a game owner like to encourage people to stay logged into your game for hours at a time when they werent there 
daaaaaarrrrr i can poop
are they paying customers if yes then what do i care i think id prefer more than getting a number even lower than 40 k users logged on on the one shard of my gamealso no
lol wow you must take real whoppers if they last over an hour well i can certainly see why nothing of this order is on the csm list  to be honest it would be inconvenient for me because i do keep a couple clients logged on most of the day when im playing just to save the bother of logging on and off to check a trade price or two missing the chat log is a pain too keeps me from logging onto alts on my pvp mains account to update prices on those traders in the boondocks
not supported in addition to what other people have said going afk in a covert ops and flying in certain directions is a great way to make tactical bookmarksin the end who cares if someone is afk if there wasnt a perfect intel tool called local then you wouldnt even know they were there since they arent doing anything
no not supported stupid ideai can easily emulate keystrokes or mouse movements within a minute to simulate not beeing afk its my choice if i want to waste energy on my computer and i love to read the logs of local and chat windows when i come back of being afk for a whilei also love laying on my sofa and listen to my corp mates while they discuss something important and when there is a local spike i like to help defend my systemi love to watch monitors cleaning my room and house listening to voice and just sit there for another 5 min to micromanage somethingi love to be ingame all day all night without playing activlythis is no solution at all against macro programmers you have now idea
bumping to the top i want to hear more
supportedright now wardecs are too cheap and meaningless they should cause significant financial hardship on the attacker i also like the bidding idea for wardeck pricesbut this is a peeveepee game wardex should be free lulz oh come on you dont seriously suggest that wardecking high sec corps that can usually barely fight back is considered pvp do you and lets not forget that there are vast vast regions of space where you dont need any fees for all the pee vee pee you may want and where some of the players may actually fight back
okand i quote simple as that
amen to that op needs a somewhat better understanding of some basic game mechanics terrible idea
this idea has been kicked around in my corp some but not for racial resist bonuses our thoughts were more of increased resistance overall over t2 or increasing racial stats ie armor speed and so on something along the lines of this1 amarr dcii resists 10 armor amount2 gallente dcii resists 20 armor rep amount3 minmatar dcii resists 20 shield boost amount4 caldari dcii resists 10 shield amountin any case id like to see some more fw exclusive items added the ones we currently have are few and many are worthless as they are inferior to meta 4 or t2 variantsedit supporting but not your specific idea
yah didnt think so poor epistemology you didnt prove that somehow naps will enable mass support but that you in particular for some reason or another werent particularly well supported by the community then again perhaps your exactly the same proposal threads are like the contradictions that really and honestly do existas nc folks have run and not gotten in evidently always is shall we say somewhat inaccurate
finnagain nothing you say ever has any relevance to the real issues at hand your like one massive train derailment stuck on repeatcsm should be imo an anonymous vote that is to say csms put in proposals and what they stand for without being identified by ticker or namethat way people can really vote on what they want as opposed to being coersed or hoodwinked into voting for their friends
turns out i am away this weekend from tomorrow even going to go spend time with my bffs in rl got this huge article on monday about how diseases have destroyed so many lives and why there isnt a curei will most likely miss the sunday roundtable i am sure one of my many loyal members will be shadowing the rooms to see who is contradicting themselves and fill me ini like minigins idea on anonymous voting especially since it is one account per vote and i would hate to have to see another vote for me thread by vuki mean if you look at things based on reports minutes and actual interaction who out the csm have actually been putting effort into helping ccp helping themselves make supercaps jammable lol and who just wanted a free tripsadly finn you fail to understand that the nap cancer will die and when it does you will be left with other nap cancers devouring your macro tainted regions eventually 00 will be controlled by one or two powerblocks and when that happens i am sure you will change your tune on how naps  blob warfare works
glass cannon slow speed uses a special smartbomb type that doesnt let you warp away for a minute or two after activating itwith it resetting every time is pulses of course think normal cloak and cov ops cloak like this type of smartbomb can only be used on that type of ship
not exclusively and only for a year but yes i do use it
i support

its sad but i look at my 1 year old toon as a giant mistake i would like to pvp but as of right now every fc just says go back to pve because im a blaster boat pilot even then pve sucks im about ready to give up and trian projectile weapons its sad to think that almost 13 of my sp would be for a weapon system i no longer use
it is almost impossible to do missions with blasters excepting maybe ae damsel and buzz kill because of rangeif you compare 4 marauders equipped 3 t2 dm  4 high damage turretlauncher you will see that blasters are not for pvepaladin 797dps at 1510km multifrequency l and 730dps at 4510km scorch lvargur 763dps at 336km empfuspp and 700dps at 654km barrage lgolem 825dps at 30km t1 torpedo and 743dps at 45km javelinkronos can do 929dps at 4513km am l and 852dps at 1116 null l
it really is adding insult to injury when csm decide to give rockets some love as if caldary is the race with the most pressing problems at least missiles are nice
going by this thread with the dramiel
actually i think the majority of the current combat frigates are balanced and working fine the majority of the interceptors are balanced particularly the combat turret based ones and only caldari is really lacking here with the raptor crow isnt exactly great either but the rocket buff will likely solve its problems for the most part id say the pirate frigs are fairly balanced too except the dramiel rifter incursus merlin tristan punisher kestrel are all solid and perform well
bump
yes i would hope that if ccp incorporated this feature that an option to display basic ship icons instead of the real ship would be up to the user preferences just like missile effects etcif anyone remembers xwing vs tie fighter they did something similar showing your current target as they are flying around this shouldnt be a problem for modern game developers to accomplishi would also like to get away from the system of icons used for ships and use the actual ship they have as the image based on player configurations ships can look very different from each other even though they have a basic hull instead of creating a static jpg why not just render the ship as it is with all of its systems subsystems etc
good idea itd be nice if we could also change the size and position of the lock icon like any other window
supported this would look cool as hellmaybe incorporate this into it too somehowdominion trailer targetting
i like where this is going im guessing theyll be redesigning the ui for incarna i hope they take a look at a way to clear up the ui clutter while at the same time giving us a quick way to view both our ship and our targets ship at the same timeactually i have an idea  each targeted ship gets placed in the queue like it currently is now but each window has a minmax button in the upperright corner of the little targeting window clicking it maximizes that window showing that ship flying around inside that window it can also have a character portrait next to it with the title of the ship and the name of the characterallowing us to define the edges of the targeting display would help ie put targets in vertical rows if they are wider than the targeting display areaill see if i can design a quick comp this weekend when i get off work
i like this idea just like you can turn off brackets i would hope you would also be able to turn off these though

update prioritization season ends at dt thursday nov 25th to allow time for votecounting before the weekend csm meetingwe will use the feedback in the thread to adjust the list as needed discuss the results at the weekend meeting and then use them as part of our submission to ccp thanks to everyone who has voted so far you bastards its going to take hours for me to extract the votes and keep the votes coming  it shows ccp how much you care about these issues
i temporary had to play eve on my tv you can enlarge the chats but the whole eve interface is very hard to read as my tv resolution is too highso definately issue 62the issue is from march 2010 how hard can it befix the fontsize

i just cant let this drift into the shadow it must stay on the front page moar supports plz
this would completely ruin the economy unsupported
i like this idea it will hurt everyone but it will do so fairly one of the most common complaints about eve is its becoming capitals online power creep is a universal problem in every persistent game ive seen the solution is wear and tear though ive never seen it implemented except in some single player games stalker comes to mindadding it would force many people who can just barely afford to field capitals to downgrade to bss it will force bss down to bcs and so on why is this a good thing well how many t1 cruisers do you see running around in proper fleets my guess is not many i certainly dont see them t2 yeah faction yeah t3 yeah but not plain vanilla cruisers the same is true for frigates about half the ships in game are virtually unused because everyone is too rich to be bothered with them but if a few extra isk sinks like wear and tear and ideally crews as well are added then suddenly the smaller and weaker ships become more appealingi think its good for game play even if everyones epeen shrivels up because of it
this isnt a good idea imo i like many others out there still do a lot of mining and having to replace expencive ships like mining and industrial ships isnt my idea of fun id end up with a stuck in the mud feeling in the game and would then just lose interest and besides isnt the armour and hulls of ships supposed to have nanites in them wouldnt they keep the ship looking new plus on a side note what about those who live inside worm holes  having to take down a pos all its equipement and getting it out of a wh so you could repair it would be a major pain something i wouldnt want to do personally 
sounds like a nerf to acive armor tanking and what prevents you from slapping on a armorhull repper and repairing to prevent these penalties if you dont i feel that it is better to say in the future you can get 100 repairstldrnot supportedpsccp make active hull tanking useable but slightly inferior to other types of tanking please seriously though do it
im not against this idea if it was handled more delicately just having random non combat repairs pop up from time to time would be interesting as long as they werent like every day or ridiculously expensive
these are unusual casesso not enough
this sounds worthwhile
this would actually make me consider cross training to fly one
this would also have the fantastic side effect of stranding the entire capital fleet while new midpoints were set up if you managed to take out the sansha ms with the fleet giving you more time to obliterate said fleet
this idea is more complicated than ww2 torpedo firing solutions no way also more cap usage on armor tanks is not a good idea i know caldari use hybrids also but theyre all in drakes and ravens anyway
your name is showing
are you serious how many people know that learning skills exist at all when they start ccp could make a big blinky popup which states we will give you 2 mil sp after subscribtionmarketing isnt that complicated this proposal was never about new playersit simply tries to give old players max learnings for free  some free skill points and you cant await to get these juicy gifts
nice troll some of us actually think the learnings are  poor design and quite a barrier of entry to the game and you can think so even if you put the time into getting them trust me poor design is  poori think removing is a great idea free sp on registration not so much assumedly for every character on an account else useless suddenly every plex turns into an insta skilled alt which im not sure most want
free sp on registration is a not a good idea because old players wont get any free sp people who really consider learnings being useless poor design and a barrier dont ask ccp to given them these very same skills for free how is it about attribute imps they force new players to grind isk for hours in order to buy them asap since it is impossible to play eve without max skill speed how is it then about removing them as well and to increase all attributes by 5 in order to lower the barrier btw i think ccp should just leave the learning skills the way they are
i think your reading comprehension is off old players who have plex can get a lot more off instantly skilled alts for the low low cost of 300 million an insta skilled suic ganker for a plex sign me upwho would ever abuse such a thingno the poor design is the incredibly slow speed at which everything trains without them which makes the skills a necessity in order to ever train anything at near reasonable speeds that reasonable doesnt apply to high multiplier skills because they still take edly long but the effect of not having the learnings is compoundedsince unless you are a single purpose alt that is not going to train anything you are virtually required to have them they impose an onerous requirement of an insane amount of time while not giving any tangible in game bonuses other than slightly less ed training timeimplants are different in that they have all types of tangible effects and getting isk is much faster than getting sp i personally think attribute implants are fine not having 54 if a serious main character certainly notccp themselves agree that they are a terrible design mistake that they wish to fix and of the proposals i have seen to do that this is one of the best onespersonally i think training times across the board should be reduced for everyone but more so for new people if ccp ever wants to get anything near reasonable suscriber numbers which by their marketing and focus on player luring features it would seem they dotldr learnings should go your idea is still bad and open to abuse
i simply cannot agree enough the entire learning tree needs to go and all sp sunk into them by existing characters should be refunded and available to be instantly transferred into other skills and base training speed should be increased to as if characters already had the entire learning tree 5ed
no my reading comprehension is ok i just dont see the problem or how does it change the situation compared to now are there now no suicide gankers yeh there will be more suicide ganks so what that is what eve is about dark and harsh placeso on the one hand you say which makes the skills a necessity and on the other hand you say while not giving any tangible in game bonuses other than slightly less ed training timewhy is a slightly less training time a necessity i translatei am inpacient little kid and i am going to cry if i cant fly titans after 12 months playingattribute imps have exactly the same tangible effects as the learnings do just for isk instead of sp and to earn 10 mil would take a trial account about a week and he only would get one 3 imp for it
checked on that lately running the epic arc and the tutorial missions made me about 30 million and i am sure i did that in much less than a week more like a couple nightsas a newer player the worst part of this game is waiting for the learnings to level while not gaining any benefits for my shipsvery support removing them
dont feed the troll i am inpacient little kid and i am going to cry if i cant fly titans after 12 months playing i lulzdhis post is so full of nonsensical garbage its not even funnytldr learnings must go people who cant spell inpatient and have terrible ideas dont like the idea of more people playing the game and the game being more accessible
hosenfefer13614514612217113626111
i want to see this on the forums and on the csm priorities requestyes to no
nowadays  lmfao u mean u have noticed this alarming trend in the 4 months u have played the game  er 4 faction warfare militias as well the ebil nasty piwates who are ruining ur game cry would like a word where the  are we supposed to go  and with that simple 2 word phrase u reveal the quite obvious fact that u are playing the wrong game pretty much everything u post on this forum is somehow related to making the game easiersafer for you if eve is so far removed from what you want to play why not  off and play something else stop poasting ur stupid ideas based on 4 months ingame whining how hard and dangerous this game without thinking about the who ur stupid ideas might affect
lmfao lord elfa all i thought of when reading your post was runescape take your two sense back dont wana flame but what you say is scary00  strength in numbers where i live is probably safer than highsec and anoms are sweeet keep itlowsec  pirate hellhole is correct so it should be made worth while to go there as this is most dangerous in my opinionhighsec  i wouldnt change it
lowsec actually needs to be made the most profitable area of space it should produce more isk per hour than nullsec wh space and highsecrisk versus reward as they say
dont be mad portmanteau im not trying to ruin your game just because ive only played it for 4 months doesnt mean im not entitled to my opinion of what i would like to see if i didnt like the game as it is now i would go elsewhere i mean its not like ccp is going to read my post and go directly to making eve the way i like it or anything and nor would i want them to hell even i laugh at some of the stuff i post days after i post it and wonder what i was thinking at the timebottom line is it was just a post so dont get your knickers in such a twist over it also while ive only been a player for 4 months it doesnt mean i havent spent a lot of times digging through the forums and reading up on the history of the game you know you dont have to play the game for 5 years to understand it its a sandbox game where everyones combined efforts make the game world what it is im also aware that if i and nearly 60 of the posters on these boards got what they think they want implemented in game the whole thing would collapse into ruin inside of 2 moths or lessit doesnt mean im not going to say something ed and outlandish for s and giggles thats part of the fun in posting on here sometimes you say something serious with real feeling and sometimes you talk out your butt for great justice its all in good fun as far as im concernedfly safe
there isnt one currently and every other has one so ecm needs onethats all i have to say
lowpriority issue but something that probably should be donesince every other form of ewar has an animation
im sure this has been proposed numerous times just thought id bring it up againcurrently we undock align then warp in a straight line through planets through asteroids through the station right next to you i overlook it but it would be so much cooler to warp around them and it would also add another layer of strategy to safe bookmarks and where to bubble someone midwarpto fix it eve makes a few simple calculations for a path that is bezier instead of aligning directly towards your target you align based on the path generated going into warp causes you to swing around a station around a planet etc it would also be an extremely cool effect watching your fleet weave around planets as they warp to the gatewould this have effects on lag i dont think so if the fleet leaders client made the path then all it would do is sync that path up with the server and the clients would interpret the flight based on the points and the bezier to smooth out the motion
bubbling someone midwarp
do you really think that ccp knows who the bots are and is just sitting there with their finger on the ban button waiting for them to sell some isk what benefit would that be to them there will eventually be a holy rage ii after which the botmacro people will write a program to compensate and the cycle begins anew yes botsmacros are frustrating welcome to mmos
obviously the botting issue is becoming increasingly worse againand like last time we the players are seeing little to nothing done about it the botters or macro users if you prefer seem to operate with impunity we report them day after day week after week and nothing happens the same botters are still there and new ones appear every daymaybe ccp is doing something about them we dont know all we see is the same bots over and over miningrattinghaulingtrading and we report them over and over without resultshell maybe i should start up a few botting accounts for the extra income the chances of actually getting banned are slim to none
ironically this particularly odd clause makes it ok to macro as long as you do it slower ergo macroing itself isnt actually against the eulaseems to me like if theyd meant no bots theyd of put no bots irrespective of the speed at which they work this seems specific anyone clear it up
simple system for account protectionplayer picks a pin4 numbers so lets say 1234each day you login put your pw in and put in your pin the pin you brings up what looks like the calculator you then click 1 2 3 4 and login the pin works untill downtimeto prevent anything from knowing your pin the calculator would be scrambled instead of123456789 0it would be381290475 6this of course could be turned onoff if someone doesnt want it i think it should be player discretion weather to have extra security or noti think this would be easy to implement so no reason to qq unless its just a bad idea but i dont see how it would be
seriously physical tokensits simple it works just because wow uses it doesnt mean its bad
with real and honest respect you guys are all full of itthere is only one game mechanic difference between high sec and low sec and its not so dramatic a difference concordyou already can do everything in lowsec that you can do in high sec and you can do it safely the only people who get killed in lowsec are1 unready people2 not paying attention people3 pvpers who all die once in a whilein lowsec i mine in my hulk i haul in my orca i run missions i rat i do pi i tradei do all the things that most everyone does in highsec the only difference is how i fit my ships and i pay more attention to whats going on in three years i beleive i have lost a total of 4 or 5 ships in lowsec used in an industrial capacity and every time it was my fault except one client crashso this whole thread is a bunch of manure what low sec needs are simply more incentives for more industrialists to take the time to learn how to reduce the risks dying in lowsec is strictly caused by pilot errorwant to learn how to take advantage if lowsec safely join my allianceescocealliance lead united trade syndicatelow sec industrial alliance
your idea has some merits to it but lo sec should remain as it is the only addition i reckon that lo sec needs is a bounty hunter option where you join a concorde bounty hunters squads where you get paid for killing those with negative security standings and make it incremental 10 gets say 100000000 payout 90 gets 90000000 payout and so on this would give players an incentive to go out and fight for lo sec making lo sec safer for neutrals to enter and would also give what i believe the pirates also want more pvp and loot
100 mill npc bounties on 10s lawlbrb making my alt 100 so i can farm billions a day
not supportedoriginal poster has obviously never tried to live in lowsec and is clueless as to what to do to fix it aside from the standard add concord therefore i cannot support this stupid proposal in any way whatsoever
exactlydoesnt matter what form the currency iscurrency is currency cause its gonna get spent one way or another1 ure the one that needs to l2readi never said they didnt set the bounties moron i said that bounties r only a small fraction compared to loot and salvage just because a small part of the value is fixed how would that automatically equal its complete value set in stone in case u havent figured it out by now it doesnt and fyi blaming someone else for your own illiteracy and stupidity wont help it at all2 from rats just like ore comes from asteroids way to miss the point and the rest of my post
1 salvage price decrease does not an isk sink make i dont think you fully grasp the way it works selling salvage at a higher price and getting more isk from players who buy it is not a faucet it changes the amount moved around not the amount paid out from the system if npcs bought salvage then it would be an isk faucet sort of2 you also pay less for insurance now3 99 or something like that of modules are created by players or looted from missions refer to 1 buying modules from other people is not an isk sink4 and 5 are good points 2 was acceptablean isk sink is only an isk sink if the isk is paid out to the system not players and is actually gone for good once it is paid paying isk to the system npcs meaning skillbooks clones insurance automatically generated modules for sale on the market by npcs etc is an isk sinkan isk faucet is only isk paid out by the system such as mission rewards bounties on npcs not players as those are paid by other players insurance payouts etc as with point 1 selling anything to other players will never be an isk faucet isk is moved around shifted from one person to another not absorbed into the eve system effectively meaning deleted from existence
this post is correct
hey you did say they didnt set the bounties im must be a real moron to say you did say that didyou still have no reading comprehension or spellinggrammar conprehension i bet you dont have the bain cells to truely understand what a real isk faucet or isk sink areallow me to explain an isk faucet adds isk to the game from out of nowhere these come from nonplayer sources always an isk sink takes isk out of the game permenently via nonplayer sourcesselling loot only transfers isk from one player to another did i raise you iq any
real simple any transaction of goodsisk that involves 2 human players is not an isk faucet nor is it an isk sink it is just a swapping of ownership
yes u r a moron once again i said they dont set the total value of the rats worth because try and keep up bounties r only a small fraction of it 1 i think u meant brain not bain especially since u wanna be such a spellinggrammar freak cause u really got nothing to back u up2 and in your stupid ranting u completely miss another point yet againthe value of isk is fine why cause ppl still complain about grinding it crying about taking risk out of their losses by buffing isk faucets and nerfing isk sinks boosted t2 insurance proposals to lessen clone costs etc therefore the current isk sinks work as intended3 in case u havent gotten it by now the value of isk is fineure just making up a problem that doesnt even exist except in your own little head uve offered absolutely no proof to prove why its actually a real problem just a hypothetical situation that doesnt even exist so really all ure doing is crying about nothing i know its hard for u but try to actually comprehend all of thisif u even can
there is nothing funny about his logic asteroids  iskasteroids dont create isk you can sell them for isk that was created from bounties and so on this is also the reason why there is no hyperinflationthere is not only isk created out of thin air but also goods asteroids salvage as long as the amount of isk doesnt grow much faster than the amount of goods the inflation will stay low
it mostly partially is due to taxes
the fact remainseven buyers have to have isk in the first place to buy the ores somewhere along the line someone has to have actual isk to buy not goods but isk and no ones gonna like spending hours trading contracting and sifting through all the scams to get all the exact items they need
i dont get your point and still cant see the problem here there is no problem with isk sinks and faucets the inflation is like 10 pa this would be a lot in the rl but in a game where you dont have to save for retirement and so on its just fine if ccp thinks that the inflation is becoming too high they will simply increase the sales tax which is probably one of the biggest isk sinks
thats exactly my pointwith their definition of isk faucet there is no problem with isk sinks and faucets despite some morons that think otherwise
players do not collect taxes or broker fees that transaction is between a player and npcs not two human players any item sold from one player to another regardless of its source is not an isk faucet as it does not introduce new isk into the system when a player buys an item from another player for isk the amount of isk in the whole system does not change it has only changed ownership it doesnt matter where items and goods come from if there were no asteroids salvage loot moon goo planetary products npc sold goods etc there would be no products or goods on the market everybody would be flying pods and trading isk for isk if there is no isk involved in the immediate eventitems being destroyed activitymining etc or transactionexcepting player to player sales it is neither a sink or a faucet check out thisand this
hey dip how about you attempt to spell out a simple three letter word before trying to attack me for a typowhere the hell did i ever state there was a problem i only suggested that if ccp was going to introduce more isk sinks that the way to do that was with microtransactions leave the plex alonei still see no evidence you have the iq to understand the topic that the op introduced why dont you just go back to wow
moronlets do some economicsi mine 100000 veldout of this i got no iski sell too youi take your isk you get veldin no way did i magically forge isk therefore its not a faucetthe only way isk is a faucet is if it gets created out of thin air such as bounties mission reward and insurance payouts
1 because ure the one crying about my grammar and spelling when u cant even spell yourself or r u just incapable of understanding what u and r means2 and u were only greatly whining over semantics but i do agree that it doesnt even matter especially since u neglected to mention that now huh3 i already stated its not a problem and u just agreeddo u have the iq to comprehend that didnt think so but plz continueand i quote let us know when ure done whining over semantics because u have nothing otherwise continue whining
in a game with as much complexity and dpeth as eve semantic are everthing not to mention proper communications techniqueswe still continually have one dip calling player to player transactions isk sinks and the same dip continually states that bounties from rats are not controled by ccp and are not an isk faucet it is obvious that this particular dip has absolutely no clue to what is going on in this threadto the op would you please show any evidence you may have that there is too much isk in the economythe suggestion i made earlier imo should be implemented if ccp wants to do microtransactions whether or not there is too much isk in the economy i would always prefer there be too little isk in the economy than too much as it is always easier to add in more in little bits than it is to nerf it
1 oh thats right cause then idiots like u can label anything that doesnt coincide with their style of play or their likes as bad2 and i quote again and what have u done oh thats right cry about semantics for reason 13 so in other words u have no other reason to take away isk from everyone besides u preferring it yeah surethe only thing thats obvious here is that ure the dip
wow now i totally understand where all your emorage is coming from you not u see the words isk sink and think that this is an attempt to take away your ginormagantuan pile of electronic monopoly moneyallow me to reassure you you can keep your play money i dont want ccp to confiscate it
pretty simple idea add the following line of text to all salvager modules and the skill books to use them salvage is only yours once its in your cargo hold it is not loot so its first come first serve
omfg best idea evah
its not yours if its in your cargohold bring it to a station first if its in your hangar i would agree that then its yourssupport
holy cow did someone come up with a good way to reduce whiningi think thats a yes
id go with something a bit better worded myself but i agree with the basic principle not because lol thatll show them whiners but because its useful information for rookie pilots
do itdo it now
ideally it would be a fuller explanation than the one mchief117 gave but i completely support the idea
right so where are the piezoelectric crystals in eve
this is a subsystem underwater simulator with friction while you are flying in space there is no friction in space fix that first
i find it somehow funny that none of you noticed that an effect like this already exists in the gamejust look at the ends of the warp tunnel the side youre warping to turns blueish while the other side turns reddishits even influenced by warp speed its best visible while at max warp speed warping just 1au away will not get you enough speed to see it nicelybest way to see it is having a darkblack background at the ends of the warp tunnelproof
derp
i say we stop all this redblue bickering and just compromise by making warp purple and space unicorns
while im sure this has been suggested before i couldnt find an exact thread about it so i wanted to bring it up and bounce it off the player base to see what the pros and cons werethe idea is independent module targeting basically in any space show ive seen the captain never just orders his officers to fire on that ship until it blows up he orders specific systems to be targeted in eve you could have a system that would allow you if you had a a target scanning module equipped to target specific modules on your enemies shipsan example of usefulness would be if you were being warp jammed you could target your attackers warp jammer which would begin doing module damage to the jammer until it was no longer operational allowing you to escape the damage done would of course be offset percentage wise by your damage type and your attackers resists disabling certain weapons systems repair modules or afterburnermw modules would be some of the other tactical benefitsrather than make this a suggestion i would prefer to here views on this from those with combat experience who could point out the pros and cons of such a system in order to more fully flesh out the idea and solve inherent problems before making an actual proposal
this has been brought up and it wont workwhen can you dmg the enemy moduleafter shield then armor tanking sucksafter armor hull tanking works toosoon as you startstep 1 kill jammerstep 2 warp away this will be non consensual pvp from now onbut waitthis could work if you can only dmg capital modulesdeath too cap blobs yn
this idea has been tossed around for some time while it is generally well received there are questions about how difficult its implementation would be and what effects it would have on the server load ie how much more lag would it causealso just fyi youre a pod pilot you dont have a command crew and this isnt a scifi show you send out orders to the rest of the ship directly and lowlevel grunts keep things well greased
this is just a thought what if your entire ship was modular what if not only could modules be targeted but you could target your own defensive systems perhaps you want to put all your armored plates on your weaponry maybe shields are easy to switch around from place to place but armor is generally more solid maybe every ship has a weapons arraypropulsion systemmain chasis or whatnot maybe one of the key things would involve reacting to what the enemy is attacking focus your armor repairers on your jamming systemsi think theres really a lot of room for potentially interesting stuff there itd require a massive amount of redesign and a dedicated balance team for the first few months but itd be an incredibly awesome system once fleshed out
dont see a problem bring more jammers posting to confirm this idea and its variations would be awesome supportedone of the most interesting parts of games like freelanceretc is that you can disable enemy ships without blowing them up there is already the potential to disabledestroy modules via leak damage and heat opponent being able to target them doesnt seem all that radical and makes senseit just requires careful balancing and perhaps less accuracy than hitting the hull of the ship
well my general idea wasnt that you could just target modules just that it could be an additional targeting ability either something trained up or added by addition of another module you would still of course be able to target the ship as a whole and damaging a module wouldnt be affected by the shields or armor just resists as even damaging every module wouldnt destroy the vesselkeep the info coming please
ccp could always deactivate the no skill points needed crap when they have serious testing to do
except when it comes to testing having a random guy whos never so much as sat in a capital ship test it isnt really productive by any standard as he simply doesnt know what the  people who own motherships and titans know their individual ships inside and out thats one of the reasons most the input from armageddon day was simply ignored it was coming from people who simply dont understand how a supercapital is used outside of sisi or how massive the difference is between the two enviroments battlefields
well that is an excellent point it was just an idea no harm no foul
im sure maybe some of you have thought of this before and im not talking about the rorqual or orca also yes i know theres the hulk and a fleet of 10 hulks can devour belts in less than 3 hourshowever what if there was an actual capital mining shipi imagine its stats would resemble at most a dreadnought class using 3 capital strip miners and a monstrous cargo bay but never going any faster than 50 ms or less due to its godly cargo bay mass and onboard electronics to accommodate the cap strippers and maybe just maybe it could also fit a module similar to dreadnought siege modules but for mining instead activated to immobilize itself and all that it triples the yield on the strippers andor causes the strip lasers to arc into adjacent asteroids and mine them simultaneouslylargely i thought of this as a highspeed solution to nullsec corporations that are unable to get respectable hulk fleets to mine fast enough or if theyre in unfriendly territory and hulking the belts attracts enemies not that this one wouldnt
no we dont need any ship to mine anything faster though it seems good on paper you have to remember that these nullsec alliances you want to help would be able to mine more then currently this means more ships to the point where they are near free inb4 100mil super capsif nullsec alliances need to get supplies use a jump freighter or escort a chain of large normal freighter for some nice logistics
if the supercap actually required attention mining as in lolwut no afk mining with 10 chars111 it could maybe workhowever itll be a cold day in hell before ccp ever does anything to make mining just a slight bit more interesting
ccp already stated that no ship in eve would ever outmine a hulk
qft further increasing the yield when profits are already low due to supply saturation is not a good idea ccben bernanke
mining dreadnought that can drag entire asteroids into its cargo bay using tractor beams and then strip them internallymake it happen ccpi mean id never use it because mining makes me want to shoot myself but make it anyway
they need to fix the issues involved with mining before they ever introduce new mining vessels they can start by making mining a more involved experience that requires actual interaction too complex for people to use bots on
supply saturation comes from the fact that its so easy to mine bots are used for probably 70 of all the mining done in gamegiving them a faster ship would be awful the whole mining system needs to be redone first we might see it in 18 years
new map option colour lines or possibly stars but lines would make security status still observable based on how many jumps away i am from any particular system the spidery mess that is our current map is a damned pain in the ass to read and sometimes i just want to know how far away i am from a system that looks like its next door but actually isnt because a line i thought lead to a star is actually connected to another star which is in turn five jumps from aeauuugh

simple really the ability to recall sentry drones within drone control range if you wander out of your drone control range or leave grid you lose control of your sentry drones requiring an approach and scoopsentry drones will not have a mwd and must slow burn on the return to the drone baysentry drones must be deployed from the ship meaning a full recall to the drone bay must be completed before a redeploycan anyone see any massive problems with this edit oh can we get some new sentry drone models and effects theyre pretty weak atm
maybe a high slot drone tractor beam would be a good addition to this proposal
sentry drones are meant to be immobile thus adding mobility to them defeats the term sentrynot supported

hear me out i know paints a nono becausea it ruins immersion and the style of the game andb people would abuse it paint stupid things on pink ships etcbut corporation branding on a ship seems a pretty innocuous idea when im flying with a company surely i should be flying their colours it seems to me a way of almost individualizing ships creating a community spirit amongst a corporation a feeling of team while sticking within eves visual style and without breaking immersion they dont have to be big or prominent itd just be nice if my corp could brand the ships its members fly with or even just the ones it pays to have branded ie the shared corp ships no
supported but only if its rendered locally your client renders corp logo on your ship as an immersion element but you cant see logos on other ships to avoid transmission of unnecessary additional information in fleet battles
im very sure the visual aesthetics would be absolutely useless as pro players always play zoomed out and target purely by overview whos gonna have time to look at ships upclose like thatbut yeah i dig the idea an option to paint your corpalliance logo on your ships supported
yes i like that idea but i like pinky ships too and ships are always rendered locally servers do not render ships so where is the problem 
obviously lag should be avoided at all costs but i do think it would be a perfectly harmless way to introduce a level of personalisation  thanks for the support
i dont see how it would contribute to lag as that information is already in the packet of data with each shipif you like this go and support my idea to show targeted ships up close in a targeting window as they add rust damage and player customizations to each ship this would really help us connect to our enemies during battles
the point is if you have a fleet fitted only with these super weapons sorry tank breakers half of them could have a shield breaker the other half an armor breaker once shields are down the armor breakers fire and completely destroy the enemy ships or a fleet could fit each individual ship with half a rack of shield breakers and half a rack of armor breakers it would be way too easy if these cant damage the hull very much just bring in a few other ships with normal weapons to kill everythingone melts shields one melts armor combine them and have someone else blow through the hulledit it seems to me that youre assuming an entire fleet or even an individual would only be using one of these weapons
we already have shield and armor breakersshield breakers used to be called emarmor breakers explosive
so you want to add a new weapon system that will make all resistance modules pretty much worthless to solve a problem that does not exist gee how could i not possibly support this incredible game breaking idea of yoursedit also your proposal is the reason why there needs to be the ability to vote proposals down because sometimes a proposal is just so ridiculous it needs to be voted against
shields are derp against em armor is derp against explosivelearn to use the correct damage unsupported
can i have the antihull version please 
dont worry somebody will come up with a solid counter to this fotm of course said shipsetup will be the new fotmedit adding overpowered weapons in order to blow up overpowered ships is a horrible idea see the little old lady who swallowed a fly
any chance of having a choice of colours for the boxes that flash around the icons when you are targetted and engagedthey are currently yellow and red but its difficult to see if you have a red orange or yellow backgroundsorry if this is possible i just havent found itthanks

the count so far for those paying attention viable objective definitions of blobbing  0viable situational definitions of blobbing  0viable solutions to a problem which cant even be defined and is the result of game mechanics working exactly as designed and some groups being able to cooperate more effectively than others  0as pointed out about a week agothats the issue and the reason that there is no actual problem the term is 100 meaningless except as a snarl word hayakawa referred to these as presymbolic noises that were pretending to be actual fully formed languageor as he put it such statements have less to do with reporting the outside world than they do with our inadvertently reporting the state of our internal world they are the human equivalents of snarling and purring    to take sides on such issues phrased in such judgmental ways is to reduce communication to a level of stubborn imbecilitythats the reason why the discussion is as it has been were 100 posts in plus deleted posts and we have not one single solitary viable definition of the problem not one let alone a solution the course of a discussion about a snarl word which can not rise above the level of stubborn imbecility because its not a even a defined problem but a subjective issue for certain individuals is not much of a surprise were two and a half months in and 100 posts and nobody has even been able to define the problem that theyre claiming must be dealt with devoid of any possible cogent logical argument stubborn imbecility is the highest level a discussion can aim for instead of blob this and blob that substitute jabberwocky then it becomes pretty clear how an argument for why we have to reform jabberwocky warfare in eve would go and why then remember that jabberwocky has infinitely more semantic value than blob
actually finn there has been alot of great ideas and suggestions but your obsessive replying makes it impossible for any discussion to continueit is really creepy how you are always replying right after minigin and mf i dont want to start an argument as i really dont have time to reply to everything you say but you need to put your personal hate asideobviously there is problem here and quite honestly if you want to flame minigin all day then you may as well bump his threads in ah and continue the flaming
finn has a point since the problem has not been defined a solution cant begin to be proposedwith blobbing we know it is a problem but what actually defines blobbing if we pick an arbitrary definition say 200 ships per fleet then would 199 per be any betterthats probably why they havent done anything about it yet because any attempt to define a blob is pointless because blob1 is not much betterthough they could just say a blob is how many ships it takes to crash the server
this is a functional impossibility as not one person has provided one single definition for the problem to say nothing of the fact that the only suggestions which have been offered for a problem which hasnt even been defined are wholly nonviable as this thread is based around a snarl word which brings conversation down to the level of stubborn imbecility its a veritable index of logical and rhetorical fallacies for instance your response to the fact that there has been not one viable definition offered and all the solution have been nonviable to ignore the fact that you cant have an actual solution to a problem that hasnt even been defined is to lead off with the begging the question fallacy and then shift to a slew of red herring andor ad hominem fallacies thats been tried too problem is that it doesnt satisfy even basic requirements of an operational definition for instance the server can hold one day in one battle with 3000 pilots and crash another day with 1400 pilots it can be laggy as hell at noon when the system is littered with wrecks and abandoned drones but running acceptably at eight when its fresh it also offers no viable metric for telling who is and is not blobbing lets say that two sides bring 1000 pilots to a fight and the server dies is one blobbing both neither if were at the point where were saying that two evenly matched forces are blobs then weve accepted that a blob can be a 100 equal and fair distribution of forces that also brings us to other problems what if a node can hold 2000 pilots but 2001 will crash it if the defender brings 2000 and the attacker brings 5 then the attacker is the one crashing the node and not the defender that means that 2000 is a nonblob and 5 is a blobwhich also gets to another problem as well which is the basic nature of game mechanics single player games are fair mmo games like wow can have scrupulously enforced caps to keep fights even and fair eve is not never was never will be and its not by design combatants are allowed to bring as many people as they can in whatever ships they can and there is absolutely no viable way to cancel this dynamic in a target system without hardsoft caps neither of which are at all viable either if you have an objective you will try to defend it with as many peopleas much forceas much firepower as you can because eve is deliberately set up so that there is a viable economy and things have value if i want to destroy your assets ill do the same thing for the same reasons people can either accept that and try to adapt accept their limitations or vacate a niche once theyre no longer able to compete the forth choice is not or should not be i should say complain on the forums as pointed out this sort of behavior is expected in virtually everything that has to do with gaming 1 v 12 in team fortress isnt fair and wed laugh at someone who demanded it should be 2 vs 10 isnt fair in modern warfare ii and wed laugh at someone who said it should be even in eve one lone industrialist trying to compete with a 100 man industrialist corp with 50 members who started in 2003 would be laughed off the forums if he was complaining that he was being blobbed and ccp needed to alter game mechanics rather than him adapting accepting his situation or finding a new one and yet when its not an industrialist but a pvper all of a sudden there is a problem although we still cant define exactly what that problem is and the discussion is still stuck at a snarl wordwe should be very very careful about things which we know are a problem or which are obviously a problem if we cant even define what the problem is
i was kinda joking but i get your pointdefining blob concretely is near impossible atm and would need to be done before we can reasonably come up with a solution
ah fair play i had a discussion with another guy at the beginning of the thread about that and didnt want to go round the mulberry bush again and after it could be defined folks would also have to provide a logical reason why it was a problem we know for a fact that quite a few people dont like being outnumbered or outgunned or competing against groups that can outnumber or outgun those who they cooperate with numbered tagged and entered into evidence seylah but its a long way from that to an objective definition and a cogent analysis of why its a problem
i still stick to my definition of blobbing as a tactical maneuver of simple mass movement with little consideration to position beyond am i in range except for the brave tacklers the numbers values that people begin to perceive it at change but its a viable enough tactic in the current game state to compete well at 11 and dominates above it
ah you are absolutely correct id forgotten you have provided the only operational definition of blobbing but its also quite different than what pretty much everybody else is complaining about and i think there arent really many ways to institute los and projectiles continuing on with inertia and such other than by crushing the living hell out of the server in ways that even the largest battles havent managed to do kudos to you though for defining what you see as a problem and suggesting concrete solutions even if they might not be viable
the only way to do the los and ff is a check from attacker to target at an interval of the smallest signature of the smallest object in the game im not familiar with the code that could be applied to such a check but it would at best take more resources which inevitably is going to be noticed and at worse make eve cry and ragequitthats why typically its handled with a game mechanic as opposed to game physics as one or two more checks isnt a very significant load increase im not sure if i mentioned it but in a mud i did a small bit of coding for they had diminishing returns as more attackers hit the same target the end result was that numbers did bring an advantage but it was mitigated to an acceptable leveli dont have a proposed solution that could work for eve though diminishing returns doesnt make sense with guns or missiles beyond that it doesnt address the server load issue the number of ships represents since even with the tactics adjusted you end up with the same number of ships in a fleet they either perform worse or have to try harder thats why i said it has to be both a tactical and strategical mechanic change or the common definition for blobbing  the committal of all your forces to one locale  is going to continue
id be interested to know how many bugs are reported each month how long it takes to process the bug reports what percentage are processed within one day three days one week two weeks four weeks two months three months four months or longer what percentage are new bugs duplicates need more info cant reproduce working as intended etc
heh if you think that is bad there is a cosmos mission for a rather pricey implant which requires an npc head this particular npc is at an open site that anybody can warp to and he does not respawn its first come first serve so if you live in timezones that do not easily coincide with dt you will never be able to kill the npc and instead must buy the item off of contracts for grossly inflated prices that is what you call fair and farthinking game balanceat least ded gatekeepers respawn albiet somewhat slowly but i agree it is a problem
for those of you wondering monkeysphere did figure out a way to slow packets to the server resulting in his name not appearing in local this resulted in a rather lengthy thread somewhere on these forums which pl tried to spam out with alts and the likeno one knows for sure if people other than monkeysphere have used this to their advantage but i suspect that a few temp bans and the like had something to do with accusations of such nature pl now has a bit of a troll going either to try to further aggravate people or to smokescreen this issue on their websitethe original exploit no longer works i am not sure if people have figured a way around ccps countermeasures yet or if such a thing will be possible as i dont know what ccp has done to fix the original issuenone the less this was real and if the servers are still vulnerable to such style of play it is certainly in ccps best interests to look into this especially so long as pl or other entities are still able to agro things inside pos shields with ecm burstsps someone ask grath if hes upgraded from t1 sentrys yet p
i suppose there are many problems with it but here is the main onethe suggestion are are so vague that you cant tell if youre voting for something you would like or something you would hateplus there is no way to actively vote against something as opposed to just seeing it as a low priorityfor instance pos gamesim all for making it harder to redock after you go out and shoot at people it has never caused me a problem but i completely understand why people are unhappy when a super tank comes out shoots at people and then redocks before its endangeredon the other i and most people like being able to peak outside the station then duck back in if its camped its not cause i want to play games  its because the station has 100s of windows but oddly i cant look out them
moved from general discussion
why is this not in in general discussionare you hiding it because it shows the obvious uselessness of the who voting thingim not talking about game issues here im talking about how the csm thing makes no sense
whilst i certainly agree 100 with your point about not being able to check who is waiting outside before you undock which is kinda ridiculous when you think about it i think with some of the subjects the idea is that they are brought to ccps attention rather than making an actual suggestionat the risk of being flippant if you want to be more involved in the nitty gritty of changes run for the csmedit for what its worth i think the fact that they even have this kind of voting is a good thing  i know the validity and usefulness of the csm varies from player to player but i dont recall any other game where the devs give a method of feedback like this
you sir are an idiotlet me explain this to you you go to the wiki page and you see the issue you click the issue and you read on how it is broken down some issues have more information than others if you like the issue and want it to be implemented vote for it if you think there isnt enough information or bad dont vote for it or you know do something like put in effort into the original thread to try to clarify it
its moved from general discussion because its a csm topic and as such belongs in the csm subforums
look unintentionally irony

almost a year ago i posted here voicing my support for the idea of buffing black ops one or two suggestions have been adopted since then that is appeciated however the options selected were of the most modest variety and for the most part fairly ineffective at boosting the desirability of flying blops bs since i have now less than a week before completing all required training to fly a widow i am posting again to reinforce my continued support for this class of shipin general all blops bs suffer from crappy tank when compared against their t1 variants either give them t2 resists increased agility decreased mass or decrease signature radius i think the reduced sigrad is a fine idea firmly in line with the concepts and traditions of covertblack ops these guys should be hard to catch but not necessarily hard to killfirst everyone please recognize that there are 2 bs bonus slots 2 bo bonus slots and 2 role bonus slots let us start with the role bonus slotsthe ability to equip a covert cloak would place the vessel more properly into the bo role alongside its counterparts the force recons covops frigates and sb it would be no more op than any other cov ops ship and honestly i dont see anyone popping a cov cyno with a bo they cost far too much and are far too valuable as portal generators to perform a task that any other covops can do just as well without having to sit immobile for 60 seconds in a barnsized target with crappy ehpto balance the addition of covert cloak and not make bo into a doitall covert vessel remove the ability to light covert cynosthe second role bonus is fitting a covert portal generator needless to say that should stay in placeas far as the bs and bo per level bonuses i feel that they are not in line with the intended role of blops and need to be completely redonesince i suggested above that we should allow for covert cloaking devices there is no reason to have a cloaked velocity modifier let us replace that with the oft and appropriately suggested jump drive range bonus with a base range of 2ly and the jdc skill multiplier of 25 per level we have a maximum range of a measly 45ly lets give the blops another 25 per black ops level currently there is little incentive other than the widows ecm bonus to continue training blops skill this would make it more desirable to continue training the skill as well as be balanced you want more range work for itnow we can address the second blops skill bonus on all ships this seems to be a utility bonus slot drop all the current bonuses and replace them with the standard covert ops cpu reduction of 96100 per levelnow as for the battleship skill bonuses nobody complains about having extra dps however they simply dont fit the role and could be better used in an ewar capacity lets build on that theme all bonuses are percent per level of bs skillwidow 30 ecm strength and 5 rof of launchers redeemer 5 laser rof and 20 neutnos energy transfer amount sin 5 large hybrid damage and 20 to remote sensor dampening effectiveness screw the drones panther 5 large projectile damage and 25 target painter effectivenessif you want logistics capability carry remote rep bots even the widow can carry 1 set each of 5 medium rep bots 5 small ecm or combat drones thats a great use for a bo drone bay imoone other thing i would do is to change the jump portal generation skill to allow for it to reduce the amount of isotopes used by covert jump portals currently it only reduces stront usage for titan bridges that would give folks the fuel reduction they want again balanced by skill train time refi hope this post stimulates some positive conversation i can envision some interesting new fits
thats because csm has no power and doesnt do anything ccp fixes stuff at a rate csm just shotguns and talks about every issue and when ccp tells us what they are fixing csm claims success
nay
slightly bigger fonts is the way to go id hate to see different fonts than the ones ive come to adore
eve needs a new font so bad p

a lot of topics may not be 100 duplicates but are strongly related such as 78950 111266 2223 2696 35197 46203 5988 134135 166167 etc you may want to consider combining them for the purpose of prioritizationalso i think you should list separate categories for new features exploit fixes general balance issues and trivial ui tweaks some of these categories are inherently more important than others but are probably worked on by different people ie its hard to prioritize ui tweaks when everyone votes for exploit fixespesets9182196110129161197199

im in the same boat as the previous poster tbh aging is a part of life and as someone said we capsuleers are immortal because we transfer our consciousness to other newer bodies youve read it in the chronicles and the published novels of eve lifeso long as its handled delicately then i would be up for it the idea that higher tech level equipmentships etc age slower is a sound idea with logical thought behind it im not suggesting t1 ships become gritty and unusable in a matter of months just stagger certain qualities of the ship against its level of useheres a lil scenario that can offer some interesting side effects1each ships systems run at peak efficiency when bought brand new 210 degradation on systems due to continual use over a period of 12 months for a t1 ship for example3use of the ships systems incurs a slight but increasing penalty to that system fly around a lot  slight loss in max speed4high sec systems would have faction run repair facilities in stations continually maintaining your ship5quality of the maintanence will depend on your standings 6repair facilities in 00 will operate in the same manner7ships being sold as used will create another layer of trade8used ships will allow easier transition of game elements for newer less wealthy players9used sales would be done under contracts as faction ships will soon be sold in the market tool i know a major balance issue will need to be resolved otherwise people will just buy used ships rather than buying new ones so appearance and quality of maintanence will play a large factor as well as combat effectivenessas far as i can see there are positives and negatives but implemented gingerly and adjusted over time it could add something cool to eve without wrecking anything
much better than the existing bonus supported
a reason to actually use a faction ship is an idea i can support
i do agree that it needs something a bit more impressive especially with two different races carrier iii required i am a bit hesitant to give it a significant jump range bonus however as just one could grant 250 cap ships a greatly increased deployment zone id like to see that playtested a good bit before it went live my inclination is that a jumpfuel bonus for a fleet would work better and could ease alliance level logistics significantly but thats just my gut reaction still supported
not supported in all aspects it is not about the i had to do it so others must do it too mentalityi simply believe that learning skills are a purely optional part of the game it would spoil the fun of trully building a character from scratchit feels as if wed be going back to square one when a pilot had to choose a career path and render the alpha clone useless once again let alone the skillpoint burdenas far as i am concerned i trained learning skills because i wanted to
i still fail to see where the issue is reallyas far as the ccp stated that theyll remove it claim goes it all sums up to weve had 3 designers working on it for months and it still didnt go through so to begin with a positive assesment try as we may we as a player base are not going to come up with anything as elaborate as this 3 people could muster even if they spent only 2 hours a week for a mere 2 months on that particular topicanother statement which i really cant understand is soundwaves when i created my first two accounts i launched the learning skills and played cs for two monthsfirst this is a game the purpose of which is or should be to have fun learning skills are not fun skip them you need them to be competitive you say what do you want to have fun or to be competitive and what does it even mean to be competitivelets do a bit of math instead will youso ill focus on the idea that this whole skill category and its supposed necessity is an impediment to rookies discovering the game a rooky is any pilot below 16m sp your rooky bootstrap programme could be lower case for base skill upper case for advanced skill first to get cybernetics lvl1 and 1 implants for ipwm and a 2 c then mil mil mil mil mi mi mi pwc pwc pwc pwc pcw pcw pcw that would take you 6 days 6 hours and 14 minutes to reach and earn you 347025 sp raising your attributes by some 216that means you still have a lot of your 100 speed bonus as a rooky so much so that you can start from day 0 training concrete stuff to get a taste of this and that as the first skills available or required for something else are low rank low level ones so quickly trained that youre not penalized to get them before comitting to the learning familyin my opinion the only real limiting factor is not time locally wasted on metatraining but isk as the cost of proposed programme is above 24mnow your mates are adamant that you should delve further in boosting your attribs blow them a kneecap or two then or at least ask them if they ever heard of some breakeven point stuff all base learning skills to 5 and advanced to 4 account for some further 187m sp which would claim 55x more time than what i proposed earlier to get you to 248 of your initial attribs  115 of what you get with the 43 bootstrap programme  if it didnt rocket past the initial 16m happy hourso before embarking on such a road you have to work out how many sp youll have to train on that attribute in order for the reduction on training them to equal the time spent on the metaskill i havent pushed the reasonning as far as laying the final inequation for this but it appears that a pair of lvl4 advanced can be paid for with a pair of lvl5 low rank 5 or below actual skills i embarked on lvl5 base myself as it shrinks my 115 week long programme to some mere 90 neural remap includedwill i still be playing eve by that time if i am ill be happy to have spent time on maxing my attribs if im not then it wont be an issue anymore the important thing is i understand what i get from it and i know what i have to give for it
now lets take a look at some proposed solutionsfirst i want to say im not criticizing the fact that this issue escalated to a csm proposal neither do i simply want to burn down the propositions im here to contribute to it its ideas im wielding not people im fighting im not even trying to fight ideas1 give away all learning skills at lvl3 to every new character and somehow adjust former onesif absolutely everybody has it then its dead and useless simply remove it altogether1b existing characters are given bonus skillpoints equal to the amount needed to train all of the learning skills to the levels now being granted to new players while this gives existing players who have trained these skills a slight boost it compensates for the time they spent training those skills that new characters wont have to spend6 rank 1 lvl 3 and 5 rank 3 lvl 3 skills make up for 168k sp approximately two thirds of a rank 1 lvl 5 you might as well give a slight boost to your warp speed by flapping your hands inside your pod  what is 168k when youre tens of millions sp old already2 refund all accumulated learning skill skillpoints and skillbook expensesthis one would be tricky what do you mean by accumulated learning skill sp just the sp allocated in the category that wouldnt even begin to be fairto make me happy and im really serious youd also have to take back all the extra sp i earned from having raised my attribs in the first place for i didnt do it just for the sake of it but because i could turn some profit from it so you want to take back what i invested please take back what i earned from it toothat would of course raise mindboggling issues as it would be necessary to rerun my whole training queue since i first injected one of those damned metaskill and even further gaining quicker access to more advanced skills gave me quicker access to other profitable things lets say i became a refining expert much faster than a new character now will which made more isk than i would have otherwise etcif you dont do that then even as it may seem to relieve new players of some burden in some midterm run it becomes a really huge penalty on them3 replace learning skills with a boost to attributes gained from having trained skills relevant of that attribi read that in this thread and it appealed to me i like the idea that making something makes you better at doing it the next time around not in the knitting 300 socks will make you better at sewing smokings sense mind youbut then again in the longer run it just further digs the gap between vets and noobs as the former will have gained significant acceleration while the latter will not even have set speedi believe that there are two points that make the current system work at least not so badlya its capped in an absolute fashion b its choice based youre free not to train themthere are two other points that already allow new players to compete with older ones c the first skills you learn are low rank low level so you get really really faster at doing new stuff than a seasoned opponent d team up with other noobs like you do it cleverly and youll rip open any solo vets pod like a tin canso im back to that if you do something then you should know why you do it the key to succeeding in this game i believe is grey matter by the way where the hell can i buy a towel in new eden
my blog post on the subject
finally lets talk a bit of reallife currency will youone thing that really quickly popped up in my head after starting playing eve is that your monthly subscription not only pays for the mere possibility to play the game have a few kilobytes in some of tqnodes ram that make pixels dance on your screen but also pays for raking in those precious skill points no money no skill pointsso somewhere i see the learning skills as some loyalty program if youre willing to pay some playing time for nothing then well give you back a slight but permanent cut afterwards if youre accounting for your sp not in time but in terran money the effect is the same its a matter of investmentalso as i said in my first post here for me the limiting factor with rooky bootstraping is isk if you can gather as much as 24m in your first say month in the game chances are you know other players that are willing to help you and of course they dont do it absolutely for free to be specific as a ceo myself ill gladly provide the books implants and explanations to any oog friend that would join the game just to have the pleasure to share the gaming experience for as long as possibleso it somehow gets down to this when i speak of it to them hey dude theres this mmo ive been playing if you join i can make you get more for your money than you would otherwisethat combined to the buddy program makes up i think an effective way for ccp to attract new players while retaining older ones first you want to get your investment back but then the longer youve been toying with anything the more youll want to toy with it again all at the same time somehow cementing the social aspects of the gamenow if youll excuse me i should have restarted my extractors long ago  in terms of character development that is
i have all learnings at level 5 which took me 116 days salvaging in a catalyst begging my corpmate to allow me cleaning his crap after himthat said still the most adorable solution in my opinion is to1 remove all learning skills2 give all characters 50 more attributepoints as the learnings did3 give all attributes 10 bonus the same way as learning did4 reimburse the skillpoints spent for learningskills how much ever the player already spentthe above reflects my opinion that there is a good reason to train all learnings to v that i do not follow the isufferedsoshouldthey mentaly and ergo think that new players should be having it easier in the beginningthis waynew players can enjoy the game earlier and hopefully stay playing the gameold players who did do the learnings do not have penaltyand most importantold players who did not do the learnings would have been punished having a slower trainingtime untill then which they should as the gamemechanics were there and if they learned the skills now they equally would never catch up with meergo no reimbursment of trainingtime on other skills no no nothis way we have a balance between good for new players and bad for old players i cannot count the new souls that left eve after the trial periode because everyone was saying learn the learnings which you really should right nowbut one thing is missing here what about the time i spent my money on the learnings 116 days worth of skilling something that is ditched thats almost as much as 3 plexes or 45 here in europeso players who understood the gamemechanics and did the learnings are punished by paying more real money than players who did not no way5 add the time spent on learnings to the account subsription or give me 3 plexes or reimburse enough skillpoints to cover the 116 days i have paid for nothing in the past in eve its skillpints for money just as my preposter saidnow i do not believe ccp will have point 5 added to their list if not dont screw with learnings but perhaps they manage to surprise meediti also vote for the removing of attribute enhancers implants as i think everything should be equal to everybody but i do not have an opinion about if these five points each should be replced by a 5 point bonus each or if they just should be left away without any replacement but i am curious to learn about your opinionsif my proposal was implemented should the possible implant stat bonus be replaced or not
supported also been waiting for this x3
i never thought that i dont have a figure but believe me its big was proof of anything potoh what lead those souls to leave your words are because everyone was saying do that so maybe the driving force behind their defection is not so much the actual game mechanics as the kind of social pressure thats been built upon itwhen i go to my local sandbox to build a sandmade castle i dont bow to those who were there before me saying that i cant make it a tetrahedron and that it has to be a square i dont know if the point i make is more accurate than anything else i never saw any one leave eve after their trial period maybe mainly because ive been here only 2 months myself   i just bring in another perspectivethats a devilishly good point you make there but then again it comes with so much fur you spent 116 days on those skills its more like 58 but ok then what about players who learned part of their learning skills while under rookyboost vs those who did it all at normal pace what about those who sped up their metalearning with implants vs those who had noneby pushing in that direction you end up removing the whole skill mechanics dont you think if you want a game where everything is equal to everybody you can no more play even chess go or tic tac toeand in the contrary i believe that as long as game mechanics are not too deeply messed up with they precisely are what insures some kind of fairness  nobody wants actual full on equality i hope do they i begin to wonder if were not looking too close up at this case maybe any endeavour at reforming the metaskills should be done through a complete overhaul of the training systemhowever deep youre going to try and apply some leverage though do keep in mind this famous quote from niccolUFFFD macchiavelli e debbasi considerare come non UFFFD cosa piUFFFD difficile a trattare nUFFFD piUFFFD dubia a riuscire nUFFFD piUFFFD pericolosa a maneggiare che farsi capo ad introdurre nuovi ordini perchUFFFD lo introduttore ha per nimici tutti quelli che delli ordini vecchi fanno bene et ha tepidi defensori tutti quelli che delli ordini nuovi farebbono beneafter a time youll overcome the pessimistic look of it

uh guizethis one is already over and tabulated  no need for further votesfor the record after voting on all these items the csm winnowed it down to 18 small items 29 medium items and 7 large items ccp then implemented what five or six of the small items and two of the medium itemsccp

whoops wrong thread
an idea for low sec would be to ban the use of cynos and make the area conquerable like in 00 this way reduces capital ship usage in lo sec fighting and lets the smaller corps get a chance at claiming sov in lo secthen maybe the game would create a new area of pvp for the corps too small to get into 00 and too big to remain in hi sec a stepping stone if you will to allow gadual movement of new blood so to speak into 00
the only problem i see with banning cynos in low sec would be that someone could still build a buttload of dreadnoughts and carriers in a system and essentially take it completely over with no ability to jump another capital fleet in to engage it the system could be permanently locked up am i wrong here or am i missing something
hmm not 100 sure on that can a cap ship use jump gates anyone  also we are forgetting the one thing most cap ships dread the most is stealths coming in blowing crap up and well you get the jist of it even cap ships can be taken down using the right tactics 
excellent point i dont believe caps can use jump gates at all because of their size so only ships built in a system with no cynos allowed would be the only caps ever theremy earlier post about removing low sec aside i cant think of any good ways to lure people to low sec without fundamentally changing how low sec operates which would anger everyone who depends on it the way it is now to operate and make a living i mean there is already a lot of good things in low sec worth going there for just not enough to outweigh the risk involve for most the only way to really create a larger draw is to lower the risks which defeats the whole point of low sec
hell yeah
you cant bubble someone in mid warptake a few simple additional calculations and multiply it with the number of undocked players thousands everything you do in space adds to laga simple orbiting causes terrible desync why on earth would you add more complicated calculations
i absolutely support this one this is one of those fit and finish parts of the game that needs to be taken care off as it is it feels and looks like a lazy approachand calculating a simple warp curve wouldnt add to lag curves are calculated all the time in this game and people dont warp so often that it would be a burden its not like missile curves that are constantly being calculated in combat in rapid succession among tens of thousands of players
yesthis could still be handled as a straight line for the purposes of bubbling  server load and calculate a more believable path clientside
def a yes vote for this approach had started a previous thread discussing this issue btwlinky
1 spacelawyer point to you sirof course the eula also states that ccp can do whatever it wants with regard to your account and associated virtual property
one of the companies i used to work for has keypads such as what you describe to get in and out of the buildings the numbers are randomly placed so that in the event that someone watches an employee put in their code they will not be the same numbers the next time aroundhowever a physical token would be way better something along the lines of an rsa authenticator would be ideal it is expensive but worth it in my opinion
this would be free and offer basically the same protection
it doesnt offer protection against keyloggers the happen to take screenshots when you click the mousescrambled onscreen keyboards are security theatre
supported the idea of being able to take over space without an army of supercapitals and get a benefit from it sounds awesome
how about 100 isk for 100 so people can realize how worthless that status symbol is
im a basi pilot by choice but i get so upset when i miss out on epic kms kms where if i wasnt there supporting the fleet they wouldnt of got the km in the first place its ok for me to get gcc for repping someone but no km for supporting the fleet it isnt a situation where the game cannot tell how a logi helped with a kill because concord definitely knows when they try to retaliate me with gccthe only reason i have a problem is because as a basi pilot their is no evidence that i was even at a fight unless i die or i bring combat drones i would just like to open this up for discussion i take pride in my km record and i think its extremely unbalanced as a basi pilot you can only lose as a basi pilot on the kb
1 concord has no clue if you participated in combat or not if you rep someone with gcc long after combat has ended you still get gcc yourself 2 if killmails are that important to you pack combat drones and assign them to your killmail  of choice 3 no seriously if kb stats are that important to you then act accordingly theres no reason that a ship that doesnt kill another ship will end up on a mail that shows which ships helped to kill that ship not supported and i fly logis and i sometimes use dronesa gun on a scimi when i want to  some mails
meh kill mails arent epic and killboards do not reflect well how good a pilot you are id be fine with removing kill mails alltogether well it took me a year of gloating over my killboard to come to that conclusionget a batch of ecm drones and live with a bit of hate from your gang when you get caught aggroed if the killmail thing is important to you
just take a combat drone with you repair drones are mostly useless anyway during fights and yeah just remove kms from the game
had a toon that got banned for security compromise i dont even know what that is and i cant find imformation in the knowledge base that explains this issue
file a petition that is the only way you will get an answer no one here can help you with it
i tried to file a petition but that toon cant log in because of ban
oddly enough watching the new incursion trailer gave me an idea for how to make super capitals balanced while retaining all their glorious firepowerpeople complain about supers because theyre virtually immune to anything and dont suffer from the same commitment that a carrier or dread would faceso lets make them commitophobesstep 1 increase range of titans and sc by 2550step 2 increase graphic size of sc by 100 increase titan graphic size by 150then add a new feature to these ships the story for it would be that because of their enormous size these ships have to fine tune jump calibrations in order to move this is a concord feature to limit planetary disruptions in all space due to the gravity effects these ships havewhat does this meansuper carriers would by default require a calibration time to jump independent of capacitor im personally leaning towards 3 hours between jumps because it makes them commit to fights more possibly smallertitans would require a default calibration time of either 12 or 24 hours they could still bridge normally but could not move themselves more than once in this time periodalso because of cloakings effects on ship sensors cloaks must be deactivated for between 2 and 5 minutes before a jump can occurwhy does this work this commits supers to strategies either offensively or defensively there is no 15minutes of fame and then pack up and go home youre actually committing them to an area of space and allowing enemies to respond obviously you could log them off for 3 hours but you still run into the issues of being  cage bubbled on login if this is to easily exploitable then change the default log off timer to 3 minutes for any super wo agro thus allowing time to probe them out more easily for traps possibly also default 50 capacitor for any super on log in personally i like both these as added features but am not committed to them for this proposal basically if anyone is willing to deploy supers they become commited to an area for a level of time this allows the other side to either retaliate or stear clear of them once theyve committed this should allow dread naughts a bit more comfort to actually be used because theres always that pesky range limitation for any supersironically this makes the sansha super all that more attractive because of its added range tldrkeep the firepower restrict the movement

i will just pop in here to say that messages are left for transparency people on many forums often believe that they are being gagged or treated unfairly so we always like to show why a thread was moved or why a post has been deleted the role of the community team is to ensure that forum conversation develops to promote new ideas or suggestions this helps all of our developers get the necessary feedback to make the changes you want and needin much the same way we leave a message stating why a thread was locked not only for the op and those participating in the thread but to provide transparency on why something has been lockedwe will also be meeting with the csm in december so we are excited to get more feedback on how we can improve the forum experience for all users
is there an actual reason youre such a dumbass or do you honestly believe youre being funny
to be fair i myself often look at blue posts first simply because im keen to find out what informationcookies the devs are handing out todayperhaps ccp could refrain from colouring their moderation posts  theres got to be an option there that will leave their post tagged as ccp but not coloured with the attentionattracting shiny sorry coloured bar
is it just me or does everyone else see the sheer amount of contracts that are out there seem to be like for every 1 legit contract there is like 50 to a 100 scams can ccp please implement some sort of clean up operation on these things  ive never been done out of cash by them as i read contracts all the way through before accepting but having to sift through 1000s of them to find the legit deals is downright annoying plus if eve supposed to emulate real life circumstances getting caught scamming in the real world carries penalties with it if caught ie fines or even prison
no
if your gonna give an answer please make it more than one word lazy answerson a side note the way that scammers could be punished is to be locked out of hi sec for the duration of the contract they setup for scamming
the alternate would be to pay attention when looking at contractsscamming in eve have been part of the game since forever and its not going to changefurthermore giving scammers a sec status penalty or some other random debuff besides bad rep would probably not affect them since theyre most likely alts camped in a station 237 anyways
no
lol sounds like a scammer protecting his own p
faction items are being added directly to the marketplace which will probably reduce the amount of contract scamming greatlyas for the rest pay attention and read contracts carefully before accepting and you wont have any problems
perhaps instead of proposing punishment to scammers something which is impossible to do in practice you propose better filtering tools
how about people stop being stupid and falling for the scamsps dont take away the ability for stupiddrunk people to pay my accounts
you may have a point there better setup for making and implementing contracts where the description on contracts is based around the actual item and its numbers plus a easier and better setup to filter inout what you are looking for you hear that ccp setup decent contract system with better filters 
1 never click the links in jita local most are a scam2 search for the modules you want to buy with the advanced contracts search feature3 fly to the place where the module is located4 5 profitbtw it is extremely easy to avoid scams this way

its not surprising but still hilarious u think and i use that term loosely its any different than your precious internet spaceships internet spaceship pew pew and internet spaceship rocks but hey must be real fun to live in your ignorance by labeling everything else bad huh now who was emoraging about grammar and spelling again to hide his pure whining u wereand u still r but plz continue id love to hear another grammarspellcheck just to see how little u have to really say and how much more u want to whine
i had faith that you could spell properly
yeah thats exactly what i said a couples of posts before that but still if player a sells product p to player b via market a small amount is being deducted from the price sales tax and disappears in the nirvana thus the sale of items on the market is probably one of the biggest isk sinks in the game
you are the one wrong isk faucet  something bringing isk and only isk into the game universe from outsidematerial faucet  something bringing items like minerals in the universe from outsideboth are way to generate wealth for your character but only the former bring new isk into the game universe not really check the latest quen for details on some of the isk sinks and faucets sales taxation is not a big factor
mmos use money sinks to curb inflation in the mmo that always comes anyways eve has negative inflation so it really doesnt need this idea at all idea not supported
exactlyif it generates wealth its a faucet whethers its in isk ore minerals etc
i think youre talking past each other with anna a bit more in errthe net sinkfaucet equation is in line prices are managably stable while stilly having a growin magnitude per player as larger and more expensive equipment becomes the norm carriers today are less powerful relative to other players than a battleship was in 2007 when battleships were rare and earning a hundred million isk took foreverwhat problem the op is afterif it is a problem is the large agglomerations of isk in certain players control clearly if many players buyt gtcs and convert them to isk those players dont need another sinkbut like a few others have mentioned above selling vanity npc items for isk would take directly from people who had more isk than ways to spend it my favorite was drones that looked like carebears for 100 million isk a piecei think something that seemed like a crowining game achievement for 50 billion isk would be betterallow players to build high sec stations with some controls on who can put things up for sale at them but with unlimitted docking rights  or even without the docking controls just to have your name up in other peoples overviews might be a fun way for people to go out  sinking thier isk rather than being tempted to use it a way that bothers the op im not sure what that is
no anna that definition doesnt work  or if you wanted it to work wed need to come up with new words to describe isk flowing into the game and isk flowing out of the game isk flowing between players or isk flowing to and from a given player is an entierly different concept than the creation of isk into the economyid suggest if you wanted to discuss colletion of welath by individuals that you do not use the term faucet because that is not the generally accepted technical term within the game development community read the economic quarterly blogs and see how the eve economist uses the termyou really cant have a discussion if youre not using the same word meanings
do you still honestly think mining is a faucet are you edand lol at grammergingthe only significant faucets are bounties and missions there are minor ones like npc buy orders
obviously this term can be used rather loosely and therefore some idiots like running r just narrowing it to target only rats and missions since thats what most of the whining here is about1 refer to above2
you are really not getting it isk faucet  more isk in the game  inflationary pressurematerial faucet  more material in the game  deflationary pressure the game need a balance between isk faucets and material faucets to avoid hyperinflation or hyper deflation then it need to have a balance between isk faucets and isk sinks things that remove isk from the eve universe and between material faucets and material sinks for the same reasons but little of the above has something to do with personal wealth of the players it is possible to be rich in game without bringing any new isk from outside pure traders buy low  sell high  make wealth to be relatively poor while bring lots of isk in game missions runners and ratters that lose a lot of ships or while bringing lots of materials in game mining veldspater in high sec the op was questioning that there are too much isk entering the game so the inflationary pressure is too high reading the last quen he is probably even right what you are doing is mudding the argument with your confusion between what is a isk faucet and what is a material faucet thing that have a really different effect and terms that mean something completely different reread the comments to your posts and maybe it will become clear if not search the market discussion section of the forum you will find that the difference is clearly explained there

wow okay so ill put back my degree in audio engineering then but anyhow not like im a paid subscriber to new scientist scientific american and physorgcom so yahh i bow to your doctorate in this field granted its a theoretical analysis but it explains that the mere movement of a material has induced a subsequent movement in another material through a vacuum which means the transferral of energies between each of them without any typical mode of transferral aka atomsmolecules to transfer the energetic compression and rarefaction of a normal sound wavetheoretical physicists believe it has something to do with quantum tunnelling allowing the transferral of these energies but im sure u knew that anyway and itd be showing off if i had to explain thatbut back the the main point of ur criticism eve isnt made out of piezoelectric crystal eve is made out of energy when u really get down to it but more practically its just a simulation of a physical universe a simulation that the developers want to immerse you emotively and nothing quite triggers involuntary emotional responses than soundsound is just another way of interpreting energies in the physical world we live in and if compression energies are jumping through vacuums between objects then whether or not its made of piezoelectric material it does have an effect on other objects very very slight effect i might add but the reasoning why piezoelectric material had been used was mainly because of its ability as a natural multimode small and extremely sensitive sensor how you interpret this effect and transform and amplify it into something you can experience as a human being rather than study it academically is up to you but id rather hear and experience sound then watch the sound wave peaks and troughs on a daw

when your in warp your in your own little world odds are scientifically that if you are going faster than the speed of light you wont see colors because the shift of the em spectrum is so great your going about 2000 times faster than the speed of light i dont know how to do the math but i am pretty sure you would be seeing radio waves if anythingwhen you are warping away from an object you start out running the waves of light which would mean you would see nothingto create graphics in warp your ship uses known models of the objects in the solar system and approximates where they are in the system by analyzing the gravitational wells before warp
well you do realize that it would be entirely different game if you change critical mechanics such is this one the answer is simple  thats not eve
no offense but thats not a very logical argument nor does it help this topic along eve wasnt eve when it started either eve is not just sandbox its evolution eve is ever changing to better fit the community and create new depths of realism to say that a change like this would make eve not eve is naive at best eve could severely benefit from more in depth warfare and doing so would not make eve a different game just a deeper game with more strategy options when it came to aiming which ends right now at place a big x and fire
resists from what shields armor hull
this could work actually heres howyou target the ship then you have to select the specific module and then target that which takes another bit of time based on your targeting skills you can still fire on the ship as a whole while you target the module you just cant fire on the module until its been targeted targeting another module will eliminate the previous module target so the process will need to be repeated if you want to go back and target the original modulethen you fire say its a missile volley which normally youd get 700 damage to the entire ship most of that would go to the whole ship as usual but 0  50 would go to that specific module based on the targeted users skills each module would get a 0  100 health and when its at 0 the module doesnt work and is broken it also wont sell and when removed turns into scrap metalive been playing alot of fallout new vegas lately alot and the weapon degradation system is actually really good i hope they introduce module  ship degradation into eve at some point allowing us to target modules would give haulers and noncombat people a fighting chance to escape and it would also open the door for module damage module degradation and more isksinksalso the ships haul can be weathered based on the overall damage of each module i think this is a great idea
i like the concept but worry about the server effects and technical complexityto implement
well thats a missing piece of the puzzle and one of the reasons im asking for input to help round the idea out and make it viable i mean it could be an average of resists from all 3 i imagine how would you go about it

disclaimer i have no real personal fleet experience and im talking out of my assi think blobs and lag are two very different things that are intertwined more by coincidence than anything else im going to define blobbing here as simply density not numbers densitymass combat in eve is not that classy to be quite honest the trailers depict epic fleet battles but thats not really what happens theres a lot of ships in a very small amount of space all focus firing on one thing at a time now thats not to say blobbing is an evil tactic and all who use it should be punished you cant blame humans for choosing optimum strategies but what i will suggest is that mass combat it eve is pretty ing derpyi think its because there are a ton of reasons to huddle into a little ball and almost no reasons to spread out gates are chokepoints poses are tiny theres no concept of lineofsight and in a large enough fleet battle you play from the overview so visual coherence never factors into it the only aoe weapons are hard to use effectively in a bizarre case of irony i believe that spreading out the blobs would create more lag not less just because youd have to implement a ton of new things just to encourage people the spread the  outline of sight splash damage aoe travel without funneling penalties for clustering thats how you beat the blobs sadly it doesnt decrease numbers and it makes lag worselifes a  aint it
thanks for at least being honest about the changes you see and such kind of refreshing in this thread however i submit that the degree to which pretty much any change would be gamed by the playerbase would make them minor changes at best even if say there was an arbitrary mechanic whereby only a few people could target a ship or effectively fire at it the next logical step after that is to keep fleets the way we have them now for bonusescoordination and then simply have individual wing leaders broadcast only to their wings for targeting or squad commanders to say nothing of what this would to do targets that really do require a lot of dps on them a csaa pos with decent guns on it and a few competent gunners can absolutely harvest their attackers if you cant get an entire fleet attacking each gun on the pos to say nothing of all of them trying to down the tower id also wager that if they were going to institute true los for weapons then theyd have to make the bullets have a certain speed and behave like missiles in that respect after all it doesnt make much sense for a shot to miss its target and say on a stretched out 1000 km grid instantly hit someone at the other end of the grid or what have you and if projectiles didnt continue on with newtonian motion as opposed to the bluenavyinspace thing that ccp has set up then one could avoid the perils of ff by simply positioning their fleets correctly and boxing in a bubbled enemy and a fleet of ships aligning to the same point have a remarkably clean profile if they align for a short while and id wager los would be a lot cleaner than some might think to say nothing of the fact that depending on how such a system was coded it would be hugely open to abuse i do at least appreciate you providing a definition of blob rather than the were not discussing blob anything now lets get back to discussing blob warfare with many falsenonsense claims and some things that havent been in this thread ever stuff yes and no just got down earlier today bashing pos m531v pretty boring we didnt get a fight out of anybody for a couple hours then dropped and got counterdropped heading back to our staging area pretty nifty then managed to fight through and get a few kills before our smallish fleet got cut off by one about 2 or 3 times our size at which point we stood down and reformed to assault r6kym at which point i participated in three hours of some pretty awesome fun with very little lag at which point i finally got popped and then got wife aggro so i signed offit was a whole hell of a lot of fun today now the point all along has been that some folks find certain things enjoyable and like certain play styles despite the actions of some selfstyled authorities on fun who want to tell other people what their emotions really are when of course the point all along is that its a totally optional style of warfare if you dont like sov warfarelarge fleet combat nobody is forcing you plural to engage in it take out small roaming gangs and bug out if you encounter superior forces or whatever easiest thing in the world but thats the fundamental issue unable to adapt unwilling to accept a less than perfect subjective situation and unwilling to vacate and find a new niche we get these sorts of threads over and over and over
i dont know i get the feeling a lot of people like the idea of large fleet battles but just hate how they end up playing outbut this is not my area of expertise so ill gracefully duck out now
sure sometimes they are more or less fun depending on a whole host of features and factors no argument there and sure sometimes a 20 man nanopoc gang can be more fun than a 200 man vs 200 man fleet fight and sometimes the opposite is true thats why diversity and choice are so important if folks want to engage in largescale battles and try to destroy supercapitals thatre in the build phase more power to em if people want to set up shop building those supers and the associated risks of defending them more power to em if people want to get really excellent like burn eden style at denying opponents free transit and camping gatesstations more power to em if people want to get really good at leading lightning fast strikes with small gangs more power to em if people want to live in and fight over wormhole space more power to em if people only want to log on for capitaloncapital slugfests more power to em if people want to minn all day more power to em if people want to run missions all day more power to em if people want to ninja plexes all day more power to em if people want to play the market all day more power to emif people want to build and sell things all day more power to em if people want to find a new niche and create it for themselves more power to em and so on and so on and so on if people cannot compete in a niche can not or will not adapt in a niche can not or will not accept that if they can not adapt or compete then they will perforce lose and can not or will not find a different niche to which they are better suited but instead believe that ccp changing the game to help them is the answer then hell no we wouldnt accept this sort of nonsense from anybody else in eve or out of it for that matter i played halo all alone against 16 guys and i lost and they arent even real friends just pretty much random strangers who got together to game in a team bungee fix blobbing thats why apart from kabaals definition which has a whole lot of daylight between it and the vast majority of claims that weve seen we only have a simple snarlword about blob this and blob that because for many this isnt about game mechanics or game balance or any of that sure some want to make sure that sov warfare functions properly or what have you but many arguments are stuck on the level of cant adapt cant accept that fact cant move to a new niche so ccp must act for other arguments its about finding a way out of game to counter forces that theyre not able to counter ingame and thats simply not eve
i cant be asked to read this entire thread and frankly i dont even care however the only thing that is really holding back the fighting in eve is the simple fact that everything involving sov is wrapped around some stupid space structure this allows for people to batphone in their power bloc blues so basically your alliance doesnt actually have to be active or fighting as long as your blues are powerful enough to hold the space for you enter the renters these typically small alliances will pay their way into 00 and be stuck in a quicksand of never quite enough as they gain players they have to very quickly get into the fighting before the older players get bored however they have several newer players that arent ready at all for 00 end result the older players leave to join more powerful groups and the renters stay put until they just sputter outthey never get their hands on enough people to beat back the opposing power bloc and never do much more than bankroll their landlordsthe problem is that for far too long the focus of ccp and its player base was to get every idiot out to 00 regardless of how little time they have played or how much per week they actually play most casual players have no business out anywhere in 00 but because of lack of content in low sec they go from newbie cub out of school directly into someones carebear corp and have no idea what they are doing they dont have the interest to pour through endless wikis and how to guides and so they just end up just ratting until their eyes bleedfixing it if you want tomove higher payout anomalies out to low sec make them very quick to clear out 1520 mins with 2 battleships give the anomaly very random drops of moderate rarity wrap in escalations and triggered scanables basically you finish a anom and it tells you a mag site opened in the systemcreate better reporting tools in the fleet to accurately and quickly tag targets for ewar and tackle basically if i place an ecm and it effectively jams the target it auto broadcasts and makes a viewable icon on the target this way we can employ far more ewar and tactics pull the sov fights away from structures that has been the biggest hang up for this whole deal simple system active pilots in a system score points for you sov claim if you are undocked in a cruiser you score your alliance 3 points for every 20minutes you stay out there obviously rules needed for cloaksposs if i come in an blow up your cruiser you alliance loses 30 points and my alliance gains 30 points the computer changes sov at downtime based on who was the highest for that day obviosuly rules for cloaks and hiding in poss banking up sov points blah blah blah oh and reduce the reinforce timer for a pos to a max of 2 hours
this pretty much is the best description of 00for me i left 00 because of this i get more enjoyment out of anything unrelated to 00 finn  i think blob warfare isnt just linked to how many people are brought to a fight i think it was pretty obvious what peoples issues arei dislike the nap tactics where most alliances have adopted to have any chance at living sov warfare is completely broken now worse than it was before and now everyone is blobbing with supercapsyou cant really blame people for quitting the game or 00
people have any number of issues that doesnt show that the game has a problem nor does it show that there are cogent coherent complaints being made all this is especially highlighted by a lack of a definition for the problem itself outside of kabaals take on the situation that to my knowledge is not echoed by anybody else lacking a definition of the problem it becomes impossible to come up with solutions assuming that such measures were even necessary in the first place game mechanics working 100 as advertised and intended people can cooperate in any units they like along any dynamics they like towards any ends that they like this is the fundamental problem with the blob complaints your argument boils down to a dislike for tactics that other players are free to engage in an attempt to limit the style and nature of free association in order to boost a personal preference for a playstyle is simply not what eve is about in a nutshell this is the whole issue you dislike nap tactics so its clear what your issue is and fine you dont particularly have to like them and if you dont like them dont engage in them but theres no supportable argument whereby those tactics actually become a problem that ccp must quixotically and ineffectively attempt to combat what ccp made a game where playercreated content and playerdriven events fuel the inform the narrative where people can form empires based on oppression cooperation and everything in between where groups can be pirates empire builders industrialists mercenaries roleplayers and a host of other choices but if they cooperate in groups bigger than those that you like theres all of a sudden a real problem rather than your subjective dislike no while there are certainly problems with sov warfare this too will only fix the types of numbers that are required for one very specific combat profile any asset worth defending and worth attacking will always see both sides committing as much force and firepower as they can if they want to win again game mechanics functioning exactly as intended plus the blob snarlword used to handwave away fleets that you cant counter im sure to a corp of noobs who can only fly frigates a battleship fleet is a horrible blob too if it wasnt supercaps itd be caps it if wasnt caps it would be something else this is eve people can and will bring bigger and better ships with cooler and more expensive mods than you can ccp should no more do something about that than they should stop you from flying a battleship if the noob corp wants to have rifter duels ive said what a half dozen times or more that if someone cant find a place in a niche they should either accept that fact or find a new niche if someone cant make 00 work and lets not pretend that largescale conflicts alliances etc are all there is to 00 then so be it ive also said a half dozen times or more that if someone doesnt like eve there are numerous single player games that they may like and in specific theres a very popular mmo with instanced combat where the sides are kept equal and pretty much as fair as possibleif eve isnt the game for someone such is life if 00 isnt the place someone wants to play in eve ah well why either of those would be a bad thing is anybodys guess
just make the guy that has the key invulnerable until the rest of the rats have been killed its not a perfect fixbut it makes them do the entire room first at least
geez based on the csm responses to this thread how bout supplying personal jetpacks to attendees so that we can attempt to escape the gravitational pull of your egoskb
egos why ego this is jita park home of the csm csm are committed people that spends 16 hours a week workingvoluntary to make eve a nicer placeid say its the opposite of being egoyou mad
so looking through the list ive seen many interesting topics that need some attention and some good ideas to improve the gameplay but how come gallente are not up for discussion namely their weapons railguns specifically ships like the deimos absolutely pale in comparison to most others as welli realize the different roles we have in the game and that most ships do have their uses but i just personally feel like the gallente could use an overall boost lets ignore capsany thoughts
they need to be fixed but itd be as hard as hell slow gallente  slow armour tanks  close range   here are some solutions which wont work1 more damageno  blasters cant even get into range without being kited by much longer ranged lazorz missilez and autoz2 more rangethen they become autocannonspulse lasers and arent shortranged weapons any more3 make gallente the fastest raceludicrous minmatar are the fastest think of all the rage if gallente became the fastest4 longer ranged webifiers so gallente can slow down enemies from a longer rangeno because the enemies can slow down gallente anyway we need a solution which works 
certainly the gallente guns could be improved but they could also put a greater emphasis on drones within the t2t3 compartments they would grant greater utility or increased damage depending on your choice granting a much higher combat flexibility to the gallente ships
give all galente ships a 2050 bonus per level to utility drone speed health and strength im thinking if galente ships have faster web drones for example they can catch people and move into blaster rangethis way you focus on galente being drone lovers and make the web drone actually useful same could apply to all drones except combat drones as for rails just up the tracking a little bit as well as the damage multiplier fail ships can just get extra drone space combined with the above galente drone bonus it would open up different interesting strategies
rails  missiles  caldari blasters  drones  gallente rails do need fixing though cap ammo horrid fitting requirements horrendous tracking and the lowest damage of all long range turrets for absolutely no benefits whatsoever seriously if they are gonna suck that badly just make all sizes of railgun spec skills rank 1 and have done with itanyways yeah the only problem with gallente boats atm is they are too heavy even before you add plates coupled with being the among the slowest ships in the game and then adding the shortest ranged weapons tooyeah thats reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally gonna work lower their base mass and raise their agility and that should fix their spacebrick syndrome without affecting blasters when used with range bonused caldari ships nor impact on minmatar as the kings of speed
i dont see why the agility of gallente ships cant be increased and their mass be decreased so their top speed is unaffected but their acceleration is improved
moved from general discussion
im all up for a bit of agility boosting blasters though really need a tracking boost for the point blank range and maybe a bit of an optimal increase not much maybe just 25km on large 15km on medium and 1km on smallrails need some love reduced fitting req would go a long way to helping this though as would a slight reduction in cap use
the speed nerf web nerf hp buff and trinitys nerf of dual bonus modules which hit rsds especially hard have all contributed to gallente being the special race of eve the entire gallente raceships bonuses and ewar needs a total rethinkrebalance with the other races its madness to put the shortest range highest damage weapons on the slowest ships and expect them to be viable in combat
1seem like pretty simple solutions well at least progress to me without introducing a huge problem just adjust the gages slightly a lot more tracking on both blasters and on hybridsblasters could be near 100 hit within 3000k and easier fitting 
support this idea if you want to see the power of no any time soon
the vote is for prioritythese issues that have been raised are all issues which will be presented by the csm the voting just serves as an attempt to reach a consensus on which issues are the most severe this is probably why theres no downvote
there is nothing about fixing lowsec what a shambles design by committee never works especially when carebears are the committee
the voting is a good thing but csm should always pick out issues that may be less populair and thus never would make a chance in a vote systemsome issues may affect just a small group of people like the font sizefix the lag would be more populair than fix my headache because i cant read my eve interface bad eyes or screenresolution is too high or bothwhat im saying is that with many issues you just can go do something else in game however a fontsize problem will affect a player in the whole gameand thats a task for csm to see the difference and to priorize such issues
the player prioritization is an input to our decisions but it is not the only input and we will not blindly use it to set our priorities for the planning meetingsmany other factors come into play such as feedback we get from ccp about feasibility of particular items how they might coordinate with things ccp intends to do or not and so on
as soon as i found out about the black ops ships i wanted to fly one i have put the bulk of my skills into flying a sin once i wasnt so green anymore i realized that they needed a little workplease fix this so my skill training doesnt go to waste
fw plexing is still broken the 4 suggestions in the op would make plexing much better  something to actually be proud of doing it would also help solo and small gangs find quality pvp faster
no
ill elaborate assault ships already have a 4th bonus its resists someone already explained that just a few posts above yours go check it outare you implying all t2 ships except for the af have five bonuses well heavens we better change the op title or no one will know what theyre talking about should be give af their 5th bonuslol get a clue noob
af needs more agility and speed because crusersize aligntime makes them unuseble in 00
as a typical blaster loving drone gallente i would have to say yes
10 idea

awesome even ccp supports it d
supportedalsothis
supporting indirectly ms should be twice carriers carriers are good dreads are too big and battleships are too big if they all got scaled down and ms increased a bit it would all look right
moar bigger
i agree all capitals need to be increased in size not just super carriers it is a bit absurd to see a machariel next to a wyvern or hel i only just recently saw a wyvern in combat and was a bit suprised to see my revelation was bigger this needs to be changed no ship that powerfull should be so small
supportdramiel  unbalanced ship in frigsize
i totally f agreed with that there should be one whole expansion for rebalancing every singe thing in eve yep thing not just ships just everythingoh and so all the employees have something to work on they can redo the ship models  as that is probably never gonna happen i support this instead
dramiels are overpoweredsimply the more overpowered something is the more people will fly it than others in its classthats why you see so many dramiels machariels vagabonds drakes etcsupported
firstly whymining is one of the biggest parts of eve asteroid belts are in almost every system the hulk is one of the most popular ships in the game its the second most practiced activity in the game just below shooting things its the backbone of the eve economy its also mindnumbingly boring and it hasnt seen any real attention since well honestly i couldnt tell you ive been playing eve on and off for about six years and the mining i do in my hulk is the same kind of mining i did all those years ago in my bantam in todaki just with a much bigger cargohold and ore yieldlets establish what this proposal is not about firstlythis is not about macro miners macro miners will appear everywhere short of adding captchas to every stations docking bay doors there isnt a whole lot we can do about it secondlythis is not about profitability im not going to argue about if i think mining needs to be a bigger moneymaker mining touches on every part of the eve economy and im not about to go poking that hornets nest with a sharp stick finallythis is not about pirates vs carebears this isnt about gameplay styles its about a prominent feature being boring to the extent that its actively damaging to the games reputationno this is about gameplaywe can talk about hybrids or assault frigates or rockets or bits and pieces of the ui until were all blue in the face but truly no feature is both so widespread and yet so actively neglected as mining is so id like to propose that it needs a major overhaul to make it a more interesting gameplay experience the trick then is to do it in a way which satisfies the folling conditionsa it shouldnt require a massive investment of developer resourcesb it shouldnt make mining needlessly complexc it shouldnt completely undermine the existing structureso now that ive covered the why lets move onto the how i am going to throw some ideas out there please note these ideas are just my personal thoughts and sugestions even if you disagree with my particular sugestions please support the thread this is not about my own ideas so much as the general notion that mining needs an overhaul also i strongly encourage adding more ideas to the mixso without further ado some of my own ideasspreading out the beltsa current feature is that if you activate the scanner not the directional one the probing one when you dont have any probes out it takes 30 seconds to scan and gives you a list of the big obvious sites in the system these are the ones that show up with 100 clarity even when you only have one probe on them probers will know what i mean by thisusing this system perhaps instead of there being a fixed number of belts in a system there could be smaller but more numerous asteroid clusters with varying ore types say a dozen rocks per cluster you could then look into scaling the ores more smoothly across the different security statuses perhaps you scan in a system and find 20odd clusters perhaps some of those clusters have the occasional mercoxit rock in them maybe some have more than others maybe some rock clusters have more dense asteroids but smaller ones maybe you have the choice of either going for the first asteroid cluster you pick up on scanners or you shop around to see if you cant find something more profitable these little rock clusters could show up randomly across systems rather than being densely packed perhaps some systems just tend to have more asteroid clusters than others theres a lot that could be done with thisthis is getting a bit full so continued on my next post
shrinking and scattering the asteroidsone thought i often have is breaking things up more basically meaning there would be more asteroids of smaller size and cycle times for mining lasers would be lower in this your concerns should be more about constantly picking and choosing your asteroids with asteroids constantly depleting and the need to pick new targets as well as keep an eye on your survey scanner to really maximize your output you could still have the bigger plainer rocks but it might make things more interesting all the samevarying densitywhat if rather than the simple case of three different density measures you had only the base ore type but you had denser asteroids give you more ore in this way you could give each asteroid not only a size but a density do you go for the bigger rocks that are more sparsely packed or the really small dense ones even though it means paying more attention pack that survey scannermining laser falloffget up close mine more ore faster doesnt have to be an enormous difference but those bigger mining barges arent exactly fast if you want to get in close to every little rock before mining it things might get slow also makes things more interesting for the rookie in the bantam who can really move about the beltexpanding on deep core miningthis is barely a suggestion really but its a notable place where you could expand more just some ideas off the top of my head denser ore but slower mining mine minerals straight from the rock so you dont have to go through the refining process but again at the cost of slower mining maybe make it a gambling where either you get a big burst of good ore or the rock explodes into a gas cloud or such speaking of whichgas cloudswhy should ore miners have all the fun maybe some of those asteroid clusters have more gas than rocks heaven knows itd be more interesting that the occasional ladar siterandomizationsystems are cheaper than content rather than just going and designing 50 different rock clusters and spreading them across however many thousand systems exist in eve get creative with fractals and random number generators you go flying towards a rock belt who knows what you might find a super densely packed cluster of tiny rocks an enormous veldspar boulder spinning through space maybe youll find something high in scordite or pyroxeres asteroids with tiny bisot cores bias your clusters by the security status of the system and the sector of space they appear inconclusion and final statementsthe main thing about all the above ideas is that they require little to no actual content to be developed youve already got the asteroid models and the mining lasers and the minerals and all that they also dont really upset the core of mining or even the economy in any great manner as long as youre careful about it mining still does what it used to do its just a more involving process without being too obnoxious if youre one of those miners who tends towards the alttab game feel free to head to the first belt you find and just chip away at the veldsparmainly though this is all low hanging fruit the payoffs would be enormous its a core enough feature that you could sell an expansion off of it its hardly a feature that everybody loves the current state of yet it wouldnt require any real additional content development a bit of programming time yes but everything else is already there its a very old and well known feature and you can shout to the world that in fact yes ccp does care about excellence even in miningand if youre not a minerhey more hulkageddon targets

omen is the reason why i switched to using an arbitrator omen sucks btw and now my drones are more of a primary weapon against frigates secondary against cruisers if my guns cant hit them and the omen isnt good enough or worth enough to consider rigging normally rigging it would cost more than the ship and for that price a drone boat would be more effective
what it says on the tin the idea of an ishtar scooting about at 500 ms the maximum speed of a tractor beam with his sentries in tow is just too hilarious to pass upit would be a bit of a stealth marauder buff though letting them use sentries a little more easily and whatnot
i havent thought about whether it would be good or bad for the game but the image of a running ishtar with sentries following is hilarious
i think that not only destroyer upgrade is needed but some faction destroyers too destroyers can be much more then they are now like medium assault ships or stealth guard or ambush ships
good post a little bit ot here but i think that at this point almost everyone wants ccp to fix and finish the product that is live now on tq instead of wasting resources on another halfcontent semifinished expansionas i stated on the op this proposal would never be prioritized over issues like lag game balance etcreading your post makes me think it could be done simultaneous if the coders will be working on existing content makes sense that the artists would do the sameall in all its just eye candy but we like it dps changing op to moa and other goofy ships ps2 supporting my own idea lol
since these arent coming out for a few months yet we have time to push this change through if we show enough support for it 
the thinking behind this idea is good but the bonus itself is horribledoes eveonline really need all capital ships to move 30 further per jump wont the already ridiculous speed with which you can move to opposite ends of the universe just get worse
why is more mobility and thus more in combat and dying a bad thing
because it is just effectively making eve smaller and promoting blobbing even more it will result in less combat since its main use will only be hotdropping with ridiculous odds and i wouldnt call a slaughter combat not to mention it just means people within 3 regions of a super cap blob cannot do anything without being hotdropped especially since these days supercaps are seriously used to hotdrop interceptors aditionally it means using game mechanics for intel become even more useless and the only viable method is placing spies in every enemy with a super cap fleet that it is a viable option fine but does it really need to be the only realistic option
oh yeah
so you think people will start bringing supercaps they already werent simply because of this range bonus i really doubt they arent bringing everything and the kitchen sink already combined with the fighter bomber nerf already on sisi supercaps wouldnt be able to act alone nearly as effectively as they can today
giving the revenant this bonus will simply make it sit in staging systems andor combat systems cloaked to give the bonuses due to its lackluster combat stats if you really want it to work make it create a wormhole connection to sansha techeh to whatever cyno beacon it is jumping to which capitals only can jump through once it shuts off the wh after a max timer like 5 minutes or as early as the pilot wants the wh closes and the ship is forced to go through the wh
one idea thats been proposed in the thread over in test server feedback is to give it 1 fighter per level instead of 3 but with a 100 role bonus to fighter hp and damage or maybe 125 this ties in with other sansha bonuses and would make dcus much more valuable on a revenant than on any other ship perhaps to the point where they might be worth fitting
not sure why you think that it has the ehp of a hel and people dont just sit cloaked in hels it may have less ehp than most other supercaps but its still got tens of millions of hp
way to ignore all other points but yeah i think that now it is too much effort to hotdrop a bs if it requires midpoint cynos with a revenant in gang you can reach far more systems same for hotdropping a few dreads you dont want more than 1 or 2 midpoints before it takes too much effort with revenant you have then way larger area where you can hotdrop supercaps in some random small alliance
if you think people are sitting around waiting to drop a pile of supercaps on lone bs all the time you may not actually live in 00 or have ever been in a supercap 
no need to go to 00 happens regulary in low sec obviously they need to be a bit careful but if you are the dominant supercap holders in the area not much can happen if you got a few more ready since realisticly you will need arround 20 nonsupers per hostile super anyway this isnt relevant point stays that with more jump range you just encourage blobbing even more
if someone is tossing supercaps at sub caps routinely without support then they will pay for it eventually this wont really hinder or amplify that behavioractually come to think of it this will hinder them because more of lowsec will be within the long arm of 00 and thus this sort of thing will become more dangerous for th elone supercap pilot supercaps arent balanced towards use in low sec so if thats your primary reason for not wanting it then its unfounded
1 it is just stupid to tell new players that they have to max out their learnings asap i have mine on 54 and am totally happy with that many people have even 44 or 43 and are happy especially because you need to play for more than 3 years to make this investment worth it2 if someone leaves eve because of the learnings he would probably leave eve anway eve is not for unpatient people who want instant gratification eve gratificates you with delay and this is true not only for learnings but for every skill in eve the longer you play the longer it takes you train certain skills eg bs v even if everybody would get the learnings instantly for free it would still take people 3 months till they can fly a battleship properly and would be thus able to do the big money they would still have to spend a month flying small and unspectacular frigates they would still have to read tons of tutorials and fitting guides so i still see no point in removing the learnings besides that some old players would get some juicy skill points for free
aw we always appreciate your calming commentary finn just an update wrt the current prioritization one thing i have proposed to the other csms is that we release not only the raw results but a version where similar proposals are grouped into categories user interface aggression issues war declarations missions and agents etc
wrongall countries have some form of parlament where issues can be voted against we are voting on issues and changes to the game here not candidates there should be an against vote but i think not in the prioritization it should be before that so that issues dont get to the prioritization list
calmness is for cows opiate binges and cliched zen masters just sayin
imo the problems with the current voting thread extend further than the op pointed out one of a few problemstake a really controversial issue that many people would love and many others would hate that issue will end up rising to the top of the list even if more players hate the idea why because the nay votes are silenced in this processi support this discussion but not the exact idea i think the solution can be easier give people 20 points they can use their 20 points for or against an issue i would likely use most of my points against some things that i consider a bad ideas so you take the difference of the for points or the against points on any issue and you have the views of the players incorporating how much they really are interested in this or that change
what kind of moron is going to build a cap ship in a system it can never leave 
you dont go to wormholes a lot do you
you should probably change the title to something that sounds a little less whiny because i think whats currently suggested in the op would improve eve
sorry what kind of moron is going to build a cap ship in a system with no worthwhile resources it can never leave 
you would be surprised how many people would do it if it meant a total lack of any kind of real opposition hell all you would have to do is build a pos in a system a fleet of caps and you could control that system for the foreseeable future without the ability to jump in a cap fleet to oppose
i dont think missions need a nerf but they do need changing like mining they are edly easy and boringlowsec needs a buff without nerfing highsec people shouldnt be forced into lowsec but lowsec should be rewardingwhatever the buff is it needs to be for lowsec only otherwise there would be no point in going into lowsec when one can just goto 00 and get all the benefits
the current description on the plex clearly states that the item cannot be moved outside of a station not even by courier contract i dont know if thiss how it originally was but i propose the description be changed i know i for one got fooled when i first read about the plex and it could clear up some confusion for newer playersits a very minor change and should therefor be very easy to implentps im apologize in advance in the case this issue has been brought up before im relatively newtldr plex description says it cannot be moved out of stations even though it can fix
if done right it shouldnt add to lag at all missiles are more costly and move in a bezier path too
well you can put 3000 people in a system when they are not fighting adding more calculations to a warp adds to lag without even starting to fight especially if you are in a fleet that is hunted down and need to warp to different safe spots all the time to avoid being ganked
even assuming there are no load issues there are some gameplay issues1 the curved paths could run you into bubbles that are not directly on the los to your destination and in the case of bubbles on your start grid you wouldnt know if you were going to hit them or not  warping from a station after undock to a point behind the station would be the most common case2 if you just use the straight line for bubble calculations youll see ships going off on your nice curve then snapping into the bubble way to kill the immersionperhaps a better solution to this issue is to chance the warp effect so that you see a highly distorted version of the universe outside your warp bubble one that makes it explicitly clear that warp bubbles can tunnel through normalspace matterwhether it is worth the dev time for such a cosmetic change is of course yet another question i can think of a ton of things that would be higher on my personal list
has anyone actualy bothered to read the eve historywhen initiating warp your internal warp drive opens a wh whilst also contacting the locust signature of your destinationa tunnel is formed from both your ship and the locusr sig meating in the middleas you pass through the tunnel your ship appears to travel in a streight line when infact it is traveling in a curve to its destinationthis is also the same way gates and capital jump drives acomplish there jumps but on a larger scalethe idear about distorting the back drop around a warp field would work just fine
nope
while i was looking at at the issues i realized that 82 and 83 are the same recommendationperhaps a discussion on rolling those two together is in order
people lowsec is not a place for noobs
it is if the people in low sec want victims
this may have been proposed in the past but i believe this is a very interesting way of clearing up some lag and add an interesting dynamic to eve the ships that are flown in eve are getting bigger i believe ships can be flown by one character but to fully utilize its potential it would need additional characters on board to work certain mechanics for example a carrier for battle should have the pilot which would operate the flying and certain guns and another character to operate drones and another set guns you could have other parameters set to how the ship would operate this would help on lag without having the cpu to calculate for all the ships by each individual character instead it would reduce the amount of ships yet have the same amount of people to the battle i think this would be awesome to have multi piloted ships especially in battle now with all that said you would be able to fly around with the ship without having to have additional characters on board but for battle and industrial aspects to fully work you would have to have additional charactersthat is my proposal and i really would like to see something like this i think it would work and become an interesting aspect of the gamethanks for you attentionbigred seven
ive seen this proposal before and it is a both fun and cool proposal but it would require some rather large changes to game mechanics and im not sure how thatd work outhalfsupport from me
the reason why this is currently uncodeable is that it runs into the same code limitations that carriers have in the fact they cannot carry piloted ships the entire game code would require a major overhaul for just this purpose if it is ever implemented
ive noticed that you never see ships like the rohk or hyperion in missions why not work them into the existing missions
mostly because there are no faction skins for those models theres a navy eom and blood skin already made for the tier 1 and tier 2 amarr bs for example but none currently for the tier 3 abaddon would be nice to see the tier 3 bs worked in to the current missions but id much rather see dev time being spent on other issues at hand i give this proposal a halfsupport
abbadon in mission
its pretty simple really and someone might have already proposed it but ill give a brief preamble in the current environment of capitals online motherships supercarriers are king followed shortly by titan doomsday many proponents would claim this is evidence why dreads should get an hp buff but i disagree the doomsday is designed with this specific purpose in mind instead to make dreadnaughts once again viable in capital combat the chance of saving a dread needs to be increased as even one mothership can easily melt a dread in 10 minutes pull out of a close range dreads optimal in 10 minutes easily and of course is untacklable save unique circumstances in times before dominion dreadnaughts would slug it out with the faint glimmer of hope that they are primaried at the end of their siege cycle allowing the carriers to repair them slowing down the attrition rate their side suffered dominion rendered this entirely pointless tyrannis worsened it by ensuring that these dated machines were now very costly liabilities in order to get back the viability of dreadnaughts i propose the following dreadnaughts siege timer is reduced to 45 minuteswhen lucky repair cycles and nailbiting countdowns for siege timers are reinstated the overall gameplay of all capital engagements will be improvedthank you for your time and please consider my proposal
i think the siege timer should be 5 minutes but not for the reasons listed eve has simply reached a point where anything a dread sieges for can usually be accomplished in under 10 minutes with the amounts of capitals we are seeing no reason to have a fleet sitting there staring at a reinforced ihubstationpos for five minutes while they wait to come out of siege
yes please d
yeah its on my agenda
triage was dropped to 5 minutes a while back for basically the same reason the same should be done for siege i think we also need to lessen the penalties on sieing and adding some additional benefits to start id completely remove the tracking and scan resolution penalty in fact i think sieging should give a tracking bonus rather than a penalty much like how triage boosts scan resolution by 900 a sieged dread should be able to fight moving carriers and bss the draw back is youre stuck there for a while and cant be rrd just my thoughts on the matter though
so add your support dad
supported yo
they need to get some kind of buff right now they are useless other than shooting structures so they should get buffed by either giving them more hp or more dps i personally would like ot see them get a dps buff and be able to target more than 2 targets in siege if you increase their dps to say 10k with only t2 mods then they may be usefull again sure that dps is rather high but if you leave them with the same hp they can still be melted pretty quick by supers and still instapopped by a dd unless they are tanked specifically for that damage typedreads take a bit to train for they may as well be usefull if you have to spend all that time to train for one
if u actually take pride in contributing to 01 of your fleet in most of your kills then i have a solution train an alt to farm kills on no waiting for unsuspecting cannon fodder or cat and mouse and u dont need anyone else to help either so ull be singlehandedly doing it all and it only requires the same amount of effort u can even failfit your alts ships and get your buddies to laugh at it
remove kms from game and pvp would get better
eve dev logistics on killmail kb modhave funoh and btw as a logi pilot myself  not supported
lots of ways to get logis on kms if you want the whole point is not to why would i want to announce hey guis i use 1230942830 logi alts cough insti cough when the current system rewards success and ambiguiety
just assign drones to km s i did it and it works great get 5 combat drones assign each individual drone to a different  problem solved
1 if logistics should get you on killmails they should also cause aggression2 that would mean you would give up the ability to jumpdock when ever you get primaryyou really wanna give up that ability for being on killmails
file a petition from the eve support tab left to this post or if you cant find it create a trial account and petition from there
they dont reply or have not replied to two seperate petitions
makes sense to me
could be an interesting idea
horrible idea but then again this is yaay so supers are fine
i would support this idea only under one condtion  as supers are living coffens atm and thats the removal of cynos if a ship needs to calculate calcualtions to jump and it takes 3 hours to do it its shouldnt need a becon or else all the work is allready done
jesus yaay you realize that many times you need to use a midpoint your idea not only forces a person to play for 3 hours just to move to a new system it makes it takes 6 hours to get somewhere if there is a midpoint this is an awful awful awful idea remember when you said i have no idea why bfm dislikes me idiocy like this yaay idiocy like this
bfmbtw you do realize the goal is to limit what supers do right they need to be a commitment which they are not the 2 account thing is a joke of a commitment its not a good thing that supers can move across eve in 20 minutes if supers want to be deployed directly into action then they should need some proximity in the first place regular capitals should have the freedom to do the daily bull
you really dont see how this is an awful awful idea
agreeing with a goon thumbs down
yaay is a joke much like this suggestion
deploying a super to the front lines from your home basehope youve got a few days
sounds like an excellent idea please visit your user settings to reenable images
three hours is way too long and it needs to be associated with aggression eg unable to jump for 1 hour after engaging in offensive operationsbut it doesnt actually solve anything merely makes using supers a pain in the arse the super blob will still trump any other available strategy with a comfortable margin and does nothing to mitigate the ridiculousness of supers being used outside null to gank bssubbsgood idea as part of a solution but by no means a standalone
as opposed to the current system where supercapitals are as fast to deploy over long distances as interceptors just like in the real world where aircraft carriers are just as fast as f18s if supercaps are intended to be a strategic weapon then there should be strategic consequences to deploying them and there should be ways for clever enemies to exploit errors in their deploymenti am not saying the ops suggestion is the best way to do this but it is worthy of serious discussion
the caps can be in one system every 1015 minutes an interceptor can hop between systems at will these are different kinds of mobility entirely
anything with a jump drive deploys at the same general speed supers a bit slower than some due to their limited range as for the real world im still waiting for functional immorality via ftl cloning bubbles and counter attacks seem like a tactical and a strategic dynamic that can screw with super deployment
horrible idea from a terrible person
counter attacks maybe bubbles no unless you know they are coming and their cyno is a complete tard with a shiny complex and makes the cyno in the middle of the bubble a hic or dic will melt the moment a mom gets a lock on them pretty much and mobile bubbles will tend to die faster then they can come on line there needs to be capital sized points to lock them down both as a cap mod and a tower mod sure if its traveling solo you are going to tell me that they dont travel in packs most likely with remote energy to boost eachother to move faster
it still takes 10 or so minutes even with the supercaps circle jerking capacitor if you have a group of archons or chimeras devoted only to this then maybe you can do it in 7 minutes but an interceptor can still get around much fasteralso dictors and hictors dont immediately melt anymore as fighter bombers do nearly nothing to subcaps come the 30th
what i would suggest is if youre down in null or at war dont be in space or out of a player owned structure when youre away or busy yes they would see that youre not paying attention but they would also have to beat guns or a station in order to kill you
i think you meant to post that comment elsewhere
not supported i just cant bring myself to grief the blob chasing me by denying their killmail they camped so hard to get that would make all of them sad idk about u but i just cant live with that much suffering on my conscience
they usually do that dont they
it would be incredibly useful if there was some way to differentiate between those posts and legitimate contenty ones particularly for the purposes of devfinder functions like on evesearchplease could such posts have a different band colour green and be flagged differently
id just like to see them gone because im sick of having to wade through this dumb crap to find actual serious contracts besides if everyone started paying attention like you want it would have the exact same effect as if ccp just removed them iow their posting would be pointless
pls explain how ccp just remove thembtw i note this is yet another of your make eve easiersafer for me posts
you mean something like block contracts from this person option that is already in the gamescams are legitimate in eve get used to it and try to be more carefuland please dont be immature andor lazy and use the price range filter for an item that you are searching its there for a reason also always filter by item type and never use item description filterall the tools are already there you just have to use them
if you get scammed in eve it is 100 your fault there are numerous game mechanics in place to protect yourself
anna i get the feeling that you havent read all of the economic reports or followed the economic forum posts that carefully over the last yearheres a great recent developer post for reference that solved a lot of things that were being speculated on for years
1 its u whos not getting it and needs to reread the comments to my posts and maybe it will become clearthat was the first post that derailed the real argument with another and it was far from the last because the ops immediate assumption of isk faucets being a problem is falseits the material faucets explained below u want to blame someone blame the idiots like yourselves that whine about me unmasking the intent of your semantics that u continuously derail with and hide behind for the sole purpose of hiding the truth2 u already stated yourself that too much flow from the material faucets will result in hyperdeflation look at the dropped ship prices compared to pretyranniss t1 insurance nerf many ppl warned it would happen and it did with just one isk faucet nerfed combined with oversaturation of minerals thats proof enough that if any faucet is the problem its the material faucets not the isk faucets yes these r your definitions too3 so thx for helping to prove yourselves wrong ure not fooling anyone except the other idiots crying over semantics grammar spelling and everything else irrelvant to muddy up the argument but grats on both accomplishments especially the latter next
refer to my previous post because all uve offered in your wall of irrelevant text r your own opinions and figures on how much richer u r with no unbiased proof and even if what u say is true it only disproves the ops erroneous assumption that isk faucets r somehow the problem rather than the material faucets its really the reverse and your post only confirms it good job
i think one vitaly important aspect gets overlooked in all of the discussions of isk value inflation faucet amounts etcccp has and continues to tweak the bounty rates i bet they turn up and down the average bounty of spawns weekly and has with patchs changed the asteroid generation rates and drop types in a way to maintain relatively stable prices on any broad basket of items well yes t2 had a long slideit was fairly orderly though and the pi stuff really has been shaking out of control  they dont get it all right by any meanswhat gets overlooked is that technology marches forward and unlike our world where the ipod doesnt sell much more than a sony walkman did for in 1985 despite its vastly greater capacity  utilty in size and betteries etcin eve the ipod would sell for 5 times as much so people would need 5 times as much isk the sums of isk needed for a t3 ship and the ablity for players to afford them poinot to far more isk per player even if the cost of a thorax or carcal stayed the same 5 million or so isk which probably represented a pretty decent ship in 2007in dd i think we refered to high entropy and low entropy worlds a 2 2 sword and 100 gold pieces might be great in one dungeon masters world and wortheless in another world where dungeon masters handed out 5 5 swords and 1000s of gold piecesif you hand out both more curency and higher value items you can maintain price stabilty but still make the currency of less value to a given player
my point was that neither isk faucets nor material faucets are a problem but i was giving the op the benefit of the doubt to try to recognize the problem that they felt existed i took the complaint to be that there was too much wealth entering the world and some needed to be removed to me a statement doesnt mean anything without an elaboration of how one got to the opinioni tried sometimes thats called a wall of text i guess
1 news flashop never responded idk why ud expect him to at this point2 its a wall of text when there r simple forum complaints to buff faucets and nerf sinks and market price comparisons to prove ones point namely mine
are you referring to the idea itself needed better explanation or the text i added if youre talking the idea itself i cant do much more as its pretty self explanatoryif youre talking the text wellthis module is used for the detection and removal of salvage class items from any space wreck deemed usable by the device itself due to concord regulation insert a number here salvage is more or less worthless until someone takes the time to remove it from a ship as until it is removed its just space junk it is there for not counted as loot under the same regulation and as such follows a first come first serve aspect to ownership of the material in question
and with 2 plexes you would get a 30 days personal concord escort whenever you went to low and nullnot
good suggestion
thanks for the suggestions i already had most of them in my list of potential combinations that csm will be discussingmy current plan is to publish both the raw results and the results with certain items combined into general categories like ui factional warfare aggression issues missions and agents etcif you find more things that you think should be combined please post in the main voting thread it will make it easier for me to find them
im sure this idea has probably been tossed out there before but i figure i could refresh itjita is always full of scammers and spammers making local chat pretty ridiculous at times i spend a lot time in jita and i like reading local apart from the two types of chat mentioned so i do the only thing i can to filter the junk out i block a lot of people as im sure many others doso my idea was this if a person is a constant annoyance to everyone else by spamming local with scams or whatever and they get blocked by say 100 people then that person should be blocked by the system from speaking in localif you agree that a policy like this should be implemented by ccp go ahead and reply to thisthanksjackie cane

its either you or me but some one misunderstood something here for what i gather the csm is a purely advisory body towards ccp we players or csm will never compel ccp to anything and thats just right soas of the csm members theyve not been elected to some ccp board of directors they are here to sort out our requests and remarks and voice them to ccp whatever comes out of it in the end whether a mammoth or peanuts they commit themselves to a lot of work with not much in return except if theyre lucky enough a little bit of gratitudei am not saying they should be adulated either but to despise them because nothing will change is just unfair thats not part of their jurisdiction
only good thing is black ops fix everthing else i wont comment becouse some one will cry

for blaster ships the problem is located in her rather weak ability to actually fill the role they once had there isnt much wrong with the role itselfclose range solosmall gang ships1 damage the damage advantage is not big enough to justifies the huge range lose or to make glass cannon damage dealer useful the numbers would be 15202 speedagility they need to be a bit more agile to speed up and slow down quicker this allows more precision where for movement in web range and puts you in a better situation if it comes to catch stuff quickly they also need to be quicker by boosting base speed what would improve shield tanked blaster pvp a lot or simply to remove the penaltys from active tanking armor rigsand shield ones if you are at it 10 more speed or change the rigs same goes to agility i somehow would love both ways since it would improve active tanks a lot or would give shield tanked blaster pvp a lot more edge in the skirmish role since it mixes high speeds with high dps3 web strength is insufficient to make point blank favouring the close range ship if you consider it as high end damage dealer or solosmall gang ship a bonus to web strength on all blaster shipsexcluding frigs to archive 75 on t1 and 90 on t2 hulls would go a long way to make point blank again a attractive combat range in blaster ships this would give blaster ships back the ability to pin stuff down control range flawless damage projection at point blank and somewhat release them from the pain of smaller ships immobilize you at your combat range it is ok that you cant catch everything with itnever was this way or that range  speed will be very effective against youever was this way however close range pvp handed out a very unforgivable combat environment what was a very good thing since it migrated the blaster disadvantages very good and allowed to play out your advantagesraw damage  flawless damage projectionalso lol csm
there are ways to resolve this rather than complaining postfacto become involved in the discussions while theyr still in feature  ideas or assembly hall if you dislike an idea get onto the thread discussing the idea and post your reasons for disliking the idea the aim is to persuade other players to see your point of view being able to vote no will not help you as much as you think it will being able to write a coherent argument against an idea you dont like will help you far morethis involves rational thinking and presenting facts to support your argument not simply posting your opinion and calling everyone who disagrees with you an idiot as a start keep this list of fallacious arguments handy and make sure you dont invoke any of these argument styles
thanks for clearing that out trebor
also keep in mind that ccp has many teams so for us to be yelling fix lag does not preclude us from also yelling fix the eve font  the people likely to be working on those issues will have little overlap and for me at least the ui is as big an issue as lag im an old fart and the font hurts my eyes more than you young whippersnappersyeah if theres one killer feature incarna should have its the ability to get out of your pod walk to a window and look outside
not to quibble but if theres one killer feature that incarna should have its the ability to go to a store buy a gun and then go and kill some of the other pod pilots you can find wandering around the station
btw nothing i say here is intended to disparage the csm they are doing a great job the idea behind this assembly hall thread is a good one  but the implantation made it worthlessthe fact that you cant vote against something or put any weight to certain issues makes it worthless any issue that is very contentious will get a bunch votes so ccp and csm will not see just how many people really dont want that change the docking games issue that they want ccp to address is a good illustration some people like griefers mercenary corps and others who love to camp stations for whatever reason and i admit there can be many good reasons like the idea but many others who like to just fly around in eve in smaller gangs or solo hate it and by the way looking out a window wont help that ceptor will point you and the blob will be aligned to the station a split second warp awayso what happens when you look at this issue well only the people who like the idea have a vote you hate it to bad your view is silenced anyone who is not a troll may be able to recognize this is not the way to go the other issue that you can vote for up to 20 issues or your just wasting your vote and beyond that you start to diminish your value thats a bit of a stretch look how many people happened to have exactly 20 issues or fewer as opposed to over 20 issues 20 issues is too much if you had diminishing returns for each vote then you would see many fewer votes players dont really care about allot of those issues but if they had to vote or waste a vote they may say sure whateverbefore you say the results will be the same anyway  let me just say you dont know that the only way to know is to actually do a good survey where the players can give meaningful input and then compare the results should i do another this is another bad idea here is the thread that the csm is going to somehow take into account when presenting issues to ccp here is a thread by a random player which one should we vote in csm needs to be the one to put this vote on not random playerstrebors response that they didnt just use these results is sort of beside the point i mean im glad you didnt just use the results entirely but thats because they are worthless but why use a worthless vote at allagain i have nothing against trebor indeed i am very impressed with his work at csm something like this vote thread had to be done and trebor stepped up and set it up no good deed goes unpunishedthe only reason i am posting in this thread is because the op is basically correct about the vote i hope that if they ever do anything else to try to gauge player support it will be much improved

thanks for the support everybodyagainst the forced selectivity i think we come from different backgrounds maybe in great fleet battles that would be a good compromise as you wouldnt get much out of 150 vectors anyway but in a small gang i need the info immediately once i lock eone the battle is 90 overmoreover theres a better way to present the kind of information you seek you should imo be able to select 100 ships and see the average or median vectors but ill leave that proposal up to you finally the two ideas are not exclusive to each other i need them all you need a selection the solution is obvious make the choice box for activating this feature a drop down combo instead vectors no defaultallselection onlyplease also keep in mind regarding clutter that the proposal asks for the option of selecting vectors based on the overview status as already happens for ships and drones you can remove your fleets ships vectors for example or keep only those if you are a logistics pilot
this would only help eve to be a better andmore importantlyfar more fun game as it helps pilots to achieve greater immersion and strategically provocative gameplay supported

suicide ganking isnt pvp its manipulation of game mechanics to kill individuals who have no means of fighting back while avoiding a meaningful riskreward scenario its griefing pure and simple and while some griefing is reasonable and acceptable because the victim is required to take action to initiate the response ie canflipping salvage stealing suicide ganking completely takes any control or prevention away from the victimstanding hits should be enormous and there should be no insurance payouts you want to know what carebear is its attacking a defenseless target in mass numbers knowing you cant possibly lose and knowing that your reward payout is always going to be higher than the cost of an insured ship its a joke
1 theres no manipulation or riskaversion but u could say the same thing with blobs and they dont automatically forfeit their ship whether they get a kill or not2 as for griefing refer to 13 wrong againprevention involves not making yourself an appealing targetaka blobs so either insurance for all or none simple as thatyet another idiot who thinks suicide ganking is somehow different than any other pvp
supported you do not get insurance money irl if you make your car into a car bomb or use it in a terrorist act it makes no sense that you would in gamesand box or not the mechanics should have some form of coeherency and getting insurance payments for ships lost to concord makes no sense in any frame whatsoeverin fact the current system is akin to a subsidy to terrorist behavior not anything any police or public would condone and again entirely nonsensical from a game lore and playeability sensethis does not get rid of a legitimate form of play as some supporters of the current nonsense would put it it merely removes a subsidy that artificially makes gankes much more profitable than they should be
you are completely and utterly wrong and being called an idiot by a  isnt exactly going to hurt my feelings if you are blobbed by a target you are blobbed by that target specifically because you have put yourself in a situation that allows you to be blobbed either your in nulsec your in lowsec your being wardecced your in fw you attacked someone who flipped a can or stole a wreck etc etc in all those cases you are 999 of the time going to be fitted and prepared for pvpunless your an idiot in 999 of those situations you could have did something to prevent yourself from ending up in that situation in the first place this isnt how it works with suicide ganks you can try to not make yourself as appealing of a target but that isnt a solution it doesnt prevent anything its merely a deterrent most suicide gangers will blow up an empty tengu just to pad their killboards and there is nothing that that pilot can do to prevent itoutside of not flying nice ships which is a ing stupid solution now that in and of itself is bullbut i can deal with it what i cant deal with is how the actual cost to the suicide gankers is almost nothing everyone always wants to laud the whole riskreward scenario but its totally out of wack in the case of suicide ganking its 95 reward and 5 risk and its stupid meanwhile flying around with a deadspacefaction fit mission ship is 90 risk and 10 reward again its stupidwhat is the point of faction mods  deadspace modules if they only make you a massive target for groups of people risking next to nothing in my opinion if you want to go after that billion isk ship your ass better be ready to lose big if you fail and you need to get a standing punishment that severely limits your ability to be a repeat offender thats how riskreward is suppose to workpvping is fighting people that have placed themselves in a scenario where they are prepared to pvp by their own actions it might not be fair but that person placed themselves in a pvp situation ive put a lot of hours in nulsec and i think suicide ganking is absolutely pathetic its the equivalent of a group of men picking a fight with a guy in handcuffs with his back turned and then patting themselves on the back when they kick his ass its pathetic
look realistically if the police had to wreck your car to stop you from doing something illegal your insurance company would not pay up this may be a sandbox but its still a sandbox based on rules and logic
same thing with suicide ganking this isnt world of warcraft where lines r drawn undocking is what sets u up for pvp not going into low sec etc and making yourself an appealing target is what triggers it idiots like u always make that misconception but then again that covert ops frigate should scout with guns instead of a cloak rightcorrection 100 riskchance of ship loss used for suicide gank but lemme get this straightsince using faction shipsmods make u an appealing target not using them as a safety measure is stupid hahaha seriously this is why no one respects carebears like uwhen its believed to be impossible uve achieved a new level of stupidity u never cease to amaze usthis is eve not world of warcraftagain low sec is not the designated battleground and high sec is not the designated sanctuary do yourself and get rid of that stupid mentality its all nonconsensual pvp and what ure describing is all the same whether its blob gate camp or suicide gank wake up and get used to it
getting insurance for a lost ship due to suicide ganks or self destruct is a nonsense insurance company would not pay in real life
police or not the insurance company realistically wouldnt pay up either way if u brought it into a war zone and got it shot up that pretty much answers the 18351519650 posts using that same flimsy excuse
very supported atm suic ganking is a totally brainless activity that uses loopholes in insurance to make pretty much any hit profitable the amounts you make from this are disproportionately high and the risk nonexistentno insurance for concorded ships or self destructed seems a good way to at least put some thought into the situation
deleted for double posting
posting to support putting some thought into suicide ganking
fyp why would any insurance company insure ships going in to a combat situationyes although missions arent pvp they are still technically combat situations
cosmetic only

very yes
great ideas locin
supported
supportedflights on the dramiel is too boring make it harder
i hate the look of dramiels too
i dont mine much but this might make mining more interesting
i dont support many of the specific ideas since they seem to make mining in noob space ie highsec too profitable compared to mining in lowsec or playersec nullsec but i agree with the ops general proposal that ccp should devote resources to making mining more interesting than clicking a rock and pressing f1
i fully support the replacement of asteroid belts with exploration sites this was discussed some time ago  at the time the devs suggested a different mechanic to probing since probing was hard but in the meantime we get given probing skills training and a free probing ship during the career training probing is easy these daysi also like the idea of increasing the utility of the survey scanner the miners could choose between simply mining every single rock or manually selecting just the richest most profitable rocks to mine after which they leave the site and some short time later the site despawnsincreasing the required manual interaction for optimal yield will help make mining a little more interesting
dont do a lot of mining myself for this very reason its tediousit could stand to be made a lot more involved and interesting
supported on the basis that mining sucks and shouldnt suck as much
not dying of boredom is a good thing you have my support
i agree that mining needs a makeover which is the only reason i support this but seeing as it is the second most practiced thing in the game it should require developer resources and it should be done in part to counter macros and make mining more exciting and complex m y corp likes the idea of mining and of being a mining corp but as it is its just so damned boring and easyshooting things is never as easy as just locking a target and pushing fire and mining should not be that easy either
amen to thati for one believe that many of the problems of mining could be solved by making it more labor intensive at the moment all most miners do is watch their lasers cycle and many dont even have the patience for that stealth miner anyonei am not sure what should be done but it looks like csm at least has gleaned some ideas from the community and are willing to expand on them there is a general discussion on mining on the november 2010 prioritization crowd sourcing page and while im not wild about voting on the we want to talk about it option its better than nothing
support give caldari some love
railguns are currently failguns 
pretty simpleplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesso we can just paste that into a spreadsheet
supported would be helpful in pvp to be able to see your targets manuvering without losing perspective on your own ship
agree only if its optionalon slower computers this would decrease performance drastically on the client side especially if we are talking about fleet battles
supportedthe technology to do this was put in place when they made ship preview and fitting screen 3d render the devs said so now they just have to add it as per the ops request
that would be one nice optional addition 1dont know how technically possible is it tho
i was pretty sure there used to be a combat window or something that was very similar to this i remember using it a few timesthen the shortcut stopped working and now it gone entirely anyhow i would support either bringing that function back or instituting this one
sure nice idea as long as it doesnt feed the lag monster
if you can do this without lagzilla i approve
would be very nice

you seem to have skipped the first sentence in my post and thus the entire purpose of the post i put it in bold this time for you the point im making is that no t1 cruiser is designed to easily be fit with t2 weapons400mm plates are the equivalent to medium shield extenders hpwise 800mm plates are the equivalent to large shield extenders hpwise 1600mm plates are one of the many reasons why armor tanks are better buffer tanks than shieldoh really a specious argument the only two ships im aware of that can accomplish this are the thorax and the vexor thorax is a complete eft warrior ship as the medium blasters  800mm plate mean it never gets into range of anything vexor is alright but drone damage isnt a good choice for most pvp situations when flying cruisersized ships
lse425mm kiting stabber fits fine with tech 2 weapons so does the 425mm 800mm plate rupture and the 180mm 1600mm plate rupture the vexor and thorax can be fit all tech 2 as well so can the lse blaster moa and the lse assualt missile caracaland what do all the 800mm 1600mm and lse modules have in common they fit on thestabberrupturethoraxvexormoaarbitratorassualt caracalbellicoseblackbirdwithout power grid and cputhe others fit at low skill without need to use as much high meta the fitting demands on the omen are to much it is something to say when a ship that has everything going for it slot layout weapons drone bay dmg bonusand yet it is the least used direct combat cruiser in the game do to terrible fitting issues
posting to confirm the omen suckssupported
ok sorry to ruin the good moods here but thats simply not being realistic whats proposed wouldnt solve muchtqs db has just undergone a major upheaval where items identifiers went from 32 to 64 bits apiece that means there was need for room for more than 43 billion stacks of this and that then we ask for a new stat on ships maybe modules too even if they account to a mere quarter of the 43b items a single asteroid is an item after all and im sure at least a few of us are still trying to cover tristram with gold over  in the really happy hypothesis that the proposed stats can hold within 4 ints thats adding at least 4tb to the db may easily be tripled or quadrupled depending on the views not to mention the pair of months to implement the structural modifications to the data model still not taking into account developping the actual game mechanics in the first placeand that would just be for the db next in line comes the cluster load i dont know but i read here and there that sols can already have a hard time in case of big engagements do you want to add up to that with a mechanism that will have to keep track of a lot of thingsbesides were talking of a system oriented towards reallylongflown ships only the vast majority of ships in the game i believe i may be wrong get blown long before insurance expiration delay now that would be some things to ask for some qen what percentage of ships are insured how many insurance contracts outlive their 12 weeks by the way how do you propose to impact repackaging stuff if you cant bring it back to pure mint conditionas you might say those are not in any case good reasons per se to reject the proposal theyre just part of the reasons why it would be quite impractical to set up did some people before me mention customers dissatisfaction p on the other hand i think we can perfectly contend with indefinite  perfect rejuvenation of our beloved gearsome might not have seen the olden days when things were made to last but its even rumored that there once were people that erected buildings that would do really well even after 25 hundreds of years  the fact that weve been raised in a society the ecomics of which somehow govern that it is more profitable to induce people to replace their stuff every so often doesnt make it any kind of some universal rule dont you think then theres this magical utopia of technological progress we in real life are already on the verge of being able to regrow organic structures for replacement and stuff why should it be more difficult for mechanical parts things that we design and manufacture and as such understand insideout how it is done i dont care and if you do youll have to tell me about nitrogen and oxygen tanks in every ship too and that would just be an appetizer pone step further i disagree that highertech stuff should wear out less than common stuff for at least two reasons hightech stuff is more refined than plain stuff thats part of what makes it more powerful but also comes at the price that it can be broken by a grain of sand where it would have taken a full stone otherwise eg tin barbs on miniaturized solderings thats it for ideology now for economics as in pvp having the feature weight more on tech1 stuff would be like imposing a tax on noobishness
this is true except spaceships arent just one thingtake my computer its a case from 7 years ago a dvd drive from 5 years ago a motherboard ram and cpu from 2 years ago and a psu and hdd from about 4 months ago im using a version of windows i bought about 6 years ago my speakers are as old as the case and my lcd thats maybe a year and a half old a while ago my graphics card from maybe 2 years ago bit the dust soon im getting a new one but ill still hang on to every other part of my computerafter that ill probably replace the motherboard cpu and ram then maybe the dvd drives depends how long they all last the case will probably eventually get replaced i need new speakersthis is my computer less than one m3how many parts do you think my 600m long hulk has in it
mehi support this half way i say ships degrade if you have to repair while in structure everytime you repair in structure 1 gets knocked off all the ships stats until it hits a maximum of 99you can get rid of this negative and overhaul the ship back to 99 at overhaul facilities for 50 of the cost of the ship or at player owned overhaul facilities that use 50 of the materials needed to build the shipif your ship manages to hit 0 it just falls apart and you get 1 tritanium from the ship scrapping service
do want if ships stored in hangars wouldnt suffer ageingonly equipment in use should agewhat kind of figure were talking about here anywaycomplete replacement after 1000 hours usage a year has 8760hrsfor example you pilot a hulk 6 hours a day every day 1667 days later 55 months you would need a new onecomplete repairif you play on weekends maybe roaming in a fleet for 10 hours total each thats 100 weekends or nearly 2 yearscan we weave shipcrews into this somehowoverall a nice idea for mineralproducts sink for the minersindustrialists out therei mean pvpnullsec peeps shouldnt have a problem at all their stuff asplodes way before the time is up anyway if you quit the game for a while your stuff wont suffer ageing too no penalty there if you use your stuff often  get used to it getting worn out
it will not generate a isk sink it will generate a material sink making the old ships useless buying stuff from another player dont remove isk from the system beside the station tax it move isk from player a wallet to player b wallet so the effect of your idea would be a strong push for inflation with an increase in value of minerals as you need more of them to replace the ships same thing for items modules drones probes ecc maybe even implants i suppose beside that keeping track of the wear and tear of every item in eve would slow down the database even after the upgrade it has received
hm what about character aging then thinking of itmy 10 foot beard  your shaved noob chin dude
1 supported i never want to see the day where i come on the website and seesystemwide damage titans for 30 plex get them while their hotwell that might not happen but you get the gist ccp will eventually do whatever they want but this gu
i agree with you make it so people dont get a edge

really like the idea but to not make it overcomplicated i think it should be just one button to switch between two modes mode one being high alpha low tracking high cap use low dps mode two being high firing rate hight tracking low cap use high dpsor we could make it complicated and give a bunch of sliders with which you can change all the parameters around those sliders would affect each other of curse cap slider slider set for minimum cap use would set all others in the middle trackingrange slider set low would give high tracking but lower range and vise versa alphadps slider set low would give high alpha but low dps and vise versa slider at both ends would set the cap use slider to maximum or something like that
as everyone and their warrior ii knows learning skills are potentially a nearly 6 million sp investment that can take awhile i know i did it yes even for charismathe actual proposal is to remove all learning skills with appropriate sp reimbursements with the notable exception of the skill actually named learninglearning is a 1x multiplier skill that boosts attributes 2 per levelthe new proposed learning skill might be moved to social but the important thing is to change the bonus to 20 and the multiplier to 2x the sp reimbursement would be forced to cover this change before it could be spent elsewhere
so in effect reduce the potentially  not all at once nor always trained this high 6m investment to an almost certain probably mostly invested at the same time 05m investmentchanging it from being 23 months maximum correct me if im wrong to 1015 daysi like it
supported covers the but its a choice crowd and gets rid of a terrible system that only serves as a terrible barrier of entry to the game
its a lesser of two evils solution ill support it on the grounds that its better than what weve got but i still believe we can do better
does your proposal include adjusting everyones attributes 10 or lowering everyones attributes when the skills are removedsupport as long as everyone gets the same attributes as training the current learnings making training slower than it is now is not an option
the exact value of the change per level might not be precise but this is what it would effectively do10 base attribute  10 specific attribute learning skills  11 old learning skill  22and the change would make it10 base  2 new learning skill  20so maybe 2225
yeah it would have to be tuned to end up at the same overall speed or a bit faster but it seems like a good compromise supported
i see nothing wrong with this and it makes people really think about choosing their attributes i support this
you all missed the fact that learning also boosts attribute gains from implants so now my 5s will be 10s thats balanced
current 10  10  511 275proposal 10 52 30maybe that would be a good compromise in favor of a 20 bonus implantless would lose a little implanteds would gain a little either way it decreases overall the current issue in favor of more short term gains
youre still not getting it but since youre quick with the numberstell me the current sp gain per minute gap between a person with 2s and a person with 5s and then the sp gap between the same with the 20 boostthis is important because many pvp folk use lg implant sets there are no hg versions for many sets so are forced to have 2 whereas carebears in hisec have 5s all the time and dont care even if you dont use pirate implants you cant afford to continually replace 5s or maybe even 4s if you pvpthis is just a boost to highsec and a nerf to nullsec nothing more
supported the current system has to go
ive always argued in favor of retaining the learning skills because i do think that after 44 they are a real choice in terms of pie now or more pie later however the emotions of others must be taken into account and clearly many gamers are minmaxers and would have way too much angst from wasting potential learning rates that wont reach a break even for 6 months or more well ill stopive been won over to the concept that anything that puts off new players from getting past the first few weeks or months of play and all of these threads have convinced me that there is a sizable percentage of new players who get fairly put off by the skillsive always thought that the fees for the level 2 books were far far too high and even moved towars thinking that plyers should start at 4  3but ive come to realize that some nebishes just wouldnt see that its more important to get into a battle cruiser or interecepter a few weeks earlier to start having more fun instead of going up to 54 right off and losing maybe a week or so in the first 6 months while in better ships and taking on the higher levels after youre sure you like the game the notion of purposely taking a less efficient route just is too appalling to themso marketing trumps the lesson that fun in this game isnt about relative skill points
that is a problem wih implants not learning skills maybe someone should make a prop about it
i support
background when someone uses the broadcast location function in a fleet a broadcast is sent to all designated recipients in their fleet window stating the location of whoever issued the broadcastrightclicking this broadcast brings up a popup menu that includes the option distance selecting this brings up a popup box stating how far away the system is in jumps and lightyears this is an existing feature already on tranquilityproposal make the distance function available from any rightclick menu that involves a specific solar system star map bookmarks et ceteraalternate proposal make the distance function available when rightclicking a star on the star map
this really isnt needed since all you really need to do is show inforoute and scroll to the bottom viola number of jumps to target systembut ill support it anyway since no harm can possible come from adding more crap to the right click menu
i support this idea but it should not directly negate other votes  rather it should simply be another set of data the csm and players may use to determine player temperature on an issueissue x yes votes 500 no votes499  this is not the same asissue x yes votes 1 no votes0if a huge number of players are in support of an issue and a huge number are against it  then that issue is important and should be high priority it also means that the solution presented might not be right but so many players care about it that it needs to be looked at
how about we make it so anyone can jump to cynos regardless of being in fleet or alliancecorp the person is in in the map you can see where cynos exist but you cant really do anything about it frankly also logistics and such are easy enough because of cynos my suggestion is open up cynos for everyone it makes things easier not requiring fleet and such but the added risk the moment you jump 5 moms are coming in behind you as for the moms they are most likely jumping in blindthe way to do it in the usual rightclick hud  jump to  list all your typical alliancecorp cynos then very last option can be option to open map which goes to cyno option then right click on the system and jump to cyno
me hey open a cyno for my jfalliance ok cyno is lit i jump alliance wtf insert players here hotdropped our own cynobad idea is bad
dear lord no
yes lets massively buff supercap gank fleets by allowing them to hotdrop through enemy cynos this is a truly excellent plan because supercaps are terribly underpowered right now
sounds like a nifty plan in order to have lag getting more field days
i agreeand logistics being too easy is 1 complaint everyone hears today this quickly fixes that
id rather see the jumpspace expacthe one where ccp gets rid of stargates between regions and constellations and everyone uses fuel to jump to stars cynos for added range and better target selection
yes in much the same way as switching off tranquility and setting the servers on fire would fix the problem
well here if you want a real boost to bring people in how about giving low sec npcs mission or rat a 10000 to 1 chance of dropping a plex as loot a completely random roll that maybe drops a single plex throughout low sec on an npc or 2 every day hell even id venture there for that chance
id be interested to see wspace used as a gate to regions of nullsec that are not connected to current kspace by stargateswormholes provide a bottleneck that would keep the current nullsec empires from easily taking over such new space giving it a level playing field and potentially even scoping those nullsec pockets for smallerscale sovereign statesthese new pockets of kspace could be anything from a single system to a fullsized internally gateconnected region with npc stations markets and everythingit might make for some interesting fiction if this disconnected kspace had different npcs different minerals etc but the ideal appeals to me even if its just more of the same it would also be interesting to consider the possibility of high or low security disconnected space but i think sticking with 00 simplifies things especially trying to explain how concord exists out there
wouldnt it be more interesting to allow players to place stargates or force wormholes into a semipermanent state in some wspace systems allowing alliances to start creating new regions with interesting layoutsit makes more sense than finding a whole new area of space with premade regions and somehow there is already civilisation there
island highsecs do already exist im pretty sure of it least one which requires you to go through nullsec to get to and guess what its practically empty noone goes there i only knew about it because our wormhole leads to different highsecs every 24 hours
hes not talking about isolated high security hes talking about isolated kspacefor example the jove and developer regions are isolated kspace they have their own stargate network that players cant get to because its not connected to the rest of kspace and wormholes dont go to or from therethe original poster is proposing additional isolated kspace pockets that cannot be reached by stargate from empire space but are available to players via wormholes
shameless bumping and supporting own idea 50 views and no feedback 
winthank you to everyone who voted and posted their commentsplex for neural remap has been shelved
easily first o
congratulations to everyone on letting your paranoia stall out the plans for all neural remaps youve managed to accomplished exactly what the op expressly said he didnt want this thread to dothis isnt a victory its scorched earth as ccp didnt just shelf their plans for plex for remap but all neural changes they were working on
something needs to be done about the drone skill because the bonus does not make sense literally and can confuse people like mealso please review all other skills for text problemssuch asexamplescout drone operation bonus drone control range increased by 5000 meters per skill level even though it says scout drone operation it applies to all drones which makes it confusing while i first though it only applied to scoutsfix 1scout drone operation bonus drone control range increased by 5000 meters per skill level applies to all drone typesorwe can just change the namefix 2basic drone operation allows a pilot to control both light and medium drones bonus drone control range increased by 5000 meters per skill level applies to all drone typesas you can see it can confuse any newcomer to the drone skillthere probably is a better way to fix this but this needs to be changedjust patch the textjust patch the textjust patch the text

in honor of justin bieber winning big time at the american music awards i propose the followingfor the christmas gift everyone gets a launcher that when shot at someone they turn their ship any any new ship they board into a giant justin bieber parade ballon this effect would last for 24hrs and the only way to get ride of the effect is to shoot your launcher at someone elsethis will provide many lulz and endless entertainment this is a nonlethal launcher so shooting random people in high sec should not be a problem
i want to say something mean and snarky i really do i can feel the rage building inside of me to nearly grimpakesque levelsunfortunately your proposal seems to have robbed my brain of the ability to adequately formulate that rage into wordswell played op well played
i propose that double dee and any characters on that account get turned into a justin bieber balloon for a year that should teach this troll a lesson 
for teh lulz
high fives develdrinthough the thought of a supercarrier or titan being turned into a giant bieber of doom would be pretty effin funny fc oh my god is that a giant justin bieberfleetmate run run for your lives before he singsfc nooo kill it kill it in the face
the last thing we need is something in game that would promote that kid
i dont think its super hard to do
why not
what could possibly go wrongsarcasmas long as its not as outrageous and graphic intensive as sensor boosters and eccm sure
and as long there is a button to turn it off separately
also give tracking disruptors a separate animation from sensor damps or make ecm be the same and have that as the generic ewar animation
lovely that that idea is the implementation of that idea and the apparent 3rd person effects are just not consistant to whats portrayed in the gameif youre generating a wormhole wormholes exist to our perspective much like black holes a singular point in space when u travel through it you traverse a higher dimension inside the 3 dimensions we percieve ccp has shown videos of wormhole style gateways from one image to another its the same system they use to show the destination system in the graphic for the wormhole ur about to enter you would not warp in a straight line if you were entering a wormhole you would appear to shrink into nothing no one would be able to track what direction u were goingfrom what i can ascertain eves warp feature ahem seeems to act like a warp bubble around the ship in order to counteract and bend the apparent laws of physics or the games perception of basic physicsi would like to say that yes its not a major requirement to get this done its just one of those eve features that ive overlooked for a long time when id started playing eve little things like that took my love of it down a notch
actually what should happen is your computer plots a course and makes a sublight correction to circumvent objects this could also help remove pvp from gates and stations
the august 2010 prioritization crowdsourcing project included 168 elements asking players to prioritize that is essentially asking them to sort that listaccording to wikipedia most humans when sortingordering a deck of cards for exampleuse a method that is similar to insertion sort on average an insertion sort requires on2 comparisons  essentially asking a person to choose between 28000 different priorities besides asking them to reorder their prioritiesa more efficient algorithm such as a binary insertion sort guarantees an upper bound of nn comparisons under the 168 suggestions in the august crowdsourcing competition this would reduce to a mere 860 comparisons it should be simple to implement a tool that could query the user as the comparison argument to a binary insertion sortif nothing else it would go a long way toward easing the pain of crowdsourcing and would likely give more accurate results
its not a sorting problem really except in the most general terms voters look at those issues that are there pick n that they feel are important and then perhaps repick from that set to get the ones they most want their votes to go to put it this way its not looking at three decks of cards scattered all over the floor and being told put these in order its looking at a menu at a tapas restaurant and being told pick a few things to get for lunch
my sorting algorithm for crowdsourcing involves on operations its not sorting at all its filteringfirst go through the whole list and rank the items based on my criteria for improvements to the game eg gamebreaking stuff gets fixed ahead of requirements that start with it would be nice if this rank is basically a star ratingnow take the top x ranked items and stick them in a post on the crowdsourcing threadand remember when you flip a coin sometimes its not the heads or tails that matters its the realisation of which way you wanted the coin to land
ops solution is a bit excessive but the crowdsourcing could use somewhat better software support one annoyance i ran into is that i went through the list opened a few tabs of things that looked interesting then went back through the tabs and none of them listed their issue numbers had to go back through the list to find the numbers for the issues i wanted to vote on im sure its also no fun for whoever tallies the votes to have to go through the forum thread counting either this system could use some dedicated software instead of trying to mash everything in through the wiki and forumsactually a question about that is this crowdsourcing thing all being done manually by the csms vote tallies setting up pages in the wiki etc or is ccp providing technical support if its being done manually i can see why that stuff like the issue id numbers on the wiki pages isnt being updated  thats a rather immense amount of work for just a few people

it would pretty much kill off the hulk anyone with an orca would prefer it over the hulk ill support this just for the heck of it
t3 miner should not mine better then a hulk but have much better tank maybe allow it to have weapon systems as well as minersi didnt read due to bad translations but my statement still stands
sorry delete it
locked per request
i think that ccp should go after bot and macro users with more agressive attitude
good idea i guess
instead of a jump range bonus it should get a mass reduction bonus of 20 per level the reason for this is so it can take any wormhole size and of course be able to take wormholes into any security space imagine the pure awesomeness of have that amazing looking ship at a trade hub in empire blowing up stuffthis bonus would not only be more fun but add some flavor to high sec also have a mechanic that will nto allow you to board the ship if you are in a npc corp
i actually agree this would be an awesome idea and in flavor with the sansha lore supported as long as even player piloted sansha supercaps have no concord protection
sounds like a nice compromise maybe have a mechanic that does not let you board the ship unless you are in a player made corporation also you cant be kicked from a player made corp if you are in space and ccp refuses to kick players that are in super capitals from corps no matter what i will update the op also be sure to give a thumbs up if you like it
this has to be a troll
looks like greed got in the way of the shut down of capsuleer dont get me wrong i have an iphone and used this app all the time capsuleer functionity to monitor character skills and status ccp events and development updates entertaining community blogs it was the best so long capsuleer and thanks for all of the fish
token we need second layer of protection account hacking hurt the playercorpalliance it concern the hacked player but also is corpallianceccp  its time to protect your players
i dont get it i follow the simple rules given in one of the wiki articles about safe flying or something and havent once been killed in low sec been close but survived every encountermind you im not a pvp person so i am avoiding all combat rather than seeing if i might winbut i still cant see while people wont read a bit and learn which mistakes not to make
boooyou want to see truly depopulated space look at sov nullsec
except everyone who does not like to live in claimable or concord space oh yeah everyone who lives in low sec if you want more empire or null sec space then make more of it as ccp to add systems but low sec is for people who like to pvp without the politics of null sec its either low sec of npc null sec neither one is claimable
i support thisand for all those claiming technical reasons against it id leave such comments to ccp devs if enough people want it id imagine they would at least consider the feature and its feasibility
why not implent joystick support while were at it the idea itself is actually pretty awesome and i can imagine itd change the way many pilots thinking mainly interceptorfrigate pilots navigateuse their shipi dont really see a downside to this except for the obvious technical problems that might arise but as the poster above me said lets leave that to ccp to determine
while i would love this it just isnt possible instead of a node crashing with a few hundred people it would crash with 20
id love to see something like this or even wasd there is a way to fly in any direction double click so there is at least some implementation of manual controls now lets try mapping them to something less carpal inducing speed updown pitch uppitch down etc does not seem that hard to do at any rate id rather let ccp say if it can be done or not while letting them know that if they do it i would love ita reticle i dont think would work at all but all up for manual flying
this is why poses were made modular rather than a single unit
they tried this when eve started and the code literally spat it out like it was poison
its always ridiculous theres a simple solution  minimize local when in jita and pretend that it doesnt exist thats what i do anyway
any time now as blobbing has no definition and is a contentfree snarl word you might not want to hang your hat on that and as cooperation is part and parcel of game mechanics working as intended you dont have an argument there either generally when we refer to a fact it has to be something that is well factual what you really are saying is that your subjective disagreement is that some people can cooperate more effectively than you can and can form bigger groups than you that you try to cast your subjective preference as an objective problem doesnt make it so you are lying on both countsnot only have i addressed the risks inherent in cooperation ive also addressed why your argument is nonsensical as the same exact risks exist in cooperating with one other guy as the guys in your corp as the corps in your alliance as the alliances in your coalition but of course youre not advocating that ccp nerf the ability for two guys to form a fleet or ten guys to form a corp or two corps to form an alliance or to say nothing of the fact that youre committing the fallacy of equivocation and deliberately conflating different types of risk as if there should be a greater risk to fitting two guns than one and a much greater risk to fitting eight guns than two what with those dastardly gun blobbing ships and all likewise ive never claimed that eve is real life or mentioned iraq or the united states much like the contradictions that you simply cannot quote but really they exist you cant quote me doing any of that because youve made it up if you contend otherwise quote it we both know you wont be quoting it though
trolling posts removed please remain on topic
missed the moderation nvm
to put it straight i was looking forward on this one and was hoping to get it passed i think its a bit ridiculous that this affected me and some of my friends who were also planning for it lol and how things can impact from a decision of some minority or whoever the body is i just want to play have fun no stress would i have to worry about whats happening up there just as to how people worry about elections i dont really mind but i just want to get a word out because i havent really seen a plex for remap support thread or i am just ranting pwasnt it a winwin decision for both i mean people do the exact same thing buying and trading characters converting plex to isk but for me i dont really think it would really affect anyone people would only remap to train faster so that they wouldnt have to wait and ya know waste time i dont think most would even use real money just to buy the plex for a remap cant people make enough isk to buy plexs themselves and then use it them for remap or in whatever they want with it remap  one year until you can do it again but maybe its a good thing i mean if im an official peep who has lived and played eve for years i wouldnt want anyone to get ahead of me in some form of cheating using real moneyz but who cares let them have their own fun i think that would even mean more pew because of the newbs remapping and more ka to ccp right i just think people who have played long enough who thought like this are just sad i mean who cares about people using their own money its their money advantagedisadvantage i play the game and we all make iskspeaking of isk the only problem i saw from this was the plex inflation because of it maybe i hope to see it die down back to normalfurthermore about the recent news could this probably mean some transaction of a sort where people who have money can buy official things separate from people who just want to play the game like wee look at me i bought my logo because i can i hope this doesnt turn into a mini webbrowser game who ask  for official itemsoptions thing so was there at least someone who supported this if so why would you think it would be good all in all for both sidestldr  remapped hoping plex for remap recent news turned downnow can we have prices back to 330 again c
i am still hoping that ccp convert neural remaps to a booster which can be manufactured by players and comes in various flavours  eg an illegal variant which reduces the remapping interval to 8 months or sothe soul of the eve economy is player created materials being traded by players to be used byagainst players neural remaps as a game function rather than an ingame effect and vanity items sold directly from the eve store go against this grainwell just wait and see
no
the correct decision for the welfare of the entire game and ingame economy has been made after long and hard discussions between csm player elected representatives and ccp the developer plex for remap has been discussed to hell and back on numerous threads on the forumtheres no need to discuss it any further  were done with it if you wanted to support plex for remap you should have posted in the discussion threads that were active for months especially in the assembly hall section of the forum i believe csm and ccp have read most of the constructive arguments for and against this feature and decided whats the best for the game
yea perhaps so but thats another thing that just bugs me i dont really need to go on the forums to participate i just want to play but then again i know if its good for the game its good for the rest of us im left to wonder if atleast someone had a say of backing it lol sacrificing a few days just for that aint seem so much anyhow i hope to see everything for everyone like that one dude said lets just wait to see i dont know how csm or the body representatives do stuff and all but i know they are also players anyone can relate to asides from the vet to newbs difference
nice event its good to be able to directly ask the csm some questions nice job moderating dv
i was unable to make this but the effort by the csm is appreciated it is however disheartening to see this thread got a whole 2 pages of replies while incessant whine threads get tens of pages of replies reading the transcript now thanks again
it makes me sob sometimes 
thanks for taking the lead on this round table dierdra you did a great job on all of it sorry i could only be present for part of it the wiki transcript was a good read and that is a nice editing jobagain thanks
great idea and thanks for the effortits a pitty that helen highwater and alpha were not in attendance this would have been a great oppurtunity for the community to see them in action and to meet them in person
i confirm that my favourite solo pvp playgrounds are broken serpentis one as i understand it from a context of a post also the bloodraiders deadspace last pocket could be changed to the structure instead of that red cont bots just loot with no risk and as for the keys between the rooms bloodraiders is a good example how to do it  just kill all npc there mix those 2 good solutions and you will make solo pvpers and duel lovers happy i did submitted a bugreport about it and i hope they will be fixed and if you will take this suggestions into the consideration it could be even better
ive had them respawn i was able to do the same complex twice in one day because of the respawn however that was in high sec and things might be different elsewhere
if we are going to discuss impossibilities i propose we roll back to red moon rising since i kinda missed it and there is that fun flash video about it but lets take the idea a step furtherwhat if bear with me we could have singularity rolled to different versions of the game like have tyranis week and revelations fridays it would be like time travel but with game versions you could go back to before there were even more than 20 ships or play with that badass looking alpha ui we see sometimesthink of the unreachable possibilities
spend about 75 of your presentation time justifying your own existenceoh wait thats what you did last fanfest
there are some pretty healthy threads around about blasters and railguns needing attention but i read a post in one that outlined the weapons systems  outside of ships and it made me think a bit more about the topicmost comparisons deal with different weapons as they are fitted on various hulls  as in comparing an amarr battleship fitting lasers to gallente with hybrids when you pull the weapons off the ships and compare them the weapons themselves arent that far off but when fitted to appropriate ships the ship stats and bonuses make the hybrids look fairly lamerockets needed fixing vs just the ships but i think all the fixing could be handled at the ship bonus level for hybrid guns not just gallente ships but the caldari gunships need it too i think id also prefer the devs to take a good look at the ships with respect to balancing them out a bit better  if they are tweaking around bonuses they might be able to look at the other stats of the ships and perhaps bring gallente ships more in line with some of their counterparts from other races
what about addressing the portal range issue by providing a t2 and named variants of the portal generatoras a fan of the dominix i would like to be able to transfer my drone skills to the sin and would happily give up the hybrids bonus and all the turret hard points for some more drone dpsreppingslightly larger fuel bays combined with slightly better bridging fuel efficiency and range due to namedt2 bridge generators will address most of the issues people have with black ops i would not want to see them buffed to the point of being capable frontline combatants so if they become powerful enough to replace t1 ships when running missions you know something is wrongthere should be some sacrifice for the ability to bridge in a subcap hull in return the bridge should have utility that can be expanded with some expensebuff range by 5 to 50 based on some modules reduce fuel consumption by a similar amount on others have the pilot choose between higher range or better efficiency
the problem with drones is that they dont apply damage on the target immedelately so this should be fixed aswell ether buff drone damage or drone vellocity bonus

noabsolutely not micro transactions are for trash games which cannot hold its own subscribers so they are forced to be free and finance from micro transactionshowever microtransactions severely move economic power differences from real life to game world and that is not something that will allow fair play and equal terms for everyone
can someone please explain to me in a substantial post as to why plex for remap is so terribleplex for remap doesnt make you better than other players as long as implants and learning skills are the same your max sphr is no faster than any other players i think too many people likens plex for remap with plex for sp i do agree that plex for sp would be really really bad however its plex for remap and not spplex for remap allows players who dont want to commit a full year to a specific training path lets admit it to someone who is only a couple months old at eve a full year feels like an eternity and that massive amount of time can be intimidating and may contribute to a lot of newer players quitting evealso lets leave the slippery slope fallacies out of this plex for remap whats next  slippery slope fallacy and whining about ccps profit margins theyre a buisness their goal is to make money deal with it
is there any real reason why noah hates faction war so much
not sorry that the next xpac was pushed back 2 months maybe ccp is starting to hearwe shall see if the next release is ready or excellent

if ccp manages to ignore this 94 page thread with nearly every poster giving hisher support well should say enough about ccp i trust them they wont let us down though op definately got my support a game doesnt need a load of features to be good what it does need is you guessed it excellence
yes better font internationalized fontlike one i did in just an hour but a bit betterexampleps text from wikipediapps i cant simulate eves font smoothing technique in photoshop precisely
this honestly shouldnt be that difficult compared to most of the other stuff ccp has been working on and has been needed for years
its too boring to have one frigsized ship that can pwn every other frig
not supporteddont they cost substantially more than any other frig out there market equalizes all things if a curse can kill a dram and cost less then the dram is balanced in the context of the game as a whole the other frigs just need boosting to match
no dram pilot in their right minds would be caught within web range of a daredevil also when one ship can only be countered by a single expensive ship in its own ship class theres still a problempersonally i say take out the drone bay or drop a mid
the future of mining is in my opinion that most of the rocks spawn in anomalies but what to do with the belts we already have i mean they are one of the main pvp areas in low secmy answer well we still got planets also pvp will just shift towards the anomalies while reading the op i got the idea of to some extend merge radar ladar and mag sites so you can find some abandoned ship wrecks or some hidden hacking can between your roids also having some gas clouds around in these sites is a great idea and why not extend gas mining to be able to collecting the left over dust clouds of a gneiss roid
yes please
well got to agree with you there i am gallente also went all the way up specializing in t2 425mm hybrids which are fine against low end missions then took my megathron into mini space got into mission with angels in the angels extravaganza and well got popped when i found i did crap dps due to only having em  therm ammo i quickly revisited the research books again and went into caldari ships as missles have ammo types for all situations and have been there ever since but i would like to get back to using my hybrids that i trained for so long to use and felt horribly let down by their limitations vs other weapons so yep please fix them
agreed eve needs more shiny things 
i very much like this idea
great idea 1
good idea i was thinking the other day that some sort of pictureinpicture for targets would be cool 
well if freespace 2 had it why not evemake a bounding boxinvisible around the targeted ship stick a camera on the left side of the box show what camera shows
nice idea i like itbut should definately be optional for performance reasonshate me for saying it but as far as i recall even wow had some addon that replaced the static portraits with animated rendered 3dportraits for player and targettargets target

supported but i think the boosts are too high id say 1015 cpu and maybe 3050 powergridits hard to fit but it still fits stuff not as easy as say a thorax if youve been trying to fit heavy pulses on it theres your problem have you tried fitting a thorax with a full rack of neutrons its not gonna happen cant expect the same thing on an omen
you saw what has to be done to a caracal to fit lsemwdt2 hams you and i both agree it is a bad fit that with max fitting skillsa moa with max fitting skills has to use 2 rcu to fit t2 neutronslsemwd and nothing else that is a bad fit using high meta and max fitting skills you still have to fit an rcurupture can do 425mmlsemwd but you are talking about a 4 weapon setup no missiles as compared to the 5 weapon setups of nonminmatar ships stabber and belicose are more of the samevexor can fit heavy tank and mwd because no one worries about dps from the guns so they stick some piddly guns on and rely on drones for dps otherwise you cant even fit a full rack of neutrons and a mwd without running into a grid wallthorax with max skills runs up with the grid wall just putting a rack of neutrons on it the only reason no one complains is because they dont put the high end guns on a thorax and accept that they will have to fit grid modulesall the cruisers are tight fits if you stick an mwd and a full rack of t2 weapons on them
you can fit a full rack of tech 2 medium weapons and mwd on a rupture moa and thorax without fitting mods same with the stabber caracal has problems but alara mentioned the assault fit only for his example of fitting t2 weapons on it
i didnt say it wasnt possible hybrid cruisers go with the smallest medium blasters already minmatar can stick the big acs on the omen can easily be fit with t2 focused medium pulse though if the argument is that minmatar cruisers can fit heavier weapons than the other races cruisers the flaw in that is that minmatar are simply fitting 12 less guns to accomplish this
been mulling over this one for a while might as well put it out therebasically divide each plex by 30 sell 24 hour plex on the website for the price of 50 cents a piece maybe give minor discounts for buying large amounts or something list the average market price of plex on the buy plex webpageplex becomes a lowerend trade commodity people get to buy isk in increments smaller than 760 million since im pretty sure you can only buy plex by the pair ccp gets praised for having an inovative new business model and still turns a profit and the economy gets more interesting for everybodyeverybody wins nobody gets hurtthe only real issue would be that people could remove trial account restrictions a little too easily but im sure that could be worked aroundbonus subproposal plex for pizza becomes easier to implement
sure we need smaller units than 15 dollars for microtransactions and them based on a time unit makes some sort of sense
signed bumped and delivered
bump
supported out of common sense i still maintain that 24 hour plex would be a good idea if youre going to introduce microtransactions by the way
hull  orcapurpose  tower tear downdescription  the aptly named squid is ores solution to the ever growing population of abandoned towers whose system codes block the deployment of new towers while being more than a speck in the background doing nothing while the standard solution for tower removal has been a blasUFFFD of gunfire and torpedo launchs it is both a waste of ammunition time and a good still usable pos structure to this end ore developed a special array system that allows for the hacking of offline pos towers and there recoverythe use of this ship requires a module known as a recovery array in order to use this module the squid must be within 250m of the tower and is locked in place while active unlike siege modules you may cancel the activation at any time restoring ship mobility but you must complete the full cycle to get the tower the squid itself can carry up to 4 raw towers which are restored to normal status once they are placed in a stationpos hangerthe recovery array is a complex set of large robotic arms with various tools to break through and into a towers hull to access the tasty goodness inside it has 2 effects depending on if the tower is currently active or offlinenote both the ship and the module require a skill to use both reduce the time required to hack a tower up to a total of 50 with both at level 5when recovering an active tower ie one that is still online but its shields are down it takes 4 hours every additional squid that works on the tower reduces the time by 20 minutes with the tower going to the squid that started firstwhen recovering a offline tower its internal defences are low on power and even lower the longer it remains offline  starting at 4 hours every day the tower remains offline reduces the time for recovery by 5 minutes  with more squids reducing time as above it will always take at least 15 minutes to recover a toweradditionally after 2 weeks of inactivity concord no longer considers it a hostile act to recover a tower in high sec as by that time the emergency supplies for the towers crew will be running outwhy this would be of benefit removal and reuse of the plague of offline towers that some people simple dont care enough to reclaim on their own due to towers can now be taken some of the people with the offlines may recover them no real way to abuse the system any potential target of the squid was going to be dealt with by gun fire anyways and would have been destroyed
id rather see the story behind it that the code of the tower gets hacked and it then goes over into your hands and then can get unanchored but wea ship like that is needed imho the orca is not too big nor too small as a hull the prices of towers wont really feel it as the price will go down by 200 with incursion anyway soi see nothing against such a shipedit must have somehow missed it  supported with the caveat of no effect on online tower
i personally quite like this sort of idea gives a new orca variant that can be used just about anywhere especially within whs to remove some of them pesky towers that seem to be abandoned
i dont like the idea that it can be used on an online tower with no shieldssoquick way to bash down a pos  punch through the shields and then set up five squids next to it boom  suddenly pos armor becomes meaningless
sorry i ment for that to include armor as well basicaly once you get the pos to stucture you could take it
youve got the same problem though an entire layer of defense is suddenly rendered useless so why have it at all lets not forget poss are not ships  they have substantial amounts of structure 8000000 hit points for a non faction large tower by example the idea that you can completely bypass that doesnt sit well with melimit it to solely offline towers ie towers that have run out of fuel and shut themselves down and id tentatively support the idea of hacking them to take them down if not your exact implementation
supported with the caveat of no effect on online towers
im not seeing the problem here if you have managed to break a tower donw to only its hull left the towers dead in 20 minutes anyways why not have the ability to bring in a ship to take it a single squid with full skills will still take 2 hours to crack the tower and if they bring 8 squids 15 minutes minimum still seeing that i might not see the issue maybe a compromiseafter you bash down the towers hull it enters a second hull state  sort of like a secondary reinfore like outposts have that lasts for 1 minute breaking any locks at this state the tower has 25000 hp  less than a cruser with no reistances what so ever  at this time you may attempt to take the pos or fire one more round and finish the job
i guess no support or whatnobody wants to pull his favorite station hugger closer
ill supportbecause it would least keep kiting tacklers on their toes u know the ones that stay a completely safe distance but still within max warp jam range til their blob comes
yeah why not
1 yes i want it asap
any ship traveling under a certain speed that has a lower mass than the other ship without any web or anything will then be completely unable to escapealso wouldnt it break aligning unless you propose stuff being towed sideways which would effectively stop speed from helping you escapebut ill give you a thumbs up since itd be pretty damn hilarious
would suggest the creation of tug  modules that would allow smaller ships to act like they are bigger we currenty have small tugboats that can push giant freightersother wise yyes
one thing id like to see is this as an alternative to hauling smaller ships by cargo hold
i support this as long as the tractor velocity is a debuff and not the same way as a webifier so a fast ship pulling directly away from the tractoring ship is only slowed down by 500 ms but if the ship is orbiting the orbiter would have to compensate larger ships should be able to affect smaller ships more than a smaller ship can affect a larger one
cool idea time to train up the battle rorqual
while were at it lets make salvagers do structure damage to minmatar ships
i cant believe im saying this but i would support this with some tweaking of the  and implants
supported in principlealternate proposal1 learning the skill remains unchanged it stays at a 2 bonus per level and remains a rank 1 skill2 the other 10 skills in the learning category are removed and any skillpoints invested are reimbursed3 a new skill called self improvement is introduced the name of the skill is tentative what we call it is unimportantself improvement x1soct advanced mental training while this training obviously is of great value to anyone the most impressive results are achieved by students with great latent potential training in this skill allows a student to develop almost superhuman mental qualities2 point bonus to all attributes per skill levelthe overall effect on skilltraining is thus almost unchanged while still reducing the number of ranks in the learning category from 21 to 2 i note that anubis xians original proposal also reduces the number of ranks in the learning category from 21 to 2 this alternate proposal should address concerns that anubis xians original proposal is a highsec buff or nullsec nerf because of the effect of implants
anything that gets rid of the current system
that does sound like a better solution keeping the dynamic the same seems to be the critical issue
nice
heres my only contention doesnt it seem a little overpowered to have a total of ten attribute points allocated for training a skill thats only a 1x multiplier i say make it at least a 4x there might be an objection here since one of the main issues people raise with the learning skills is that they take time but heres my thought making it a 4x multiplier makes leveling to iv not convenient per se but certainly doable and level v a good chunk of time sacrificed for the advantages gained this is more appropriate i feel since 1 with a single skill as powerful as this it should take some time to max it out 2 it is still considerably less time than training all the learning skills currently in existence and 3 only those who really wanted it would have maxed skills i understand leveling the playing field but timeintensive skills exist for a reason the game would be a lot less fun if everyone could specialize in everything and likewise i think something as important as the most advanced level of a learning skill should be reserved for those who work for itthoughtsedit forgot to support topic
made this idea up in another thread liked it so much that i refined it and made it into its own post  so without further a due the bio shipunlike normal ships bio ships are not built they are grown a bio ship consumes both food bio pastes and such and knowledge skill points this means that you cannot actively train a skill and grow a bio ship at the same time when you start of you get an egg after caring for it for about a day you have a basic ship thats more of a frigate sized shuttle than anything else this is where the customization of the bio ship comes into play every aspect of the ship is based on what you teach it to grow into you can teach it to grow big and strong reaching through the size categories all the way up to titan status take a heck of a long time or what its body structure is like as an example i could train my ship to better resist em damage by 5 with about 4 hours work i could then add another 5  stacking with that time  15 so 6 hours  with it maxing out at 95 i could get my ship to grow its first mid slot referred to as a node of which i would then get it to grow a bio shield hardener that acts much like the current devices do with the growth of its first high slot it gains a visible node on the hull of the ship that any weapons node you grow in a high slot fires out of  to make it easier to actually build a ship model this means that 34 turrets will appear to fire from the same spotwith this system the possibilities are numerous but there are restrictions first and foremost its your pet and it wont listen to anyone else so you cant swaptrade it second as the many banks view a bio ship as a pet they are not covered under any form of warrantyinsurance lastly to get a bio ship up to the point of being better than its class of ship ie a bio battle ship can be a lot better than a normal one takes a serious investment of skill points and once blown up is irrecoverable the loss of a bs sized bioship could set a player back a half year or more in skill points
so you want eve tamagachi
i like the idea of a fully customizable ship but i would make it use new skills that need to be trained higher if you want to further improve the shipsay bioship 1 gives you te ability to build a bioship about the size of a frigthen you can train bio offensive systems giving you the abilety to make gunslaunchers on the shipif you lose the ship you lose some of the skills in line with t3 ships perhaps more the bigger the ship isyou can also train the skills before you start building the ship then your skills will make the ship grow faster depending on the skills
somebodys been playing starcraft i see
we are all kosh
actually i see something more like peter hamiltons voidhawks which while cool are not at all in keeping with the story that is eve1 for cool but cant support it
although it might fictionally make the gallente less suck which means i like it unfortunately it wouldnt fit well into eve as i understand it
i too want vorlon cruisers yes plox
mchief moved on from ting up features and ideas to ting up assembly hallbravo
species 8472 much
i dunno about tier 4 but a line of biologically grown ships does sound interesting sort of like the wraith ships in stargate atlantis
so you want to take the t3 concept to another levelbioships would be interesting but i can think of a hundred things id want to see happen first
im so glad that im not the only one who made the voidhawk connection my answer is also the same as develdrins
great idea think you just went up in my estimations
haha i like it 
sounds good set sail for win
in carebears are any of u people actual 00 pvp players not oh im in a pvp corp an actual player of the game because this is just stupid i too have to deal with the hisec wardec corps who just sit outside amarr and kill people who are stupid but their is a simple fix dont be stupid and they will go away its because of the winers in this forum that they will never leave maby if u stop giving them targets to shoot they will give up and not shoot u anymore did anybody think of that or did a caldari noob just school pros
can you please clarify to me what a griefer dec isi was under the impression that all player corporations are fair game for declarations of war and the rules of those declarations are exactly the same across the board
basically what youre asking for is null sec that cant be attacked by capital ships but you can build capital ships in it thus making an impenetrable fortress even if a current large 00 alliance didnt find it first whoever was able to secure such a space would end up becoming a major force simply because they would have fairly safe null sec spacei like the idea of building out gates to connect different systems in quasikspace regions though
sounds like wspace but with sov stations gates and a market oh and the first alliance to colonize gets supercap advantage foreverno thanks wspace is great as is delayed local no supercaps no lag no blobs and if you dont like scanning htfu
although the op mentions nullsec exclusively i would like to see this expanded to an entire region or two that includes all security spaceensure that in each large blob of kspace there are unique resources and materials and then you end up with an economy that needs to go through wormhole space in order to run this makes wspace more interesting in general and will increase trafficby making the space not exclusively nullsec and including some low and high sec you create a way for established power blocks to become challenged since there is a safer staging area for an attackeras an additional means of moving between these regions perhaps there can be a new class of ship that is designed to use really far jump gates and consumes some kind of fuel to do so something that cant carry a whole lot of cargo 100s of m3 this will allow people to move between these regions but at a potentially high costside note i wish people would work with and modify and idea into something better instead of an outright omg no u nub
there are too many stargates not too few
we cant entirely control what ccp decide merely inluence if we are lucky as it stood ccp were about to introduce plex for remaps something that a vast majority of posters were vehemently against it seems ccps reaction to this is to forget changing remaps at all we cant help that but given a choice between plex for remaps or none at all i take none at allare you suggesting that if slightly less ppl reacted slightly less strongly ccp may have kept the other ideas for remaps  how on earth would we control that  are you suggesting that perhaps we should not have reacted at all  then we would have plex for remaps exactly what the majority here did not wantultimately ccp suggested they were about to implement something and that something got a reaction a very vocal reaction yes but an honest one really tell me what you expected us to do when we were so completely oposed to the idea
yes aswell them reconfirming vanity mts this is the other negative to this announcement it also worries me as why would they completely removed this option if not to reintroduce it later when people are ok with mts while i do not think we should have unlimited nms i do not see why they couldnt be gained through another mechanism like the lp store
well doneccpi love you
hear hear
there are more cases of that with other skills that also need to get fixed
a minor fix but goodsame thing needs to happen with the ewar drone skill
a lot of skill books need their text redone might as well start here
ive also found confusing skillbook text irritating
warp speeds are generally not all that differentiating i say we make systems 10x larger or so to make warp speed much more important at the same time fix those 500au systems by leaving them the same sizethis will mean that interceptors will be able to actually catch stuff because systems are large enough for it to matterthis will increase the time logistics take relative to freighter warp time
i agree with the idea in general but have you ever flown a freighter i mean 1000756022 so it takes two whole minutes for one to cros a system with 100 au now think about a 500au system and then thing about having to cross 20 such systems 50007560x20yep you would spend entire three hours in warp now thats fun isnt itthe real problem is not that the systems are too small rather than that all ships speed up at the same speed in warp ceptors and freighters alike if that would change or we even would get instant speed up like startreck etc then things would be a lot better and ceptors would get much more out of their high warp speed
doesnt this seem like an entirely backwards solution to the problem you presentspace is quite large it is unimaginable how long it would take to cross the average system in eve at subwarp speeds rather than increase the size of every single one of the 7500 systems new eden has why not simply tweak warp speeds to achieve exactly the same effectin particular the acceleration rates of ships warpingincrease the rate at which the faster warping ships reach that faster warping speed and perhaps slow the acceleration of the slower warping ships and now you would find those ships have an easier time catching upi agree with you though that there is a problem
in reference to all ships with a ship maintenance bay when destroyed currently their contents simply vanish from game this is inconsistent with the way pos module smas work they pop and everything comes out like a pinata its really neat it also makes for silly killboard denial gamesi propose that the contents a either pop out always b pop out sometimes and  or c show up as having in the contents of the hold on the killmail just like drones in the dronebay doif you vote for the proposal please indicate your preference
i want option asupporting my own proposal
do louder votes count for more
they should be shown on the kb and some shout pop out
i see no reason why option b and c cant be combined that combo gets my vote 
best idea to come outta the csm in 12 monthsfull support
wtf is this 
come on drake you know you moused over the support box for a few seconds you know you want it do itdo it11
it would be nice to kill him over and over again but in most cases we wont be able to so noalso i like south parks way of dealing with him
the only time ill ever support a thread by you is if it ends your existence with a permaban

pretty simple not sure if this has been proposed at all before but as a lazy merchant id really appreciate having the ability to quickly sort through my personal assets by sec status and jumps to work out what ship im going to use and which route im going to take to pick stuff up inalso another minor thing that i was unable to add to the subject line is the question of cancelling a set destination to my knowledge the only way to do that is to load the map options which involves atleast opening the system map and at worst if youre unlucky opening the starmap moving the waypoints menu to a different place making a new option in the right click menu on your shipor anything to remove the current set destination or making it so that you didnt have to load a map automatically when you clicked the map options could all potentially work i dunno if theres a simpler way of cancelling a destination or waypoint thats eluded me then please tell me it just seems too long winded to really be the only way
option 1 no for the above stated reasonsoption 2 already exists its called an ecm burst module got tactics get a hic in the middle of enemy fleet warp scorpion to the hic activate ecm burst modules in staggered cycles harvest big blob tears in local
or just implement lineofsight blocking targeted modules causing the blocking object to acquire whatever effect was being projected ecm projectiles stasis web etc just the kind of calculation a gpu excels atthis would add a new dimension to small scale combat blob warfare and escort ops

well most of the posts that were for microtransactions are in the threadnoughts about the subject i dont recall any particular for argument since most of them fall into category of microtransactions so what groupso if you are looking for some counter arguments for the decision ccp made your best bet is to use evesearch or wait for a constructive nontroll good luck with that feedback here from someone that was actively following the subject the best situation would be if a member of csm dropped by in this thread and gave you the direct info
i wasnt too bothered by plex for remap considering how the forums are anything ccp says results in people whining
1to all those who say sp for iskplex is a bad ideaectit already exists in game nowbesides the obvious if your subbed your buying sp with  lets look at it this way two characters created the same hour same day one player sets up his ev
i think a smartbomb dedicated ship would have adverse effects for those who do the smart bombingsmart bombs rely on the surprise factor if i scan a gate and see a smart bomb dedicated ship on the gate ill never warp there in my small ship depriving the ship of the kill if the smart bomb ship was just a regular sb fitted bs though id probably warp and be killed by surprise
jumprage should get a buff  an exeption to the rule that u can alwasy make 1 system jump even if the distance is bigger than the max jump rangethe 75 tracking buff is useless without extra power grid to be able to fit them in the first place

i like some of those ideas makes mining seem alot more fun and more engaging also if this system is adopted or some such do away with asteroid belts all together possibly
it has merit
unsupportedthe mining system is just fine the way it is
and i love being stabbed for no reason if you think it does not need to be fixed you have either never used it are really boring or are a lazy macro writer who does not want to have to rewrite your macrosi say give the system a good shake up that stuff you said sounds goodalso when do we get comet mining
it definitely needs a makeover it just isnt fun
too lazy to read all the posts to see if you have this update but the market for ships has been simplified for ship typesthese changes include advanced ships too wootone bug that i do not like is that the item review page right hand side resets to the top every time you interact with a direct buy very annoying
yes yes a thousand times yes fake edit ffffffffuuuuuuu

firstly a little note number 105 make more faction items tradable on market csm is already going to be implemented as seen here incursion feature page second from bottom though that one does not include faction modules but rather faction shipsand 45 and 142 are pretty much the same thing just 45 is more specific and 142 is more general ill add 142 to my list but 45 is just as important and i think they should be combinedlots of good ideas though i have a lot of favorites because of thatsingoth 15 50 83 must 85 92 109 117 129 142 156 163 202

first off it can not fit focused without heavily diminishing tank and even with this buff it would still need to use adaptive plating it will not overpower the the ship in the least but let it be fit as effectivly as the others with the prescibed buff it wont even be able to fit heavies just a small usable tank and focused pulse as well as be more friendly to newer playersas for the rupture you are overlooking 3 thingsthose 4 guns get a double dmg bonus covering the loss of one gun giving it an effective 6 of the largest acsit still has room for two energy nuetralizers and double the drone baythe omens second bonus is to weapons cap while acs are cap free and it uses nuetsas for the stabber its second bonus goes to a kiting tank and it fits the big guns as wellthe moa is usually fit with ions not wasting a mag stab slot getting 400 dps with a 30000ehp tankthe vexor can jam a 1600mm plate and deal over 200 drone dps and a 800mm with between 400 and 500 dpsthe thorax is ok but fitting should allow ions in my opinion and the caracal i would love to see a good brawler fit availablein all they all have effective fits and even though i am not happy with the overall standards of the cruiser line up this buff will in no way overpower such a rarely used ship all i am asking is a small and well agreed apon fitting buff so it doesnt slip through the cracks and will see mainstream use againso please give your support for such a cool ship and breeth just a bit of life into it
there are a whole load of ships that need rebalancing such as the enyo caracal vexor thorax moa brutix omen etc
the argument is that the omen and caracal cant fit cruiser weapons tank and mwd unlike the other major cruisers in each raceedit bomberlocks what wrong with the vexor i can see the thorax due to hybrids being crap but the vexor is good
no no problem running desired fits

the only issue i can see with this is that ccp will get charged for each transaction by the banks other than that this seems like a sensible and logical idea if were to have microtransactions they might was well be efficiently and conveniently implemented
i support this proposal in the advanced tutorial when you get the destroyer coercer  i did the mission couldnt even fit a full complement of t1 medium lasers small an ab tried to mod for armor tankingi almost lost iti did it again in a punisher i was afraid to an antifrigate destroyer almost lost what chance would i have in a frigate it was like night and day its sad when something in its description states that it is an antifrigate platform yet loose to 1 frigatei didnt even know about the glass cannon train of thought but even then that fails the coercer is a glass pellet gun
i love my gank catalyst on frigate roams but to be out dpsd and out ranged by dramiels daredevils and some t1 frigs is just well pathetic glass certainly but a cannon it is notcmon ccp give destroyers some lovecoercer for example has only one mid you get a abmwd or tackle not bothcormorant only has one low so its tank yeah right or magstab not bot i would like to see this turned into a rocket boatcatalyst and thrasher have good slot layouts but i would have to agree that the catalyst would be much more useful with a damage bonus instead of the falloff bonus considering the pathetic dps of small rails the couple hundred meters you get from the falloff bonus is useless when using blasters
by the way aging is already implemented in using mining crystals its just a logical extension to more items and can be greatly balanced out by numbersthis way it wouldnt ruin the game at all its completly in the hands of the developers to do this rightonly problem is you have to trust them so they dont mess it up completlyit also can be fixed during every downtime if something is going wrongand yes why dont people become older ingame you can always jump into a new younger clone
im not sure about this one cause technically our characters are just clones were biocreations and were in a sense created to be 1 anyway
it is not ageing it is usage wear in game mining crystals and laser crystals are ammunitions and are consumed they use a slightly different mechanics from other ammunitions but the end reasoning is the same you use your ammunitions to get a result and doing that you consume themnote that you can use stripminers without crystals and they will never wear out
no if i wanted to play reality id look out the window it would simply create meaningless money and time sink
well this is a simulation i think its a good way to make it as realistic as possible it should be logic and somehow right still its fiction and of course most mechanics of eve are completly unrealisticone of my friends would like to add something to this ideathey should be a different racial bonus to aging or wearing however you want to call this amarr ships for example are slow so they have a bonus on aging minmatar ships because they are fast and fragile will age a bit faster obviously their construction is not that sturdy as other races are the other races are just in between some will be easier to repair others more difficult so aging can be controlled by high level mechanic skills or specialized stations like the amarr stations where you have bonus on building ships can probably help an old ship with doint some restauration just some ideas how this feature can be implented in many different ways
think of the planes and boats we use today on earth most of them have very long services lives here in canada laugh it up we have a fleet of cf18s from 1980 theses are 30 year old fighter planes that are just being replaced through the next 10 years id assume that our ships and equipment in eve receives the same maintenance and care our earthly cf18s received or even more this maintenance and care is abstracted for good reason1 the economic difference between the interstellar credit and planetary monies this maintenance would only cost fractions of an isk2 this micro management would simply not be fun for the player i dont want to return to an account that has been inactive for over 200 days which i just have and have to spend a bunch of time and isk repairing all my ships
no
supported  more fw love please
supportedi honestly dont think it would take that much dev time to fix the current situation having spent several months in fw and throughly enjoying it im not really sure how to make it better though i agree it could use a lot more love
while im or less happy with fw as it is i dont plex and system occupancy doesnt interest me mainly because i see fw as the easiest way to get constant targets and easy to find fights there is a lot of room for improvement  system sov should be awarded on a killdeath ratio not by plexing system sov should give the sov holder an lp bonus fw kills should give good lp based on target value and should replace fw missions as the main way to earn lp that will help in removing an isk faucet in game
noah hates fw he didnt want it released and doesnt want any work done on it now it isone personally opinion is ruining gaming experience for a not insignificant portion of playerswe enjoy fw we like it its our part of the gameeve is a sandbox game not this 00 is the endgame garbage
no i didnt do a lot of fw but i would like to see this expansion deployed fixes for fw fixes can come after january

currently pilots can produce tech ii modules with the input of tech i modules however in some cases the new created total volume gets much smaller let me give you a few examplesstrip miner i  deep core mining laser i  volume 100m3  volume 5m3  modulated strip miner ii  volume 5m3ice harvester i  volume 100m3  ice harvester ii  volume 5m3strip miner i  deep core mining laser i  volume 100m3  volume 5m3  modulated deep core strip miner ii  volume 5m3in these examples the volumes go from 105m3 to 5m3 or 100m3 to 5m3 which do not make a lot sense for the producer is adding stuff togetherthis is a minor issue which can easily be adjusted however it is an important difference for haulers and markets that do work with them
the volume of the t1 items got increased so it wont be so easy to haul them into nullsec to get minerals out there
so theres a skill called tactical shield manipulation who per level drops chance of damage leaking through shields to armor if you regularly passive shield tank for pvp this skill is absolutely nutty to train to level 5 because when your ship is say around 1520 shields its actually better to have a small bit of damage leaking through the shields as this leaves shields higher and regenerates more shields better i suggest the ability for the pilot in that situation collapse shields for a second the shields still regenerate like they would as if there was nobody shooting yousimilarly for armor tankers you might decide to collapse shields from the beginning when you still have say 75 shields left then when your armor hits 0 you turn shields back on it regened to 100 during fight and it gives a bit buffer just for a cycle or 2 of your repper
this is i believe an awesome suggestion would add a bit more strategy to tankingsupported
supported
would like to see an ingame effect to this too
the ability to turn off your shields temporarily i like it
when i created this thread i was unaware at the time that there were other pos threads ah well just more of a chance to get the poss fixed sign this

in favor of new orca variant either way
games whit microtransactions dont have subscriptions plansif ccp wants items shop in eve should remove all subscription plans any kind of microtransaction should automatically remove the subscription feemicrotransactions or subscription but not both on the same time few example this games have microtransactions but this games dont have a subscription feeatlantica onlineddovindictus world of tanks allodsglobal agenda
i think notreason huge profit drop for ccp entirely
over my cancelled subscriptions
and if you like player dont accept microtransactions and subscription on the same time and cancel your accounts there wont be any profits just sayingread again if microtransactions get in eve remove subscription plans
it not complex subscription is stable funding microtransactions are notbesides those u mentioned games have alot of issues i rather not seem them reaccumulate onto eve
you misinterpret my meaning if ccp goes to an f2p model with microtransactions for everything in sight i will cancel my subscriptions and go play something elseyou want mts for vanity items fine because then i dont have to pay to keep up but if you dump subscriptions altogether how long do you think it will before youre using microtransactions for everything else like skill books  wanna fly a battleship thatll be 150 please
world of warcraft has both subscription fees and microtransactions how does that fit with your idea of how an mmo is supposed to work
eve already has a free to play option was there anything else you wanted
by subscription plans you mean like plex
if eve changed to micro transactions i would quit immediately i hate being nickled and dimed i want to pay my monthly fee and enjoy all that the game has to offer
this game has both sub and plex the only difference between this and other mmos with microtransactions is that so far eve only has 1 thing as long as it doesnt bring inbuy 1mil sp for 20 then it will be fine cosmetic things are ok as well remaps are ok but it would be better to be an npc service that is exponential o provide an isk sink
in theory i like the idea of having just a couple of modes for simplicitys sake but it would pretty heavily reduce the usefulness of hybrids being modularyour second suggestion is much more useful but it can be simplified since 3 sliders seem like a reasonable number of options for sliders ill go with that as well the sliders can easily fit in the current overview as module slots without actually being modules of course for ease of use one slider can fit into one module slot and be differentiated from the other sliders with different colors maybefirst slider could just be damage output forget about toggling between high alpha vs high rate of fire just have the option to increase dmg at the cost of more cap so no change in rof much simplersecond slider is just for range increase range by increasing cap usagethird slider is just for tracking same deal increase tracking by increasing cap usagethis format would allow for each player to decide how they want to reduce cap if need be while still giving plenty of options that make sense for a variety of situations
the pirate population is almost completely destroyedcaldari pvp has been horrible for far too longthe csm have failed to adequately address these problemssnip please mind the language spitfireits basically a method for care bears to get their waythe playerbase should be represented by independent lobbies based on profession not on the gallente style democratic election anyone who is democratically elected is bound to be an incompetent idiotfor the first two reasons ccp needs to be kicked in the balls the csm cant do this it has failed big ass timeadded 25112010i dont have all the time in the world to reply to your idiotic comments one by one so im just going to make a blanket statement i dont care about what initiatives have been put in place to do things this is just a repeat of past initiatives that were supposed to do the same thing the csm has failed to institute any measures to fix anything in the game the game used to be good and the game design has progressively become worse and worse due to emo whinging on the forums by carebears the csm has done nothing to stop the steady decline in the quality of eve it only serves as a mechanism to confuse the stupid who are in the majority that changes to the game are being implemented this is exactly what is happening with the rocket fix i dont want to go into how the changes to rockets dont affect caldari ships to make them viable at pvp what my proposal is is that we get rid of this forum where stupid people put their stupid ideas forward and influence the game to make it more stupid ccp obviously dont play their fricken game if they did theyd fix it they obviously dont because its been broken basically forever piracy is dead there used to be piracy in eve a lot of caldari mechanics are broken and have been broken for a long time generally pvp shield tanking is broken t1 battleships specifically caldari weapon systems are broken in pvp some caldari ships were designed to fit webscap rechargers and have had their mid slots removed making them nonviable pvp platforms and in one case pve pvp is moving towards being completely consensual ie you have to sign up for faction warfare  there are a whole lot of dialogue boxes popping up warning you if youre going to perform an illegal act additionally you can abandon wrecks to prevent flashy red people popping up around you this was actually supported by the csm faction warfare introduced basically another antipiracy policy in eve by introducing massive organization in lowsec that is something in the order of up to 6000 players to effectively prey on pirates so theyve introduced a predatorthe csm has achieved nothing dissolve it the only surprise i expect to receive in upcoming expansions is surprise eve just got worse they havent achieved anything regarding real money items in eve online dissolve the csmremoved trolling remarks zymurgist
signedalso the playerbase should be represented by ccp playing their ing game
and i think that the majority of players should feel free to direct the game as they please by electing those who represent their interests as opposed to leveling the playing field and giving an apparent fringe equal say with the mainstream that said tears are delicious if you dislike the current csm structure maybe next election cycle more people in your profession should actually vote
if piracy sucks there will be less pirates and therefore less votes to count towards pirate candidates you sir are a good demonstration of why the csm has failed and will continue to failthank you for the demonstrationtrolling remark removed zymurgist
but if most people dont like being pirates then why should there be a push to satisfy this fringe minorityand if most people dont want to support the interests of this unpopular minority then why should their interests be a prioritynot supported due to nonsense
in that case the playerbase doesnt exist and i dont grasp why you think it should be equally represented i also dont accept that there is such a huge demographic discrepancy merely on your saysooh good when all else fails do result to playground insults it truly drives your point home certainly please continue with your elaboration im dying to hear why a playerelected body should represent a career path that isnt mainstream in the playerbase or be dissolved for failing to follow the wishes of the majority of the electorate
notsureifseriousjpg
im gonna bite and just point out real quick that the chair of the csm is a pirate
i tried running on a propirate platform but was disqualified because i account shared in the past the guy who dqd me said that if i kept my nose clean id be allowed to run again next timemaybe ill give it another whack
id vote for ya at least youre an honest crook
1 pirate population destroyed bull2 caldari pvp horrible fly a drake or get a falcon how about coming up with a solution and not just crying tears3 ccp is the problem not the csmthis is nothing more than a troll thread and a whine festseriously waste of time
i think all decisions should be public poll upon logging in tbh
not supported due to op apparently being an arrogant prick who cant refrain from opening up with insults you already have the most control possible over the game stop playing if it doesnt work for you since you are expressing your opinion that the forum is for morons to express their opinionsi find i have to agree that it does go down like that sometimes
bad troll is bad
csm is just a joke nowthey killed it with the announcement that they wouldnt be working on eve for 2 yearseither listen to the csm before releasing features that ruin the game or just kill it
what exactly have the csm done anyways that ccp couldnt figure out by reading the forums occasionally
agreed
unsupported and op is a nonsencial silly billy who needs to learn the pewpew rather than qq on the forumsproud carebear
actually compared to the more recent csms of the past this one is pretty goodits actually restored my faith in the process as a whole
the people on this csm have done a great job im not sure what you mean that they have failed they presented the issues that people voted for in the assembly hall when ccp basically responded yeah whatever the csm made this very clear to the players and put ccp in a position that they had to address some of the itemsin dominion and tyranis im not sure any proposals were incorporated by ccp now we have rockets getting a boost t2 ammo getting a boost ghost datacore production got whacked i think there are other changes as well these items were not on the radar due to what appeared to be a busy schedule for the incarna and dust now they are getting done it is because of how csm handled the situationnone of these changes are a big deal to me personally but then again the proposals in that get support in the assembly hall generally are just requests for minor tweaks so its not the csms fault they are not changing the game dramatically fact is the players never can agree on any dramatic changesmy only concern with csm is they seem a bit insulated from players they have private message boards where it appears most of their work goes on i would bet they are posting more there than in jita speakers corner i think that is unfortunate because its hard to know who to vote for if you never really see what positions they hold its sort of like ccp used to post here on the forums then they stopped so they got a csm to represent players and use jita park forum to interact now the csm no longer posts there as they have their internal forums where they hash things out perhaps we need a csm to the csm to find out what they are up to but this trend of the players getting further and further removed from ccp is not good imo
pirates are completely destroyed if thats even true its most likely due to level 5 missions and such that pirates now run lowsec incentives failed to lure people to lowsec and instead converted pirates to carebearism i guess there was a bunch of pirates who went to wormspace also as for caldari pvp if we look at the only valid true pvp capship pvp in top 10 recent kills as i type this 3 of them were caldari for the last 5 capship kills 4 of 5 top damage dealers were caldari only beat by a nyx plenty showing from caldari so that aside lets discuss csm before they existed people posted ideas and when  never got implemented they blamed ccp so ccp created csm to filter the ideas and then when something doesnt get implemented people blame csm csm performs this purpose absolutely awesomelyif you think for a second that csm has any power to change what ccp is doing you are quite naive now their continues threads and dev blogs with the propaganda saying they do is quite false you see csm discusses every topic about balance and proposals ccp knows these things and plans to fix them whenever then when the topics start getting fixed they check off as if they were successful however go back and see how many failures theyve had and youll understand
i dont think you need to worry too much the csm has had an internal forum for over 2 years although it is getting used a lot more now than it was a lot of what goes on in there is nda stuff that we couldnt discuss anywayi am quite happy to give my opinion on any topic to the extent that the nda allows and i suspect that most of the rest of the csm is the same way i monitor jita park and assembly hall daily and post if i think i can do so constructivelyin addition you can get a good feeling about what positions csms hold by reading the meeting minutes and the various summit reports and i have no doubt that when election season comes around we will all be focused on answering questions about our positions as we busily whre for votesand tbh if time spent working in the internal forums has cut down on time available to post in jita park then that is a good thing overall  it means ccp is communicating with us more which means we have more opportunities to get things done for the players
csm didnt immediately make everything perfect forever for me personally so therefore it is 100 a waste of timein other news i am not what is wrong with the rl political process today
dear op you are an idiotsecond learn to read patch notes we got a hole lot fixed in the past 6 months cause of mynxees crew new server hardware rocket fix in a few days even better fleet fightsthird look at the csm members there isnt a single carebear on the listforth be thankful you are on an alt rest assured posting with your main would get you shotblaa blaa blaa blaa ok im bored typing now
have you participated in mynxees make lowsec matter project
ive always been a big cohcov fan and i was thinking about the pve experience today coh has a mission creator which has added a lot of content to the game has there ever been discussion about this kind of thing for eve it would make running pve stuff a lot less boring because the content would be a lot more dynamicthoughts each tier of mission has a bounty allowance as well as a high and low cap as far as ship difficulty goes a mission can be flagged as whatever style intel security etc the author thinks makes sense the content of the mission all of the text etc would be subject to community votingreview the winners would get reviewed by ccp for inclusion in the game abuse would be limited due to the community review the allowances and ship restrictionsthis would sort of crowdsource the act of creating new missions which would take some burden off of ccp employees that want to work on other more interesting thingswhat do people think
should elaborate more how ever im pretty sure that unlike cohcov it probably couldnt happen due to game mechanicsfor merit
i dont know that it couldnt happen  im imagining some client that exists outside of the regular eve client which would let you position static objects spawnwarp locations etc it could be pretty basic to begin with  create a trigger system that could be attached to different object types ship structure etc that include proximity warnings destruction etc triggers can cause spawning sequence starts etcit would work with our game mechanics if the mission code were standardized and streamlined in such a way that it could be modular in the way described above once a mission is submitted and packaged up the notion is that it could be easily dropped into the mission hoppers after getting signed or whatever after community and ccp review goes throughi dont think it would be too much of a stretch to be honest
writing missions could be a viable activity in the isd volunteer program
i support this as well eve need new players
while im not against the idea this is ultimately eve and not star trek online
im against lets not call this startrek
to be completely honest guys i never watched a single episodefilm of startrek i have vague idea that it is also happening in space but thats about it im getting idea completely out of pvp practice in eve space since i am mainly station warrior and station hugging enemies are my worst nightmare since they are only waste of ammoi still think although there has to be ofc alot of tweaking and some limitations that tractors should work on ships and drones too
you should use a different module than you average runofthemill tractor beam for it though i mean seriously turning a pveonly module into a pvp oner just like that next we know salvagers fire decloaking rays and ofc the new module being basically an ew one would have to be allocated in mid slots
supported
excellent idea i look forward to it being implemented as its somewhat surprising that it hasnt already been supported
i was doing some mining in a hauler today and saw a person with the word crotch on his name i decided to petition it realizing it was literally pointless afterwordsso this is a topic to bring it upas minor as it is i think immediate bans would be the actionthere are to many people getting away with inappropriate words for names and im not sure what the rating of eve is suppose to be granted that there is none of any language filters i found over 100 cases of the inappropriate nature i think this need to be addressed even if it is small
crotch is not an offensive term in fact it is a polite term for that region of the body compared to oh any of the other 50 terms i can think of i think you need to chill out and let people express themselvesmind the language please spitfire
doesnt matter this game is played by younger players and while it is in the petitions to be reported i stand firm on reasoning
same was said for an idiot called va monologue and that chars name was removedso i throw your stupid reasoning right back in your face palthe point is not whether this game is full of adults or not majority of which have the brains of kids as it isits whether eve online should have filth or noti wont pretend to even fathom where that line should be drawn but the fact it keeps getting crossed is the problemand furthermore its not the name or the wordits the idea behind it and that is what needs to be stopped
thus is my point of addressing this
i didnt support the idea because im not sure banning would even help let alone be effective enoughas it isits likely too harshlosing the name to a generic minmatar citizen 3252352352 is hilarious enough for me
i could support that
erm thats what they do if they find your name unacceptable they use a randomizer on youdid you think people actually named themselves that  tease
eve is for everyone id hate to see a loss of playersubscriptions to parents seeing their child chatting to some guy named 111 in the game
hello your concern is unwarranted as this game eve is rated t not including actions by playersif words offend a teenager they shouldnt by playing online or games in general well maybe they should just die sorry but its true its a damn word oh i said damn im offending you go cry in the corner k thanx
no your missing the point its not general languageuse and its not just for teens eve does aim for the older community but it is for everyone
i want to vote no to this ideano
it must have have been an awful long time since youve been a teen if you think theyre mentally unprepared for naughty naughty language im not sure if you meant to sound like a pseudosocialist douchebag but thats what it comes across as when you capitalize everyone eve is not for everyone eve is for paying customers whos parents if theyre above recommended age but not adults are supposed to be taking a hand in their entertainment choices there is already a system in place to deal with it if a name es you off petition it and if its a eula violation it will get dealt with i certainly wouldnt hate to see ccp lose subscriptions of overly square busybodies because they dont cancel subscriptions of gritty harsh players in their gritty harsh mmo
fair argument but the names are abusing the eula and are still being broken there are lines that has been laid out
crotchthe word is not even filtered on the forums seriously bro chillaxbans for name violations i would have hated to grow up in your household if those are the types of consequences you think are appropriate for the crime
whats the first thing that comes to mind when u hear the word crotch and it has nothing to do with my household besides i didnt say anything about crotch being the target of this topic now did i inappropriate names are
when i think of the word crotch i think of the place between a persons legswhat is so inappropriate about that weve all got something there why is it inappropriate to talk or make jokes about it inappropriate names are funny and fine if you are seriously offended or think any childs parent who lets them play online games really cares you need to go back to your bible
you can already report inappropriate character names through petition system they will be reviewed and if necessary the character in question will be renamed to characterracecitizen datecreated amarrcitizen 20060101 for example if you find some name offensive please file a petition and dont suggest solutions to problems that doesnt exist or already have solutions
oh btw i have an eve box sitting on my desk right in front of meit clearly says t for teen not e for everybodybut nice try
there are too many people getting away with inappropriate words for names there is a petition section for it i would gladly report them but this would just make things simplerfact is it aint funny it is not humorous its vulgar and it shoots the respects of this game that other players do have for it has nothing to do with me personally but about respecting the game i play
nice try yourself read again what ive said thus far
actually im pretty sure complaining about it here is much less effective than simply petitioning them
that is why it is herethere can easily be something to work into the system to kill the remain and continued use of inappropriate names i love playing eve not seeing someone making a joke of a characterwithin eve gaming mechanics
yes that system is called petitions
sadly im doing that already but that is kinda being lazy about it which btw is action not a system
you dont consider filing a petition to be actioned by a gm a system what dictionary are you using
not the same system that could be implied
but back to topic id would appreciate it if there was an improvement on inappropriate name usage conditions without an excessive use of petitionsi play eve i should not have to be flying along and see a player named inappropriately cause they thought it would be funny there is a line of things people should not do maturity is implied not adultery
yes one does come to that conclusion considering youve bothered making this thread unfortunately for you the current system works just fine id much rather have incarna factional warfare fixed incursions or any one of a dozen other things than a redundant additional system for dealing with names beyond petitions
its not that hard would take but mere hours for something to what im suggesting and those things are gonna happen regardless of what may or could be done now
even more rigorous than what we already have which im assuming is pretty standard in mmorpgs1 why2 i seriously doubt the quantity of namerelated petitions in eve can be described as excessiveno that is not the case you do not have the right to exist in society and expect us to all conform to your every whim and personal morality like little automatons if you want to play a multiplayer game you are simply going to accept that not everyone agrees with you end of storyit becomes even more ridiculous when a system already exists in answer to your complaint petitions and you for some obscure reason are not satisfiedwhich is why we have petitions what
you couldve just voted no a long time ago it never had anything to just me but it does include me there are many others that would think the same as both arguments continue true the name peitions may not be excessive but then why hasnt it been done
i didi dont see them here supporting your idea because if petitions arent excessive then coming up with another system would be a waste of time
nice so im ranting then dont think so it is not a waste of time since it is a part of this game
seeing as this game has a t rating certain things are to be expected such as inappropriate names among other thingsif you have a problem with it petition it or stop playing banning someone for making a name that is inappropriate is completely stupid
how so
so teen means be inappropriate i thought thats what 18 m was that would make it adultthis game would require age verification if that was the casethis game is teen and in many cases is language and vulgar words usage being observed and or restricted so it is stupid to allow it since literally its not nameing policies
its really sad to see such intolerance and ignorance being spouted over someone having the freedom to name their imaginary internet spaceship character how they want no this game is not rated t this game is unrated because it is online and online interactions are not rated by the esrb im not sure how you could be unaware of this fact since it is right next to the t and is the policy in every other online game ever you logic is astounding it is almost impossible to find a place to start you think va and crotch are equally offensive terms what planet are you on a game designed for children should have more restrictions and games for adults should have less restrictions that makes sense your logic is saying that either we shouldnt put more restrictions on games for children or we should babyproof every video game both are ridiculous i have also yet to see even the most devout critic label crotch as an offensive term this is the whole point of the op he is just petitioning any name that doesnt fit his personal criteria well guess what pal this is everyones game not just yoursthe end all be all is that if you have a problem with a name then petition it if you want a system based on your personal views of what is appropriate then you are delusional especially when your views of acceptability are so far off what a reasonable person would thinkthis is not something against offensive names those will be dealt with by people petitioning ccp this is about one guy trying to push his personal standards of what he thinks is a correct character name forced onto everyone else and you want people banned for making a joke in a video game cripes
honestly gallion i can see your point but if you really think a name is that offensive just petition it and be on your waythe only thing that really gets my back up is the  crap the pops up now and then in playercorp names and descriptions if they take a hard line on anything it should be thatedit n word is censored
vaal  few othersyour attacking me seriously did u not read the naming policies nice speech and all but your just saying that im wrong and clearly im not by saying that more should not be done about it and that since they are ignoring rules put up
not supported in my opinion eve should be rated m including non filtered names even if you  uh  happen to be sensitive enough to find them offensive to you you can always go and shoot him in the face over it in game ofc
lol i shouldnt have to be the one to petition it it should not exist
regardless youre asking a lot just look at how bad the word filter on the forums is this is the kind of thing that causes unnecessary problems for a number of people who do go with regular names
sure let see if ccp will agree to making eveonline now mature while were at it incarna we could have halfnaked characternpc in the medical room
no its not not hard at all
i find some name fastidious and showing a immature mentality but i dont think that a automated filter will resolve much in eve we speak languages from all the world i am almost sure that the word ioli beans in italian will be censored by the automatic filter as the first 3 letters are an offensive term in the usa qed filtering every possible offensive word and variations even in the principal languages would block a large number of innocuous terms so the most common forms should be censored automatically while the inventive ways to bypass the filter should be reported by the players that feel offended and speak the relevant language in the meantime we can treat players showing that kind of immaturity like people of their apparent mental age
so youre happy to sit down and sift through over 100000 character names to make sure nothings slipped through and messed up
where did i mention anything about automated filtering cause their aint no mention of such read up
its more like 4mill by now and ive already been doing that but being limited to 2 open petitions dosent help not to mention it trunicate the list to max25
ah so you are stupid enough to assume that ccp have the timemanpower to do that well that concludes my presence on this thread
if respect for the game i lovingly play is stupid then yes cause they wouldnt even break a sweat but note that i didnt say implicit such
uhm 910
i have taken this as a suggestion for a automated system seeing how having a gm screening all the names on 300k active accounts plus inactive accounts plus corporations plus alliances and keeping up to date with all the new names being added every day would have a heavy manpower cost
well motivated reply what is simply wrong the time needed to screen the eve universe manually is shortthere will be no new inappropriate namesor as you had already explained above that you dont want a automated systemi have simply explained why i had reached the wrong conclusion that you were suggesting something automated and why i feel that doing it manually will be problematic
so its hard to change a name or ban a personim sure the complex code to retreive a single ship due to error or faults is way more tasking then what ive already suggested which btw would be the very thing were still conversing about i can petition theyd still have to go about it that is not automated but if my understanding is correct be no harder then use the window search functions
since when was crotch offensive or inappropriatethe last i heard crotch was allowed before the watershed which makes it perfectly suitable for general use to people above the age of about 7just because you think it is inappropriate or offensive doesnt mean that it actually is if you think it is then ill have to turn to the i think the name gallion is offensive argument i think i might petition thatand before you say that my name is offensive or inappropriate its the name of a skin cream my sister uses
you obviously you didnt read everything crotch wasnt the target of the topic think about the fact that im still sayin it i know what it means and i know its not a viable word to censor but word of the sexually derogatory are the aim of this topic
gallion please qq this game is too advanced for you
yeaaah ok read naming policies bud fyi been playing lot longer then you
here ill make it apparentcharacter and corporation names may not be racially or ethnically or sexually derogatory contain profanity suggest an affiliation with a reallife hate group or figurehead they may not impersonate a member of the eve online team ssi staff cs staff or volunteer corp alternative spellings will be viewed with the same scrutiny as traditional spellings names used in the game are also reserved and may not be used in whole or part infraction of these rules may result in a mandatory name change or ban at our discretionnote that the list is not allinclusive and names that violate our rules can be changed by customer support staff even if they could be inserted in the character creation process that qq for ya
not to long ago there was a campaign to end the isk spamming that broke eula this topic is no different
i find your name offensive as it is a direct link to neopia which is a peadophiles playground which has links with scientologynuff said
this topic is entirely different isk spammers are ruining the game people with ridiculous names arent its your problem if you get easily offendedccp is merely protecting themselves against lawsuits current system does the job theres no reason to do more just to satisfy a bunch of prudespetition if you find something extreme then go back playing the game
so op wants us all to be mature and not offend the young kids playing the game with our names but then expects the same level of maturity from those young kidsme thinks op is completely out of touch with reality
im sort of on board with the op but for different reasonsi have seen some names that i think help explain why we do not have more women playing eve or at least not fcing where they would have to repeatedly say the names of targets im not saying all women im sure many dont mind but i would think many would not be up for it this i agree is a bad thing but anyway i personally never really understood the whole bad word concept so i am not overly sympathetic where i grew up people would sprinkle bad words into their language all the time i think the focus of any such activity shouldnt be protecting children from hearing a bad word but instead making sure the game isnt obnoxious to certain groups
i cant stand people like you just because you dont like something shouldnt mean that noone should be able to like it if you dont like their name which is not really offensive at all you can choose not to look at it just because you dislike the word crotch doesnt make it offensive to everyone nor should it be bannedi think you should be banned you are an amarr slaver your crimes are too great to allow you to exist
it is not me its the naming policy your attacking i can bring it up as many time as i like as it is a policy that must be read before playing the game creating your characteri dont care if you hate me thats your issues and this is eves by allowing inappropriate name to come ingame breaks the naming policies that is no different then isk spamming for mature game it wouldnt be an issue but there is a np and this game is teen teen is ages 13 thank you very much
sure but you are saying someone should be banned for the word crotch in their name the issue is that where you draw the line for inappropriate and what someone else might are different especially for a word like crotch my parents routinely used that word throughout my childhood and i have no inclination that it is offensive at all but someone like you believes it is hell i am sure your kid has heard the word crotch in school countless times even before they are 13 and i highly doubt any teacher or school administrator would discipline a child saying itobviously there are some words that the vast majority of people would find offensive however for the remainder of them i dont believe its you or ccps job to judge their appropriateness just ignore it and get on with life
no go to the begining of this topic you missed some and what biz do u have judging me for elborating the np naming policies
crotchracially derogatory noethnically derogatory nosexually derogatory nocontain profanity nosuggest an affiliation with a reallife hate group or figurehead noimpersonate a member of the eve online team nonames used in the game noseems ok to me
ok no go further back you still missing the point that this is not a discussion about the word crotch its about he vulgar inappropriate names
what spawned your topic was the word crotch in someones name which you disliked and petitioned so obviously the word crotch made you so mad you wanted to get revenge and ban someone
sure lets go with that you people are not very good at this anyway it would be my proposal to state that open petition limit should be raised and the currant inappropriate names that are in game now can be dealt with
incorrect spelling punctuation and capitalization annoy me i live with my disappointment in the human condition just as you should silently well usuallyperhaps including variations of hamburger in your name should be restricted since hindu consider the cow a sacred creature or are we only respecting western sensibilities just the other day i saw cheeseburgerdeluxe or something of that nature add himherit to the listfor some reason some people dont like being called stewardess preferring flight attendant lets categorically stamp out the use of malefemale based profession names since they may be considered derogatory oh man we can add so much to this listor we could be tolerant youre the one acting immature words mean what you build them up to mean someone told you crotch was naughty and like the godfearing simpleton that you are you apparently went with it not everyone feels the same including plenty of parentspetition it petition all of the names mommy told you were bad ccp will decide if she was right this doesnt need to be here
no your response to attack me is immature your ignoring the factsso ill elaborate here by denying anything ive said during the begining of this topic the players whom have attacked me with glorified words are interested in destroying the rules that ccp placed and that players whom have gotten away with this should not get punished that is what im seeing in every reply that has been aimed at me
its up to them to enforce their rules they have a system in place to allow you to participate in that enforcement by reporting violations you are free to do so they are just as free to decide if the instance has broken their rules and merits enforcement of them a thread in the assembly hall will do nothing to correct the problem that you believe existson the other hand im really digging the random capitalization over here
your no better then trolls by saying anything out of the topic which is somehting should be done about inappropriate names ingamewhich is described in their npi play eve and i do not attempt to break from the guidelines made and agreedupon when you first start your client  game  character which ill point my finger at more then 90 of you forum readers
the fact remains that you are using an example crotch which does not meet the requirements to have a name containing it removed therefore we can conclude that many of the other names that you personally find offensive and claim violate the rules actually dont all you will be doing is wasting the gms timethe players havent gotten away with anything because nothing wrong has been done they wont be punished because there is no point to punish them
troll read the policies then come and say that again
gallion have you noticed that you are the only person here upset by this seriously i dont care and i doubt anyone else does either if you find inappropriate names this upsetting that you need to rant in a nebulous thread in assembly hall about it what the heck are you doing playing an mmorpg
and your not doing the same
well lets see i havent actually been ranting about an issue nobody cares about but rather chuckling at you so id say not
sorry wasnt clear with last post your trolling too the fact that i did start this topic mean that ther are those who do care there even a few positive replies to my point but while u chuckle at me this was not the topic
so i suppose that it should be okay to run around with any name we want using your logic and if we dont like it well sucks to be usor we could be adults and realize that there needs to be some standards of decency in the gamei think the renaming solution that we have right now is perfectly acceptable though no need to add a ban on top of it
i do lowsec exploration and the mag sites there are so incredibly worthless that these days being older and wiser i dont bother with them because theyre a waste of time why should i spend 1015 minutes of my life just to get 100k in crap salvage
i do most of my exploring in hisec starting to do some roams through losec working on some ship skills so i can run an all in one exploration vessel swapping around is a pain in low p  and i support thisi have been tracking the loot values from radar and mag sites since i started exploring and found that in hisec on average radar sites are worth 15million varies from 0 damn empty cans to about 50m mag sites are worth less than half a million absolute best i got was about 12mill for a condensed alloy ibeam thingy usually less than 100k in valueobviously i dont think they need to be buffed up to null levels of reward but it would be nice if they were consistent with the average for radar i do them anyway just to despawn them but they definately arent returning value at this point in timeedit drone plexes are pretty ordinary as well 
or leave learning but remove all the attribute skills and replace them with a study skill that adds 2 to each attribute per levelsupporting the overall idea none the less
supported learning skills have been a barrier to entry for a lot of people i tried to get into the game
hell yeah this is one of the first learning skill proposals that actually makes sense
yes
i likes side suggestion why not jus have some new 2attribute skills booksie book that would give 2 more to willpower and intelligence per level i know their is only 5 attributes but swing with me here
supportedremodelling learning to a 20 learning speed per level skill is most appropriate and as mathemathically proven here boosts training time moar
i think any solution is going to seem extreme to those of us with 6m sp in learning but to address your concern and the better idea put forwardkeep learning as is but add two skills basic self improvement 1 to all attribs 1x and advanced self improvement 1 to all attribs 2x and reqs bsi lvl 4 and learning lvl 4
i support the original position and the position that makes it work for implants i dont support making the new not learnings learnings take as long or close to as long as the old ones nothing would be solved that way the problem is that people need to have those skills if they want to play for any lenght of time and fly most anything inb4 go tackle n00breplacing a number of you must train this skills with a single you must train this skill that takes a substantial amount of time wont do anything in practical terms the problem is the huge roadblock these constitute to playing the game particularly for new peoplethere is something certainly flawed in the notion that they are optional and deepen the game when every piece of advice is get them in the skills forum and every corp recruitment officer wants them and you cant train without them eitherthe whole system needs to go and this proposal is getting worse rather than better
 agree minimize learning skills absolutely as much as possible id do away with them entirely if i was given the choice
you have a point which is the whole point of my proposition nobody is going to be completely happy with the result but i think the op solves most of the issues and the implant problem should have no bearing on this implants need their own review
who to we get answers from when your petitions are not addressed i was recently banned and i asked for clarification thru two different toon neither one has been answered positive help on this issue would be greatly apprecioated
first talk to the guy that sells  and  characters i hear hes giving away capital letters at the start of each sentence for free limited time only hes not in the assembly hall assembly hall is a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar managementas for your question i havent been able to fully understand your situation your account got banned youve opened two petitions from two different accounts and ccp havent responded or the response wasnt positive for you if they were not answered at all youve probably put them in the wrong section andor havent put enough info or you just have to wait if ccp responded to your petitions and said that the decision to ban one of your accounts is correct ask for petition escalation and review from a senior gm by using the same petition not opening a new one or try contacting customer support directly through email can be found on this page

read some of csm meeting minutes and it seamed like their was a lack of direction for what should be done in stationswhat is lacking in eve is an open area to build i would really like to see us able to build our own areas and do what ever we can with space give us legos and let us build a wonderful corporation bar with them using basic building blocksnot really legos would let people great so amazing and weird thingscarbon seems to have a physics engine at least on some level so even making something like a water fall that falls into a little pond as part of your quarters in that station would be neator taking it further letting people build crazy contraptions and structures such as mind craft and have the space for rent maybe the corp would rent a large area and people would work together to create a lounge with stripper poles and a fully stocked bar could also higher npcs if we wished i am sure once the tools are their even more creations will be possiblewould sure beat spinning your ship
okay but to what endi mean dont get me wrong a nice social hangout is a great idea i cant be the only one who wants to head over to jita 44 and hang around the bars watching people come and go but theres got to be some kind of context for that why would people come to the bars in the first place socialization there are already channels for thatthe problem with incarna is that its a load of very cool tech thats looking for a reason to exist in the world of spaceships its hard to find significance in the individual captain because well the captain is just so damned small its hard to think of anything that you could put in incarna that you couldnt just put somewhere elsei think its a chicken and egg scenario in most worlds youd get the idea of a pilot getting in his spaceship in eve its the idea of the pilot leaving his spaceship the unspoken assumption is that theres no real reason for a pilot to leave his ship in the first place we spend all our time in there now why would we ever need to leavedont take my lack of support personally its not so much that i dont agree with your ideas in principle i do but weve got far bigger problems at the moment
no start spinning your ship
add compromised security to the data base knowledge so when we do a search we can get an answer that is better then having to wait 5 days to clear a petition i almost susened my accounts because i was banned and i wasnt getting clarification until today

1 please add the crowd source number to the explanation pagereason i just went through and selected about 50 stories that i wanted to research in order to vote on i will now have to go back and do between 7 and 20 searches for the csm number2 please add some kind of planning poker  tshirt sizing estimate to the stories ive voted for a lot of very small stories and some stories that i didnt know the size of the value of this is that voters could be requested to only vote for a certain amount of story points 3 please add a thread to the specific crowdsourcing vote thread so that some level of trouble shooting can be done by the community for example at this writing bothreview destroyers csm destroyer improvements csm are virtual duplicates
for 3 the duplicates can be identified by the community at the time the crowdsourcing is being done at the end of the crowdsourcing process simply combine the nominations for those items the community deemed to be duplicatesfor 2 its really up to ccp to estimate how long a proposal will take to implement the idea of crowdsourcing is to determine the priorities of items not the implementation plan thus we can build a list of the things the community wants most and ccp  csm can work out the implementation schedule after the top 5 have been selected much better for csm to be spending time investigating only 5 priority items rather than 200i agree with 1  each csm item should have a reference to the crowdsourcing efforts that it has been raised in along with a comprehensive as possible a list of threads dealing with that issue some issues have been done to death boost destroyersafk cloakingdefending industrials it would be nice to have an easy reference for people to research existing proposals before they launch a new one
ill admit that it does provide the number of jumps but unless i missed something it doesnt seem to have the number of lightyears
this same division could also be applied to the bazzar threads as well seeing how disorganized they are is hurting my brain

lets spell out how lacking the current system isissue x yes votes 500 no votes499 issue y yes votes 1 no votes0issue a yes votes 500 no votes 2000issue b yes votes 1 no votes 2000issue c yes votes 500 no votes 0the current system treats issues x a and c as if the players felt exactly the same about them the current system also treats y and b as if the players felt the same about them im sorry but i can not see how any rational person would think this system offers valuable information about what the players really want i guess the only thing it offers is that if an issue gets very few votes we can conclude no one cares about it but beyond that this vote worthlessi highly doubt most players feel equally strong about 7 items on the list they probably feel strongly about 04 of them and the others they are just voting for because they figure why waste a vote the assumption that everyone must feel just as strongly about at least 7 issues is a bizarre assumption to make sorry the whole thing is a bust
as the saying goes the perfect is the enemy of the good prioritization crowdsourcing is something new weve only done it a few times and i will strongly consider some of the concerns raised in this thread when i design the next iteration

herpity derp
this topic has no clarity wilse the idea for t4now is that tech or tier 4 is beyond this point of eve story the sleepers arent far off from what your looking for in bio
perhaps a system similar to the genetic complexity system in spore the creature creator was the only good part of that game it was free too
i still play that game darkspore is coming out soon
my first thought was lexx actually  but space tamagachi does fit in the current trend of products intended to bring in new folks and at least deals with spaceships
sansha incursions are basically groups of players banding together to go on a quest to kill npcs instead of other players theres even progression from easier to harder sansha sites sound familiari propose that ccp scrap incursion and instead devote an entire expansion to bug fixes as well as fixing a few broken components like failguns and t2 large scanning rigs dropping from exploration sites
im not going to lie im skeptical about incursions i mean really skeptical im about 90 sure theyll crash and burn and the forums will erupt into a state of chaos and hellfire causing ccp to backpedal faster than an olympic cyclist caught face to face with a freight trainbut its basically too late at this point theyve already poured a ton of developer resources into it so itd be foolish to ask them to scrap all that work nowapparently one of the main reasons no hybrid fixes have been implemented is because nobody can really decide what they need that wont either be overpowered or else cross over into the territory of a different turret type why not work on a proposal for how to fix thembut in the mean time we might as well just see how incursions go
i thought that was the point of this entire invasion p
i predict ill log off for a week when they inevitably find their way to my constellation and yes from what ive seen on sisi this is an expansion best not released when i first heard about it i thought it would be cool and exciting it could add so much to the game but as always the demon is in the details as with virtually all pve content ccp chose to make it boring and grindy rather than interesting and challenging they gave the npcs cheats rather than intelligence and thats a sure fire way to make it irritating for players instead of fun
no its part of their conditions an expansion is gonna happen incursions is a great step and from what im hearing from testing its gonna be dangerous for most miners
by griefer decs they mean decs that fall outside of corporate strategy or role playing eg decs for tear extraction and free pvp on noobs by veteran corps in search of their jollies at the expense of new playerstypically these are the groups that that use the its a sandbox claim as an excuse to kick sand in your face while they high five each other for killing players with 150th their skill and experience
not supported because it is just hitting the playerbase with a big stick to force them to do what you wantbuffing lowsec  nerfing highsec
so are you saying that some some corps should be immune to wardecs perhapsperhaps a corp for noobs and starting playersi can envision these corps being full of new players in fact as soon as one creates a player they could be automatically placed in such a corp to facilitate the processfor those older characters who wish a little bit of solace from the harshness of eves unforgiving nature they can also elect to leave their current corp by themselves or with their friends and join one of these new player corps as well so there is a balance to fit with the role play of eve ccp could come up with some cool rp backstory and descriptions of these new player corps to give them a bit of fluff think about it everybody wins
i am confirming this idea sounds good and i will support this suggestion over the op
since it sounds like one of the strongest objections is that the first alliance to build cap ships would just own the place what if the idea was modified to disallow building cap ships in these isolated regions of kspace i realize that would be more development effort the idea without that is just a map change but probably nothing too difficult the game has the concept of limiting pos arrays depending on system security level already so adding a new attribute of a system that also disallows cap assembly arrays seems possible
hi i have bug reported this issue  aparently it has been fixed in an internal ccp build it will probably hit sisi and tq at some point in the next few mounths the reason no one has responded to this is because its not a particulay major problem or a long outstanding issue and the problem is clearly a defect as such bug reporting is the first point of call only should that fail to fix the issue in several itterations should it realy be a matter for the cmss attention if you spot any other item descriptions that are wrong or game mechanincs which are definatly not working as intended  especialy if you can reproduce them i highly recommend visiting this link
in every major patch or expansion they fix a lot of typos grammar errors description errors etc that were reported on bug reporting page well just have to wait no need to bring this up in assembly hall really
i say vote no to this
supportedi would even be happy with an individual corp being able to join fw whilst still being part of an alliance though that will open up some neutral alt issues though its not like we dont have them now  hi jasper
this along with some of the trade skillsnew easier to understand text please
yes my obelisks name is robert paulson
in death he has a name
the current start to new character i believes hampers new players sure you can test everything out cuz they send you to trainers of all sorts yes you technically get to 16m sp in about the same time but here are teh downers1 you get a very sudden slow down of skill points its kind of in reverse of what should happen you should get your feet wet first then get stuff running fast2 character have a harder time getting into certain aspects of the game its harder to do missions you have larger waste in manufacturing to start you mine less ect3 players have a harder time feeling like they are a combat pilot or an industrialist or miner or whatever and such may have a lower chance of staying in gamewhat do i suggest to fix it you should be launched into space with 50k sp you start with now with an option to pick a proffession or do tutorials first if you pick tutorials it lets you go straight into the game as it does now at any point you want you can open up your character sheet and pick a proffession and it would be like the old school list you got to pick out it would put skills up to the point to what you picked for your proffesion so even if i were to pick say a combat proffesion and its gunna give me small laser 3 it would simply put it to 5 why is this nessesary it will help keep newbies in the game and build a larger playerbase
i wish they gave you the choice of whether you wanted the low sp start and accelerated training or the specialized start with no accelerated training i miss the specialized start for creating alts free level 5s were awesome
the reason they dont do that is because it be easy to make a dessie group suicide gank quitbiomass repeat dozens of times
this thread should never die and never forget i encourage people to search for eve jobse on google and star the appropriate search results
blobs are fine just make them harder to assamble and manageif you can cross entire galaxy with entire fleet in no time no wonder you have what you have
all it takes to reign in blob warfare to reasonable levels is to increase the relative size of the universe compared to the concentration and volume of player playing on a given day if ccp can find a way to vary the size of the universe andor travel times in proportion to population density on a dailyhourly basis then there comes a point were the amount of timelogistics it takes to form a blob fleet is simply not worth itall in all the eve universe feels too small increase the quality of content in each system as well as the size of each system reduce warp speed and voila  people feel more inclined to stay within a constellation rather than roaming 30 jumps across multiple regionsdilute the population density for eves sake
im not clear on why you cant just continue doing this
woah so much rage hereyes plex for more sphr is bad but thats not what ccp are doingwere going to dohow many plex would someone need to buy before they have a ridiculous advantage too many danyway a nice outcome of this could be you can use a plex for a remap every 6 monthsbut really i couldnt care about the outcome of this because as i see it there wont be huge implications by any decision discussed herewhat would get my attention would be someone proving that a player could train up twice as fast without spending 1200 on plex d
 you have got to be kidding methere are 8 csm threads on your internal forums you say mmmmmmm well that ends my involvement in trying to get you guys to do anything
8 pages of threads every page has 29 threads so you do the mathi guess reading isnt always easy
dv
why pretty much nothing but a reflection of the percentage of playersaccounts that actually still can be bothered to vote for csm what did you expect 20 pages threadnaught cmon we all know how ccp likes to ignore those repeatedly better to have some quality instead of quantity
actually i would prefer if most of the csm discussion was here on eveo in the jita park assembly hall and features and ideas forums i would prefer it if the csm actually discussed ideas with the players rather than with themselves i see more than a few assembly hall topics were voted on by csm even though the csm member never mentioned what or why they would vote a certain way in assembly hall if youre not interested enough in a topic to throw your ideas out in assembly hall so you can consider what the players think of them then maybe you should sit that vote out i understand ccp used to interact with players on the forums now i suppose ccp thinks they can leave it to the csm to do this if the csm no longer does this then the csm is simply distancing the players even further from ccpi think this csm is doing a great job but this is one thing i think they can do better the round table was nice but that format doesnt really allow the sort of follow up that a forum posting does share more of your ideas and thoughts with the players on these forums that are specifically set up for that purpose
plus pretty much answers the question if it were indeed in ccps best interest to seriously look into this it wont have resulted in just some loltempbans but permabans rather didnt happen which makes the conclusion rather obvious that its yet another time ccp paying merely some sort of lip service no i didnt write giving head to pl  but not really bothering to get seriously involved so basically some token action to quell possible customer unrest but in the end the wellknown we dont care attitude go figure
except they apparently do and so do i and i know it isnt nearly as bad as you make it seem admittedly it could be polished a bit but it is just fine as is and rollback god no
ya like playing only on days that have eve run in prenanonerf state or even prenosnerf one ofc your sp would have to be rolled back as well then right
got the ship and skills now widow its expensive and useless i regret investing into thisi gonna reprocess it if it wont get unnerfed at least the jump range needs a buff
easy solution just allow concord to crack eggsbreak the law and well will blow up your ship and your pod add some tacklers for concord gate camps and watch people cry
yes no one want to hear us ccp themselves says htfu but look how my thread died and how this one doing well
i dont support this proposal
ahaha all the suicideganker tears in this thread are fantastici havent been suicideganked or are at any risk to be its not like i undock with estamels modified plex and im not a suicidegankera removal of the insurance payoff will be logical and force suicide gankers to only pewpew at the uberpros who can afford to lose things not some poor and new player in a badger who happened to have sightly valuable loot
i look forward to the whine threads when people who dont fully understand agro mechanics get themselves concorded accidently in the 5s clone
sorry but anna is right and you are wrong as your entire counter argument about putting onself in a dangerous place relies on the incorrect assumption that hisec is supposed to be safe and as ccp have stated over and over that is just not the case and as for this remarksuicide ganking completely takes any control or prevention away from the victim utter cobblers this guy has made a career out of it
i support this
front page news hybrids still suck
70kk  it is not a price for the best ship in class also a daredevil cost is about 300kk in good fit but daredevil is not so powerfull
no these changes are unnecessary
i say it fine as is peeps needs to learn how to fit a ship better when dealing with frig hulls
i agree with the principle in general i dont think that a probe is necessary though  a player should be able to find asteroid belts with the onship scanner maybe not all asteroid belts but the common ones with lots of veldspar and scordite this way very new players can get started right away
i dont like the idea of removing belts because belts are a natural thing and not having them would seem weird they are also a pvp spot in low sec and dropping them would mean more gate and station games however maybe bring in planet rings cometsalso a better spead of the ore though the sec systems living in caldari space i get the four common ores in belts and nothing more being a newer player i have not yet gotten around to the probe skills required to find the rare ores in empire space however travel to gal space and you find omber all over the belts their kernite is sitting in amarr space belts and having not been to a belt in minie space i cant say anything but given its near both amarr and gal space i wouldnt be shocked if it had both the omber and kernite it seems given the prices of those that if i wanna make some real money from mining i have to be willing to leave caldari space either that or be willing to continually take mining trips 1820 jumps into other empire spaces now seeing as an orca and hulk are not super fast at this whole flying deal im not in favor of thatso could be an idea to either limit the ores in empire or randomise the second teir ores more maybe the belts people use everyday change one day lots of commons the next day a few second teir are their or at lease even the playing field and give the caldari a second tier ore not everyone can spend the time probing out a site or wh and move an orca and pos into it for a week sure making mining more fun sounds like a good idea buts its mining theirs only so much you can do
i know eve is considered a universe and not a game but having to find a game to play or video to watch to pass the time while youre mining is kind of ridiculous i in no way support any measure that would increase mining yield but making positioning important to yield is a good idea less yield as you get further away heres my idea in the way that pi gave us a minigame of setting up extractor networks and the like a mining ship could go into an asteroid view like looking through a mining laser turret at a target asteroid the scanner could show deposits and the varying amounts of ore on the asteroid in the same manner as the planets appear in pi colour  density etc then you use the laser to shoot the good deposits blasting them until the ore is depleted and then you target a new area each laser could be set on a seperate deposit and you manage them and move them around as needed when the roid is depleted you select a new one perhaps move closer and repeat this makes it into something entertaining shoot those deposits shoot them for profit and may possibly cut down macromining
i like the idea of updating the mining process but i think we all need to keep in mind which i think we all do that changing mining in even the smallest way will have larger impacts in the rest of eve really the biggest change i would like to see is that the mining cycle be stopped the moment all the ore in an asteroid has been removed that will save loads of time
supporteddevscaldari and gallente need some lovecsm take a look at this problem and prioritize this onto your list of things to look at
supportedhowever if i could suggest something rather than having a separate bay why not just have the ability to right click a drone and select repair depending on the size of the drone the repair costs more and this can be done per drone or per drone group drones being repaired cant be launched until the repairs are complete which for fighters or fighter bombers can take several minutes
space barbie will be here soon enough but those whove been following along have most likely noted a distinct lack of meaty content no buenothe core mechanics and content of eve shouldnt stop as soon as you get out of your podso suggestions 1 pew pew pew pew use the eventual world of darkness combat engine modified however is necessary or create a first person shooter style interface doesnt matter if youre not in your pod sitting in your ship in your hangar someone can put a bullet in your brain which brings me to2 scooping out your grey matter like pumpkin innards create a skill say rank 6 that has a 10 bonus per level starting at 0 with the skill untrained to salvage neural implants that a victim may have this should not be competitive with lp store offers however so after beta playtesting and balancing ie once it goes live in an expansion and enough people complain figure out a dynamic balance so that any implants that are dropped in this fashion have a certain amount of damage that can only be fixed by the use of certain consumable materials ideally tie those consumable materials into salvaged components from the neural interface that any undocked pod pilot will have to wear so that if theyre fragged their consciousness downloads to a new clone also allow implants to be built from scratch with bpos 3 decks have their own security status in stations semiindependent of the systems stations are in10  05 decks are like nyc under giuliani a cop on every corner and a plunger up every ass 04  01 decks are like beruit sure theres a government presence of sorts but if its cloudy with a chance of rpgs suddenly there are more important things to engage in like continuing breathing00 decks are a wretched hive of scum and villainy anything goes here want illegal weapons buy them here buyingselling the salvaged materials from some guys skull you just perforated with high velocity ammo thatd be here tooplayer owned stations in 00 not ing pos actual stations damnit can be set up however their owners prefer 4guns lots of gunsslug throwers laser rifles flechette pistols microwavedeath rays yes personal shields ablative armor flak jackets reactive plating powered armor yesillegal gear thats so awful and awesome that its banned by all civilized nations and has to be snuck around yes accepting an assassination contract cloaking up with thermoptic camouflage and performing an emergency trepanation via 50 cal incendiary round at 500 yards yes yes yes yes yes all gear is player made and sold 5this time its personalwar decs carry over instation kill rights are not only transferable but outlaws who wander around a station can be exterminated with a bounty to be paid by concord6 hey man did you ever look at your hand i mean really look boost drug smuggling as a profession in the seedier security zones in a station players can purchase upgraded cargo containers which give back false scan results to customs ships showing up as clean containers have a limited number of uses7 its sweet that you think you have a choicelaw enforcement is punitive not prohibitive cops in station highsec  bots in station lowsec will respond to crimes but in both cases if youre good or lucky you should have time to paint the walls with your targets brain first8 moar dakkamore reasons to depod and look around no not ing minigames arena to the death combat for isk poker tournaments etc9 an offer you cant refusecrime syndicateslaw enforcements groups in stations who you can run missions for faction warfare including pirate factions ranging from sabotage to smuggling to planting high explosives in the local police barracks or blow out the windows on the observation lounge and let the ers suck vacuum
my definitive sci fi experience doesnt make me or others safe when im outside of my ship
its sad that space barbie is such an apt description of incarna i would also have accepted dancing in gay bars as wellyouve the the nail right on the head here mate eve is a harsh universe except when youre walking in stations apparently then its project runway  eve edition its taken ccp years to get incarna to this point however and like all the other things eve needs to survive and grow itll take years more for you to shoot another player with a plasma cannon on a station which is about the only thing thatd coax me out of my ship tbh
would love to wander up behind a war target whilst there playing pokerhaving a drinkwhatever and shooting there brains out so there head smacks on the table old fashioned western style
i agree with you that there needs to be ingame combat but i disagree on some of the smaller pointsi cant agree with you on highsec security in highsec stations not lowsec stations police should be preventative and doing a very good job of it too if theyre not then those who can afford to and have the standings to buy jump clones can essentially have free reign in highsec the only reason thats not an issue in space is because ships that can instagank arent usually cheap and i assume that a pistol is not anywhere near as expensive as the cheapest of frigatesperhaps instead of making all of highsec instation security forces either easy to circumvent or impossibly hard to outdo a system of reaction times can be implementedin 10 space theres an instantaneous reaction instantly killing the offender in 09 that reaction is a few seconds slower in 08 even slower all the way down to 05 in which it can take as long as 15 seconds for there to be any responsei think its perfectly understandable that ccp wants to hold out on tossing combat into the mix however with your method people are hardly going to want to get out of the pod in lowsec or nullsec because anything could happenalso another reason ccp might want to hold out of combat in stations is because that would require an entirely new interface out standard dropbox method of movement isnt viable in a combat situationi think that for ingame handtohand combat youll be better off waiting for dust514 as ccp has already begun development there
fair enough however id still like to try to convince you as you realize im sure concord isnt really preventative even in 10 systems i also think you misunderstand my proposal a simple pistol wouldnt be enough to kill anybody in station highsec before the police responded at least who was wearing something like personal armor andor a shield think of walking around a station without armorshielding like flying an untanked frigate and remember outlaws will not only be kos but players will collect bounties for shooting them which isnt to say that suicide ganking wont go on in stations as i envision it but it wouldnt be as simple as getting a pistol and blasting caps randomly yep that was my idea but i ran into the character limit for the post 10 in space isnt exactly instantaneous concord response either but damn near close think of 10 station security as analogous itd have to be playtested and balanced of course and maybe in 10 simply unholstering a weapon would be considered a criminal violation and you might not have time to squeeze off a shot remember station highsec is still giuliani town nah every station will have highsec decks lowsec decks and null sec decks again ran into the character limit think times square  highsec alphabet city  lowsec the projects  nullsec think of it this way highsec space stations will have lots of decks where respectable people do respectable people things but theyll also have a few out of the way decks where the cops maybe dont look too close or theyre paid off to not care too much about and then there are always places in a floating cityinspace where wicked stuff goes down and the cops dont go there at all because theyre written off the inhabitants anyways lowsec space would be similar there would be a few decks of high sec station because after all respectable people need to do respectable people things but thered be a lot more lowsec station decks and a lot more areas where the police simply dont go were probably already going to need a new interface for space barbie anyways and they can and should port over whatever theyre developing for combat in wod if at all possible dust will be console only iirc space barbie however will be in our games no matter what we might as well make it awesome oh and supporting my own topic
despite my lack of optimism that this will ever happen i would dearly like it toincarna should become eve 2  a full fledged game in its own right with all the breadth of gameplay possibilities weve come to expect from eve prime
this
better to blend it into a pc version of dust 514 just in stationsno i dont like this plan because its not what space barbies were designed for this might be a fun option for low sec or special combatready stations  like faction warfare control points
to be honest i think that the best way we can insure that something like this happens and that ccp doesnt leave space barbie to rot on the vine is to show our support also convince the csm to capture a few devs and hold them hostage over the icelandic volcano but that showing our support part is probably optional i dont care really if its dust or wod but ccp has got to produce real content using some engine or another and incarna is already based on the wod engine and strictly speaking this is what space barbie was designed for its a byproduct of ccps work on the world of darkness game besides even if it was simply engineered to show off nice shinies it should be properly iterated so thats not all it is as for a combat option only for some i think thats contrary to the nature of eve theres no such thing as safe space only safer space and anything you have as an asset is potential loot for someone else players should no more be safe from danger walking around jita 44 than they would be undocking from 44 otherwise they might as well just give every eve player a subscription to second life and put in some spaceship themed backgrounds or something
wardecs in station no thanx this would mean the only safe place in eve is when your logged outwis should be optional so there should be no need to walk aroundi like the diffrent security of decks but something like 8 should be impossible to fight on 5 has guards that will kill anyone who attempts to suicide pwn even war dec4 and below there are guards but they will only attack whats in los so sneaking around is what happens00 no or very little guard i think here will be security cameras that dispatch guards so you have to run and hide before they see your drug deali think in the lower security area should be a shady fellow to pay to raise your faction standing this would mean no more grinding standing to be aloud in other faction space
undocked  unsafe depodded  unsafe ship spinning  safe wardec  murder your opponents in front of the local police station at high noon then go take a nap as for places outside your hangar where its impossible to fight i think that really is strongly opposed to what makes eve eve and sure itd have to be playtested security camerasbots sneaking what have you all fine maybe in 10 walking around with a weapon that isnt hidden gets you shot and in 09 an unholstered weapon gets you shot and in 08 aiming at someone gets you shot etc i really dont know im just sketching in broad outlines because id like to make sure that ccp develops some sort of content beyond space barbie
so if there were an internet church in the station you would disregard sanctuary for the epeen factoreveryone requires some place to conduct business or interactions that is safe not safer besides logging out of the game this type of protection from direct interactions is not logical eve ccp has always guarded the station as sanctuary from unwanted combat sure you can still lose everything in trade or scams while docked but never combat  periodtrying to apply your view of wis mechanics to what is accepted undocked will not work because it changes one of the basic combat mechanics of the game  station  no combatas you said undocked  unsafe therefore docked  safe not saferi would like to see combat mechanics in station but not all stations faction warfare would be a good start
no this is eve internet churches do not have to be respected unless you want to roleplay it that way id see no reason why an internet church in a station should be any more sacrosanct than an internet church out of a station to say nothing of the fact that the most likely church in eve would be the church of enslaving those dirty minmatar im not understanding where the disconnect is coming from again stay docked up play the market just like everybody does today as for any other place where you can conduct interactions that is safe and not safer eve doesnt currently have that other than chat channels which you can use while docked up so your claim that everybody requires that is nonsensical as it doesnt exist in eve currently outside of your hangar anyways this makes no sense at all ccp could not guarantee that the station was a sanctuary because youve never been able to step out of your pod into the station and as ive stated and youve quoted staying docked up will leave you 100 safe again this is nonsense as youve never been able to step into a station before your claim is like saying that up until now driving cars around on planets in eve has been totally safe yah station  no combat because stations do not exist outside of your hangar and as stated you will still be 100 safe in your hangar just like it ever was
so what do you want to do inside stations that you cant already do in your ship whilst dockif it isnt chasing wartargets down it is going to be some boring expansion what are you personally wanting to do get a haircut buy some new clothes if so the sims is thatawayincarna must bring some gameplay that you cant do whilst in a ship docked and to tell the truth the only gameplay that i can envisage is stuff like killing wartargets or sabotaging their ships some how maybe new skills implemented for the latter if this was implemented then incarna would be fabulous in my eyes but if it was just poker roomshaircuts etc then it is a waste as you can do that already from your ship well maybe not the haircuts but then again maybe opening a hairdressing salon could become a new form of griefing so supported
well open war or shooting in station in higher security areas wouldnt make sense its what im saying ok fight in lowsec station decks but not highsec even war first off wis shouldwould have civilians and other things like you know windows that may or may not be hit by stray firewhen you get down to the lower portions where the poor and homeless reside people stop caring oh yea deck 74 just depressurized looks like we gotta clean that up after lunch who caresanyways just sayingno fighting in 8 plus even warother then that same rules as space is nowyes space barbie is pretty lame but there are other ways to make it fun it could be pve or pvp related it be nice to kill outlaw pilots who dock in lowsec though
so what you are saying is that you want absolutely no new content whilst you walk around stations everything that you can do is possible from sitting in your ship alreadymy suggestion of ship sabotage would be cool have some sort of skill so that war target when he undocks to play station games finds that he cant stop his ship and re approach station now that would be worth it for incarna

the current plan is to combine some items like 166167 into a single item for voting purposes with respect to updating the proposals if there are items in them that have already been implemented let a csm know what they are and we can update the proposal to reflect thissuperseding the current proposals with a new one will require the regular process ah thread raised by a csm vote at a meeting

any news on the issue from our beloved csm
supported
since i generally love the destroyer
this idea crops up every month or two and every time its just as bad i dont see this as adding anything positive to the game at all whatsoever  just an annoyancegeneral ship maintenance is already performed by the ships crew yes ships do have crews backstorywise anyway why should we suddenly have to pay extra isk did they go on strike or somethinghow nothing is being produced or being sold its just players ing away isk
the problemat the moment you only receive the mail when you open up the insurance tab in a station and not when the ships insurance actually runs outthis means that if you insure one ship and do not attempt to insure any ships after that you will never receive a notification that your insurance has run out the solutionit would be logical to change it so that you receive the mail when your insurance actually expires instead of when you open up the insurance tabif you havent insured any of your ships for a while try opening your insurance tab  see how many expired insurance notifications you get please support
fo shotie this into the eve calendar too so we can see when our ships are losing insurance 
yes definitely a niggle that ive noticed on and off for too long
my pvp dessy lost its insurance a month agosigned
this would be nice1
ccp should add big rewards bounties for navymembers that manage to save pilots on stations or planetsbelts attacked they could instantjump to location with help of concord concord could monitore that nobody tries to use situation  pass it on to ccpthis could make game much more interesting for those on navyfleets not to mention reactions of those saved by the bell like somebody in orca
point here is that would it really be realistic that any empire would let sansha roam free on their highsec space withouth any responsethey do it against other empires navys so why not against sansha that was afterall attacked by all empires together in storyline
not sure if this came into right section even but just wish ccp would get informed about this ideajust wish that sansha could not do anything they want in highsecconcord should still be just monitoring playerplayer actions but navy perhaps through modifying it into separate sanshafleets would be logigal opponent against themi bet it would bring much fun for most navyplayers and increase amount of players willing to join the navyon the otherhand it could reduce frustation of many players who loose their ships and even could quit whole game because of it
 you want to make players concord and make sure anyone who gets concordd dies even moreim sorry this makes absolutely no sense to me
no i wanna make navy as navy and game more fun for those in navywhat is navy there but to protect us from hostile empires and things like sanshacheck storyline all empires navyUFFFDs fought together against sansha and now they do nothingi dont wanna make anybody concorded except those who try to get benefit from sanshaattack killing easy damaged ships lootingbut nobody should be concorded from attacking sanshafleet especially if defending those attacked by sanshau got something wrong read again
it might help if you typed better than a 3rd grader as far as english is concernedand if english isnt your native languageshould have thought of that before you proposed this idealike it or not hes having trouble understanding you thats a facthell so am i o pnot supporting it because its obvious your not really sure either
ainUFFFDt this idea more important than if i spell it correctlyyes i am finn but i also understand that you can read and understand better than on 3rd grade level rightcome on this canUFFFDt be so complicateditUFFFDs just about how navy could bring balance on this coming sanshaincursion otherwise its gonna be booring and even frustrating when you get into belts to mine or to planets collect stuff and get your orca blown up regularlyconcord canUFFFDt and will not protect from sansha so who would navyits obvious u are not sure neitheryes i am sure this is only way to keep highsec still interesting and profitable for newbies and navy fex where did you came up with that assumption
lets remind us again this game is not about sanshadominionif it is i resign this industrialaccount and focus on 00 sec pvpaccounttoo bad that industrial account brings much isk for me to buy pvpships on other account and much needed stuff from planets to my corpif ccp wonUFFFDt come up some idea like navy helping in this sanshaissue many pilots will quitcanUFFFDt be so hard to understand eventhough my english would not be perfect
and this is not about too much changes or complications on how to jump navyfleet into sanshaattacked areajust as concord comes in seconds in highsec they could request assistance from navy sanshafleet for somebody in problems and fleet commander could make decision to jump with concord in seconds
your idea is worthless if no one can understand what ever the hell your sayingthis isnt playskool this is assembly halltake the time to spell and be clearly understandable and you might have a shototherwise your just looking like a foolfor crying out loud you obviously dont give a crap because anyone who types u as opposed to you is obviously telling of ones mentalitywhat are you doing texting this dont you think youd take a little more time and effort into your idea as opposed to just slapping it on like a paint bucket being dumped on the keyboardare you a monkey hammering keysbecause that is the impression your giving right nowand for the record i still dont get what your talking aboutim not asking for perfection i have dyslexia and im not the best speller eitherbut at least i take the time to be clearly understoodps supporting your own idea with an alt is just as increasingly stupid and obvious
omgso that is what it is aboutnot to make game better but to write you instead of uin game we both use shorter u i bet and i am sure everybody here can understand it only you seem to have problem with itok forget my shortcuts just focus on message not into messenger or his mistakesps as i supported this idea with my alts i did expect it to be obvious as all my alts have similar names jeeeeeesusit was just expression about how much i myself support this i really think it could save incursionand if you cant understand what i try to say i can definitely say its not about my spelling
btw you noticed you wrote word text with lowercase letter after previous sentence so donUFFFDt come to me about using u instead of youand just as most of great writings and ideas those are worthless only for those who themselves canUFFFDt understand themplease explain what you donUFFFDt understand what in my writings you do not understand i am happy to explain then with more details
by navy do you mean the empire npcs like federation navy 
well botnavy would be much like concord it would be much more interesting and fun if it would be navy from players that join it in fact it could increase amount of players joining navy very muchthink about itone fleetdivision of navy patrolling in case of sanshaUFFFDs that just happens to be only one available others are fighting already elsewhere against sanshaUFFFDs and fleet commander gets call from concord to assist 2 orcas and 3 hulksfleet commander has though choice fleet is pretty much frigs cruiser bcUFFFDs and couple battleshipsbut reward and bounty from empire rescuing those ships and killing sanshaUFFFDs even is hugewould he in few seconds take a risk and call in ts we jump
you what this is unintelligible drivel i havent got an igloo what you are saying are you having a giraffe at us
sorry did not understand that giraffe i am just humble soldier on my pvp account and hardworking on this industrial accountjust describing how it could be in incursion as i have said it would be incredibly stupid and notfuntoplayanymore if sansha get to kill anybody anywhere in highsec withouth even any kind of possibility to strike backdefence by playersafter loosing second topfitted orca andor hulk on planet or at belt in one week guess i would quit and concentrate on civilization 5only solution i can come up with is humanorganized antisansha navy that could jump anywhere with concords helpand it would be so much fun pretty close to some battles in 00 secbut in this case even newbies in frigs could join taking their smaller part from reward loot and bountyaction that is what this game needs more
learning skills are being removed according to dev blog a great thing is happening but i want to get this out before the fate that plex for remap had ignor bitter vetsthings changegames evolvethis isnt eve build 000001this isnt patch 10learning skills need to be removed it pushes noobs away and no morons they arnt optional without them it takes 25 50 75 longer to train skillswithout them more people will playthread
bitter vet checking ini agree new guys shouldnt have to train skills that do nothing but help them train other skills when i started i kept putting off learning skills there was always another skill i had to train first1 to ccpwhat im not that bitter
dont let cluesless nubs play the gamelearning skills are being removed according to dev blog a great thing is happening but i want to get this out before the fate that plex for remap hadignor clueless nubssend them back to wow where they belong
op should perhaps look in a mirror before he calls other people bitter
im not the one who said dont do plex for remap cause it will ruin the game because i didnt have it when it came outvets are the ones who  about things that are good then a few months later most realize they were wrongplex for remap was a good idea personally isk for remap would have been better  isk sink but about 600 bitter vets ed and now not happeningtrying to not let the same thing happen to this idea learning skills are stupid and im glad they are being removed  hopefully
blarrrrg

as someone who just started a new new alt 4 days ago im pretty happy about this though it seems silly that im doing learning skills now and they will vanish in a few fews
i like it
controlling how your ship takes damage interesting tactics to utilizing it without actually increasing a ships ehponly problem i see is then it basically creates a small buffer hp that either tank type has to give its main tank a small respite the only issue with that is that buffer is self regenerating on an armor tank but a one shot buffer for shield tanks without armor rr the net effect for that individual case is the same since while the shield tankers shield is off its regenerating but after that its a very slight advantage to armor tankinteresting idea is supported though
awesome idea itd be very fun to play with 
i simply can not believe that jason edwards actually posted a reasonable proposal instead of lowgrade trolls the universe as we know it could fall apartoh btw idea supported
yes
interesting concept however i do not think ccp will want to program this onei will support it because it makes for an interesting combat tactic
i like the idea no idea if ccp will go with it though
i love the idea just not sure how it could implemented maybe make the capacitor display into a pressable button to turn the shields on or off but no timer i guess
i like the idea very muchi dont know how possible it is for ccp to implement though i also think it would be near useless in a high lag situation
finally a proper use for the tsm skill apart from unlocking tech 2 hardenersedit forgot support
when you pay the subscription you pay to get access on all the game content not just a part of the game contentsubscription  item shop  is most outrageous thing one can hear like spanish ppl say hacer de puta y poner la cama
i want to vote no to this ideano
anything that will get hybrids looked at and fixed cant believe rockets are being fixed yet a turret weapon system used by two races of the game isnt even on he csm list
i dont have all the time in the world to reply to your idiotic comments one by one so im just going to make a blanket statement that you are all idiots i dont care about what initiatives have been put in place to do things this is just a repeat of past initiatives that were supposed to do the same thing the csm has failed to institute any measures to fix anything in the game the game used to be good and the game design has progressively become worse and worse due to emo whinging on the forums by carebears the csm has done nothing to stop the steady decline in the quality of eve it only serves as a mechanism to confuse the stupid who are in the majority that changes to the game are being implemented this is exactly what is happening with the rocket fix i dont want to go into how the changes to rockets dont affect caldari ships to make them viable at pvp what my proposal is is that we get rid of this forum where stupid people put their stupid ideas forward and influence the game to make it more stupid ccp obviously dont play their fricken game if they did theyd fix it they obviously dont because its been broken basically forever piracy is dead there used to be piracy in eve a lot of caldari mechanics are broken and have been broken for a long time generally pvp shield tanking is broken t1 battleships specifically caldari weapon systems are broken in pvp some caldari ships were designed to fit webscap rechargers and have had their mid slots removed making them nonviable pvp platforms and in one case pve pvp is moving towards being completely consensual ie you have to sign up for faction warfare  there are a whole lot of dialogue boxes popping up warning you if youre going to perform an illegal act additionally you can abandon wrecks to prevent flashy red people popping up around you this was actually supported by the csm faction warfare introduced basically another antipiracy policy in eve by introducing massive organization in lowsec that is something in the order of up to 6000 players to effectively prey on pirates so theyve introduced a predatorthe csm has achieved nothing dissolve it the only surprise i expect to receive in upcoming expansions is surprise eve just got worse they havent achieved anything regarding real money items in eve online dissolve the csm
christ almighty could you be any more madthe csm are not developers they are a communication channel between the players and the developers they were always designed to be a communication channel theyve failed to institute measures what the hell do you expect them to do march over to iceland and uniformly kick ccps management in the nads any power they have they only have because ccp grants it to themyour mistake is the mistake of many you presume the csm are failures because you misinterpret their purpose theyre a communication channel not a balance team you want to see caldari fixed you want to see pvp matter how about you make a god damned proposal for those things were all open to ideas were just not going to go easy on you if those ideas turn out to be poorly thought out and selfservingwhat i would be in favor of is making the csm more visible to the actual players of eve
110 seen better trolls from goons and testtrying to hard there son ya got a draw it out otherwise it becomes to obvious
then it would appear that you are the minority here and you cant argue against that point because youre the one who made it
this generates so many lols ive bolded the most ironic part of his post
that makes sense on so many levels not going to argue i try not to seem troll like im actually not trolling im just ed i think a lot of people are edid like to complement you on your incorrect use of the word ironic you have clearly shown that you are not an idiot and that i am wrong and stupid
another stealth caldari are pants whine thread the csm do there job since this lot got voted in alot of things have been fixed or are being fixed that people have whined about for ages rockets for exampleas for the caldari and mid slots a never fit cap rechargers for pvp b i never seem to have a problem fitting webs to my caldari ships cruiser and up the problem with caldari ships is their hybrid ships dont get a damage bonus and hybrids are generally pants
id like to compliment you on how well youve managed to make your insulting remarks complement your own misuse of the english language
i do it with style
but if you are a shrinking minority doesnt that mean that comparatively speaking most people would not be edbrb carebearing
qftbout damn time nice to see your using your head
ed retardant for the english impaired ccpdons flameproof suitsprays flame retardant everywhereenters fallout style vaultbraces for impactproblem with democracy is that it is rule by the lowest common denominator this is fact and a huge fallacy in the democratic process
i approve of this as a general statement
i disagree they managed to make ccp uturn on a very good idea that would of promoted a more dynamic way to play the game
i disagree they killed the learnings current csm best csm
you can not dissolve the csm they stay crunchy in milk
irl black ops often have extraction ability i suggest the ability for 00 alliances with sov to be able to drop a system upgrade and pos module that gives black ops ships the ability to jump portal to this module from anywhere in the eve universeincluding wormspace this has 2 effects the black ops ships actually tags along to hostile space and ships can get into bad situations and can escape the caveat cost of fuel will be much higher and theres a cooldown at pos module where you are unable to cloak move or warp for a period of time depending on ship size quite the target
so from you badly worded proposal i take it you want blops to be able to jump and portal all the way across the eve universe to a system upgradepos module that someone drops ie instead of a covert cyno this would make the blops the most powerful jump capable craft you are not putting a cyno pilot at risk at all with your method and it reeks of personal agenda although i would love to see a slight increase in the jump range of blops this isnt the solutionnot supported
purposethe purpose is really to just provide for a more dynamic experience wherein a human element is brought more into the game by introducing petty mortals who do the work for you essentially this element is already present though it is hiddenunseenbackgroundcrew consists of little insignificant mortals who dont count for much but still need to be cared for the larger the ship the larger the crew while in station a crew doesnt require as much while in space it will require more in space a crew will require food and other supplies in dock they can simply get these themselves main proposalif a ship is assembled it requires a crew you need to hire a crew so per time interval a certain quantity of isksupplies are paidconsumed to pay for crew so if you have a titan or supercarrier these costs will begin to mount up no more simply buying the ship and youre done now that awesomely powerful debatable ship is an isk sink that needs to perhaps now be used more often when you buy a ship and assemble it you now have to buy a crew before you can leave the station when you build a supercap you need to import a crew before it becomes operational i would also like to see crews becoming more apart of the combat or mining experience most interestingly i would like to see crews gain experience so that the longer your crew and you are together and they work together basically the longer your ship stay intact the more effective your ship will actually be i made this up in like 10 minutes so im sure it could use reworking but i wouls really like to see crews introduced
i have always had the comment that scientists  slaves  and other units should be able to be put in ships and poss to increase efficiency somewhereimagin you use slaves on your ship and enter minmatar space where slaves are forbidden  adds a dynamic to the gameor you have a pos  and if you put in 5 scientists  your labs run a bit  faster  or engineers  your pos uses a bit less fuelthey would become a commodity
i have always trained the learning skills to a minimum of 54 on my accounts and have always hated it as it wasted basically a month of time before the toon can even start training on things that will make it a better pilot so maybe it will help if we look at it this waykeep the learning skills causes new players to curse at eve hate it and never play againremove them completely makes 7 year old pilot a bit angry why the hell should you care youve trained everything you wanted already htfu and they wont quit eve over itskills kept means a slower growth rate of players for eve get rid of them and that rate increases creating larger fleetscorpsalliances and of course fun
the arguments for the removal or modification of the learning skills are ridiculous you all want them removed because they are a hindrance to training skills that make you a better pilot thats exactly what training those skills do they allow you to train at a faster rate making you a better pilot faster in my opinion youre all a bunch of whinersthe patience gained from training learning social leadership and trade is invaluable for the new pilot in later eve adventures without that patience gate camping and pvp roams would never get organized the patience needed to do the same missions over and over would never develop mining would never happen eve is a game of patience even a lone wolf ambusher needs patience going from belt to belt system to system to find the right target
i disagree wholeheartedly games are meant to be fun and the described activities are fun in themselves yes even mining for some people or bots tmmv spinning in station not fun the only thing that paying 15 dollars a month for spinning in station teaches is that you could be doing better with your 15 dollarshow do i know this because i have heard it from numerous people who have quit the game some i introduced some i didnt who came here looking for the stuff in the trailers and found the learningsrecognizing terrible design design that chases away new players and encourages and rewards tedium and boredom doesnt make one a whiner i would say that it would show more concern for the future of the game and about it in general than self serving bittervet postures from people that have trained all they cared to and want to keep their advantage forever doing their utmost to make eve as boring and pointless as possible as to never have to compete with anyone or lose their imaginary edge over the barely growing wastelands of new edenno the whiners would be those closed to reason who stick to the way it is because they see it as a hindrance to new blood and as such good in a perverse and nonsensical way people who would make every facet of the game as tedious as possible in short you
so ccp finally started to listen all the wise words in this topic

not supported worst change
too late oh only if you had said so before ccp made a blog about ityou could have stopped it we would have learning skills forevermoreno but really too late m8
all the bitter vets will cry now
ccp has just handed bittervets our single largest bonus in the history of eve not only have we benefited from learning skills for years now but we also get millions of skillpoints that we can invest wherever we want now it still wouldve been best not to institute this change but for a change that was supposed to benefit new players ccp just granted an overwhelmingly huge bonus to older players want racial dread or carrier to v okay that train will take you about 5 seconds fc to v well almost most bitter vets can go from leadership v to half way through fc v in yep five seconds once the boost goes through ccps just made vets even more overwhelmingly beyond new players in terms of sps
im still confused by this and need a straight answer1 will the removal of learning skills hurt the training time bonus that i currently have2 if it dosent how is it being fixed i get that the points are being added to the attributes but im still confused to the reason of why3 if the learning skills are being removed will there be another way to decrease the time that it takes to train a skill by increasing your base attributes with out a neural remap or implants
youre not thinking it through finnyeah vets get the sps to apply now but noobs are instantly equal to vets in training rate whereas normally they would have to spend time x months to train up learning skills equal to the vets and at the end of that x month time period they will have applied to their nonlearning skills the same sp that the vets are getting refunded so it comes out in the washboth sides win they just win in slightly different ways noobs train faster in the early months than they would have which means they get to do more of the basic things faster vets get to apply some sp now and have more opportunities for training arbitragethere are some edge cases where some people get slightly disadvantaged and i am one of them i set up a training plan just before ccp told csm they wanted to do this and i stuck to it despite my inside knowledge but overall it is a big win for everyoneyes noobs will never catch up with vets but they were never going to do that anyway and in any case the real reason for this change imho is making the game a bit more noobfriendly
better fix lag
not supported bad ideathe eve is differ in case with other mmorpgs with its freedom of choice and training useless learning with next faster or instant training musthave skills is a part of that freedom and you are want to kill a part of soul of eve ill never agree with it thanks to all for attention
not supported worst change
yeah someone should make a law chillax bro the decision has been made so take the money well the sp and save your energy for a more important battle
big faila whole demension of eve removed forever especially for newbsmillions of free sp  only makes it more after u finished to distribute them cause u got smth u wanted without effort
big win the whole demension consisted in spinning in station while paying monthly fees a demension indeedtruly a solution where everyone wins noobs dont have to spin bittervets are happy everyone is happyexcept for what do you call those things under bridges starts with a t or something its in the tip of my tongue
even though i was in favour of keeping the learning skills the fact that i get my months of training back in sp that i can flush somewhere else i am content withto me this got rid of a little element of the sandbox where a player choses to skill or not to skillbut  with that saidfair to 999 of all people  everyone gets their training time back  lets start playing the game and stop beating this dead horse as it has been solved  patchedsee you all in the game cheers
no ui mean am too in any case it does come out in the wash over time but instantly all of us vets can invest points into noob ganking v where new pilots will still have to spend time training up ting up local to iv before they can skill up for tear extraction v so new players get to train up a bit faster to match older player rates but older players can train up almost any skill in the game to v instantly you are correct though this change was largely instituted to help out new players and make their beginning game more friendly i for one will do my part and skill up for some artie thrasher alts oh im chill no argument here just trying to figure out what im going to spend my noobhammeringlyhuge pool of free sps on maybe ill just keep a pool of them to deal with potential t3 losses
please for the sake of mind do not change the working system as long as it is not brokenif you ask the casual eve player why he likes eve he will mention the awesome skill system in front of all facts so why change itit just makes no sensepeople just dont get that eve is not about skills its about fun and you dont need the biggest ship to have that fun besides even if you train for that big ship straightaway you get it faster than if you train all learning skills at v before starting to play the gamethe only proposition that would make the new system we already have with the double sp till 16 mil any better would be if the players that choose different ancestries get somelearning skills like if you choose minmatar military soldier you get perc adv perc and willpower skill at iv rest you would have to train like all the rest if you choose to play as amarr business then ofc you will get other starting learning skills at iv maybe increase the double learn bonus cap to 16milthe amount of sp you get in those learnings but thats not even necessary that system would allow the players to train those skills of the profession they have chosen at the creation of character later on they can change that spec they got 2 remaps for that the players that quit eve because of learning skills will be the players that quit eve as soon as they notice that there are skills in game that take over one month to train like carrier or freighter or they will whine on the forums for as long as it takes to break ccp and remove the whole skill systemmy english is not as good as i would like it to be but i hope someone will get my point i did not train the learning skills at v i did that after i could fly a dominix with shieldtank and t2 med drones the best solution for those learning skills would be that those people that tell all the newbies to train those at the beginning get banned or at least removed from forums because of giving bad advice
why complicate they have module already made they only need to allow it to be used on ships and let it remain high sloted since we need marauders to be buffed and mid slot would be too much of a buff for armor tankers or nerf to shield tankers and whining minmatars
this comparisons been used many times so if youre really easily irritable well its not my problem xdbut this isnt world of warcraft if you want things to be easier go there this game is designed a specific way for a reason if you could just up and pull people in itd only benefit people like you  who go ahead and would turn station games around for your own benefit and pull people away from the station reducing your difficultyeffort bumping people with your machariels  and would benefit alliance warfare goers or casual lowsecnullsec pvpers in no way what so ever and im not talking about practicality here im talking about how fkd up pvp would be you have webs use them theres a reason why your precious machariels exists even if they werent intended for bumping and theres also a reason why the rapier exists use them in conjunction dont go and ask for a universal solution to making pvp easier for your selfish needs if pvp were that easy again world of warcraft influence also im sure ccp considered the idea of using tractor beams as the same mechanics seen in star trek and numerous other spaceship showsmovies dont you think they would of implemented it by now if they thought it were a safe and practical mechanic to sum this all up because eve should be easy amiriteafter all how long have tractor beams been around now
except there should be it was part of the rules they agreed to when the client first installs to a computer  to follow all policies and the renaming only take effect when a person petitions it which is where im going with this topic
i find the name gallion offensive and racistbut nice trolling
grow up
are you like eves version of mary whitehouse  what about these names crackcrevicecleavagemelonsknobhungstackedsalamiweener 
not sure if serious of all the things to crusade against in this game of all the things that suck or are plain broken of all there is to fix you choose the word crotchi err confussdbut just for arguments sake is there a list of terms someone may find offensive i dont think such a sensitive topic as bans for offensive terms that seem inocuous to others based on a whole bunch of subjectivity are a good idea i dont think this should be up to gms as they are known to act based on their own beliefs and who knows what they find offensive
his argument seems to be that instead of actually developing content or cracking down on rmt the gms and ccp should waste their time actively searching for supposedly bad names in character creation so the playerbase wont have their delicate sensibilities offended by having to petition the individual cases god forbid i should have to see a character with the word knockers in their name my soul would be thoroughly corrupted if i had to actually petition it
 what seriously im not targeting crotch as the topic it was the reference for the topic and as for referal to the inappropriate nothing can be said so as such i stand by the fact having players named sorry moderators 111 or vaginallips is not by any means something that should be allowed to remain in eve you guys are obviously still new to the world to understand the term teen and know the differnse of maturity the devsccp of eve have not a hard time dealing with this manpower or automated targeting me as the joke here is not the topic so im gonna level with those who think that what im saying has any notions of delaying anything with eves mechanical design yes glorified words grow up really cause eve isnt a normal community its got plenty of smart players and demeaning this game that those who love it would rather have seen some improvements no matter how small
i stand firm to the original tos the naming policey is there read thatcrotch is fine but the referance is notpoint this excellence
the punishement is excessive for such a minor issue and since there is already a way to deal with such names using any more of ccps time and effort on this seems like an unnecessary wastenot supported
yes your talking about petitioning them so am i its not minor it huge u just wouldnt understand oh and the punishment was there from the begining
he is right to a certain degree when in communication with another player in eve it becomes unrated but it is technically rated teen and by virtue of that fact the precious sensibilities of a teenager could be destroyed by looking at a profane name in local without having agreed to any sort of comunicaehowever he is not even really arguing about profanity specifically because he states many times quite fervantly that he does not want to expand the catalog of the profanity filter he is arguing that the petition system be changed in such a way so that he can press on with his crusade to protect the innocent and uphold the law eula now if we look at it from this standpoint we can ignore the profanity discussion altogether and focus on the real reason that he is the only one supporting his topicplain and simple it will waste the gms time he seem to scoff at the very idea that this could actually eat up more time than he is willing to believe in his original post he states i decided to petition in realizing it was literally pointless afterwords he never stopped to question just why exactly it was pointlessi assure you gallion that the reason that it was pointless was because the gms have to address literally thousands of petitions every day there is a well defined reason that there is a cap on active petitions because it takes up time now i know that you believe that there are plenty of smart and capable people at ccp and there are but they are doing a lot of things all at once and they cannot prioritize naming conventions over game destabilization even if those names in question breach the eulayou have stated unequivocally that raising the active petition limit will in no way hinder the process of eves development but what numbers do you have to support that claim almost everyone here has elicited concerns over the gms time management in regards to the amount of petitions they receive why do you disregard that immediately is it because you really believe that they could withstand any amount of work just because they are smart and capable or is it that you believe all of us opposed to your idea are simply trolling it and attacking youto be clear i believe this to be a well thought out and cogent argument against your proposal and in no way should it be construed as a troll or as an attack i just think that there are ramifications beyond your wellintentioned idea that you have not or are unwilling to consideron a side note however i must ask what did you find particularly offensive about the word crotch i dont mean to pull this back into another vague discussion of syntax rather the word itself it does not actually refer to a part of the human anatomy vulgar or otherwise now you have a crotch on your pants and technically you have one between your legs but the male and female reproductive organs are not a part of itsorry everyone for the wall of text
you have no problem to destroy a teenagers brandnew hulk in highsec by suicide gankers who buy plexes from real money to pay the losses but you have a problem with someone named crotch thats pathetic no not supported if thats the only problem eve has i can live with names like thati seriously have way more problems to see native american or english player not being able to speak and write english grammar correctly because i see my children i have 3 of them playing eve learning from them lots of mistakes and slappy languagebut i cant change that i know that i personally cannot write correct english i am german but i really would be more concerned about education of your poeple in your countriesmy children can handle bad words they just laugh about iti am really more concerned about really bad behavior stealing scamming lying killing other people destroying alliances thats the nature of eve in general and bad behaviour gets rewarded in eve i think thats much bigger problem for children they learn from that
although i dont support the op if you are going to start pointing out grammatical errors and spelling mistakes i would look at your own writing first
points made and fer certain others still miss the topic and my crusade isnt just mine there are others and many of them dont have time for forums petition work is part of their strive for excellence and holding their rules is part that as wellthey are fine with this that is why there is a petition category and no change in naming policies
she seems to address that with the i am german part conceding her failure to be flawless
i see you didnt reply to my comment about your name being offensive with its obvious connotations but then you forget that inoffensive names in your eyes may have deeper connections than you first realise the same applies to what you may find offensive in your language actually has different connections than you have the intelligence to work outin other words stop using your questionable morality to sensor other players names when you are doing it from a misguided platform of ignorance
no but now your just attacking me its sensibility  maturity not morality
whilst that is true its still a bit of a cheap shot to point out someone else is grammar and spelling mistakes whilst making mistakes yourself particularly when you cant be sure that the person your correcting is english as well
which im totaly fine with since that is your problem but to put something past your ignorance wrong topic
no its just just being racist
i was going to give you 1010 the adultery bit was classic but then you posted twice in a row showing you are getting more worked up than the people you are trolling so dropped you to 610 good effort however and i am looking forward to your next attempt
i firmly stand against any and all attempts of limiting what players call themselves anyone who has a problem with a particular word should just grow up its a word after all the original post is quite ridiculous considering the word crotch isnt even inappropriate it doesnt matter if their are kids in this game the majority of players are not i have no problem letting someone name themselves whatever they wish or typing whatever they wish into a chat channel words are merely a grouping of individual symbols these symbols have been invented by human minds human minds have invented the meaning behind them words are not offensive only little minds choose to take offense to themthough i do recognize that ccp is a private company and it is within their right to limit communications as they see fit
i am attacking your ignorance not you personallyif you cant see that your own maturity comes into questioni see that you still havent addressed my concerns that your own ingame name may be distressing to former neopets players
ed dimwitted typoed mental complications filtered wtf so to jump on you for your own statement a while back we tried to have a corp named death kitty this was deemed offensive due to the implication of the other cat word the one with p which we didnt even use then we went through the trouble of trying the word in latin ancient greek and even ancient egyptian still blocked out due to reference to pcat pretty diligent i must admit this is where we realized that the language written bears no impact on wether something can be seen as offensivewhat im thinking here is that your name in my native language can be use as slang for an errected richard petition sent not really but i do hope you catch my drift
near where i live there is a restaurant named fuk yuen on a main thoroughfare  i can just imagine someone like gallion going to the government office screaming to shut them down
there is a place near me calleds word blanks but its a mans crotch halfway inits a restaurant if i remember rightanyways110 post1 supportplease dont let this ever happen
this will be dealt with
lol i used to work with a guy named richard helmut oh the poor innocent peers at his school being corrupted every time roll was called lol and my grandma knows a guy named harold hoar imagine being his mother
they are to no use flashing around in their colors gagging players when they are trying to get helpim making it short im a pilot with few words
bitter much
he came into help started demanding for a gm and being really obnoxious swearing whilst doing so when told by isd that he would have to petition he replied that he had the petition system didnt work and he wanted a gm here now all whilst swearing and acting like a spoilt little bratisd told him 2 more times he would have to petition and to stay on topic eventually he was booted only to return an hour later and be booted again after 3 more warningsemorage over a lost ship or somethingsad
currently command ships often sit away from the fight and provide thier bonuswould be nice to see a range on these of a few hundred km and get a buff to thier hp so you actually see them on the field of combat
my command loki i stay in a safe spot to actually be able to run 3 command links i sacrifice tank and so make it unprobablemy sliepnir is in the thick of action as is my claymore with 3 links fitted yes i know some people safe up with these ships but they have a very good tank and should be in the thick of it vultures nighthawks damnations are all in the thick of battle the only command ships that need looking at are the gallente ones and that is mainly due to the terrible bonuses they field compared to the other racesso maybe it is just you but i have fought against many fleets with command ships in them and my corp fields them alsonot supported
simple enough when your in a cloaking gang even when you cloak you cant see any one else  which means that if you warp to say a gate good chance you might bump some one both of you get decloaked and generally at the time your in a ship thats got paper thin glass for armorbasic change when in a fleet and you cloak your ship turns transparent yellow noting your cloaked but still being visible to your fleet this will work for full covops fleets as well as mixed fleetsadditionally please try and keep posts constructive
cloaked ships are basically removed from the system their coordinates are not send to anyone to avoid client side hacks that would make them visible to others
supported in principlei suggest that the cloaked pilot have the following options any of which may be turned on or off independently transmit position to direct commanders transmit position to all commanders transmit position to fleetmates with cloaking devices fitted and online transmit position to fleetmates who are actually cloaked transmit position to all squadmates transmit position to all wingmates transmit position to all fleetmatesif any one of the selected options applies then that fleetmate can see the pilot while the pilot is ongrid and cloaked these options have no effect if the cloaked pilot is not ongridleaving all options turned off replicates the current situation on tranquility fleetmates cant see you ongrid unless you decloak
well that can easily be solved by only transmitting it to fleet membershowever while one might argue if cloaks do or dont need a nerf is there anyone who honestly think that cloaks need a boost which this is
i was never sure if you could see cloaked fleet members knowing that you cant thats kind of offsupported but youre probably going to get a lot of snark from others
hows adding more skills to train helping new players maybe if the 100 starter bonus was longer it would work removing learning skills and granting a base 10 with the 20 for learning seems to be the best all round answer sure those who have the full 6m sp in learning might feel abit put upon but theyd get to put those sps else were getting the time down for a new player to start flying a worthwhile missionpvp boat keeps more people in the game and is worth putting upon older players alittle
keep in mind the base 10 is an example base attributes would be as they are now
i dislike and do not support this optionlearning skills are the first object lesson in teaching a new player the importance of training skills in the right order and what an importance it is their extremely mild complexity is very much in line with the rest of eve as is the available choice to focus on or ignore specific attributestraining learning skills on a character is a significant investment in personal suffering and for an early player making 1 million isk an hour money one that im sure nobody takes lightly attaching them to their character with your suggested changes youd have to be completely daft not to train learning to max immediately upon character creationin addition i dislike your math a straight 100 bonus to skill attributes is extremely different than 910 or 88 or 1010 like you should be training with no additive component this will skew skill training speeds pretty dramatically as people will end up training skills theyre specced for 253x faster than ones they are not rather than a modest 17x or sobelow paragraph edited for emphasis and clarification in redtldr people want to get rid of learning skills because they are painful to train eve is about pain its an integral part of the game its a good pain one that teaches you a lot about the game if you cant deal with training learning youre gonna hate training for ships anyone who cant summon that small amount of patience and will to plan ahead is going to quit eventually anyway getting rid of learning skills strongly strikes me as the first step down a terrible slippery slopei mean what is the next logical step probably something like turning all t1 frigates and weapons skill bonuses into inherent bonuses enabling new players to jump right into the game without all that frustrating support weapons and spaceship command training maybe this sounds a bit extreme it is but its more or less the next bear in line
so you would have them remain as is even after ccp indicated that wont happen ultimately
lol some people still think ccp wants to keep learning skills when all else aside it makes new players less likely to subscribe key point identification failuretrying to keep the i train a skill to train skills idea alive just isnt going to happen even if its reduced to one skilledit  forgot to mention lol  slippery slope 2 posts above me
lol yourself sirlearning skills are not a major or even a minor deterrent to newly subscribing players all of ccps recent changes to the npe are geared towards solving this problem in another more reasonable way like i said before if someone cant even deal with training 5 or 6 days of learning skills in the first couple weeks theyre not the kind of person whos gonna stay subscribed anywayi mean seriously everyone posting in this thread trained learning skills what makes you so sure that it makes everyone quityour idea of the facts isnt the only valid thought process in the world bro
posting to confirm they make a lot of people quit how do i know because quite a few have told me so and i was very close to quitting over themif you dont think they are any sort of deterrent well you probably didnt read through this thread the other thread on learnings the one in skill discussions or the other numerous threads on the subject you must also have missed the supports in general to remove them change them or plain kill them with firei did the npe content the tutorials and all that and the epic arc didnt make the learnings suck any less the spinning any more enjoyable or the people that have quit over them stay so it is probably in short not the best at solving this problemby the way the status quo is not a reasonable way but to be honest i would think the ccp of 18 months commited to getting new fresh happy people worked i am here over pleasing bittervets that bite and hate everything would lead me to believe and hope that the learnings and hopefully the skill system in general will be revampededit oh lookie lookie i was right ccp does listen if you quit for wow in rage over no learnings can i has your isklearning skills will be removed on tuesday december 14 2010 you can read about the full changes in the latest blog from ccp greyscale
im caspardian and i approve this messagetopicwhatever
wish granted
yay
lolyour idea of the facts is the most invalid process in the world brosucks to literally get a dev post the next day making you the absolutely most unsuccessful troll ever imo
heres an actual link that works linkageso now that this proposal is redundant i have 6 million sp to plan to move to more fun locations
are you mad because it sounds like youre mad belittle harder if you dareim fine with the new changes it looks great to me i just dont think it was ever as bad as you whiners made it out to be
please for the sake of god do not change the working system as long as it is not brokenif you ask the casual eve player why he likes eve he will mention the awesome skill system in front of all facts so why change itit just makes no sensepeople just dont get that eve is not about skills its about fun and you dont need the biggest ship to have that fun besides even if you train for that big ship straightaway you get it faster than if you train all learning skills at v before starting to play the gamethe only proposition that would make the new system we already have with the double sp till 16 mil any better would be if the players that choose different ancestries get somelearning skills like if you choose minmatar military soldier you get perc adv perc and willpower skill at iv rest you would have to train like all the rest if you choose to play as amarr business then ofc you will get other starting learning skills at iv maybe increase the double learn bonus cap to 16milthe amount of sp you get in those learnings but thats not even necessary that system would allow the players to train those skills of the profession they have chosen at the creation of character later on they can change that spec they got 2 remaps for that the players that quit eve because of learning skills will be the players that quit eve as soon as they notice that there are skills in game that take over one month to train like carrier or freighter or they will whine on the forums for as long as it takes to break ccp and remove the whole skill systemmy english is not as good as i would like it to be but i hope someone will get my point i did not train the learning skills at v i did that after i could fly a dominix with shieldtank and t2 med drones the best solution for those learning skills would be that those people that tell all the newbies to train those at the beginning get banned or at least removed from forums because of giving bad advicei posted that in the other learning skill prop thread so 
you sir make a lot of sensethe whole learning debate is 90 whiners wanting the game to be easy and wanting all skills to train 2x faster for free and for implants to be removed so podding doesnt hurt and insurance to cover ship modules and for you to respawn as a ghost ship in your clone station and fly back to your wreck to resurrect your old equipment like corpsewalking in wowwhile i think that ccps changes to the learning system are fine you pretty much train stuff at almost the same speed as before and the biggest difference is for new players i do think the whole debate is blown way out of proportionthis a million times this thats my entire point
this matter has been resolved it took 6 days to responde the account was banned because they said that some one was hacking my account however they did not responde until after the ban was lifted this matter shuld be closed
i wouldve guessed you were banned for stupid but okay
to what end do you have in mind when you played w legosi understand your point but ccp indicated walking in stations would be optionalthings like vendors that avoid transaction taxes may be one reasonillegal trademinigamesso they may come up with some reasons i am simply of the opinion that i would like a sand box to make stuff could maybe sell do dads that you makebuild a great stripper stage and maybe someone else will buy it to stick in thier pad maybe you build a cannon that shoots slaves at a walland you sell it to a corpbut i would also like to see the ability to create spaces
they have thats the best news ive heard in a long timewish they made waiting for them to develop it and get back to working on eve optional too
this is not second lifeif you like to build clothes necklaces or waterfalls go there

i must admit i do want that

eh as long as its really easy to look after them and you get witty remarks from the crew when you do things like spam clicking warp
i didnt see this issue having been raised anywhere else so ill raise it nowim very glad to see that players are pushing for some extra npc interaction through the ccms ship crew issue and that ccp is bringing more npc combat to us through the upcoming incursion expansionbut i still feel that ccp could do betteras can be seen from the countless numbers of npc ships we capsuleers are able to make explode every day there are a lot of npcs out there looking for jobs and trying to make money the thing is it seems that theyve already all been hired by either the four empires security forces or by the pirate factions because we capsuleers never seem to be able to fight alongside the guysonly shoot themi propose that ccp implement a new system in which capsuleers are able to hire our own npcs to do the shooting for us it adds a new level of realism to the game and will allow for some really really cool new tacticsobviously the npcs we hire would have to both cost an exorbitant amount to prevent abuse and be extremely weak to prevent abusestill i cant see why a corp shouldnt be able to hire an army of npc ships and tell them to guard a gate or hop into another system and report the number of players in local or blow up the enemies station camp because we need to undock dangit its even more fun for mission runners who want to run level 5s but also really enjoy going solothis could also be an interesting asset to sec corps who own sovereignty in nullsec systems why is it that the empires can hire navies to guard their gates but not capsuleers we capsuleers seem to have no trouble finding people to work on our ships so why not on other shipsperhaps to add some customer loyalty if im running a mission for the federation navy i could get offered a discount on npcs i hire and use to run the mission with meits just a thought if its been raised before please let me know

eva
just like to say thanks to the csm who helped making this happenwoot
thanks alot csm for screwing with the vets
with multiple chars at 90m sp im considering myself a vet and i approve of this change
while i still think that the skills should not have been removed the csm deserves major congratulations for making sure that as long as it was going to happen that it happened well and fairly not only are vets not screwed over were insanely boosted my main account will have 4743765 sp to redistribute my main alt will have 4111530 sp to redistribute my secondary alts will also all have a bunch honestly the only way im at all put out by this is the fact that i just respeced for 1year plans on all my characters and if id known that i could knock out that many sps over night i wouldve planned differently as it is my only actual concerns are whether or not i boost skills that i was planning for in the next year and then try to find other skills that use the same primarysecondary attribute and if not which skills do i take dreads are soooo 2009 so im not sure that amarr dread v is in the cards for example and i already have a nyx on my alt so i dont know if i need to skill for it on my main too and
i have it worse than you finn i made my yearly plan just before ccp told csm what they were going to do and felt obligated to not act on the inside info and save myself a day or two over the next year so i respecd im too honest to be a good politician i guess my personal plan is to do sp arbitrage train highrate learning skills until the change spend the points on stuff that would train the most slowly and keep some points in my hippocket for doing things like training for the latest fotm ships
yes well sorry i did misread that but you cant really blame me as it would seem pretty in line with what we can visibly see your effect beingyou were elected by the player base to make a difference yet for the most part any real changes that are suggested by players you play ccps advocate and try to make excuses for why we shouldnt expect changes such as those being suggestedim gonna give you a news flash no one cares what csms real purpose is the only reason we vote for any of you is because we think we can give you the power to make changes for our benefitbut apparently you cant even stop microtransactions maybe you should take a page out of tambers book
i look forward to your candidacy in the next csm election dragonall of us clueless and ineffective csms would really appreciate you getting elected to the council so you can show us how its done
are you a veteran character recently traded a character in character bazzaar then you might have noticed your corp history is incompletegranted not everyone is affected by this and im sure its a very low priority for ccp or not even that but as outstanding issues go this must be about the longest running the root of the problem characters started or joined corps before the records began over 7 yrs ago then later changing corp to find out their corp history has been deleted as happened to me i have a 3 day corp history when in fact the character was ceo from pretty much the first day until recentlyhave you experienced this anything similar lets hear about it
did you bugreport this not saying itd get fixed anytime soon but unless its bug reported we unfortunately cant assume ccp is even aware of this
this thing was discussed some years ago in the test server forum if i recall correctly so ccp is aware of this or at least some dev was commenting in the discussion the topic of the thread was that some people was thinking it was an exploit as there was people with a very short history on a old characterfrom what i recall there was no intention of recovering the old data
hi all venkul mul is absolutely correct ccp is aware of this but they seem to be unable to do anything about it heres a snippet from a recent conversations id like to thank the nice gms for their support and assistance but surely that must be another way any other character viewing the corp history wont be able to see the dob so how do they know anybody have any nice constructive suggestions or comments
hows the bugfeatureideatracker coming along
updated nov 26thremovedrocketslearning skills andplex for neural remap as ccp has stated those changes are being or are deployedthe list will be updated again after the results of the nov prioritization has been tallied up thank you for your continued patience
at the least a change of terminology is in order instead of insurance call it a salvage contract in exchange for an the initial payment youre guaranteed a share of the value of recovered materials and an npc corporation is guaranteed rights to whats left of a wreck after capsuleers pick it over im sure theres enough minerals left in a wreck even after capsuleers salvage it for npc salvage operations to be viableas far as getting rid of subsidized ganking ive dabbled in ganking for killmails and im in favor of it even a battleship isnt expensive enough for this to significantly affect highsec piracy but it does give a bit more of a bite to it and thrashers are always cheap fully insured or notedit also id suggest that insurance not be voided for someone who loses a ship to concord but didnt kill anything and has no other negative security events for a month or so to cover those wait that wasnt a rat momentsalso also the pirate frigate idea is interesting it would be fairly balanced if it treats them as outlaws but suppresses gccs and security penalties for attacks using t1 frigates
no
quote until someone responds
nonot even clothesvisual items are acceptable why because for some people the social aspect of the game is gameplaylook at star trek online from cryptic they are dlc heavy like no tomorrow do you really want to turn eve into that stagnant crap no
noi will never pay for micro transactions it looks like a cheap way to earn money and i dont think ccp would be so stupid hope so
if they fix blaster by this time next year i would be shocked it needs to happen but it seams no one cares
wow this is an old thread blaster have been broken for so long and they need improvements same with railguns they eat your powergrid and use all your capin fact gallente ships will need a huge overhaul slow ships  close range blasters  ccp cant just increase the optimal tracking and dps a little bit what use are blasters if another other ship can kite you they dont even do much dps especially considering that the shieldtanking minmatar ships can slap on 3 gyrostablisers and 2 tracking enhancers which give a huge boost to rangequick megathron fittedneutron blaster iis antimatterwebscrammwdtungsten x4eanm x2dcu x2492dps 4513km range 167k ehp 797msquick maelstrom fitted800mm repeating arties empdisruptormwdinvuln large shield extenders x3763dps 3531km range 106k ehp 835msdamage at 5km mega499dps mael773dpsdamage at 10km mega405dps mael739dpsdamage at 15km mega252dps mael675dpsdamage at 20km mega124dps mael585dpsdamage at 25km mega55dps mael484dps

i think its a great idea but here is another suggestion to solve the issue for everyone give the carriers an extra high slot that can use something called a repair bomb in the field of battle you can repair your drones fighters you should send them to assist your carrier to put them in orbit around them that will repair shield armor and structure as long as the drones are not fighting and yourself as well the repair will repair to a max of 10 k and everyone can rep theyre drones with it this mod can repair only drones not ships or other devices only drones of all races and typeswith this it gives another skill to train which can boost your range as it goes and also boost the repair amount every levelgives a new bpo to the game  repair bomb 
im hesitant about thisthe name for a gun in the old west was an equalizer it didnt matter if you were brilliant or incredibly puny if you put your gun to the back of somebodys face and pulled the trigger they were deadimagine assassin alts literally alts designed to undock in stations with a gun make their way to whatever target and kill them only takes one shot to the head after all in space if youre fast and attentive or even just durable you can get out of a bad suicide gank its somewhat harder to get out of involuntary lobotomies by the time theyre recognized as a threat youre already deadyou could impose restrictions on this to make assassination attempts harder but youre going to end up with a lot of pretty bizarre special case code if you do further more if every time you go into a station you risk losing your implants thats going to keep a lot of people out of stations then you end up with them being even more deserted than before unless you make it mandatory and that way lies madness my friendalso fictionally it doesnt make much sense the security in stations is likely to be pretty damned tight if america is paranoid as it is after a few buildings get planebombed imagine how edgy jitas security force must be they probably barely let you into the station without a colonoscopyi understand the idea but in practice its just stupidly open to exploitation and i dont think you could really rectify that without mutilating the ideasorry finn
once incarna comes out ill be ready in the station with my pistol it will be fun roaming around a 00 station looking for unwanted neutsor how about these suggestion in addition to the ops1 jettisoning the dead neuts corpse out the airlock in 00  it would be fun seeing that2 bumping a player you dont like in order to instigate a legal fight in jita  just like highsec ship aggro imagine you are walking along the food court and you spot someone you recognized someone who you have plenty of beef with you approach the person using target mode in the crowd and you select the option to shoulder bump himher you have started a 1minute aggression timer with the person if the person you bumped doesnt throw the first punch you cant use guns in highsec stations unless your target is an outlaw  be careful not to shoot the crowd by the time the 1minute is up then you can go about your business but if heshe does throw the first punch then an allout fist fight ensues the crowd around you makes a big circle and everyone starts placing bets on who will win you or the target the winner walks away the loser is taken to the medical bay and finds himherself eating lunch through a straw in lowsec guns could be option if you can keep it within the empty hallways3 station siege if the station comes out of reinforcement after being sieged then the enemy fleet can board the station and take it over from the inside the enemy fleet can choose to either destroy the station or take it if they decide to take it by boarding it then the station is invulnerable to the ships outside however ships can still enter it i would recommend a single objective such as a centralized control room andor power generators deep within the station while the owning alliance has setup a defense at the control rooms entrance enemy pilots will not be able to access the crew quarters without gaining control of the centralized control room even then they have to secure the power generators as well in order to maintain power to the control roomediti almost forgot one other suggestion in the event than a armed incursion of the station does start all crew quarters will be locked down if youre in the crew quarters at the time of the lock down you could try to make your way to the control room via the ventilation shafts access to these vents should be restricted to the alliance owning the station
truth be told i dont think that being able to screw with someones ship itself while theyre docked would be a good mechanic any more than you should be able to screw with someone in a station while youre undocked having a ship in your hangar should remain as is imo docking games can properly be handled with changes to spacebased game mechanics anyways thats not to say that the dynamics of walking around wouldnt be different from flying around in space obviously its a bit easier to gtfo if you can go to warp but thats why were primarily pod pilots and not station jockeys its the same risk anybody takes when they undock and if they dont want to take that risk they can stay in their hangar after all just like now besides this is eve that getting out of your hangar includes the risk of destruction is nothing new and people who wont play the game because of it arent long for eve anyways tbh a lot of eves fictional bits dont make sense concord will exterminate you almost instantly if youre running a mission with a buddy and remote repping him and you accidentally hit him once with one gun but rats in a belt can tear you to pieces while concord does nothing at all and it can be pretty easily retconned as well all of the four great empires believe that gun ownership is a fundamental right and blah blah blah blah blah
1 although that might incur the risk of eve being viewed as a mainly pvp game again like it used to be do we really really want that
moi tykkUFFFDUFFFDn assume you are finn too rovaniemeltUFFFD pUFFFDivUFFFDUFFFDkeep on pushing this idea we will make this game best in universe one that not even next elite canUFFFDt challengehope you check and comment my proposition too
itt clown and razor agreeing on something you know it has to be good thanks for the support but sorry to disappoint its actually from finnegans wake hohohoho mister finn youre going to be mister finnagain comeday morm and o youre vine senddays eve and ah youre vinegar hahahaha mister funn youre going to be fined again
anyway great idea 
bad idea stations when we are allowed to walk around should be gun free safe zones i like they idea of sitting in a bar watching and smacking your target and following them out but having a bunch of idiots running around shooting anyone they want is a bad idea stations are safe spots and should remain so i wouldnt mind them having a bloody window to the undock though andor in player owned stations a secondary uncampable by  undock cause nothing worse then undocking only to find some  in his carrier sensor boosting and repping someone to insta kill you these guys normal smack talk alot and never leave the safety of the undock i assume they lack  size as well cause bragging about station gaming is about the best it gets for those people
i want incarna to be as unforgiving and griefable as possible fully supportedalthough im not too keen on the fps analogy id much prefer a traditional mmo style 3rd person perspective set up
id assume that itd be easiest to use the wod interface which id guess would take the third person perspective but if that was too hard id settle for fps style stuff as long as they didnt make it like the matrix mmoitd be okay thats exactly how 100 of the game is currently while youre undocked if you want to smack without repercussions youve still got local but no theyre not your hangar is safe and should remain so but not one player in the games history has ever stepped out of their pod and into the actual station right now they simply dont exist as anything other than an idea its a bit like saying that the grand concert halls of caldari prime have always been completely safe they have been for the exact same reason that stations have always been completely safe nobodys ever been in either
but i was hoping to run a bar in lowsec station when you could move around their how can i do that if everyones running around killing each other somewhere has to be a safe zone i guess i could just hang a no guns allowed sign at the door maybe get the sansha to watch the door
no thanksi dont fancy listening to you lot ing like a bunch of whiny teenagers when the insides of stations turnout to be as empty as lowsec because you cant help shooting everyone that walks pastnot supporting due to potential for massive whiny iness
there are waysiow dont allow people to shoot other people in stations because people may shoot other people in stations and and then people wont be able to shoot other people in stations
iow get people to quit their ing about how empty lowsec is and ill change my mind i have a low tolerance for wahhh i dont like these consequences even though theyre our faulteditthat said i do really like your sig finn
i support the concept as i really dont want wis to become just utterly redundant and from what ccp allowed to get through it looks just like it will i think that high sec station should really be close to save as in you can kill someone if you spend several days an a couple hundred million on a gun that you can fire undetected and then get turned into swiss cheese by the concord soldiers guard bots etc so the should be no salvaging of implants in at least 08 below you should be able to again with a lot of expense fool the security to an extend that you can assassinate somebody get in your ship and then gtfo with navy aggression then you should be able to dock at another station of a different corp and wait said timer out if its the same corps station you will get hunted by the guards there and probably killed or will not even get rights to dock in low sec you should be able to kill someone take his head to salvage and get shot at by the occasional security gun gtfo from the station and wait out your timer on another or suchnull sec should be total anarchy at least on pirate stations for outposts you the owner should be able to hire npc mercs to defend against intruders those of curse would not shoot people of the owners alliance and could be equipped with better weapons armor shields and other tools on a side note i just got the idea to hook dust into eve by being able to sent dust mercs into an enemy station to take it over or just destroy something shield generators so it can be taken over from the outside more easily etc i dont think i have to say much about weapons and tools as there really should not be any discussion what those should be well maybe one thingi think it would be awesome if you could break into ones hangar and steal something but that imho should be possible to defend against for a 99 if you get a certain level of hangar security which would of curse be very expensive and could maybe be breatched in null sec over a course of several hours letting your hacking tool work while you play cards with your corp mate and of course the owner would get a message like hey dude your hangar is being hacked go and do somethingi do have enough ideas for another 20 post but sadly im pretty lazy about writing so
the necessity for a feature so that space barbie actually has any real features isnt effected by whether or not people will complain about it just ignore them if they complain besides people already undock in highsec despite the fact that they could be ganked any moment highsec decks on a station would be no different and thanks i need to edit it since the size limit is freakin small and when i reduced it i was too lazy to resize the text on the bottom cant read that  without my glasses on can barely read it with em
and low sec is deadtheres three reasons with wont workfirst wardec are between you and concord but these stations are not necessarily controlled by concord this means even if you have a valid war between your corp and corp b its not likely to be honored in any station secondly theres no real reason for suicide ganks to happen in stations unless you expect pod pilots to walk around with tobiens modified top hats on their heads or something theres no benefit you talk about implants but implants like rigs are intended to be isk sinks where theyre continually removed from the market whenever used finally the last thing eve needs is more griefing further i suspect incarna is intended to do three things1 it allows ccp to show off their carbon character creator2 create a real connection with ones character one of the complaints i hear from new or turned off players is that they feel no real connection to their character since the only representation of him or her is a small image in the left hand corner or in the chat window3 provide new areas to bother expand into in terms of gameplay like gambling and bring eves lore more to a forefront its one thing to talk about amarrian slaves its another to see them in personim not saying that their shouldnt be combat ever but that combat is likely going to take the form of dust not incarna
i support enabling physical combat between capsuleers but the deliberate lack of security measures as you propose will make incarna not so desirable as a wholethe whole point of ganking in stations is to have fun by ganking real alive capsuleer targets not just some unimportant nurtura foundation deck 1712 guard 15437 this means a steady influx of voluntarily capsuleer meatbag targets is required to make the whole gis run smoothly think of the current situation of lowsec since theres nothing special that only lowsec can offer and the risk for operating within such place is comparable to living in hostile 00 any lowsec region that is not a faction warfare zone or a l5 mission hub is barely populated of course shooting other pirates  pirate gangs itself is a lot of fun but the whole concept of piracy ransoming and plundering does not work very well right now because of the distinct lack of unarmed unsuspecting and innocent targets simply put i dont want to be an innocent target for a crappy paycheck so the rewards have to be bigger or something completely unique enough to make me risk myself as a targettherefore at least two systematic encouragement for voluntary selfvictimization has to be established to supply the coveted targets1 unique experiences andor compensation via stationonly items  systems for potential meatbag targets especially in lawless decks2 reasonable safety inside station areas partially preventative law inforcement and personal defence gear degree of prevention can be configurable at the users will hirable body guards and duplicates private security grids and detection gear in taverns directional forcefields that can cover your back while you play poker or shake hands with high level officials etc to add immersion to the ingame worldpreventative security measures also have a side effect it makes the whole ganking process much more challenging and engaging than lock target  scan cargo  shoot  get blown up  scoop loot with alt rinse and repeat bypassing security measures itself is comparable to solving complex puzzlesat least according to the chronicles and novels so it adds another layer of gameplay element that rewards the intelligent patient and persistent users the kind of stuff ccp envisions as being eveish i thinkthe empyrean age and burning life novels provide some insights toward how the inhabitants of stationsespecially those in lawless areas protect themselves with whatever resources they have and most importantly the reason why those inhabitants got there and lived there in the first place i hope these references help you improve your idea of gis so that one day i may actually see gis going live in tq and become the game of true black ops that will make cod black ops a crybabyonce again i support your idea fly recklessedit wording and some more ideas
my personal issue isnt that im not getting combat right now in incarna i understand its supposed to be phased integration and whatnot i havent seen all the dev posts but im hoping the intent has been incarna will not come with combat activated but it will be something we will be trying to get in hard after that that being said the impression ive gotten is along the lines of it isnt even on the long term agenda this is a serious consideration to the overall feel of the game i really dont think ccp will keep combat out of stations forever but until i hear otherwise im going to have nightmares of telling my friends we have avatars now they dont really do much and cant even fight but we have them
if i get the op right i believe he is suggesting that the security level of the station doesnt have to equal that of the system as well each station can have multiple deckslocations of varying security level with this idea you could still set up a bar or shop in a station in a station located in 01 sec space but be on the only deck of the station that happens to be 05or perhaps you can hire guards which would effectively create a high sec bubble around your shop or bar of course as the op illustrated and i agree 100 all security needs to be punitive not preventative in order to keep with the philosophy of eve
station security isnt tsa underwear bomber got through level of security were talking about gods who hold enough isk to buy several planets and morea spoon or even a well camouflaged weapon will be easily detected by the highresolution scanners installed in every single wall of the restricted capsuleer area and automated defenses ready to take out any threat and lownullsec those people know even better the lengths one must go to ensure security for the roaming godsunless you move into the commoners area theres really no straightforward way of killing someone and even if there was it would be a suicide op one that might see you sanctioned by concord in ways ship combat wouldnt
just because its not what you want doesnt mean its badspace barbie as you call it can bring many things to eve the point is character creation people want to have an avatar not a picture and hey look at my badass ship that doesnt have a pilotgambling drinking player owned shops and other goodies can be implementedeven stationplanet outpost combatsome of your ideas are ok but basically your a moron which is why it wont happen pvp because im a 1337sauce wardecing alliance is just plain stupidwhat would be fun are like what i saiddrug running shady deals gangs in the slums even if its pve related it could bring much more to evealso think about this suicide ganking in station would be lock boomb headshot a trial could do it combat if any would prolly be pve only
no seriously can we please actually get it deployed first then we can worry about stuff like this
capsuleers are pilots not soldiers theyre not only pilots but ridiculously wealthy pilots so theres absolutely no reason a capsuleer wouldnt have a heavily armed escort thats if the station isnt safebut stations should be safe stations are owned by corporations and they would be incredibly stupid to allow capsuleers to fight each others all the time because if that becomes a game mechanic then it will happen all the damn time ridiculouseve is a harsh place blah blah blah its so harsh that every single aspect of the game must be open for greifing really i cant wait for the day when ccp will delete x number of accounts per day just to prove how harsh eve is cant wait to brag about how awesome i am for playing a game where even your account is not safe im already having an eboneri dont think wis will ever have combat and i dont believe eve needs station combat at all theres enough drama about balance issues and broken game mechanics already we dont need another the game inside the gameas far as i know wis is a social thing first and foremost dont like it then stay in your damn capsule and keep using the good old chat the new character creation tool is amazing and having a complete avatar from head to toe is nice even if i dont intend to socialize with it UFFFD la second lifewhat i would like to see in wis is interactions with important npcs to enhance the pve experience maybe having a dialogue system UFFFD la mass effect but that would be rather ambitious but combat hell no we dont need that theres enough pew pew in this game
my a moron is the cause damn i will totally call in my b or c morons insteadcalling someone a moron only works if you can at least spell the word youre just saying and its pvp because were playing eve online nor is it because i dont like it but because it diverges from the dynamic of eve online and please ive stated several times that a bullet to the head wouldnt have to be fatal on anything but an untanked char itll be deployed soon all that needs to happen for this proposal is that ccp commits to introducing gis at some point its not a demand for the next expansion to have it just for some expansion to have it exactly just for argument lets say every station has 10 decks in highsec youll probably see most stations with 7 highsec decks 2 lowsec decks and one nullsec deck and if you travel out to a 01 space security system you might see 1 highsec deck 6 lowsec decks and 3 nullsec decks or whatever exactly thats why i want a commitment to iterate maybe it takes a year after wis goes live maybe it takes five but i hope not but in either case id like ccp to say yah eventually there will definitely be combat in stations in one form or another not necessarily right now were just dealing with the concept that combat should happen and wis should be iterated upon to that end the specifics of gank versus tank can be hammered out in the designtesting phases theres nothing that says for example that a pilot wearing powered armor and a massive personal shield can be oneshotted by any weapon at all or that pilots wont have a displacer device that makes their actual position look six feet off their actual location until their hologram is shot and discovered to be fake or that headshot damage will actually be counted any differently than shooting someone in a foot just like you cant actually target subsystems in ships now and all damage is simply applied to general shieldarmorstructure hp pools orand sure there should be enough compelling content in stations that theres a reason to undock and risk attack 1 ccp controls the fiction they can writerewrite it easily enough turns out that concord handles all station security who knew eh eh2 again nothing specific evens been designed let alone playtasted yet maybe a pilot with a personal shield in a station cant be oneshotted by anything lighter than a six foot long 50 cal sniper rifle or a plasma cannon and one would think theyre not exactly inconspicuous 3 as my proposal is for pvp and not griefing which is illegal under the eula anyways im not sure what your point is the last thing eve needs is actually a pvp free zone
agree with this gentleman
definitly supporthaving the ability to gank in stations takes nothing away from what we currently have if your docked in a hostile station you still can do everything from the hanger and having decks of different security status regardless of system security means that lowsec stations wont be empty in fact may even be more busy since lowsec and null entities have less need to dec each otherpersonally i would find an fps combat system more amusing than a lock on and hit mmo style combat system purely because of the potential comedy of hitting random passersby and getting concorded even if you were aiming for a legitimate wartarget would give folks the chance to hide in the crowdi would be inclined to suggest giving a second tier to wardecs  the standard wardec only covers shiptoship combat in concord sanctioned space while a second type of wardec maybe 10x the price would permit combat in station as well basically you are paying off not only concord but faction police too if you wanted to get fiddly you could seperate faction areas with the dec as well for example could dec the targets only within caldari stations but not extend it to amarr or dec someone within only empire stations leaving them safe in pirate faction oneshowever its done though a combatless station experience just flies in the face of everything eve is and we need a commitment that combat will be implementated in one way or another at some point
first off you dont understand what ambulation is on a technical levelsecond youre a spaceship pilot when youre in a station you are in a countrys territory you dont have your licence to do as you please anymoreso if you are able to commit murder in a station you should be punished by the owning corp as well this means that depending on the corp politics the punition could be as pathetic as a 1 buy tax incease in a station angel to being unallowed to dock in any of the corps station and have a bounty put on your head any empire navythen maybe you can start talking about the possibility of blowing brains outalso im all for some eventual outofpod action but i still think youre just a  troll with some serious issuesi think you should just play dust
why waste so much time on something that is just an eyecandy marketing ploy
the last thing eve needs is actually a pvp free zoneoh yeah sure we cant have people safely grinding level 4 missions with their pimped out marauders inside stations wait you cant
so the general argument of the no side is along the lines of pvp is icky the definitive scifi universe has safe zones not safer safe it mite beunbalanced and i suck at gamez and supporters should go play dustwish i could support again signed someone who doesnt need a magical safe zone thinks if youre in station ship spinning a smart agent should be able to blow up your pod while you look at the interface and knows that would make him vulnerable to some extent at all times as well if you want to be safe log the expletive out and go play farmville
and i love when people recite lore when they obviously havent even read one of the actual published novels go read the burning age and say you are always immune from someone who wants you dead or worse
truthfully i thought that this would be a very very easy sell i mean more high quality pvp in eve with the type of avatars that so many people seem to want pvp in eve is evidently objectionable to some people its a little bit like going skiing and finding some people protesting against snow ah well as for lore even if some of it didnt fit with this proposal but it does ccp can always rewrite it its their story after all so that argument seems weird itd be like people protesting before red moon rising that players clearly had no capital ships in the lore so capital ships shouldnt be give to the playerbase in before zomg i hate motherships so you are wrongif tomorrow ccp wanted to rewrite it so that concord ships were really crewed by 8 foot tall giant rabbits then hippity hoppity so that its not just a bit of eyecandythank you for your intelligent and thought provoking contribution
this made me laughi am only supporting this silly proposal if we go all the way realistic that is if you get concorded instead of being blown up you are simply incarcerated i want players who try in engage in station ganking to be locked up in a brig for a few weeks without outside data access that is no access to industry market or pi menus no chat no mail no corp functions no fittings not even ship spinning just an icon or avatar in a cell with a countdown until you are released from prison
welcome back ank
this is now a widot thread
thanks again for your work on this treb
and what happened to these were they all declined or the first characters vote was accepted i simply didnt manage to find out whether it was ok to use alts or not logic said it was not but since no such thing was mentioned in the rules i decided to vote with alts as well

it wouldnt make any significant difference and it is important for ccp to have some feedback for historical purposeswith regards stormmasters question about the duplicate ballots they were left in the reason was that while ccp already has the tools to quickly determine the number of unique accounts posting in a thread it would require some extra programming effort to ferret out the ballot box stuffersif it had been a significant amount of votes then i would have asked ccp to clean the ballots of duplicates and this ability may get put on the todo list for future forum updates

im bumping and supporting my own topic because im a douchebagi can almost taste that plexbought pizza
supported if they could be combinedseparated in game or at least activated all at onceseems like a duh feature but this is eve
daysweekmonthwtb year plex as well
signed its about timelet me buy a 1day plex with a charge to my cell and itd be even better
requesting plex for prostitutes in game at least
and if you want to extend your account you just need 30 of them or what ever number ccp comes up withimagines a custom colour scheme by setting 34 colour sliders for ships for 10m a popsigned
i can certainly see what you want but i dont see your solution as particularly goodmicros will only be used for vanity items ccp fears the wrath of the forumz o so creating another level of plex is redundantmuch easier to make current plexes redeem to separate points ie plex  iou and then use said points to buy stuff  same end result but much more malleable
jaja  yes yes
as a young eve player i tried to fly a catalyst efficiently in missions or ratting i really tried but with low sp destroyer are inferior to a good t1 frig kessie and later in the game i couldnt find any fight where it would be better than a lowend cruiser its cheaper allright but i kept repairinglosing themi disagree with removing the high sig a destroyer should be a frigate hunter but unable to fight bigger ship its paperrockscissor thing reallycatalyst needs grid upgrades and either removing the rof penalty or increasing the damage bonus why not
the more value of stuff player have in eve the longer his or hers password is sometimes its so long and tricky that you need written reminder on what is it but there are also exceptionspassword is the only thing which is implemented as precaution against accounts hacksi propose another oneeasy to implement ccp dudes not need to work hard to implement it and it would make many many players happybefore i start with explanations i believe that this shouldnt be mandatory option for all players you could attach pin or notif you do it will limit access of you or someone else to yours assetsfurther elaborationpin protection will cover all your station assets preventing anyone who is logged as you totransfer isk from your wallets personal or corpto cancel or put contracts private or publicto poke yours science tabto even modify your market ordersto trash sell reprocess your items or shipsto see your contacts or notesto do any corp stuff which you could doetcthis prevention will only work for station based resources that you haveso if evil hacker doesnt know your pin he will not be able to sniff yours stuff excluding your ship in space if you did for example log off in spaceyou will need to remember it it will not be secret questions or answer to you retract your pinit can be inserted only 3 times per login if you made mistake tree times you will not be able to type it for 24hr periodyou will still be able to train your skills as you wish without need to type it init will be based on session one time entry of your pin will last as long as you logged in gameyour pin could bea3a4e not only numbers but also letters and caps so it greatly reduces riskand there will be popup window for you to insert it or someone else when that person wish to do something of above for example modify market ordersof course risk will always exist and nothing is perfect defense but it will hopefully prevent at least some headaches which sometimes takes ages and wast resources on yours and ccp part to be relieved updateas proposed down there that authenticator  is also not a bad idea but because some of us have multiple accounts let it be possible to use one that thing for all of ours accountsfurther elaboration i believe that we should be able to get extra safety true pin and all others stuff which will be purchased as many cool objects in eve online storebut dearest lovable hot ccp duded and girls if you do implement this things let it be possible to connect multiple accounts with one authenticator or what is it calledalso if you dont know about what i am talking here and you love kittens feel free to supportfor kittens

im supporting this because believe it or not stolen account issues take up a great deal of cs time in most mmos and i doubt eve is any exception itd probably save ccp money in the long run because of this
i think it would be best to just implement a security token ala wowffxiand many asian mmos
while we are at it why not put a extra password that is send to our cellphones which we have to enter in 60 seconds every time we perform a transaction just keep a complex password with a username something other than your character name or your real name  and you will be just fineadd a couple of  to your password p
if the hacker got the username and password from a keylogger they will know the pin also if they got it from phishing they would as easy convince the user to enter their station pinsorry not supported as it is but yes account security is a big problem and perhaps you could expand it into something else i like the full tilt poker image select option where you have to choose 3 cards you have previously selected from the pack to enter the gamestops keyloggers however unless the images were generated from a users own pc would not stop phishing it also would not stop any recordingremote access software perhaps if the biggest hack access is keylogging something like this might be worth an investment
paying extra for additional security why if you can get it for freenot if you have calculator like box with numbers and letters moving after each digit clicked something like on screen keyboard did you clicked on a number or a letterno program would be able to detect because even if there is programs which can remember position of click not sure on that position would be different number or later every time
add an another password is not going to make it any better or any worsekeyloggers still crack that with no problem at allseriously do you people ever put any effort into thinking about your ideas or do you just toss them around like candyas its been saidphysical token would be appropriate but only if its not forced on youbut imho the only source of the security problem is the human factor not the computer not denying that there are some serious flaws but honestly its the user who refuses to take them with any amount of respect of that fearwhere you gohow you use your computer your habits those are what makes you prone to being attackedthat and making foolish mistakes that people will never admit to doing such as isk buying going to sites without checking for validity using the same usernamepass on an another area of internets list goes on and on and onadding a pin number wont fix it its just an another way to get hacked once again
with that many restriction you would always have to use that extra pin but since its basically just another password it would just mean extra inconvenience for the user with little extra protection because if someone can get your password also getting your pin is a small step what you want is authentication by another method or over another channelbesides password and the like are actually a bad security mechanism you have to reveal the secret every time you use it
yeah this is kinda silly

one more reason to do it again its win or loose if ccp thinks empires would just surrender it just sounds stupid no matter how muh joviantech they haveand now it would be good time for ccp to develope tech 4 to antisansha navy or they make us all like moose hunted down using gps as my father does in rlor otherwise they ccp will make big mistake
abdul4finland you must understand that true slave ships are far superior to normal shipstrue slave ts ships will destroy the navy due to the ts simply being extremely effectivenear perfectthe only real opponent to the ts are the capsuleers  normal people gets wtfpwnedit took the combined effort of the 4 empires several months to take down the sansha nation thats some serious resistance theyve met no matter how you put it
eh how come we then destroyed if not hundred but at least many dozens of those in provi in anomalies plexes just with few bs and lesser support while at same time taking fire from other kind of sansha bsare you saying ccp has made those sitting targets now harderthat would just be stupidas i said just couple bs and perhaps bcUFFFDs even cruisers and frigs for similar sanshaships killed dozens of sansha bs in anomalies including ts at the last spawn how would it be different now if navyUFFFDs sanshafleet would consist from several similar bs etc but in greater numbersas i suggested this sanshanavy would consist from regular capsuleers who join that sansha navy in hope of big rewards bounties and loot big enough rewards compared to risks and navy would grow really fast and bigit took the combined effort of the 4 empires several months to take down the sansha nation thats some serious resistance theyve met no matter how you put itbut in any case even as war will last long again all battles will be localised not all sanshaUFFFDs attack at the same time on same areaso from there we come into my idea strong enough antisansha navyfleet in highsec that can jump directly into spot of sanshaspawn with help of concord covering their back for player vs player attacks one at time again and again
those of us who were against plex for remap were not against it because the game didnt have it when we startednice attempt at a troll though you rock opno really i mean that you are like totally amazing  like sliced bread you are
please do explain exactly why you were against iti for one do not understand the objection i am not trolling and seriously would like to see a presented argument against themi didnt realise what the assembly hall was until today and the learning skill death i really wish i knew about it before as in my mind plex for remaps was an excellent ideai have had a good look around this forum ah only thing i can see relevant is tamber suggesting that mts are bad while totally ignoring the fact that there is rmt sanctioned by ccp through plex and character trading is also sanctioned so basically plex for remaps is a micro transaction and since microtransactions are bad plex for remaps is bad am i understanding this is the reason plex for remaps was cancelled
i have a questionwhen the learning goes will everyones attributes return to stand plus implants or will current remaps stand if they are set to standard will we get a free remap to readjust like wise will we get a remap to reset our attributes to a more standard fit should the removal of learning skills overbalance our toon to much
i dont necessarily care about mts themselveshowever remaps allow a definable in game advantage over the other players in terms of faster training speed due to attribute adjustments in a game i pay a monthly fee for i think i should be able to compete against every other player on an even basis in terms of the game mechanics i have access toyou want plex for paintjobs or plex for fancy hats or plex for hookers  fine because none of that affects my ability to access a game mechanic on an equal basis with you plex for remaps violates that rule because were basically saying that those with more disposable income deserve to have more advanced characters in terms of core mechanics ie skill points than people who say have kids to feed or mortgages to pay this is exactly the reason i dont play f2p games like evony
well as malcanis law states whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of new players that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer older playersby this logic the learning skills removal things should be a boon to the vets or maybe i m misunderstanding the law
i understand where you are coming from but that is easily solved by sayingisk for remap400mil per remap double it every remap resets after a yearisk sinkthe training time increase isnt zomgwtfpwnzor for that priceand blahblahblahwas a good idea like learning skill removal is an amazing idea yet againover 900000000 threads are poping up about it being an issue or they arent doing it right or wtf i just bought the skills out a wooping 25milits stupid let ccp run the game unless its obvious it wont work or needs tweaking an example of this is the new super carrier it takes more time to train but is being said to be worse then the current scs it needs tweaking
bad idea 1 remapyear for all good riddance to learning skills
now you see this is what i dont getif someone has real life money in abundance they can already gain a massive advantage over you through gtcs or if someone is very well established in game they can purchase premades from the character bazaar to further increase their iskhour there are hundreds of thousands of characters in the game each at different stages of skill training you already have an advantage over lots of them through your training and you are already disadvantaged against some by their trainingif there is a character out there with equal skills isk and time spent in game and they decide to remap to go down a different route how is that going change disadvantage you or in anyway alter my previous paragraph also would you even care about this hypothetical toon you will probably never meet him and if you did how would you know what he didyou would still have exactly the same opportunities to remap and as plex are quite expensive it is something people would have to weigh up do i purchase a plex for 400million to save 5 days training over the next month or notetc etchowever the benefits of the remaps in my eyes totally outweigh any slight possibly imagined disadvantagesplayers could remap if they get bored of their professions or if they mess up there remap the argument that mistakes should be punished i agree with however spending an entire year with substandard training speed i think is just slightly over the top they would still be punished with having to buy a plexsomeone might decide rather than buy that shiny new faction ship i will think longer term and remap now the learning skills have gone this is about a as good a substitute for them that there is i support getting rid of learning skills btwwell what is done is done and thanks for trying to explain 
actually a majority of the veteran players are pretty happy at this change not really bitter at allcomparing the removal of training skills to the removal of mt for remaps is idiotic plex remaps were opposed because it started the dangerous trend of allowing a very tangible in game advantage in exchange for real money not something i ever want to see in a game i pay for all readyi also dont particularly care for character purchasing but its not as offensive as the plex for remap idea wasanyhow this thread is pretty much just more whining about an issue thats all ready decided and doesnt really belong on ah
has anyone figured out what the op is actually proposing yet
you wonder that too huh
bitter vets you say thats getting a bit worn now i think emo noobs
so ive been pondering this subject for several months now i believe i have a solutions that could help i am a corp ceo myself and i have had this problem amongst myself and my memberscorp hanger containersthis would essentially be a freight container with a password and be repackageable small enough to be moved around in an industrial ship this would solve a huge security problem with pos corp hangers and enable each member to have their own space without worry of others taking their equipment this item can not be launched or anchored this is primarily for pos corp hangers it has little use in station corp hangersessentially this is a very simple fix just the addition of one item that is already very similar to existing items just in case anyone is about to complain a corp ceodirector would have unlimited access to these for purpose of moving or tearing down posesupdatesome recommended stats would bedescriptiona massive cargo container used for corporate member storage most commonly used in corporate hanger arraysattributesmass1000000 kgcapacity100000 m3volume100000 m3 5000 m3 packaged
almost forgot to support my own idea
or so you think perhaps this is highgrade trolloh btw idea not supported
tldr  do not let eve turn intoproper textremoving learning skill is unfair towards those people who invested time and patience into developing them some people invested into presence 5 even though they had low charisma attribute the reason they did it  is because they planned in advance that they would want to train for leadership skills in the future so they accepted lower training rate in return for future benefit this decisionmaking was possible because ccp had a set of defined rules which prescribes how game will be in the number of years down the road right now time spent doing this seems like a waste certainly there were similar examples in the past when ccp changed all probes a lot of people lost money on their blueprints and being a reasonable person i am willing to accept that certain changes are necessary for progression of the game however there should be a line beyond which ccp should not go eve online is all about decision making you todays decisions affect your future but that is only possible if rules are unchanged and clear the way it looks now is that ccp keeps changing those rules that habit can have adverse consequencesat least part of eves success is attributable to the fact that ccp has extremely loyal base of subscribers such changes as remaps plex for remaps removal of learning skills will move game to more casual domain but will dilute base of hardcore loyal players hence ccp will have higher volatility of cash flows and higher turnover of player do not move into that direction not bending to general market trend does not mean you are becoming dinosaurs rather that company is choosing its own path for successvote for no to removing learning skillshere is the opposite thread feel free to check with supporters of learning skills removal
support
all attributes gets 12 base  normal learning skill bonusall sp in learning skills are released and can be applied anywhere you wanti have gone through the blog and have to agree with the icelandic alcoholics they actually thought this one out pretty thoroughlysystem will be easier to understand and new players read alts will be able to train useful skills soonermy biggest problem is going to be deciding where i should use the 2m sp that will be freed up
completelly unrelated comment without any argument
i made this choice and the sacrifice i am also happy to see the skills go they are really really stupid we already received years of training at increased speeds and now we can take our useless sp and stick it into something better
way better argument however than saying because you suffered them everyone else should suffer them too should we also make for everyone that their first expansion had the habbit of deleting bootini because i suffered it everyone should suffer italso eve player base has nothing to do with loyalty but with having no alternative for internet spaceships in open universe and the vast majority of the long term players read bittervets see this as a good change
how can an ontopic comment unrelated even on my third read through of your post i cannot see what your argument is or even what it is you are aiming for my guess is that you skimmed the blog and panicked go back and read it again and youll see that there is no cause for alarm
learning skills are a big waste of time it is a very big turn off for new players when they find out they have to train a month worth of learning skills or else they will pay the consequences in the end those who spent all those learning skills lose nothing u get your skill points reimbursed
hot damn can you guys imagine if eve combat was as cool as asteroidsthats my next proposal right there
too late get over itthe old order changeth yielding place to new and god fulfills himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world  tennysonand god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away  rev 214
because you are stupid and will be treated as such
i suffered through it  and i found it to be very stupidwhenever i tried to get friends with jobs to play this game the learning skills were a huge turnoff good riddance ty gamedesign decision awesome job ccp
supportthe character will train trade skills so how much they are necessarythe character will train learning skills so how much they are necessary is a completely similar statements reasons in both skill group trainings also fully equal
i think you are spitting into the wind here the csm were pushing for learning skills to be changed or removed themselvesthey are a big detractor from early enjoyment of the game which is where it counts with regards to player retention eve should be complex but the complexity should not be at the expense of funand yes i trained learning at the start although not exclusively and will be getting 5m sp to allocate
huh wtf are you trying to say some grammar would be handy to make yourself understandable anyway if i am going to guess what you are going at everyone had to train learning skills directly in the beginning there was no serious choice trading skills are an option you can do that it costs time but you can do stuff perfectly fine without them i got 50m sp and lousy trading skills and the reason they are lousy and not absolutely horrible was that i wanted to do some trading in null sec then we got kicked out so i didnt even use them ever and no you cant do stuff perfectly fine without learning skills
its too late trying to change it now theyve already decided on it i for one am glad learning skills were such a stupid idea and the last thing you really want to be doing is training these skills for a month or so just for the long term benefit when youre on a trial account you want to get in a nice shiny new ship as quickly as possible not worry about training these ridiculous learning skills well done ccp for finally getting rid of them and for allowing us to use any invested points into supplementing our other skills i do have one question about spending these points will you be able to train multiple skills up to level iv if you so choose and not be forced to put them all into a couple of level v skills anyone can answer that if they know
i am all for removing learning skillsthey are just there to ruin the gaming experience for the new playersand with the method ccp is applying it it will be fair for those who invested time for itat least it will be worth the time i had invested in them
if anything its unfair for those that didnt train themplayer a trained learning gets millions of extra skillpoints for the time they had them trained gets millions of extra skillpoints for the reembursement for their susposed loss more about reduction of tears then balanceplayer b didnt train learning gets no retroactive bonus has no real skillpoints to reemburseplayer a comes out with a double bonusthe way this is designed has little to do with balance and everything to do with crowd control
being rude in your topic doesnt really get you anywhere m8however not supported main reason is new players dont want to train learning they just want to get into a ship and do something useful not spending there whole tutorial training 2 monthes of skills and to the people that learned them they get them back so who cares i for one enjoy it i invested 2 monthes to get 53m sp it did me well now i can do those dreddit skills that take a month to do something new for some its a turn off but the game has to be new player friendly
so what you are really saying is i had to waste time to train these skills yet despite the fact this change is not going to affect me i will be happier if others also have to go through this burden because i had to 
simplificationwithout loosers there is also no victorsremoving those skills removes yet another nice competition from the game which is sad

i completely disagree with your topic and do not support iti have trained all learning skills on multiple accounts and do not feel it is unfair in the least heck i even created this character origionally with chr 3 and very balanced stats for what i anticipated to be many years of training i still trained presence all the way to 5 because you never knowremaps still required some amount of thought because of the one year limit on switching it allowed players who have played the game for years that wanted to switch it up the chance and allowed for newer players to make a mistake that would not last an eternity because in the end it is a game if you came to just train skills then yes remaps and the removing of learning skills might lead you to leave the game for most of us we tend to play for the sandboxsocialtradeindustrypvpiskmakingbecause i still think missions are boring as hell parts of the gameany idiot who is a hardcore player that leaves because of this good riddance learning skills had pretty much no value to the experience of playing eve any reasoning person could see that if they intended to play the game for any period of time it was nearly a requirement to train the learning skillsthey dont add anything to the game it only detracts people who might genuinely enjoy and contribute to the game from getting any further than the trial because having to train learning skills at some point just to train actual skills has always been a negative aspect of the gameeve is more than complex and harsh enough in aspects of its gameplay to fit the hardcore players without forcing them to train learning skills to get to what they enjoy
eve may be all about griefing people but for that to be fair it requires that an intelligent competent player can avoid being griefed but not so with the learning skills  either a newbie griefed himself by training them instead of something useful or he griefed himself by not training them and instead suffered from ty attributesgood riddance
please link for me where ccp says they will never alter the game to make it bettershould ccp also remove all balancing they have done in the last 6 years remove capital ships remove invention remove t2 remove officer gear remove faction warefare remove soverienty remove pos remove exploration sites remove wormholes remove pi sorry if you feel you have been nerfed in some way but you really havntyou will be given back all the points you put into learning you have not lost that trainingstop selfishly worrying about your own person situation and start thinking about what makes eve a better game
not supported solution looking for an issue learning skills are cancer and cancer needs to be removedas it will begood riddance
shut up get out give stuff
every player in eve is allowed to make stupid mistakes some examples  people who didnt train their learning skills or far too low people who trained unnecessarily high like youccp is now correcting that mistake for you and you get a big bag of sp as a bonus so my advice to you is to deal with it
confirming this is the best course of action
i cant shoot the roids i support this idea asteroids returnsoh and to the op no compromise is going to make someone unhappy always this time its you and not me next time im sure it will be flipped around
reported op for personal attacks and trollingseriously people seriously lack the ability to read and or understandread the effing dev blog nooblet and you just might get somewhereive trained the learning skills upand i wasted all that time on thembeen playing 2 years you dont see me crying over it why because they are giving me those sps to use elsewhereif it wasnt for that little detail and the fact we are getting 12s id be a little edbut honestly this is the best way to do it imhoand i was in favor of learning skillsthose who chose to not invest the time in it well tough at least your getting 12sso seriously stfu and deal with it or gtfo because this is far better than just removing the skillsat least ccp actually put some time and effort into this ill give them credit for that much now if they could just fix their gameall i see here is a spazzing emoraging noob who has no idea what hes talking about hope you quit and give me your stuff  o p
quotin dis
this thank god the learnings are going away
speaking as someone with 5376000 learning skill spthe op can go suck an egg
710 op got some real hate flowing
new chars gets a set of learning skills lets say basic at 4 and advanced at 3just that simple but actually i think its better than other to complicated onesconsequences1 new players can start a game immediatly without spending time on useless learling skills2 for other players there will be nothing to concern about3 there is still be a possibility to gain a small advantage in training speed for those who caresthats all just that simple
apparently you didnt get the memolearning skills dont exist anymore as of dec 14th
id rather have my 2mill sp thank you very much
memo
i dont know if this is even possible but when i am flying through space toward something or stopped somewhere most of the time the sun is right in my eyes now many of you will say that i should just turn away except that that would also turn me away from what im looking at such as a gate so what i propose is an option to turn the sun off at the very least reduce the glare it puts out this is perfectly suitable to a game of internet spaceships that have mastered warp drive but for some reason dont have filtered viewports or cameras
i wouldnt mind the suns being a bit dimmed or at least having the option to do so supported
very supported also dim down nebulae holy  they made those bright
when i started they were almost blinding still sort of are needs to be added
as someone who uses the sun as a probing point a 1000 times yes
oh god yes i support both ideas give an option to dim the sun and another do dim nebulae and other blinding objects in space
i pray for this ability around 7 am every gd morning
i have run into this as wellsupported
wont hurt anyone that does not want to use it supported
supporting my own idea for making eve a better place to fly serious spaceships with no sun glarealso thank you for the supports so far it is appreciated
but what would light your solar systemseve would be pitch black with only station and ship lights if not for the suns for the systems dimming for sure turning off no
sorry for the informal way i will be posting this is my first time getting involved in the forumsintro one of the things that actually got me to play this wonderful game that is known to be eve are the videos that are on youtube videos such as eve online day of darkness and the ccp made trailers really inspires a player to stop whining about the difficulty of the game the horrid learning cliff but in many of these videos the longer engine trails are intacti have played for around 6 months and i was wondering when i would get this fantastic engine trail that looked awesome but recently i have found out that it was a feature that was taken out due to its new code not functioning as ccp would like it too proposal bring back the longer engine trails previous dev post says that it is on ccps list of things to do and this is just a reminder that at least me wants the longer engine trails back my request is to add them to be functional with an option to turn the effect on and off thus players who are bothered by the improper functions of the engine trail can turn it off and others who enjoy such a feature can keep it onprosmakes eve seem much more streamlined like it adds a vital visual interest for new playerssome players want velocity vectors this can be such a tool if created properlyconsadditional work for ccppossible performance issues and improper allocation of the engine trailsbring the engine trails back i miss them
we all miss themit was engine trails that made me train for interceptors way back in the dayone of these days
me wants them engine trails tt tired of looking all slowyou know without these engine trails it looks like the ship is standing still and just the environment was moving  is what it looked like the first time i played i thought it was stupid and quit the trial came back a year later when i was introduced to videos with the engine trails xd
heck yesreally really want this
also wantif not brought back fly your ship around with 10 hull left that looks pretty 
must be the 100st proposal for this
first off this is not a rage thread about learning theyre changing it and we cant do anything about itafter thinking about the learning skills and realizing its only aiding new players which is good but sort of hurting the old players all the sp missed from not having maxed learning right off the bat dumb training ive thought of something else related to allocating skill points that can benefit older players toonow even though i dont consider myself a veteran im only about 1 year old and i feel i havent made any dumb decisions on training i did learning right off the bat and ive specialized in only 1 ship and little else i think there should be a way to make up for the skill points you wasted on dumb stuff this would benefit older players that made mistakes and since theyre not getting all the sp they could of had at least they can get rid of stuff they tried and realize wasnt the best route for thembasically you would be able to pick a skill and bring down the sp on it to your liking and put it in something else ive thought it out and there are some cons with it right off the bat it screams easy pvp switching someone saw you dock in a domi hell change your sp and come out in a raven so there are some ideas i came up with to deal with thisi think this should either be a one time thing or a once a year thing like the remap this would avoid the obvious problems and still allow players to change as they go sort of like remaps doany input or suggestions are more than welcome thank you very much
so skill point remappingwhat an original idea how about no
well im not a year old like you but i also trained by learning skills up first thing thanks to advise from a veteran friend personally i think its a find compromise since i get my points back and those points will get me close to my t2 guns sounds like merry christmas to me
like i said im not a veteran so i dont know if its come up before just something ive been thinking aboutmay i ask why you say no constructive criticism is good criticism
will you please tick that you support thanks
better idea reverse trainingyou pick a skill to untrain it untrains at twice the speed that it would train as it untrains the sp get put back into the pool which you can then redistribute elsewhere you cant train and untrain at the same timeitd allow rectification of old mistakes without being blatantly exploitable
dont you think if it was a once a year thing it wouldnt be exploitable
well it would allow sudden change you could overnight go from elite miner to highend mission runner sure the change would only occur once a year but itd still be exploitable of course you could impose further restrictions buteven besides that its also too limited what is the purpose of these skill remaps to rectify mistakes rectifying mistakes only once a year is a bit off and using it as a means to alter your character well that shouldnt be the point in most games it would but eve is pretty heavily based around specialization allowing drastic changes of profession in a short time would do a bit of damage to that concept and it is pretty key
right but it would allow to better specialize and also it does help with mistakes and wasted training sort of the same path on the removal of learning skillsthe problem i see with the training is it adds even more time and this is to benefit the players especially the older ones that had trained up skills either due to mistakes or the fact that they had too before the skill queuei do see where youre coming from though thank you for the input
in the long run mistakes are simply stepping stones for other activities that or they are learning experiences how else would you know that mining is boring unless you actually trained up for those t2 lasers with anticipation only to watch the slightly faster light show when it comes to mistakes being i trained the wrong weapon system well people may have ditched projectiles only to later regret it or rockets assuming this fix is on that same level there really arent training mistakes as there are no training ceilings
the only bad sp investment in eve is multitasking
i understand i still think there should be a way for the older players to be able to redeem some of their skill points since theyre not gaining the skill points retroactive to training their learning skills and it would also benefit everyone if its once a year
i fail to see a major issue with what ccp is doing vets had learning trained so they were getting more sp anywaysmore vets didnt max learning anywaysall sp is being refunded and tbh thats a few mil sp will be amazing for vets and noobs alikealso didnt they say they are removing the 16m sp boost so how are new players at a new advantage its no more wasteing time training learning
learn to read nubseriously the op is obviously a blind trollthe dev blog was very clear about thisif you have taken the time to train those skills you get those sps backeveryone regardless gets 12 attribute points across the board in absence of the learning skillshow the hell does that hurt older pilots this could have been much worsestop trolling and making a mountain out of a damn molehillps youve only played a yearand you feel you should speak for older pilots scuse me who asked you 2 year old
unfortunately eve players do not drink milk they drink battery acid with ground glass mixed in for fiber
proposal  get out
see what i mean this is just a stupid process for appeasing the stupid and the pseudointellectual meat get rid of them
im afraid i can not find fault with the csm because ccp doesnt listen to them enough the fact is they are doing exactly what we elected them for to bring our concerns to ccp what ccp chooses to do after that is out of csms control i might suggest you aim your anger towards ccp for not listening to the will of the people
seems trolling in the ah forums is considered normal now too op  in case youre not trolling go screw yourself
this would be contradictory to the statements i made about the democratic process
the csm have to pass this for it to go into effect you know i dont think theyll pass it
too lateyou just said you where wrong and stupidso much for not contradicting yourself 
no im pretty sure i used it correctly considering that you actually started talking about whining carebears when ive never quite seen a carebear that cries as much as you have in this thread i know
please indicate on the doll where exactly trebor touched you that felt naughtyseriously ive seen better trolls on the back of my cereal box and i dont even eat cereal anymore
you may very well be right on two points1 every single person is an idiot not to mention what comes out them gathering 2 you are a greater person than any of us else isdits already been mentionned that emoraging is precisely what youre achieving here pwhat my proposal is is that you take your proposal for yourself and quit putting your ideas forward here since you hate this place how i love circular thinking dpredating on what dont pirates pride themselves to be great predators in the first placedo i sense some kind of mama too many big guys they wont let me be the tough one anymore  in short dont you just blame pvp for your failing at it pthis thread will achieve nothing dissolve it in humour and absolutely no offense meant to the op for i stupid as i am think this is all about roleplaying to those who percieve it as troll a little bit of shame on you for you should know better than feeding it phowever if by any chance this is roleplaying indeed im not sure were still actually in the sandboxi really dont know the least of it but i heard sometime or read somewhere that this is a pillar of the mullahs regimen 1 that only the wise should be given a voice is it something you would like to promote1 i translate litteraly from a french common expression and without any derogatory motive for 10 minutes ago i didnt even know that the word mullah became overused by us heretics out of contemptedited a typo out
fixed that for you on the op the darn ship is called a black ops in the real world these are the guys that get in and out generaly with out the opponent knowing they are there till its to late fast forward to todays state of the art black ops platform an you have a overpriced paperweight with no real function other than just for fun situations
so with 2 bos youd be able to bring blockade runners from one side of eve to the other in a single jump and then back again you simply need that upgrade on each side and if you limit it to 1alliance you can still have 2 bos from 2 different alliances fleet up and do ithow about no
well transwarp mod can be like 10mins for covopbomber 20mins for recons 30mins for black ops then like 1 hour for blockade runners moreover you can easily set it so an alliance can only have 1 transwarp pos mod and black ops portal only works for same alliance even then with the delays its hardly workable as you describe
black op discussioni would like to reform your idea into something better covert ops bridge module that works like a covert cyno but u need 2 of them fitted on 2 black ops one on one side and the other on the otherside once connected this creates a portal true a black hole a rupture in space continuum that can only support a x amount of mass 50000m3 or so this recuires only fuel to start up the bridge xx amount lets say 1000 racial fuel for each bo range is unlimited bridge last for 1 minut
no
proposal hostile wrecks in empire spaceproposal to change the mechanic where if you kill someone the wreck has no aggression rights from you allowing you to defend what is your loot it has tractor rights much like a can or npc wreck but no aggression timer this creates an entirely risk free way to generate iskexamples ninja salvage in missionsif you grab a wreck in a mission you get mission runner aggressioncan flipping you can steal cans to grant yourself a monetary gain but there again is an aggression timerin closing in a game where there are zero risk free ways to make isk why does this loop hole still exist where there is ownership of a wreck to the killer and no safeguard allowing them to atleast strike back at people that take what they have earnedalso there is a disturbing trend developing of highsec bots in populated areas that are macroing lootaddedccp incognito ninja salvaging is intended game play it was always intended that the wrecks are public the loot is private
marine salvage lawmarine salvage is the process of rescuing a ship its cargo or other property from peril salvage encompasses rescue towing refloating a sunken or grounded vessel or patching or repairing a ship today the protection of the environment from cargoes such as oil or other contaminants is often considered a high prioritysalvors are seamen and engineers who carry out salvage to vessels that are not owned by themselves and who are not members of the vessels original crew when salvaging large ships they may use cranes floating dry docks and divers to lift and repair ships for short journeys to safety towed by a tugboat the aim of the salvage may be to repair the vessel at a harbour or dry dock or to clear a channel for navigation another reason for salvage may be to prevent pollution or damage to the marine environment alternatively the vessel or valuable parts of the vessel or its cargo may be recovered for its resale value or for scrapsalvage law has as a basis that a salvor should be rewarded for risking his life and property to rescue the property of another from peril salvage law is in some ways similar to the wartime law of prize the capture condemnation and sale of a vessel and its cargo as a spoil of war insofar as both compensate the salvorcaptors for risking life and property1 the two areas of law may dovetail for instance a vessel taken as a prize then recaptured by friendly forces on its way to the prize adjudication is not deemed a prize of the rescuers title merely reverts to the original owner but the rescuing vessel is entitled to a claim for salvage2 likewise a vessel found badly damaged abandoned and adrift after enemy fire disabled her does not become a prize of a rescuing friendly vessel but the rescuers may claim salvage3a vessel is considered in peril if it is in danger or could become in danger examples of a vessel in peril are when it is aground or in danger of going aground prior to a salvage attempt the salvor receives permission from the owner or the master to assist the vessel if the vessel is abandoned no permission is neededthe amount of the award depends on in part the value of the salved vessel the degree of risk involved and the degree of peril the vessel was in legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights to reduce the amount of a claim after an accident boat owners or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel they do everything possible to minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in if another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not applysome maritime rescue organisations such as britains royal national lifeboat institution insist the crews of their lifeboats renounce their right to claim compensation for salvagejetsam are goods that were thrown off a ship which was in danger to save the ship flotsam are goods that floated off the ship while it was in danger or when it sank ligan or lagan are goods left in the sea on the wreck or tied to a buoy so that they can be recovered later by the owners derelict is abandoned vessels or cargoin the united kingdom under the merchant shipping act 1995 jetsam flotsam lagan and all other cargo and wreckage remain the property of their original owners anyone including recreational divers and beachcombers removing those goods must inform the receiver of wreck to avoid the accusation of theft as the leisure activity of wreck diving is common there are laws to protect historic wrecks of archaeological importance and the protection of military remains act 1986 protects ships and aircraft that are the last resting place of the remains of members of the armed forcesthe 1910 brussels convention for
they have a point 
not supported stealth suic ganker buffthe wreck already has an owner he whose wreck it is ganking someone makes you no more the owner of his wreck than murdering someone makes you the owner of someones statethe proposal is devoid of merit or logic and is obviously self serving
you cant undock after suiciding allowing you to burn off a 15min aggro timer from a gankerthis is more directly related to legitimate pvp in empire space
what about the other 15 artillery tempests floating around if in your corpalliance wouldnt they get rights to protect the loot from your legitimate empire pvp
no
not supported incorrect premise there is an owner of the wreck it should be the killed there is no reason the wreck should belong to the killer and this would encourage even more suicide ganking
whats that nerf salvaging proposal number 1234556677879nops use eve search to find the better replies on the older triespps ccp did removed that salvaging causes flagging roughly 3 months after salvaging was introduced you might want to read up on it and why that happened
this has been a problem for a long time it would make more sense if the person who shot the ship also got agression to the person who stole it or if there was a cooldown timer  for example 30 seconds  to everyone but the victim and the members of the corp who shot itit unfair that this is not the case
yep you get a point stasis web and enough heat to make the kill you take the risk and hope his mates arent close  your reward  an empty wreck cause a guy hangs off the tail of the wartarget and loots it before you can get close enough theres enough mercs outthere who go through the same scenario  its time to put it right surely
ccp uses the marine salvage law as a refference read it carefully posted aboveas for ownership of the the wreck ccp did change it so the aggressor may tractor beam the wreck if they went this far they should follow the law to the tthis calls for an aggression timer its quite clear
not supported
this isnt actually about salvage at all its about wreck lootthanks for reading
without doubt ccp has decided to go the path of blizzardblizzard made changes to its game that has cost them 1000s of players dropping there accounts and returning to other games this seems to be the path ccp has decided to take blizzard hopes to regain the accounts with its new expansion and one must also belive ccp hopes the same as it destroys its game play by removing skills how does this improve the game play  i see it as a negative effect and although i enjoy eve i also enjoyed blizzard yet i never renewed accounts with blizzard i understand one players opinion means little to ccp yet i also rememeber eas mmos space game and player makeing opinions about game changes which lead to total boycotte of there products it took them years to overcome it these are facts you can check for yourself one of the great playing facets of eve is the decision to train in what and when it effects every thing you decide to do ingame from tradeing to the pvping how can you replace something as intergal as the skills option  for me it seems this will be a sad year the lose of a truely massive gameing platform  btw best of the holidays for all 
eve is going nowhere but up
thisalso 11 skills being dropped how many more will be added in the upcoming expansions
if you really stop playing eve because theres no more learning skills all i can say iswhat
i dont see a suggestion in fact it looks more like a rant a barely coeherent one at that reportedplz dont forget to contract me your stuff before you leave for wow
i too am argleblargleaaaafnrdtghtbihtdfgkhdsfkghdfl
because you see making new players train skills that make them better at training skills is an integral part of a spaceship combat game and now ccp have ruined everything
2m sp to spend now after this update is fine by me despite the isk for the books and the sp differential lossyes i see your point with the loss in the learning skills however eve has reached a turning point with the growing player base there are fewer people who will tolerate investment games vs playing games this is a move to help ccp retain the player base of new pilots it was either this or microtransactions lesser of two evils imo
posting to confirm your tears are delicious yum
im happy because we get to see an another moron leave the gameibl  o p
oh my god what are you talking about
here is where i stopped reading and caringalso ib4l
its a mistake del it please
ok so i really like your plans for the learning skills gg ccp very simple change thats satisfied everyone except the stupidest of noobs and most bitter of vets in the interest of quick and easy changes that streamline the experience of character development read less waiting for more pvp i would like to propose the idea of removing all 15 implants and removing the attribute modifiers from the other slot one through five implants while keeping the stat bonuss and set bonuss whether or not ccp wants to couple this with a  to everyones attributes 5 would keep the minmax sphour the same is at their discretion although i support it entirely what does this do positivenegative seeing as how everyone gets cybernetics 5 and 5 implants asap as with the learning skills read mandatory train it keeps with the spirit of the current changes being implemented all  stat bonuss and set bonuss snakes slavesetc would remain the same so customization of your character remain unchanged it would simply allow more newer players to engage in pvp in all regions of space without the fear of being podded and losing alot of isk 5 set is 50000000000 which is notably harder for newer players to acquire than it is for older players obvious counterpoint yes you can get jumpclones and save those 5s in your mission system for grinding iskies for pvp as a new player you still have to learn to have jumpclones learn about proper use of them find someone with standings to help you or get ready for a long grind and then most people still put 23s in their pvp clones to mitigate the sphour their losing from being in the 5 clone i would suggest that any current work around for this issue requires either significant time isk or insider knowledge none of which should be necessary for newer players to get out and pvp this is the same antichoice that learning skills wereinformed counterpoint yes this would slightly reduce the largest isk sink in the game tho with a little work you could easily add implants to the current lp stores if that gives an incentive to add more  stat bonus implants then all the better that would actually increase the largest isk sink read good for the economy and increase the amount of customization between characters major contention ccp would have to come up with a way to mitigate the problem of people who currently own implants although it would cause some strife i would like to think this would be another change that would be welcome considering it would improve everyones gameplay experience although anyone stockpiling them would obviously need some kind of payment read yes their worth a small fortune read because you have to have them read no choice  bad sandboxending point any serious pvper would still have a full ten set of implants to modify whatever ship heshe uses so it would keep with the current risk vs reward without bordering on causing xenophobia for newer playerstldr remove attribute implants more pvp for everyonebut really read it think about it respond with positive criticism please i spent an hour making this idea decent for you to read i have a feeling this idea is going to be flamed if you understand the idea though its not a reduction in gameplay its not dumbing anything down its actually a chance to expand on customization it simply allows in the process to open up pvp to more casual and newer players this idea can be adjusted this is a framework for the overall concept that ccp would work on please support the topic and keep it bumped if you feel this has any merit i would really like the opinion of the council andor of any developers that may be lurking aboutthank you for your time sorry for the wall of text hope this happens soon more yar for the newbs
okay no sorry im one of the biggest antilearningskills guys on eve but the key is that i recognize where they start and endlearning skills are key because theres no actual reason not to get them you get them you train them youre set for life barring clone stupidity implants dont do this you can lose them thats a big deal you can train faster but its risky if you want to negate that risk you have to sit in your station all day its a gameplay choice and its actually an interesting one sure you can keep jump clones about but you can only do that once every 24 hours and you dont benefit from the implants when theyre not in your headalso i sincerely doubt 5s are even a tenth as common as learning skills are
this is a good suggestion and i support it
op fail as mentioned before  implants are different many use them not just as attribute modifiers but also as sets to give people bonusesplease get into your ship and activate self destruct do it for your pod too
bad ideai dont support this
huh i know of no one that are not planning on using command implants who train cybering 5 then again i live outside of the concord sphere of influence so poddings are a part of my daily routineif your goal is to reduce the isk sink involved in podding then a much better solution is to cut the jumpclone standing requirement taking it down to 5 from the current 8 would allow all but the newest of players to have at least one jc to use when they feel the need to go weekend warrior
i would say obvious troll on the other hand you never can be sure
terrible idea i understand what you want though but this isnt the way to do it
btw i stated that set bonuss would remain the same so you sir definitely didnt readactually this change wouldnt affect me at all i have the isk to buy a new set of implants when i get podded its an earnest suggestion for newer playersi dont think many of you actually read the whole thing and gave it some thought it may not be perfect but the point is to get more people engaging in all different kinds of pvp also this change would increase the isk sink in getting podded by adding new set bonus implants for the one through five slots also adding more customization but my original post said as much
do not supporti like to pod someone knowing he has 5 implants
so now youd be enjoying podding someone with a full slave set and slots six through ten full of expensive  implants nothing would change as far as that goes read it all or dont post
wowi should be amazed this only took one day for someone to start on this but im actually not
another person that didnt bother to read this is not taking anything away or dumbing anything down i have tried to keep my opinions out of this thread personally i would make the game alot harder no one has had any constructive arguments or thoughts
wrong and a pitiful attempt
looks like were gonna have to nuke it from orbit
to the op if you want them removed i suggest you unplug yours and train like that the rest of us will keep ours in and be happier for it
you took a long time to get to the trolli dont see how encouraging newbs to offer themselves as targets because they wont lose an implant will change game behavioreacs is available for the noobs that need jcs to protect the implants even you can use the service barring alacta hasnt read your troll implants are head rigs for a reasoni want to vote no to this idea
what is this about againall i saw was a rant about how expensive they areyou know what honestly they are not as expensive as they seemthere are ways to get them for cheaper you knowbut its a little too obvious the op is just full of himself and hasnt really thought about ittoo obvious def a troll
everyone who supported removal of learnings should support this excellent proposal by op
this idea is fail learning implants  learning skills
my problem with implants has to do with how pirate implants dont have 4 and 5 versions
i actaully thing the current missions should be randomdifferent ships  different type of resistances and even random warp scramblersthe fact that someone can go to a webpage to see exactly how to kill a pocket  which pocket  and which ship to take last is a bit sillythats my opinion on current missions  but i like the idea of new player made ones too
good daywhen we fighting or mining puts a target on a square and a line through the entire displaysquer i understand it well but the line is unnecessary when you are mining this is annoyingis there any option to repeal the lines but retention in the squareif it can not be done this is perhaps the eve developers to create such an opportunity
maybe it will be part of the most requested item in the csm prioritizationfix the uiits not like ccp hasnt thought of this before either watch the butterfly or dominion video for a tease of what an alternate ui might be like

background the algorithm used in the vote counting for the issue prioritization is suboptimal as measured by voting criteria in addition to failing a number of basic voting criteria it also places restrictions on how much assistance users can supply in their votes requiring both a minimum number of choices and placing a restriction on that number there are a number of ranked choice voting methods which are mathematically better compared with the existing system  condorcet methods providing the most potential the voting mechanism would allow participants to rank as many options as they wish in order of preference they could pick only one or they could rank every single option in order the number of options a participant selects would have no bearing on the weight of their choices in the final count so there would be no incentive to select only a large or small number of items only the number of issues you actually care about all others would be assigned an equal least important votei understand the existing vote counting is performed by some code created by trebor i would be happy to provide technical assistance in implementation up to and including development of a new fair counting mechanism
hey thats precisely stuff id be interested in toying withthe fact is i lack mainly motivation to collect nuggets of knowledge about voting mechanisms when you say failing at a number of basic criteria i suppose you already know more than i about arrows or the gibbardsatterthwaite theorems for i barely know of their existence on the other hand if i knew enough of coq or only got my stroustrup back id gladly try to implement stuff hell id even learn enough of cgi or perl if that could make it more useful of course there are already a few implementations of anything we could try to deal with here you can find a few of them from wikipedia yet as long as i dont understand it i dont buy it whatever if you have pointers to precise voting systems mechanics please seed 
yes i know theres a csm topic about that but the forum thread has been closed so why not make this one livei couldnt support mandatory crews to fly a ship after all we never hired any and weve been flying everything proprely this far havent weon the other hand i love this idea feels lack it should have always been there yknow slots it could fit in a rig simpler to balance or it could depend on the ship size frig are know to be flown by the capsuleer alonemo when you hire a crew it doesnt give you any bonus hell it could even be a drawback to fly around with rookies on board but the longer you manage to keep them alive the better they get yes it means pvpers would probably need to hire new ones often it would make sense that crew grows skillful more quickly when youre pvping than mining in 10max ship upgrade fullytrained crew should be a little more competitive than a rig i think because it costs you more time to get it there isk sink either you them a salary daily weekly monthly or you just buy them its a way to get isk out of eves economy and at this point this looks like a good thingcons obviously balance issues in fight easily balanced if crew are only slightly superior to rigs balance issues in economy because crew cant be reproccessedarbitragedcomplexity i dont think new players should have to worry about that on frig and dessies and lets face it its not that complicated you buy the crewfitting rig you hire the crew you try not to lose the ship even in code it doesnt look that complicated to keep the track of crew and xp besides i would rather keep it simple no fancy notions like feedingmoralemoral issues about buying selling people see them as sport players mate or about buying people youll take to their death problem of being hated by your crew if thats a problem at all
i was also thinking of asking if trade commoditieswhich right now are only used for tradecould go down to planets to improve different aspects of your colony in planetary interactionthis is a very common yet needed ideasupported
i like it except for the part where your ship gets better the longer your crew is there i say implement it but keep it simple dont do stuff like that
yes i would prefer more macro than micromanagement so keep it simple but make sure crew members are transferable from ship to ship
linkagebreed them on planetstrain them in stations hello incarnahire them to shipsand use them in fighters
very yesi want the crew to do something though like gain experience or similar if its just annoying overhead then its not so good
while i like the core of this idea i must point out that it runs contrary to the pod technology that defines eve the idea being that a single capsuleer in a pod can fulfill all the functions of an entire crew this also justifies the diverse training skills required to fly a ship eg engineers engineer and gunners gun for crewing to happen ccp would need to create some backstory that eliminates the capsule you cant command a large crew from within a pod crew members must be more than insignificant mortals or theres no justification for their being on a ship they would have specific skill sets necessary for the function of the ship with this being the case what happens to skill training the change you propose is massive pod tech is central to the game im not convinced that the pros outweigh the cons
thats wrong the chronicles mention there is crew and ccp whoever that writes them has confirmed several times that ships have crews you just dont see their escape pods due to technical problems with itthe crews are already there they just dont do anything tangible in game especially in bigger ship classes you need thousands just for maintenance
supporting this i basically would be happy if crew acted like skill hardwiring implants for ships but which cost isk every weekmonth to upkeep and come in various quality levelsfurther to this  please give us crews for our pi facilities and let us use slaves in them
can we give them our learning skillsmake them faster better and more durable
honestly i dont give them escape pods because they caused my ship to blow up so they go down with it as for me i just watch the fireworks d

log in in the morning undock cruiser fly to asteroid set orbit start firing laserscome home to cruiser 5 energy turret 5 and a whole lot of unnecessery server loadwhat would your proposal actually achieveoh and for the record rather a lot of us love offline skill training my god its such a relief to play a game where my time is actually spent playing the game rather than grinding numbers on my character sheetnot supported because this is an ineffective nonsolution to a nonexistent problem
couldnt you grind sp in the beta and ccp disabled that quickly afterwardsnot supported of course
hmm wish you would of actually read the post rather the tldryour not going to just log in are you and leave it running talk sense but there you go you have contradicted yourself at least you have to do something for your training instead of just log in click train log out like you want come home to level 5 for doing absolutely nothing at allbasically you just want easier way possiblewaht do you mean what does it achieve you didnt read the post did you what does click train go away achieve nothing at all at least this way you making people truly competent it what they usein what environment do you just pay for something and do nothing to get a certificate or accredited training nowhereand remember i said the skill training time will not be affected you still have to train for 30 days or whatever for a level 5 skill its not grinding it actually gaining experience in using dont compare to wow where you grind to get skillsand actually alot of people dont like skill training you do well fair enough thats just you alot of people dontand you just said you want to play the game so this makes you play the game dude before you post please think and read eveything thats set out there is no grindinginstead of wanting the lazy way out i cant be bothered to work for my skills attittudefor the record for me and for quite a few thousand others there is a problem sorry to suggest you might actually have to do some work to get your skillswow who would of thoughtsome work
what he said
there is no grinding please read the post properly  you dont go round shooting rats mining etc to skill up you just using that mod and ship etc for a length of time so you become experienced in using it
as opposed to your whiny i want everything now attitudestop trolling dude
are you thick seriously are you totally a dumbass it would take the exact same time as it does now to train the levels jeez read the fecking post
in order to get cruiser skills i have to fly a cruiserin order to fly a cruiser i have to get cruiser skillswhoopsbut really thats not the point eves skill system is really quite a nice thing in and of itself it can get a bit tedious sometimes waiting for long periods but for the most part its great the whole point of leveling up in most mmos is that they want you to spend time before being powerful eve just cuts straight to the chase and says hey you still have to wait for power but in the meantime do whatever the hell you want i like that id genuinely hate to see it leaveyou seem to have taken the existence of a problem for granted im a bit guilty of that myself but its always something you should be careful of always make sure the problem actually exists before you make a suggestion in this case i dont know if the problem exists and i dont think it doesim open to convincing but at the moment i cant support a solution to a problem im not even sure exists
that was going to be my point as well but i agree with pretty much what you said anyway
with this im asking for ccp to do one big balance sweep not the patchwork style like always one big look through of all weapon systems ships even modulesdoing it all at once has the profit of not making one thing worse while buffing another i know that his will have to wait till after incarna but then it should be done at all at once in one expansion
one gunone shipone speednothing elsebalanced
win
snowball launchershuttle0 msall done
agreed changing near worthless bonuses and removing the teir system would be greatedit thumbs up
only if the expansion is called somthing stupidlikeeve online seesaw
this shouldnt be even posted in the proposals section this is brainfart materialif you want an onceandforall balance then you also want a freeze of the codego away not supported op is an idiot
dudethe thing about balancing a game with hundreds of ships and thousands of modulesits hard yo
takes one to know i one i guess current system where they make one shipmodulerace overpowered for an entire or multiple patch cycles at a time is ridiculous gallentenanoamarrmatarspending the required time and resources to not only balance what needs it but to lay out a detailed internal plan for what the various racesshipclasses are supposed to do will make any future work done in this area a lot easier  reference material is gold fotm will always exist in one form or another but by putting in the effort to spread it out and making it as diverse as possible the game experience as a whole wins big

to use this feature you must be docked at a station with a medical facilitythis feature is subject to the same limitations as jump clone services namely personal or corporate standings of 80 or higher towards the npc corporation in question are requiredcost calculationfacility rent 50 million isk base cost for each remappingpersonnelmaterial cost 20 million isk per reassigned attribute pointat 14 attribute points that can be reassigned total cost range would be 70 million to 330 million isk the entire sum as it is being paid to an npc faction is removed from the isk faucetfor playercontrolled stations or supercapitals with medical facilities the facility rent could be set to any number between 0 and 50 million isk this portion of isk is then transferred to the corporationsupercap pilot in questionpersonnelmaterial cost would remain the same you have to hire outside specialists to do the job etc and this isk portion is directly removed from the gameso in theory corporationsalliances controlling such facilities could offer the service cheaper than npc factions if they so chooseso why is this different than plex for remap people with a lot of isk  rl cash to spend on plex will still have an advantageyes they willthe differences are1 this does not tamper with the plex market as it is2 the isk used for remaps will be removed from the isk faucet and help prevent inflation3 this solution makes sense from a rp  game integrity point of view extremely expensive solution found to circumvent braindamage caused by frequent neural remaps  makes sense handing over item paid for with rl money for additional remap  doesnt make sense
no just no
you really think this will get support
i dont know quite a few people seemed upset plex for remap which i strongly opposed didnt make it into the gamepersonally i dont care much one way or the other i have not remapped in years and could remap now any time i want to but i think this solution wouldnt be detrimental to anyone and help drain isk from the game  which would be an important bonus for everyone who likes a stable economy
330m is too cheap but yea been suggested and would workhow many people can honestly afford to remap every month at prices like this yes there are trillionare and multi billionares but adverage player will not spend the isk to remap many more then once or twice a year
i was trying to aim for a plex price there more or less and the numbers were neat and clean of course those could be adjusted i wouldnt make the facility rent disproportionately large however as that would give those groups owning stations etc too much of an advantage its supposed to be a small additional bonus nothing more
thumbs down dont make my eve feel like runequest
i like also brings some skill decision making back when the learning skills are gonedo i buy this nice shiny new ship or wait a month and remap to optimize my skills
they already told that there will be no remap for plex isk or anything or notenough already
okay so your run your missions and you have you nice salvo cane waiting in station when some uber prober comes into your mission and start salvaging not only can you not kill the guy because hes leaving all the loot in cans but you know hes making alot of money that should be yours you cant do anything unless he steals the loot and pretty much if he does that its because theyre in a pvp ship fit to nuet your pve ship to death an quick fix would be simply to make salvaging any wreck that isnt yours an aggro bringing action or the what about bring out a dropable object that when put into space and active makes probing out your missionsafe spot harder not impossible never impossible but just harder make these people work for there free income
per ccp mitnal per gm faolchu  per senior gm ytterbium  per ccp prism x  per ccp incognito  these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleetcom
then making it harder to probe you out should be an option cause its annoying componants are pricey the right mission salvage is worth millions and not being able to protect that is annoying and while ccp might not call it stealing its money out of the pocket of the mission runner every mission runner has had someone do this to them at some point and at lease making it harder for them to find should be an option
making deadspace and mission deadspace harder to probe will make it a safespot for ewar logi and other ships that can be scaned down in fleet fightsmission running is a no risk isk think and massively profitable compared to other careers and your angry at people whos profession makes less then your bounties and only bother you once in a while in mission hubs leaving you to salvage 90 of the timethats pretty greedy
this is eve im out for myself most of the time but i did say make it harder not impossible atm theres nothing to be done having said all this im getting to the stage were my alts will just mine me my income and i can stop running missions in highsec all together its just very annoying seeing isk fly out the door
this is a nonissue imo i get jumped in on a lot and im still doing l3s in a cane if the ninjas bother you shoot your own wrecks to make sure that no one gets the salvage that chases off a lot of em sure you cant come back and salvage but then neither can he if you cant have your salvage then no one can when one finally does steal from your canwreck shoot him if you think you can take him many of these guys get used to carebears not looking for a fight and decide to help themselves to loot and salvage because they know many players wont do anything about it be careful though often they will leave and return with a bigger ship while they still have a timer to shoot back thats why i like to wait until the end of the mission before engaging and cleaning up wreckage beforehand if possible multiroom missions still leave plenty of stuff behind for them to come back and extend the aggro timer so i typically avoid combat in those unless im ready to chill for a couple hoursi managed to kill a ninja who jumped in on my mission the other day i popped all my wrecks after he stole then sicked my t2 drones on him and watched them eat away at his frigate when his ship went up in flames i took out his wreck too then docked to let the timer cool while he probably waited in a bs outside my station if id left any canswrecks behind hed be able to keep extending the timer until they despawn and have a much larger window to get revenge in the end he lost a cheap ninja ship but its not what they expect out of most mission runnersmany ninjas work together in areas and will tip off one another to who is a known hostile who should be avoided and who is a pushover they can steal from without repercussions the very next day someone else from his ninja corp jumped in on one of my missions and stole he made it to the final room of my plex and saw i was still there then took off before i had the chance to target him either he got something valuable from the previous rooms he didnt want to lose or word gets around about who they should avoidif you dont want to try to scare them away then youre better off running missions in a less populated area but remember there is always the chance someone will drop in to say hello
stop missioning in the main hubsi run level 4s when i am not in a wormhole in a little system well off the beaten path i have been bothered by ninjas about three times in the two years i have been playing evethough frankly the salvage market is so crap lately i dont bother salvaging at all i just blitz the missions and leave the wrecks behind
op i found the problem your logic is flawedsee as the first person pointed out its not your salvage so it really shouldnt matter there now there shouldnt be an issue right
i could care less if some ninja finds his way in and wants it he can have it hell ill even turn it blue for him i normally salvage all my missions but if theyre that desperate im always in the sharing mood
while i mission it will be an issue for me salvage is pricey as i make a good 40m a day from it while that might not be alot to some its a good amount to me
right but its not yours so the point that you make money from it is moot
i completely understand where youre coming from sync but its just one of those eve things that you have to learn to live with and work around sure it sucks but its unlikely to changei dont like suicide ganks market hijinks or wars for tears either but its what makes eve the game it is change that and it makes it less which is in the end worse for everyone
there is a handy module already which makes you harder to scan down
no
not supportedwe had this version of salvage  get flagged at the start and the  didnt come down in price i remember running around belts flashing red in my small frig if you brainmaniacs would have salvaged then and the prices for salvage would had come down so that ccp would had met its target for rig prices you would have it your way now its entirely your fault
ccp is resistant to the idea of making salvage theft a crime in eve ccp likes it because it gives new players something to do thats safe interesting and isk making as they say it was intended as a mini profession theyve even gone so far as to make the statement that its not theft even though it of course is just not a theft punishable in eveit is unlikely that ccp will create a device by which a mission runner can make himself or his mission less easy to probe first see the above paragraph second ccp has made a special effort to make probing of missions easier thats right at one time it was difficult to probe a mission the changes that made it easy predate apocrypha when apocrypha made it even easierwell now any week old player can probe you down for some nice safe worry free theftshoot your wrecks theyre yours it ticks off the salvage thieves and youll not lose too much if any because youll be running through the missions faster by not salvaging yourselfregardswindjammer
not supported the drawback from u hiding behind concord is that they can hide behind concord as well to steal it from u with impunity risk vs reward
great move ccpitll increase peoples wish for playing eve because now its geting easier to start i didnt expect you gonna do itbe ready to have 50 000 players this year but you better deal with laggs we have ps you should have done it earlier
maybe as a weak long range web having it actually move players may be more complicated gamemechanic wise
obviously things arent going the way they should so ive already requested this topic to be closed
locked per request
when i lived in 00 i almost never did mag sitesit was better to just kill rats in the belts reallythe only mag site that was worth it was one of the first i ever did in 00 dropped a faction pos battery bpc
i would like to introduce the idea of being able to put your corp logo on your ships this is a simple anof of an idea which shouldnt require a lot of debate the second idea is player customizable skins for your ship nothing fancy just the ability to change the color of your ship skins would be cool but the ultamate goal is to get our corp logo on our ships
big fleets are already laggy and now you wanna get everyone to start having to download 100s of skins while trying to shoot a target get points or return to gatecome on its a fine idea an all but it just adds lag in battles not that a lot of people are zoomed in during battles these days or have effects on bar me but i dont really get massive lag in 100 man fights
i realy doubt that a corp logo is going to lag everyone out skins mabie harder to pull off but lets try to get one or the other with this post
french maid barmaid and mega maid skins please
if said corp logos would get updated at the startup of eve there would be no lag at all except form your graphic card and ccp could still add a button to turn it off any way
i second this motion
i am pretty sure he mad not bitter drake
lol edit glances at op oh yeah my vote is no
ccp has commented in the past that they dislike offfield boosters and that some day this will be fixedsupported
additionally remove signatureexplosion radius calculation for bomb damageyay a fun and viable counter to ahacsalso first mchief117 idea ive ever supported
why cant we train two characters at once at the moment my main is tied up with a training que that wont finish for several days yet and my alt cant do any thing as i train it while my main has the que tied up
google this topic read the other 3000 threads on itthen delete your op and ask the mods to lock this thread before anyone else gets in here and makes you feel like an idiot for posting this for the trillionth time
considering you get three characters slots go for the gold and shoot for three in other news i like selling characters too
sorry op too late
so how many games let you log in to the same account simultaneously and grind xpwe on multiple characters at oncethis would be the eve equivalentno
then wtf are you moaning aboutreally so advising new folks to the game on how to optimise their skills is a bad thing
yes advising new people to be useless at the end of the double learning bonus is a bad thing and makes them leave the game telling others they left because of learning skills but in fact they left because those mentors did not explain the skill system properly to them1 attribute point with learning v gives you 66sph if it is a primary attribute 33 for secondary the difference between having learning skills at all v and iv iii basic adv is 297 sp the difference of sp the guy who only has trained the skills to iv and iii and the guy who maxed em is 1909490so the guy that has trained the skills to all lvl v would have to train for 267 days with that skills as primary and secondary he would need even more time if he start to train any other skills to catch up with the guy who has skipped that training and started specializing on the profession he wants to do in eve so while the guy who got the awesome advice to train up all those skills at vconclusion you have more sp in shipsmodulesscience whatever for a very long time than that guy who thought that he have to train with the maxed skills else he is at a disadvantage compared to the player who started playing eve instead of watching skills to finish spinning his noobship in station and quitting eve at the end of the trial period because of the impression that sph is all that matters in eve which is not the reason to play evepeople also seem to forget that the amount of sp to fly a singe ship or do a single task you like doing most in eve is limited you max it out and what then  yes that is the point when you can start trainiing those learnings at higher lvls because you notice you like the game and may stay for the time its worth to max out those learnings
well i do understand what you are saying and sort of agree especially about training learning skills before skills to have funwhich is why i think getting rid of learning skills is goodlet me reread your first post when i wake tomorrow perhaps i misread what you are saying it has been a long day i have been forum slapping narrow minded selfish ignoramuses all day and i now need sleep 
i just really want to hear this any links to such would be appreciated any blue posts i would love moreif i have to explain what the local issue is to a dev then they really only look at fi to move posts from general there
i was just about to make this very topiccheers csm
could we get a list of the csm members who supported this removalso i know whom not to vote for 
well it was all sudden for me i was ratting happily for security increse then my friend told me they are deleting learning skills completely soon omgwtfbbqareusanebut hey i will get the sp to redistibute right cool i will finally get hac 5 and maybe some gunnery skill as well you cant really say that you wasted time back thenscrew this i dont care if newbies will get their skills and ships faster good hardware wont make them good pilots anyway am i feeling bad nope im not angry at all for this decision i have a 50m sp charcater active more or less since 2007 i was buying the advanced skillbooks one by one and then train hard but hey everything changes right vets did it the hard way yes but now you have about 5m sp to train anything you still dont have d its basically for nothing you never lost anything and your attributes will even rise a small bit if i recallfor me its the same as align problem i remember lessons at the academy about align and training with warping the fleet now we have that damn align button and suddenly its not that hardcore anymore
this is in no way to really help the player most players that stuck through those training times were the players that were looking for a challenge and a game that required dedication ccp is playing the poletition card we promise and deliver something that looks good to the gamers but back at the ranch there is a behind the scene motiveit makes sense though from a business perspective for ccp what better way to get more subscribers more subscribers mean more revenuethe more you can dumb down the game the more people you will attract and the more revenue ccp makes the down side of this strategy is that your retention will more than likely be a lot less simple business mechanics  soon you will be able to join a fleet and go watch tv sso to sum up game development has changed over the years from we are passionate about the game we make to we are passionate about finding new ways we can make more incomesad but its clearly true
wowowow what exactly do you mean by changes for our benefitand indeed while you obviously dont care for their real purpose whatever you might believe that could mean you ought to learn the difference between representation and votecatchingand please quit lamegreening p
ok we all know macros cause a game imbalance in a number of ways you have the mission macros which youll watch a group of ships randomly named players in npc corporation in something like permaboosted cnrs undock all at once and head to different area all at once that sells isk which all ccp can do is detect massive isk transfers question the guy and determined if its bought than you have the trader macro same as above but in haulers and freighters that buy mass of one item for the day sell it and still sell the isk than you have the miner macros which cause even more of a market imbalance than the 2 above they mine ore both ice and normal ive seen them mining normal ore when ice became harder to find sell the ores and cause a market imbalance for people that want a mining profession to make isk and suppy people with ores but has become impractical since the market decline in ore and mins the miner macros have been the most adaptive program ive seen when ice was in rat free zones they jet ice and a hauler comes pick it up loved stealing the ice than ccp took the ice out of rat free zones to 08 and below the macros adapted and were made to deploy drones to fight off the attackers but still jetted ice for a hauler than the orca came out now they dont have to jet can it all goes into the orca which is further boosting the fleet to mine even better and they can go long rates with out the orca having to dock and the orca wont miss a cycle which means more isk for them to sell now while i half approve of the hulkageddons little fun fair as during their time i have to mission and salvage for my isk and mins it isnt practical to move ice to low sec than unless your in a big alliance or corp no ones going to be mining ice with out getting shot at one way or another i have this one ideathere is a game called tibia ive been playing off and on since high school freshmen yearim 25 now so you do the math i played it straight through high school than i learned of eve and now i only visit tibia to see if friends from back home are on now and again they had a huge macro problem but than again when you have to take 4 hours as a magic user to make a backpack of runes mage ammo to go on a hunt and run out higher end runes take 8 hours to make warriors and paladins have to train up weapon skills which get to the area of taking days of sitting there hitting a monster to level up your weapon and shield skill than you have that nasty 15m logout timer to where the game will log you out if your not doing anything active like waiting for mana to regen you get logged out so yeah who would want a macro to keep you logged in hitting a monster while your at work or alseep for 8 hours or so so when you can play your good to go and now wasting time doing it when you can play and than have complete boredom well over the past few years now they developed a program this program detects 3 party programs aka macros on a players account and banns them no questions asked since its release and its been accurate as can be with in the first release literally hundreds of thousands of accounts were banned across all servers for macro use all 100 accurate and the markets have balance the game developers name is cipsoft and id say getting into contact with them would be a good first step as they to have the same problems we have on eve as many accounts were also designed to sell gold if its enacted id say well find ice a decent ore to mine in the future less accounts selling isk and more people will move to the mining professions that they wanted to support the eve community in more than just having to build a ship from whats mined to make any decent money and missioners will benefit from this aswell as salvage and mins will come back up even though the mission loots drops have been nerfed and has shuned salvagers from their profits when they wat to go in and take advantage of the missioners mess
this post is the literal definition of tldr
you can put something in your bioor before leaving the old corp you can award yourself a 5 years in corp name medal i fear it is too late for that for you as you have already left the corpnot great solutions but they are something
or you could simply fill out this

yarrr yes did i support it yet no idea well i do anyway
go to the new forums threadintro as far as i know the current warp effect is at least 4 years old i believe it is time for a bit of a visual change in that areamy idea is to replace the current get up to speed and slug into warp with a more punch like effect as demonstrated in the following 4 videosmy first two examples are from the 2009 star trek movielinkagelinkage  imagine a titan or other capitalsupercap class ship performing the 2nd warpmy next examples are from the game mass effect 2linkage  skip to 218linkage  skip to 210finally it seems that ccp has almost pulled this off already in the incursion trailerlinkage  skip to 120since the new forums havent come back yet ive edited out the mechanics changes in this thread hopefully the new forums will come back online sooni appreciate you taking the time to read my proposalalso keep the suggestions coming id really like to see this become something that mostly everyone can agree on and thus get it passed by the csm
graphic change yes actual change to warp mechanics no will this give our ships a parking brake
i agree with this topic
what part of the warp mechanic change dont you likealso what do you mean by parking brake
i do want in warp speed up to go away so that you instantly get to you max warp speed once you enter warp also all the animations need some work but im fine with the other mechanics
i agree whole heartedly ccp shouldnt listen to people who  and complain about game play mechanics changing if it improves the game overall after all thats what nerfing ships is about now while warp mechanics dont have to change to implement this it would not hurt for the sake of immersion if they didwe need better graphics
i agree with both visual and mechanics changes warp acceleration and deceleration is just an excuse for wasting our time the space bending effect is just awesome 
i do like this idea and it would make some cool player videos
i fully support the change in graphic but strongly oppose the game mechanic changes
fully agree the change in mechanics isnt any different from how they are now instead of align time we have charge up length
i agree with this
i think it would be a very cool graphical update and also a good change to mechanicsit might even accidentally fix the coming out of warp jigg back where you reach your destination and then pop backward and then forward seeing as you would land right on your destination and almost stop
i think its a star trek joke from when they first warp off to vulcan
ah i feel dumb now for forgetting that part
forgot to check i support this
i do like the idea of a more punchy warp effect but i also want splinebased trajectories to play a role i feel this would open up more tactical options in chases and make smaller ships and t3s fitted with specialized rigs more important in catching preyin fact id like to see more terrain available in general ring systems asteroid belts comets etc etc
agreed
im assuming youre referring to this post of yoursplex for remap is swapping 30 days game time for a remap theres 2 ways to get a plex buy one with  buy one with iskin game cost to out of game benefit buying plex with isk saves you the trouble of having to spend real money to play the game checkout of game cost to out of game benefit uh what i missed what you are referring to here theres character transfer fee that costs  and portrait swapping that costs  buying a plex with real money is out of game cost for in game benefit you can keep playing the game or you can get more in game money plex for remap is either out of game  or in game isk cost for in game benefit remapslippery slope i see even if they open the floodgates of microtransactions for vanity items as long as you can buy plex with isk theres still a way to get the vanity items without paying  for themok lets break this down by each case herecase 1 player uses  to buy a plex for a remapplex never would have made it to the market as it was intended to be used for a remap player trains skills at a normal rate but benefits from being able to have a skill path that is less than a year in lengthcase 2 player uses isk to buy a plex for a remapthe point that the price of plexes will go up because theres a steady supply and increasing demand now for game time and remaps seems logical but whose to say that the amount of plexes injected into the eve market is constant its also possible that a sudden drop of the supply of plexes when plex for remap would go active would increase the isk value of plexes but this greater isk value could also attract more people to purchase plex to convert into isk because of a higher exchange rate at minimum partially offsetting the greater demand on plexes for remapsplayer also trains skills at a normal rate and also benefits from being able to remap more than once per yearseriously what is the big problem with plex for remap is it really the plex for remap or is it that everyone falls down the slippery slope and is fearful of microtransactions

he has a point the carriers carry drones and the amount of space is less then the largest industrial ship they arent really carriers as they stand except by the definition of does little else but however the lore says they are too massive to dock if thats the case show it make them biggeri support thisi also support upping their drone bay space
as i understand it carriers are better labelled escort carriers whereas current supercarriers are the equivalent of modern naval cvnsbut yeah i still think they should be at least twice their current size as scaled in game
you guys need to push this thread harder it needs more votes think of the children who would otherwise grow up in space unaware of the wonders of gender augmentation technologies
i deny societys limitations and taboos and support this worthy cause
no
i would also like to see the groups window hold its position when you go to buy an item with the list instead of taking a chance on getting overcharged with the buy button in the group window
exactlythe real issue isnt whether they allow high explosive shells or only regular ammunition or if the cops show up in 2 seconds versus 6 seconds but that there must be combat in incarna because this is eve and when youre out doing something you can be interacted with by the potentially hostile universe around you it shouldnt be that we have the real eve game and then you can go play space barbie some it should be eve and then still eve in stations if you want to walk around in em
you are confusing the hypothetical inside of stations with the notso hypothetical space outside stations in eveonline op didnt actually state there can be no limitations imposed did he but hey i totally understand your problem to some empire muppets everything that even reeks of pvp is pure evil and if you really are worried about you lot ing like a bunch of whiny teenagers then you should reprocess your chars and quit eve or go back to wow because the massive whiny iness is exactly what happens to some degree in a whole lot of empire systems all day long its called local you know
oh man youre so tough and cool and awesome do you also eat nails for breakfasti dont know if youre aware of this but eve is a spaceship game not a gawd damn fps its a spaceship game that needs thought and planning because its indeed a harsh place with few safe zones now you want to grief people while theyre fitting their ships shopping for modules planning expeditions with their corp mates or just taking a bathroom break if eves gonna be a harsh pvp spaceship game then leave me the f alone while im in my hangari guess left4dead is also a pansy game since it does have safe zones where you can heal and reload your weapons doesnt matter if it makes sense gameplaywise real men dont care about stuff that makes sense real men only like danger 1000000 of the time everywhere so they can look badass on teh internetsno really you log the f out and go put some grizzly bears in your pants cause obviously youre drinking too much powerthirst therefore youre too energized for normal entertainmentsure the only reason people object to this is because they hate pvp while theyre subscribed to a pvp game oh boy aint that ironic lolololseriously did you know that  loved pvpits not like skiing and protesting against snow its like going skiing and at the end of the day take out the skis and go take a cup of hot cocoa inside the lodge snow is nice outside on the mountain where it belongs but i guess eve is too harsh and cold a place to offer some fing cocoa right real men must drink blocks of ice recited like verses from some holy bookit never occurred to you that a game can have several aspects dont you realise that mmos have fundamentally a strong social aspect what if incarna is just to enhance that aspect why are you all talking like every features which doesnt involve direct physical violence is some heinous crime against humanitywell because this is eve is eve some kind of sect or something
this thread is about eventual iterations on the game once its no longer a spaceship game but a game where you can be either in or out of a ship either in or out of a stations corridors and either playing eve in space or space barbie in stations thats pretty clearfeel free to offer constructive advice on how the core content and core combat dynamics of eve can be kept in this new area rather than simply trying to mock people for realizing that eve is set up along certain wellrecognized dynamics that incarna is ignoring this is dishonest as is your continuing snark about hot cocoa stop it ive stated very clearly that im not proposing that hangars be changed at all and they will still serve the same exact function that they do now but that the interior of stations which have never actually existed in the history of eve  will cleave to the same dynamic as the exterior of stations if the proposal is that youll still have your hangar exactly as it is and nothing about that part of eve will change and your response is eve is too harsh and cold a place to offer some fing cocoa right real men must drink blocks of icewell its pretty clear whats going on and if youre going to refrain from supporting the topic id at least ask that you actually argue against the topic rather than anything that lets you do whatever it is exactly that youre doingthanks for the free bumpage though
so says the man continually snarking about space barbies and calling me dishonest while hes the one setting up strawmen eve becoming more than a spaceship game really oh whatever its getting really late bai bai
no seriously stop the trolling and nonsense about religion andor hot cocoa and at least argue against the actual proposal rather than this general trolling if you support space barbie then come out and say it if you oppose making sure that space barbie has the core content and dynamic of eve then identify reasons for supporting that position but attacking tangential comments that people make while ignoring the actual proposal is simply diversionary nonsense and quit the nonsense about any strawman as i havent used any as just explained walking around in stations rather obviously does not occur in spaceships do you really contend otherwise therefore it is being argued that a way must be found so that the core content and dynamics of the traditional eve spaceship game translate over into the eve station game so that its not simply space barbie but eveinastation thats the whole point and its not complicatedthanks for keeping this topic at the top of the page though but please contribute to either the pro or con sides rather than just trolling thank you
i want gameplay in the game supported
supported but i dont want everyone running around with huge guns shooting each others heads off in 04  0000 shouldnt be a free for all where you kill all the time for profit there needs to be planningalso concord must be in the highsec stations and behave like typical concord you perform a crime they instantly appear out of nowhere and crashtackle you out a reinforced window into spacei doubt there will ever be pewpew in stations though
maybe so maybe not im convinced that the best way to see that its more likely is to add more voices in support also hammering out a viable vision for what stations should be like may help
my vision for what incarna should be like is basically system shock
system shock 2 was cooler though and had zombies
oh lord please get over yourself
no amount of holding devs by their toes over the fiery maw of a volcano will accomplish anything in this case i think you have to look a little higher up the food chain the apparent state of incarnaeven the little revealed so farsuggests that no articulate vision or roadmap has been developed or maintained for this feature despite the huge investment poured into it over the last four years sadly without a roadmap the risk is that incarna will be nothing but a shallow disjointed mishmash of mini games microtransactions forced interaction to pump up selective metrics in order to prove its success and thus justify its huge expense and over time fotm content that lacks integration with the greater game with that in mind i would rather see some evidence of a cohesive roadmap before worrying about specific game play ideas not holding my breath on that oneeven so im supporting this proposal to honor the spirit of your ideas a word of advice though ccp has told csm quite clearly that for proposals that are broader in scope like this one less detail and more elevator pitch has a better chance of provoking interest from them so instead of dwelling on the details of implementation it might be more useful to describe why your changes would make for a more compelling game play experience
cool story bro
thanks for the support and the advice as wellwould you suggest that i reedit the op so that it only looks at the vision and not the specifics or add a post on to the thread to do that
the op has the most orgasmic idea i have ever read for eve 1infinity signccp has the mechanics in place already and expanding the engine enough to have people and places outside of our ship we dont need dust add stations give us health we have the stats for it already just asign some arbitrary number like 1 hp per constitution or whatever the right stat is give us guns and we are good to goin the expansion after incarna add customs offices as where we can visit and say 500m around the office use generic locations for each planet and expand from thereyou have the engine you have the drive and you have over 1 million per month from all the active accounts assuming none use plexs before expenses you can do it ccpor to paraquote the guy thats always in adam sandler movies you can do it you can do it let us blow his brains out
i support this

he wants plex for remaps because newer players need more help then they already get  look i could not care about the learning skills  if anything it makes making alts a lot easier and sometimes i need a quick alt  and learning skills were a major investment in these termshowever everyone gets the boost  so newer players dont catch up any faster and no one gains an advantage mt is a bad trend and if you want to see all the bitter vets leave then you will also have to recongnize that the game sorta dies with it just look at all the great games out there that this happened to  so eve givs a major advantage to people who have been playing longer  deal with it at least now you can buy a character and buy as much isk as you want   which we did not have btwas for the rl money  gtc  isk issue  i agree we should get rid of that too   but then a bunch of people start to cry about it and i get called all sorts of names  
of course its a boon for the vets were getting a huge injection of free sp that we can use to instatrain stuff that we cant remap for meaning that we can keep right on rolling with the max sphr skills in terms of nonlearning sp weve just gained an extra 13 months lead over a new player as a further benefit now it is impossible for a new player to try and train learning skills higher than us and catch up that way the only way to differentiate your learning speed is to use implants oh hey look who has more money to pay for better implants or to stick to stat remap friendly skills for a whole year again far easier for a player who already has core skills trained than for a new playerin absolute terms the learning skills reimbursement has only increased the gap between new players and high sp veteransone could make the argument that in relative terms the new players will get more benefit in the same way that a 1000 pay rise means more to a supermarket checkout operator than a 100000 oneoff bonus means to a doctor but even then im doubtful assuming that the new player was sensible and devoted no more than 50 of his skilling time to learning skills hed have been on a level with the doctors within about 10 weeks or soanyway i argued against removing learning skills for just this reason as usual a campaign based on help the new players is once again rewarded with a result that benefits the vets pretty much the whole antilearning skills campaign was based on the notion that new players are too stupid to work out the very simple optimum way to train learnings and are therefore discouraged i also noted quite a few of the loudest campaigners of removing learnings deliberately giving the terrible advice of do nothing else until you have learnings to 55 to new players in order to bolster their own campaign clever i cant deny if rather unethicalso the metagame was played and once again the older players came out ahead all i can hope for is that when people look back over this one that theyll become a little more politically sophisticated in time for the next campaignmeanwhile i did my best and im certainly not above spending my reimbursed learning sps best of luck to the new player who fights me on dec 15th when ill have an extra 15 hit points because ive been able to instatrain for a mindlink and when i say best of luck of course i mean sucks to be yousee you all again for the next big forum campaign on oh what will it be i think were due another campaign on suicide ganking there have been some older very rich players who have lost a lot of isk to these lately  wont somebody please think of the children
giving a set of 4s or even 3s to a new recruit is far easier and better than dumping a pile of skill books on them to train for 2 months give or takethat so called gap needs to be there anyway new pilots are not as good or smart as they tend to be in times pastpersonally ill take this change over plexs for remaps any day
see now there is a proper brain at work there nice post
i take some comfort in knowing that it wont do a tiny bit of good
hello bitter vet here and even though im not really bitter thats how im going to be judged according to the opim also against removing the learning skills malcanis brings up numerous good points excellent post btw but why should the game be made easier in the first place im assuming that at least most of us posting in this forum figured out eventually that learning skills were useful and trained them new players should deal with that as well this is a game about choices isnt it from the very beginning industry mining combat to the very end supercarrier dreadnought pos and everywhere in between high sec low null this game is designed to present the player with a variety of choices what you decide to do with those choices helps shape your toonbut all that aside lets say you convince me that removing learning skills is a good thing  because it takes out the complexity because it speeds up character generation  character growth because it doesnt scare away new players well why not go one step farther lets remove shield management and just improve all shield regeneration by 25 lets remove drone interfacing and just let every drone do its job 25 better lets remove negotiation and get paid faster by agentsi didnt start playing this game because the choices were easy i joined because the opportunities are seemingly endless and every choice makes a difference even the basic choices like do i learn my next step of clarity or do i go for battlecruisers if i wanted a straightforward laidback no challenges kind of game id go play a platformer
sounds like a good idea
yes
nice one supported

not sure how this would work out in game but cool idea supported
i support this idea but i thought id add my own missives on the subjective always thought that shields should work radically differently than armor or hull the resists should determine how much damage passes to armor or is taken by the shieldbasically a 0 em resist would have the shield ignoring 100 of incoming em damage a 50 em resist would have 50 em damage passing through to armorhull and 50 of it being absorbed by the shield this would alter tanking and require a revamp to the relationship between armor and shield tanking styles but i think overall it would be a positive change especially if coupled with my slot revamp rather than hi mid and lo slots there would be primary secondary and tertiary system slots
yes
its never gonna happen but itd be cool
it seems perfectly sensible that one should have some kind of red button to stop some subsystem whether shield hp should still regenerate or even be stored for immediate use when shield is returned to operation is more open to debate proposal should escalate to the csm i think
but when the new plex for remaps was being introduced none of this applied nor was relevant hypocrite
that isis the only thing that 98 ppl so happy about and so blind to obvious notsogood consequencesnothing personal im talking about a whole but its just discusting tbh
whats not good new players dont deal with a really stupid mechanic anymore old players get all their sp back to invest in something else
so what your saying is 98 of the 4060000 players in eve online are dumbasses and dont know wtf they are doingyeah let me know how that works out for you
why do people cling to these learning skillsare they really that wonderfuleven if you disregard the damage they do to newbies do those 11 skills sitting there really fill you with a sense of worth that couldnt be filled better by skills in gunnery or leadership or tradeis it just the insecurity of having newbies be a threat and the desire to have superiority wherever possible
1 so new players get 7 instead of 12 as is planned way to stick it to the litte guy2 same as for planned change they even reimburse the people who have been stockpiling the damn books3 i dont care much and usually have only 3s in my head you probably care more and have 5 looks like the small advantage in speed you are looking for
actually this is a pretty safe assumption most of the time
theres more like 300k subscribers actually 40k60k is the amount usually online
all i know is i see an average of 40 to 60k concurrent users online every dayi dont know the total numbers dont think anyone really knows only whats reportedfact remains the op is being an utter idiotgoonie  egoprideful much

id mainly like to see the lens flare disabled so that looking in the direction of the sun doesnt white out your entire damned screen
i use chat screens as sunglass or sometimes i just put on sunglass
supported
this definitely this
not supported just bring enough drakes to blot out the sun
if locationenvironment gave a tactical advantage then i would not be able to support thisuntil that time however 1 for both sun and nebulae
i cant afford a million drakes
well neat idea because i also find the glare really annoying but cant you just spin your orientation around so that its at your back
like i said in the opening post if i spin around then most of the time i cant see enemiesgatesetc overview can only do so much and i like to see where they are on the gridthis proposal is nothing more than a way to make eve better for everyone by adding an option to either turn the sun off dim the sun or at the very least turn off the lens glare the sun gives off
yeah but hey man we can keep showing ccp that the mass majority wants thisi will create the 9999th proposal until it is finally implemented roar
more or lessalso make them able to be disabled so in blob battles can be less blobby
its included in the proposal to disable the optionmoar support for awesome engine trails
engine trails ftw i also support engine trails for drones so during pos bashes and such where every allocates their drones to a single structure therell be a massive orb of fire created from the orbit of several hundred or thousand drones dor maybe thatll be a bit too far
more trails please
im pretty sure ccp said they were bringing them backsupported regardless
an antiblob missile of sizes light heavy cruiseeveryone is familiar with how cruise missileswith good skills can fly greater then 250km most often this being needlessly wasteful how about this chain reaction missile hits the first target for 10 damage then automagically flies to the next enemy and does 20 damage then 30 damage then 40 now if these missiles are left to roll through a enemy force of 500 im doing 5000 damage to each near the end that missile is doing tons of damage now cruiseheavylight missiles are shot down with defender missiles but you would need someone running defenders for each enemy who is using these missiles to break the chain or you dont bring a blob of that many enemies or you spread out and let the missile run out of steam as it only travels so far before popping or dont bring a blobit is omnidamage type making it semiuseless for pve also in missions there arent that many enemies to hit to make it ever get to decent damage
wtb boosted fc v skill so now i can give bonuses to a fleet of 500
fixed that for you in my post doesnt matter if fleet or not
itd be nice if the noctis could fight off npc frigates in hisec when its salvaging it shouldnt have to run away when its attacked by a corpii scavenger or something even 15 mbits would be sufficient though id probably give it a full 25more importantly the noctis should have some means to retaliate against ninja salvagers we need to let newbies do dumb things
reasonable but unlikely
whydestroyers didnt have drone bays honestly a salvage ship really shouldnt either would make it too overpoweredand if this is a stealth salvage drone thread please get over yourselfpersonally i wouldnt care but i dont think its earth shattering either
battle noctis
hardy thing wrecks can stand up the the power of a salvage ship as it is now noctis is way too op as a salvage ship as we know currently giving a minor combatdefense feature is hardly opcurrently there is only one ship that has a salvage bonus  and its not a destroyer and its way op for salvage too
might be possible to speed tank it
i dont understandsurely you either hand in the mission meaning no rats or you are with an alt who should be tanking
if they ever make a t2 variations combat salvager that could follow fleets and salvage on site while having some tank to hold together if primaried then yes add to that 25 drone bay no need for more no need for lessbut thats a different topic as it is the certain proposal posted i have to say i am not in favor of the t1 hull getting a not needed drone bay
lets take a look to the carriers for example  minmatars are most useless for sinle playertanatos is best other have more capasitor more ehp speed is not matter for capitals 5 bonus to remrep is not so much and for single player is not nessesary as for capital fight  5 for remrep is better there but with the lowest tank it becomes deadly to minmatars carier pilot10 bonus is far more useful i mean or better tank or at least capasitor sizerechargesame bonus to motherships  looks like bad joke from developers  hel is baddiest mothership in gamenaglfar  why it have 2 bonus for projectile and only 2 slots for them why not make it with 5 highslots with 33 turretmissile bay slots and 5 bonus to rate of fire for missle and turrets per level  if it too cool make them less low or middle slots for tank  but at least player with good gunnery and bad missile skill can do some real damage on it
that is just about incomprehensible so i am voting no
other then the poor capacitor there is little wrong with mataar caps  its a choise and if you dont like it train something elsethe rep bonus is fantastic th problem is that the ship cannot really use the bonus effectivly because of the poor capacitor  which is a mataar racial traitso the fix is not to buff acapacitor but to change the bonus to 5 i think it should be 75 for the hel  but that may be a bit imba actually and 5 capacitor use per levl fo both the niddy and teh hel9 that would keep the capacitor gimped but give it a chance to actually be a proper repperas for the nag considering how awful all dreads are right now due to imba moms there is little point in changing it but as a glass cannon it does a lot of damage  which is what its good atif you dont like it then train something else imo i for one should have invested the time to train amarr  but i still fly mataar because thats what i have invested a crapload of time into and thats what i got   but there are alts that do other races just fine
yes at least 5 bonus to capasitor per level will make them far better not best but it means that they really have unique ability to rep himself or others more effectivly  bust for pve pvp abilities and different role in game
minmatar capitals should be the worse they speed tank ffsminmatarbest speedgallente best drone capabilitiescaldari  best shields and ewamarrbest armor and cap
sorry i got caught up on the word baddiestwtf is that
im not trolling a player i know is 2 years older than me and i have more than half the skill points he does why because he has 19 million in learningif he started with all of them 12 he would have way more skill points were getting what we have in learning back not the skill points we could of accumulated before and during the training of themthank you for trying to derail the post i am not trolling im trying to figure out a way that we can compensate better wasted spthis isnt whining about the learning nerf this is a different idea
again read the dev blog derp derpccp put it in black and white any one who has trained the learning skills will lose everything tied to them including attribute bonusesthe sps used to train them will become reimbursed and redistributable to anything of their choicethen they will give you max bonuses as if you had trained them completely give or take as the math is showing interesting results but the point is still validthose who didnt train them get a buff those who partially trained get reimbursed for lost time and balanced back to the baselinehow the hell you come to the conclusion its not fair based on someone elses opinions of which you claim to represent is beyond me and everyone else hereagain you are trolling ccp isnt going to change it and they clearly stated they dont give a crap what you think because they have been there and done itcsm has no power over this and for you to post in light of that is obviously a big fat trollwhinefestthe evidence is irrefutable and undeniablecontinue to deny it dont matter to me anyps produce hard facts and evidence and iwe may change our minds not your half assed baseless assumptions based on some joe pilots supposed opinion of which you conveniently pulled out of thin air
first im not here to argue this isnt about learning skills i only mentioned it because my idea is along the same lines this is a proposal for the ability to redistribute skill points once a yearsecond please dont call me a troll im notthird i read the dev blog and i read the csm logs i understand them and can appreciate that ccp is hearing our voices and working on changes it will bring new players into eve and thats good for everyonefourth im not pulling things out of the air im not making anything up either we are getting back our points in learning thats what ccp said im not complaining about that what i dislike is the fact that were not getting what we could of had if we started with 12 in all attributes a lot of people would have way more sp if they started with all learning 5 but we cant do anything about it theyre not giving us the extra sp we would of had and i doubt they will eve players will live with itand finally please dont put words in my mouth i never said its not fair nor did i come to any conclusion that it wasnt fair i just think there should be another addition to help older playersthank you for letting me clarify to you what i meant apparently you didnt read my postsim still looking for ideas and comments thanks
this isnt about a problem with what ccp is doing this is a different suggestion along the same lines as what theyre doing
no
no
how much is this dumb stuff you did worth to youwould you be happy if youd loose 50 of the skillpoints in the transfer
how is getting millions of free sp hurting us exactly because if that is hurting i really like it when ccp hurts me wut multitasking is a very useful skill to level 5 has kinda limitted uses only for triage carriers iirc but the first few levels are done in no time anyway and pretty much mandatory for carriers and logistics
noi really dont know where to put all the sp that ccp is going to reimburse
the learning skills were a limitation  players had to spend the time and isk to train them or else suck much more at whatever they decide to do with their character thats why i support them being removedhaving made a mistake in your skill training is not a limitation it was your own choice it doesnt stop you training whatever skills you like in the future and you still have those skills if you decide later on to do something different with your character in fact i cant even think of any dumb skill training decisions that would warrant your proposalsolution looking for a problem  no support
put it in the antitroll gunnery skill
and what to do with all the other 51m spp
ill take that would be nice for my capital pilot 

like i said it sort of hurts them all in all its a good change but theyre not getting all of the sp they could of had they started with attributes maxed remap  all 5s  5 implants  2772 sphour which is a little over 24 million skill points a year few 2 year old pilots i fly with have 48m spanyways thanks to those who have responded with input i do appreciate the constructive comments
those 2772 sphour are with max remap and 5 implants if you would want to make good average calculation then 21002200sphour are more reasonable even that is already all learnings to 5 and 4 implants on a balanced base attribute layout and how many people do you know who regularly pvp in a clone with 4s or 5s
a few 5s everyone else i know 4s unless faction the point is there are many skill points that they will not have because they didnt start with max attributes but whatever at least were getting something this topic isnt about that though
is he talking to himself
ccp just does the same thing a different way theyve never compromised on a single thing
 nah i dont think im better than everyone the guys that had balls enough to tick this even though theyre not caldari not better than them i like to think were on the same level ie people who stand up for stuff i wouldnt say its emo emo is wah
youre right about this you didnt say you thought yourself superior so i somehow made that up myself but it could be subjectively sensibly extrapolated from the you all are morons stance  emo may have been exageratedhadnt you posted in the first place im not sure id have bent to no one complains woh everythings perfect then might rather have gone something like no one complains doesnt it smell of alltooconsensual rancid air in thereand actually your thread raises my morale especially when i read those alltoserious replies you get im not saying you werent just that i like to watch the average passersby make a fuss in reaction to what they percieved as a personnal insult while it was just a remark to the universe regarding reaction towards boosting of caldari pvp i dont know much about pvp but ive read stuff along how good my fellow gallentes fare at it and well i lold at the gallentes i meaninstall the smartest person filter candidates who would do that who could choose the wise better than the wise herself thats a consistency requirement i feel  how the wise comes to power be it by way of peace or force hers to know whatever i never was fond enough of plato to study that matter  plus i dont believe or at least still hope that not just every one is a plain idiot

no
you have not earned anything from salvage until its in your cargo hold the loot in the can belongs to you and your corpthe wreck does notwhat they really need to do is separate the damned cans from the wrecks again and stop this nonsense
i approve of this
oh my badbtw if you shoot someone in high sec in most cases it will be those juicy afk industrialsfreightersfactionfittedmissionboatetc youre already profiteering from1 unsuspecting targets2 no other combatants like in lownullwspace that could shoot back3 bring alts who could do the same as the lootthieves you whine aboutif you want the loot for you alone go to these other places and grow some ballsfor me this seems pretty balancednot supportedps also be very carefull what you wish for ccp might get tired of these whines and flag the wrecks from mission npc belonging to the mission npc faction as loot from players wrecks belong to the owner of the former ship this would also make it consistent and there would be no loophole anymore good luck with getting a flag for loot thieves after that one man how would i wish that one come to tq the forums would probably explode
doesnt the owner of the wreck have rights to the wreckwhy should the suic ganker have rights to it exactly enabling it absolute certainty of getting the loot and removing what risk there is in suic ganking which seeing how its in effect subsidized by the insurance by concord kills nonsense is artificially profitable on most targetsthis would only encourage even bigger ganker camps in more locations and act as a further buff to a career that doesnt need itvery unsupportedbut gallians what about pvpconsensual pvp already happens out of the way and there is low and null sec where the risk equals the reward and your gang is assured loot only ownership of the wreck and items in the wreck should be by the person who paid isk for it irl murderers dont get the state of their victims neither should then in game
let me clarify as im not supporting suicide gankingwhat out proposal is talking aboutwartargets in empire space where you pay isk to be able to fight a targeted corpalliance in empiresuicide ganking bypasses this lawful game mechanic
hence why it is suicide
i loldi couldnt help it
the sky tis falling a tiny minority in eve are upset woe will befall us all
locking thread there is no proposal here for the assembly hall
locked by request
to the eve community and designers i have not been around long so please excuse me if im off base recently plans have been announced to get rid of learning skills as well as put faction ships on the market order system among others i will not go into various ways this removes game complexity im sure both the game designers and community understand that i do fear that this is a avalanche waiting to happen i feel the base community enjoy and choose eve because of the depth of the game in my experience when games start to simplify people leave eve is still one of the more complex and involved games today so this is not a fear now however there is always some money somewhere waiting to fill a void i dont think anything i say will change decisions already made but i hope that the next thing i read isnt that implants are gone because the newbies did not realize how useful they were or that we all get remaps every 6 months instead of 12 because people are not patient thank youps it would be nice if a dev responded with insurances to the community that this is not a change of principle the game is not going through a slow simplification and that complexity will continue to be a focus of the team pss always welcome to add more depth to eve too
and this really should have gone into general discussion
skillgrinding is not complexity or depth
to be fair i dont see any of this as some huge evil change i only wanted to state that it could be the start of something not that it is all down hill from here sorry if i gave out the wrong impression
im sorry i missed the proposal in therenonsensical systems that impose an artificially high barrier or entry and make people quit learnings or that have little sense why are certain items not on markets have nothing to do with depthmore like errors that shoulda been fixed a while ago and just finally wereif the proposal is that they stop changing eve which in my opinion is changing for the better then not supported
there already where several threads that expressed the same should have added your opinion in them instead of posting in the wrong forum
lol wow rough group it is what it is
fyi i believe ccp avoids posting in this sub forum general discussion is a better place for this
ill give you the benefit of the doubtthe key to understanding the removal of learning skills is to realize that they truly are a unique casefirstly theyre the only skills which have no tangible gameplay effect by this i mean they dont change how well your ships operate or your standings or your ability to build things or anything along those realms they are the only skills like thissecondly theyre required for optimum performance regardless of what you intend your character to do it doesnt matter if youre a miner or a hauler or a mission runner or a pvper you can benefit from learning skills again no other skills fall under this categorythirdly they have a very clearly defined optimum strategy the sooner you get them the better off you are some people will tell you that its more fun to get other skills first and those people are right but fun isnt a strategywhen you combine these three you end up with a group of skills which have no tangible gameplay benefit but which must never the less be trained as soon as possible in order to gain the most benefit from them this means theres a strong motivation for newbies to learn them but learning them is boring so often a newbie will quit halfway through the learning skill process there are some people who will tell you that those newbies who quit are newbies that we dont want playing eve those people are elitist idiots who wouldnt know their head from their ass i have nothing else to say about themif you consider these issues in depth you can come to realize that learning skills are unique in that they deter newbies while not offering any interesting gameplay decisions the choice of learning skills becomes a matter of willpower not intelligence this is not good game designsimplification is not inherently evil sometimes things really are needlessly obtuse or vestigial
i approve of this comment
moved from assembly hall
i dont see the removal of learning skills as a simplifying or dumbing down of the game so much as a removal of an nuisance and a feature that is really nothing more than a waste of time
you must be a hoot at parties
i approve this product or service
you should because it doesntill repost this from where you should have posted the op to begin withlearning skills did not make eve any more difficult and removing them doesnt make it any easier youre confusing difficulty with tedium  both of which make things take longer or at least feel like they do but for vastly different reasons by your standard progress quest  a game you leave running in your status field is the most difficult game everconversely removing tedium is not the same as simplification  both may make things require less time but again for vastly different reasons if you want an example of the difference look at the old and the new pi interface the new one is much less tedious than the old one but actually far more complex and it actually adds difficulty by being streamlined
funny you should quote that as youre confusing difficulty with complexity
they didnt add that either so feel free to searchreplace in that post and itll still stand
whats complex in choosing the most bang for the buck coupled with the neck breaking tedium of needing to look paint dry for the next 3 monthsi really dont get you on this one crumple
i would think very little yet everyone insists that 1 month of learning skills is mandatory so apparently there is some complexity theresimilarly i cannot divine the source of this fiction
i think the source is reality
thats cute
i thought so too
so it seems
i like your sigs
yes yes it does

you just ruined all the suprisei was still getting new ones
needless complexity  badcomplexity that adds depth  goodi think learning skills are an example of the former they add no real depth or strategic decisions they are an unnecessary speed bump on the way to training skills that do stuffi dont see any loss of depth or good complexity from putting faction ships on the market eitheri love complex games like eve dwarf fortress etc but i dont see either of these changes as anything but good i havent seen a valid defense that either of these are dumbing down the game in any real way
are you really that dumbsimplification increases playerbase which increases revenue doesnt take a genius to figure that out the few bitter vets who quit are irrelevant in comparison to the hordes of new players a simpler game will bring in
learning skills and faction ship contracts arent complex theyre just obtuse and annoying especially to newer playersthese comments remind me of the people that say everquest was hardcore and complex because you had to sit at a camp for 20 hours straight in shifts to get a chance at a dropeve is still complex wormholes are much more complex pve than missions and pi is much more complex than mining invention and t3 production is much more complex than t1 production the game is getting more and more complex and thats a good thing imo
ill post it again here in the days of old there was a choice to train learning or to not train learning you would get them to say 3 or 4 and then stop most of these came per learned with your race some players would then spend 45 months for a long term advantagepayoff while other players would go for just getting useful short term skills and so the long term investment players would start with about 1200 sphour training time and slowly ramp up to 2100sphr aboutthen one day they changed the way training worked giving players x2 training speed for the 1st 16 million sp this shortened the 5 month learning path down to 15 months much faster than half like you might think with double training speed but then you think about the math implants like 5 have double the effect meaning a 5 give you 10 effectively increasing your sphour now let me ask you a true or false question with the new change each point of learning takes half the time to train false the 1st level takes half the time but it gives you 2 points instead of one because of the double training time so level 2 takes even less than half the time which gives you 2 more points and so on meaning that old 5 month learning skill plan to increase your sphour instead takes 15 months even shorter with those 10 implants more like 56 weeks total to get to 2100 sphr now thats 15 months of getting to 2100 sphr and 35 months of effective sp being trained meaning that the sp you wasted into learning pays off in about 3 months instead of 9 monthsa yearso what happens to the players that dont train learning skills in the 1st 16 million spthey are ed royally they have to spend 5 months when they could of spent 15 months to get learning skills to the same pointin the old system it was a choice because training early took you just as long as training them later more or less but by making learning skills train 6 times faster if you do them early it stops becoming a choiceill leave you guys with a terrifying facta player that does not train learning skills but then trains them after say 6 months will be 1 year behind a player that trains them right away
this is the same game that is adding ambulation p wont be long before they let you add animal parts to your avatarexpect more dumbing down and furries lots of furries
the game is very complex without the game getting in the way of itselfeven if you start training nonlearning skills on day 1 it will still take you a long time to max anything out but you might have more fun early on as faction ships not being on the market that was always silly if it aint illegal why cant you sell it on the market all this does is potential limit the isk revenue of scamming ho bags

when stealth bombers last received their fixes some time ago we were told they would be our antiblob tool whatever happened with that
to whom it may concernthis is my opinion on the learning skill sp rebate and urgent request to ccp to do a slight change in the rebate formulas that will kick in on dec 14th first of all i agree that this should be done since learning skills are viewed by some as one of the major parts of the steep learning curve thrown at new players however ccp needs to seriously reconsider the rebate amount i believe that anyone that has put in time for the learning skills was thinking long term in terms of years payback i believe that the base rebate should be a multiplier of the current points perhaps 12x currents sp assuming one has all lvl5 for learning it actually takes longer to learn them in the old system then it would with the proposed fixed attributes so assuming it takes 3 months to learn the skills using the old system i guess it would take 2 months with the fixed attributes proposed so we should receive the equivalent sp that we would receive for the 3 months of training time using the new system i hope i am making this clear i am not sure what the fair multiplier amount should be my guess is 12 on top of that we should receive a certain percentage bonus based on the total amount of current learning skill points this is to offset the loss of the long term advantage over the people that would not or did not decide to train up the learning skills so for example if someone had 1 million learning sp they would get the 12 x 1mil  1 of 1mil so that would be 1200000 20000 for a total rebate of 1220000 in refunded sp if someone had 2 million that percentage should be 2 and so on up until 5mil and 5 i would actually recommend having the percentage amounts higher perhaps starting at 2 and jumping 2 for each 1mil so at 5mil the percentage would be 10 this whole idea behind the percentage bonus should be based on the fact that those that chose to learn these skills were doing so to have an advantage over those that didnt on a long term basis by leveling the attribute playing field that advantage disappears and i feel isnt fair the compensation percentage should perhaps be based on a 5 year outlook  perhaps 10 ok i am being lazy here and not making charts and doing the hard number crunching to justify myself but i think i do have some logic in the above requests anyone else agree think i am an idiot but whatever you think i would hope someone at ccp will see some of my logic here thanks alex dua
i would rather see isk for remap to create a sink

can we get a list of schools you attended so we know who failed you
you seem to have no problem criticizing imaginary mistakes other people make why cant we blame you for yours your fondest wishes dont change reality im not 100 convinced by all of ccps we cant do that because arguments but a lot of them are perfectly valid the csm can  all they want but it wont change what the genuine problems are we elect an advisory council not a dev team  its not going to be everything i could dream of but it seems to be a major improvement on what has come before funny story  they did stop microtransactions
im missing the make certain factions more valid for mission running  part 2 csm proposal both threads that are mentioned in the wiki are closed i think its still very annoying that most corporations either have their l4 agents in lowsec or only have 50 courier mission agents this makes everyone and his dog mission for the few corps that do have high sec combat agents as theyre the most profitable at the lowest risk
a pos is supposed to look like a battle station rawr not scrap heaps floating in space  yuck
no insurance payoutsadjusted standings to 03concord pods gankersloss of some abilitys the use of medical facilities or repair shops or docking with npc stations in empire no more jita visitswe also should have the right to deny services when it comes to corp and personal contracts or market sale orders give a pilot and or a corp a negitive standing and they cant buy any of your stuff in market or contractsthats how id like to see it 
supported it doesnt make any sense
i dont mind either way about the graphics but the change in mechanics doesnt make sense the way you put it now we either cannot align and hold in preperation for a warp or else someone can charge up thier warp core and fly around and insta warp anytime the game mechanics change is just not practical graphics sure
no it still works the same the ship still has to align also if you change direction after using align to the warp core would discharge although changing your speed after an align to would not affect the charge
youre still missing the effects on small ship pvp especially in 00 constant movement while at speed simply changes what you are aligned to so in pvp you can fly around at full speed during an engagement and all you need to do to pull out is to be pointed in the right direction and warp this is part of fluid pvp and would be detroyed by your proposed change in game mechanics i suppose if you want all pvp to be shifted towards a slugfest last man standing sort of fight then this is just the right sort of change so i must still maintain suppourt for new graphics not for gameplay mechanics changes
i think im still missing what you perceive as the difference in order to pull out the ship must align and get up to speed small frigates already warp nearly instantaneously even from a full stop since the charge time is meant to be based on the amount of time it currently takes a ship to get to warp speed its pretty much exactly the same
yes to new warp graphics ie much faster accelerationdeceleration would be neat if you were decelerating so fast didnt even get a warning when you dropped out of warp ie one minute youre in ftl and the next bam gate camp confirming i would be most annoyed by this part but really right now even if you see the gate camp as you come out of warp theres not much you can doedit right supporting conditionally of course
ill support the new graphics but the new mechanics id have to think about
i couldnt agree anymoreeve needs to make itself more punchyperhaps we can still keep the accelerate align but once youre at that point you go right to maximum warp and then drop out of warp instantly with proper sound and visual effectsthe warp tunnel effect is a little on the light side so i would suggest making it a little bit more dramatic too
totally awesome idea and i totally support just the idea of being at a gatecamp and instead having the enemy fleet gently slide into the bubble having them all slam out of warp in a flurry of exotic particles would just be fantastic or seeing a fleet go to warp just too epic for words
1 agreed
i understand what youre trying to say since current mechanics require 75 of the ships speed and proper alignment if you meet these during a fight while not intending to warp you could still warp instantly if you so desired with the proposed plan even having met these requirements you will still need to wait for your warp core to charge if circumstances suddenly change and you know you now need to warp it could be costly im not supposing the op intends the wait to be huge probably directly proportional to what it is right now so frigates would still enter warp almost instantly though with some fine tuning to accommodate the frigates and fast ships which would be negatively affected by this it could work really well i highly approve of updating the graphics ships enter warp at such a lackadaisical rate this would add a little excitement to one of the most monotonous tasks in eve travel
eve needs more dramatic warpjump driveness
i like this it would look awesome make fleets warping in much more scarythough isnt there already a skill that effects warp time
im going to support this but not so much the mechanics changes honestly just decreasing accelerationdeceleration times when youre aligned and at 75 speed would probably be enough
tentative supportwhen a warp drive is being charged the ship should not be allowed to change vector
i dont exactly understand why people prefer the acceleration mechanic to one that is effectively the same for initiating the warp but better in other areaswith the instant effect of dewarp you can remove the delays on targeting after warp for both sides disconnecting warp from acceleration does take away the whole stasis web trick to launch ships off faster but theres nothing wrong with that in my book it could also potentially lead to further ship stat differentiation with nonwarp acceleration and warp drive charge timesupported
i support the graphical changes however i do not support the changes in mechanics
1 i fully supportadditionally i would increase the acceleration time to get to maximum warp giving the ships with 3 aus warp speed a real advantage not only one in 40 au systems
oh baby hells yes
oh yes this is actually the most logical and realistic warp feature i could think of it makes sense the rapid deceleration and accelerleration
pretty much this keep the method for achieving warp the same the game has been balanced for the current method but have the ship just punch offsuddenly come out of warp it would shorten warp time by only a few seconds and the effect would be so worth it
1 for warp drive punchynessmechanics mmmmm let ccp figure that out would be nice feel more awesome when you click warp 
agree with both graphics and mechanics changes
our ships tumble out of warp anyway i dont see why aligning matters
yeah id love to see the accelerationdeceleration process sped up a lot not sure i agree with everything in the op but anything would be an improvement over the current system
please no microtransactions i dont mind the current name change and i think changing your facial look would be ok not clothes i mean face shapesimply as if people can do that anytime they want a ton of people would be continually changing their looksnames continuallyeve is on the expensive side as it is also there should be no game advantage from any items if the do go and do this anyway the only people that would want to vote for pvp items are those that have tons of money or suck at eve and hope you add some overpowered weapon they can just buy for real moneyps please forgive the bad wordingstructure im very tired

though most people would like lag to completely disappear at the current level of technology it is impossible to accomplish this we must come to terms with this fact if we want to keep our groundbreaking single shard world ccp are trying their hardest with need for speed in a multifaceted approach that involves upgrades to hardware as well as optimizing software and fixing bugs unfortunately if you are waiting for gameplay in a 3000 man fleet battle to approach that of a 10 man skirmish youll be waiting a long time my idea approaches the issue of lag by adapting to it rather than fighting against itin a nutshell i believe when the server is having trouble dealing with requests and lag is taking hold the whole game should slow down as in slow motion or bullet time until it clears up againhere are a few reasons myself and others think this will be a good ideawhen lag takes hold you have to remember this is how the game is playing anyway requests from players are held in a queue and you have to wait a long time for your guns to activate or to target something or warp out at the moment the game is not designed to display it properly in the front end so although you can feel the lag it appears as though everything should be working my idea just makes it more visible and therefore usableit would give reinforcements a chance to arrive to the actual battle rather than at a standoff this is what we all want when we are on the way and hear the targets being read out over voice commsit would look really cool and give the opportunity for some nice frapsthe node would not crash any more because it is taking everything at its own pace its like a teacher who is swamped with children saying alright ill deal with you one at a time itll take a bit longer but at least you will all be sorted out rather than ill deal with you all at once aaaarrrrrgghhhh brain explodesit doesnt alter any mechanics for the game itself within the slow down scenario this keeps it from encouraging metagame so if we bring this many we can have x effect we can use this since all it does is literally slow the game down if it gets to a lag situation thanks to kabaal ssylistha in post 2 for this one you could play it off fictionally as spacetime distortion caused by a huge number of warp drives in one place and because the communication channels arent as jammed it could actually lead to improved gameplay turn on the matrix music and slowly maneuver your interceptor between ships thanks black dranzer in post 3 because the game feels like its working properly albiet slowly the problem will not be compounded by players clicking many times on each command which as we know adds even more commands to the list and creates even more lagby slowing the game down the server will be given a chance to handle all the requests that have been piled on top of it where as before it would be struggling to complete them all in real time with the physics engine breaking and missing node heartbeats resulting in player disconncetions this way it will be able to complete them all successfully at a pace it can handle most importantly players will be able to play the game albiet slowly rather than being unable to play at allremember the most important part of this suggestion is this slow down would only happen in a situation that would otherwise be unplayable due to lag so a useless critique would be nah thatd be annoying as hell if everything was all slow because the alternative would be the gamebreaking servercrashing lag we are all used to its kinda making the best of a bad situation
fight lag withlagthis seems too logical there has to be something wrong with itunfortunately it makes sense and is the only thing i can see compensating for lag theres none of the silly mechanics trying to influence numbers the only issue really is the one you pointed out about reinforcements technically having more time to arrive it also gives ccp time for node reinforcement not sure if they can do this on the fly but i understand its some possibility and it doesnt alter any mechanics for the game itself within the slow down scenario this keeps it from encouraging metagame so if we bring this many we can have x effect we can use this since all it does is literally slow the game down if it gets to a lag situationwould 2 this if i could a lag fix that isnt a stealth force people to x fleet size thread and would do what it intends with acceptable in my view consequences holy crabcakes
crazy but it just might work its worth a shot no
i would rather it wasnt needed but support it
sums up my reaction perfectlysupported
came back to see the image like above post almost like someone put a camera in my room while i commented
i am having trouble seeign the flaws here hmm
thanks for the support and ideas guys i hope you dont mind but i added two of your ideas to my main post and cleaned the whole thing up to make it a bit easier to read if you dont want your ideas in the op i apologize just send me a msg and ill take em out asap but thanks for your excellent input
id love for this to be tested on singularity 
well time is only some subjectiv illusion if it helps playing the game better i support thiswhy not sounds logical and time is relativ so why not relativ to server lag 
its making too much sense head explodes
why didnt someone think of this before
this would be awesome
totally supported fantastic idea mate
ccp should hire the op and instantly promote himi love this
pic says it all
this seems like too obvious an approach for ccp not to have considered it already but if they have and rejected it on the grounds that the playerbase wouldnt tolerate it then ill add my voice to the no do it chorus
i saw this on an iama that one of the devs did on reddit a couple of weeks back
 yeahthere are however 2fold issues with this1 with no lag ie lost cycles improperly applied dps on the scale that alliances are able to deploy capssupercaps were gonna see some scary dps applied capssupers instapopping every single cycle anyone 2 i can see alpha getting pretty scary3 goodbye armor rr we cant use you anymore as you take an entire cycle to give me hp hello shields instant hp the second i take dmg ftw conclusion plother entities who create new tactics will all start flying around in shield buffered alpha ships like macharioh waitthey already do nvm thenim all for it as the game will become moar playable lords servantpsedit i forgot to check support lolz
yes this would be awesome
i raised this idea in a thread in response to a presentation ccp posted a few months ago and a dev confirmed that theyd at least thought about itfound it
with everything slowed down u would have more time to react and start transversing since theyll lock slower in real time anyway and since its only the game speed that slows down your transversal will remain the same cause even the turrets will move and track in slow motion pretty much nothing that can happen in slow motion wouldnt happen at normal speed anyway except for smarter decisions cause ud have even more time to assess the situation and make your moves more strategically kinda like speed chess only even the pawns can move and think on their own
i see 1 large problem in thiswhile time for the people fighting would slow down other areas left in the game wouldnt this would allow large numbers of support ships to come to the aid of the fleet in that system inducing a metagame slow down the system so our reinforcements have something to reinforce when they get therethe only solution i can see is to make the gates and cynos only allow jumps out of the system when the system goes into this state
this is suuuch an epic idea nice work on thinking out the boxtrying to fix lag by tech and speed has an achilles heel in the form of a generalised version of the peter principlebasically whatever ccp does to create server headroom for fleetfights the player base will inevitably eat it up with more players at least this will help to keep the game functional and playable untill ccp can roll in the extra computing muscle to kick the fight up a gear or two1 and another from my alt
well they carry the raw drone bay capacity the corphangar and fuel bay the ship maintenance array 106 m3 on a carrier 25106 on a supercarrier all freighters are  106 m3 and only carry packaged ships and the implied support equipment for everything on the ship capitalsized modules fighterbomberdrone refit and maintenance ammo andor torpedo holdsfactories lots of crew and crew support jump drive and jump drive supply divisions and controls for access to the corphangar from outside the ship added reinforcement so it doesnt break under its own inertia etc ad nauseamboth carriers and supercarriers should be made quite a bit larger actually using the dreadnought as a basis of dockable size you might still have to justify jumping hyperions around as a partial repackage or strapping it to the outside or something but its better than a machariel dwarfing a thanatos and a moros the same to a nyx dedit since finnegans nitpicking and i dont feel like spamming the thread  what exactly do you call that nice plastic wrap aside from packaging for your ship despite the notclickingrepackage p
just a tangent but thats not true i routinely transport rigged ships with my charon back and forth across all of eve just set them up in a courier contract but yah make supers huuuuuuge

with some work this could be an excellent idea it does mean the multiaccount miners are going to be in for a hell of a run thoughone of the issues with probing down mining sites is barges cant give up a strip for a probe either barges need to have probe launchers built into them or not need probes at all to find roids also think of the hell hunting down 10 minute fields would do to mining ops perhaps offer some huge belts and some smaller ones at the same timeagreed this is one of the most annoying parts of running a barge having to know when to cut your lasers and considering the ui doesnt tell you exactly how long your strips have been running its approximated you still waste a lot of time even if you babysit it galphis idea would make this a nonissue so there is one potential solution therei also support the idea of comets and planetary rings offering other ways to mine both ice and orelots of great ideas here and whats nice is many of these have the side effect of making it much harder to macro mine
been a while so many threads have gone up for this and a few expansions later still nothingi really hope they dont leave it out yet againedit fixed link
i remember ther being a post about what types of missions and gameplay would be available in stations but these forums are horrendous and i cant find it according to a ccp posting in that forum there will not be combat of any sort inside stations when incarna first launchesas for my personal feelings on the subjecti dont think combat should be a focus in incarna it doesnt fit the mentality of most capsuleers rpwise it would be like seeing a bunch of sailors shooting each other at port hueneme capsuleers engage in a special form of combat one that only they can do and it would be wrong to make all of them thugs with guns and baseball batsaccording to the chronicles and back story capsuleers are the elite of new eden and are revered in every race and faction over the course of hundreds of years we have evolved into some of the most feared people in the galaxy and for good reason you see the beauty is we capsuleers dont need guns
cause we can crash nyxes into stations yeah honestly though theres something to be said for the op an incarna which breaks away from the principles that grew eve into being awesome and succesfull theres a fair few thoughts possible in regards to how well that can mingle and influence the direction of eve overall as incarna gains influence as a niche of the productmakes you wonder though whats the actual vision other than those old vids from devs saying uh we always wanted 3d avatars thats not a vision thats something to put on a christmas wishlist at amazonso supporting the discussion
why would station owners be allowing us to disembark with sidearms in the first place
been seeing this a lot it would appear agile scrum is breaking down in places and creating some real mindless zombie stuff
finn i would add the elevator pitch stuff to the op formatting it to draw the eye then for each why this idea would make great game play offer the implementation specifics simply as examples of how such a concept might be implemented or to clarify the intent for that idea if other players post about things that fit the vision for your proposal you can then link their posts with a brief bullet point as well what a proposal essentially needs to do is build a compelling case for what it is requesting in more ways than just upvotes the more you can offer which does that the better
nice to see that the csm is having a key interest in this discussion if they need more reasons for implementing incarna then lets give it to them1 depth beyond the mini games to avoid turning incarna into another form of playstationhome as a start i would recommend giving players at least the option of seeing their npc brokers regarding the traditional buysell orders they usually put up or seeing the manufacturing process of their production jobs on top of that maybe even allow players to be brokers or manufacturers themselves so as to further the competitive nature of eve online as players set their own rates to attract clients2 bridge toward dust 514 we already know there is a possibility that planetary interaction might play a role in dust 514 but incarna can help as this could allow dust players and eve players to directly interact with each other the planetary command center could serve as a gathering place between both sides this way both sides wont have to feel like theyre being treated as a number by players on the opposite side of server if its possible maybe even allow eve players to pump isk into the dust 514 economy if there ever is one as dust players are paid for their services while dust players can also pump isk back in eve as they pay for weapons equipment or other suppliesjust a few suggestions
as for the editing the op thing finn my personal opinion is two separate threads might help clear things up a we want combat in stations thread and i want combat in stations to be like this are going to get different votes and as long as both exist it it will show the level of support and have design offers unless ccp cant look at more than one thread and realize theyre connected or something silly like that
look i can add more and more off topic posts because i think im importanti dont need to get over myself if you have an issue with what i said explain yourself if not go back to your hole or i can keep editing your quotes til you cry into your power ranger pillows
well i suppose if any 13year old children are reading this you might get a chuckle out of them 1 arrogance is generally stupid2 instead of taking your options i could simply stay here and continue to be amusedby puerile statements like that it does wonders for my selfesteem anyways my issue was merely that i agree with nora skulds assessment in post 57
oh i missed that post entirely of course if you agree with that then i respect your opinion less but thanks for clarifying on what i need to address it helps with actual discussion as opposed to just making snide comments snide comments are fine and dandy but please include more than just that or theres no point crybabyfor nora  sorry i didnt know you loved your safe zones that much yes l4d does make itself more pansy and doesnt fit a real persistent world sense by having safe zones where the zombies who can throw a ing car cant break through the strategically placed door frames it is also a much more defined linear system than eve and operates under an entirely different viewpoint i love me some l4d but its certainly not eveyou cant have danger 100000 of the time time can only have up to 100 of it occupied if you want to be safe log out unlike some people who follow slippery slope poorly worded arguments with backtalk that copies the style of the person in an attempt to sound kewl would have you believe i think logging out of the game is a perfectly good time to be 100 safenow to throw a grenade on your paranoiastick to secure areas hire guards monitor access to your occupied areas keep some form of personal protection just because you suck at video games when youre no longer fighting floating rocks with 3 minute timer beam lasers doesnt mean being vulnerable  dying 247 you are vulnerable right now holy  nerf rl you also stick to more secure areas dont let strangers in your house have a police force and if you take advantage of your rights  a glock on the nightstand you also dont die everydayyou want a game based on risk danger and fighting to be more secure than real life you wonder why i think your opinion is bad if not ededited an and to an an
us grown ups can comment on more than one word in an entire post with valid reasoning and arguments i choose to let the anger out because stress is physical pain from not telling an idiot that he is one and i dont like to stress myself feel free to do it yourself if you can back it up with more than he insulted me the insult didnt work ad infinitum
true but im not required to do so but im not actually stressed amused would be more apt though we are going quite afield apparently i touched a nerve when i poked at your somewhat pretentious style in 49 are you just about ready to move on now weve accomplished that i think you were ridiculously pretentious and that you think you are very important
i like the idea some of it will work other parts not so much this could open up some interesting doors for piracy and political agendas capturing people mugging ransoming a prominent member of some allianceimo wartargets have no bearing on this stations are faction owned and have nothing to do with concord im fairly sure wars still need to be conducted outside with laser beams and autocannons remember adding a fps or even 3rd person over the shoulder element to combat could cause some 13 year old whos been playing call of duty and just joined the trial to wax every veteran pod pilot he comes across which is against the general drift of the game eve rewards planning and length of time not twitch skills i really like the idea of security levels or zones inside the station theyre enormous im sure there are a few bad neighborhoods getting caught doing something could have some unique consequences as well i for one do not want to be a minmatar running into johnnie law on an amarr station can anyone say racial profiling honestly the biggest reason i see ccp not wanting to do this it would be so much easier to just sit in a station and kill people than to fly around in a ship as eve was designed for who cares about training for the next best ship when you can cap a player with twice the sp you have with ease if you can kill anyone whats to stop some suicide ganker from buying a machine gun and mowing down a whole bar full of random people just for kicks there are a lot of whatif scenarios that overcomplicate the design and coding of this element when 8 years have already gone into the space part and it still needs help
thanks i may go with that i spent a couple days over turkey day vacation hammering out my ideas on this topic and this might as well stay up as an index of some suggestions anyways i may get to work on thinking up a cohesive vision for another thread entirely although its temping just to write so theres pewpew damnit
the main issue from ccps side with this could be that it would interfere with dust514 sales when you can have the egoperspective pewpew ingame in eve why care about their console game any more not saying some people wont still get dust but from your average pencilpushers perspective a new feature that potentially cost your company a few bucks might look bad
might work if they make dust twitch play and gis third person generic targeting sort of stuff but yah i need to write something up for a cohesive vision just got a lot on my plate now and it may have to wait until the start of december
it actually just occurred to me right now that instead of trying to implement punishment style security system in stations why not simply prevent the player from aggressing in highsec areas by jamming their weapons as they enter the highsec decks and corridors their guns will then have to be taken out of the area in order to work as for handtohand fights the aggressor should suffer a couple of days in the brig as soon as the corpown police comes in and arrests the aggressorwhat do you think
its about time the drone ai gets an update isnt it perhaps for next years expansion if were good podpilots lets consolidate ideas and propositions personally i came up with the following list that should fix all drone issues everyones having it also allows for a bit less micromanaging in hot situations while still maintaining full control if desiredproposed improvements to drone behaviour for all intends and purposes i will call the owner of the drones the mothership please do not confuse with an actual mothershipdrone and fighter stances aggressive drones will automatically engage anyone that is or was in hostile contact with the mothership this includes targets you previously fired upon defensive drones will only engage targets that are engaging the mothership or the drones drones will not attack hostilesstructures that had previously been attacked but are not engaging the mothership or drones passive drones will only act when a command is givensentry drones sentry drones now have the ability to mwd back to the mothership when command to return to drone bay is given this can not be interrupted once command is given sentry drones can not fire while they are returning fighters delegate control no change however the drone stances of the delegating pilot will prioritise over the mothershipglobal drone and fighters behaviour  commands commands given to drones are absolute this rule overrides every other rule aka drones now follow commands given focus fire drones will engage the same target if due to timing issues drones engage different targets they will consolidate and engage the target with the most drones on it assist drones and fighters will engage the target the assisted pilot is engaging protect drones and fighters will engage any target that is engaging the assisted pilot assist fleet drones and fighters will engage targets of the fleet on the grid based on closest target protect fleet drones and fighters will engage any targets that the fleet is engaged with on the grid based on closest target reconnect the mothership sends out a signal in all directions reconnecting to any lost drone on the grid that originally belonged to the mothership and signalling an automatic return to bay command grid wide effectrepair drones ability to repair mothership repair drone stances triage mode will repair targeted ship and its drones targeted ship is primary if damaged if not the repair drones will look and repair damaged drones of the targeted ship upon completion drones return to the mothership and orbit cover mode drones will engage and remain on targeted ship and continue endless repairs drones will not switch or return unless command is given or target is dead hehelets poke an example with the repair drone triage mode i have a feeling combinations would be askedflight of armor repairing drones if given the triage stance and is told to protect fleet assist fleet is not there for repair drones the rr drones will attempt to repair any ships that have armour damage and if done they will look for friendly drones with armour damage and when done they will return to the mothership
really like the look of these about time we had some drone love 
ive been waiting for similar proposals to happen for so long ive just about given up hope i really hope these can be implemented and soon at that
love the ideas and its definitely about time the drones got some love

what why is voting over how exactly are we supposed to voice our opinion on matters to the csm if you bury the link shortly after you post it i have serious doubts on how interested ccp and csm are in the opinions of the people who pay to play and fund every paycheck for the staff at ccp i might add this game when you dont make a great effort to tell people and make it easy for people to voice and vote there thoughts

voting was open for almost 2 weeks the thread was stickied and there were several eve news announcements about it  heck there was even a login bannerthe reason we closed voting when we did was simple we need to have the results available now in order to influence decisions that will soon be made about what will be developed for the summer 2011 expansion

i realy could use a can that had tabs store all my ordnance related bpos in one tab and a diffrent class of bpos in another tab and all in the same cani dont need a lock or any stupid thing that stops me from repackaging the can because of logs like station warehouseshell a freighter can with 7 tabs would be perfect im sure people would love to sort out there hangers with a can that had tabs so im sure it would be usefull not only to store bpos but almost anythingthanks
i was gonna say just use a normal can but then you mentioned tabs supported
just make it so that plex in future is 130th of actual value worth 1 day ie get rid of that 30 day part  never understood that to be exactand if you want to buy plex for isk you get the usedto conversion rate x day gtc  x plex instead of now 60 day gtc  2x 30day plexanother cool thing possible with that lets say you got 25 days left on your accountby now you can only convert chunks of 30days account time into a 30day plexwith the change you could convert as much account time into plex as you want and if there would be offers like colour your ship for 1 plex you could do thatplex then would be more like ccpvoucherscomparable to flying miles or whatever companycurrencykickback vouchers you are used tono need to introduce a new intermediate currency between rlmoniez and plex and iskjust use plexisk can be generated by ingame activity ccp gets no rlmoniez from thisplex can only be generated via rlmoniez and traded ingame ccp can use this as companycurrency once locked it ccp got the rlmoniezrlmoniez can not be used ingame
plex in smaller increments than 30d would be nice however im not entirely sure if one should be able to buy the plex in stat small increments if i remember correct main reason why they dropped 30d timecodes was that it was not economically sensible for them to keep selling them bcos of transaction fees reasonable compromise would be keeping selling the plex in 60 day chunks however when you convert it into ingame item the amount of them generated would be bigger while amount of days per one would be smaller ps i do not like idea of microtransactions
i would love to support this but it wont happen they get charged by the banks a fee per credit card transaction this is the reason why many institutions do not allow credit purchases under a certain dollar amount not a feasible business plan
over the years countless lines of text have been written about t2 bpos in the present forums overall there is two opposed schools of thought about those relics of the old i will skip the arguments in here as both for and against sides have been covered ad nauseum over the years and anyone interested enough can find same arguments over and over again with the help of eve search first school of though is supporting t2 bpossecond school of though is opposed to t2 bposi am myself in the second school of thought my main reasons of being opposed to them are following i dont own one ofc i do not believe that their distribution scheme was influence free a la t20 i dislike artificial entry barriers ie only way of getting one is to get one of the current owners to sell one there is no other reliable ingame way of getting one last one should not be confused with general like or dislike of entry barriers  for example supercapital production entry barrier is fine as anyone can in theory cross it with enough effort while for t2 bpo no amount of effort will help you if another player is unwilling to hand you over his invention is one of the game areas that is somewhat influenced by t2 bpos however influence on inevntion is relatively limited there is no competition between t2 bpos and invention invention can and will in a economically sensible way only fulfill the demand that t2 bpos are unable to meet due to limited production capablities of those putting a cap on t2 bpo profit per time unit where it is economically sensible to invent the item my proposal is to remove t2 bpos from the game just deleted like the learning skills some suitable compensation should be handed to current owners if that is impossible for some reason then in game mechanics needs to be introduced allowing one to acquire t2 bpo in some other way than having to rely on the current owners will to sell
i will support my own proposal
sure why not
not supported honestly id rather see them open up lotteries again but with loot drop like percentages to get certain bpos and not a hard cap on bpos that already exist and people have to find
either provide a way for others to get a t2 bpo or take them out of the game
hmm better take out all those alliance tournament ships the state raven etc because i cant get one either unless another player sells it to me for groan sake this has never been discussed before this is groundbreaking lets see how many people who dont own one jump on this because they think t2 bpos are isk printers
you too can get a t2 bpo do what i didtheres so many t2 bpos being traded on the forums these days that im inclined to think that only a very small percentage of the original lottery winners still have theirs its simply too tempting to sell it
you can always inventalso removing t2 bpos will result in a rise in prices and making them available to purchase would also be badt2 bpos are a major asset to many alliancs and corporations  to remove them would be to destroy the industrial backbone of many organizationsyou can buy a bpo  they usually go for 30 odd million depending on th shipmod which equals about 3 years investment
unique ships are a bit different thing everyone can get one thru skill and dedication all you have to do is to win an alliance tournament other than sitting in your hangar and looking pretty there is no real eve use for one they dont print isk for you  even not that little amount that t2 bpos do as far as being fountain of liquid isk  they stopped being that with invention as possibility to invent put quite reasonable cap on profitability of one most of them are reasonably profitable and thats about it main thing that sets unique ships apart form t2 bpos however is transparency of getting one with half of eve looking you will not get some dev tweaking the odds a bit like t20 did or going and telling his buddy how exactly lottery system works so he can maximize the odds of winning one  like man dont use that level 4 agent use this level 3 instead as only 3 people are using this one and you will have like 13 chance to get from hereim not saying this has never been discussed before i have been myself part of those discussions past 4 or 5 years by now there are good solid arguments by people wanting to keep them as well and equally solid arguments against keeping them in game and at this point its game design question as factions arguing for or against them can at best agree to disagree as has been proven on numerous occasions in many threads talking about t2 bposccp has demonstrated by axing the learning skills that they can and will dump content that is not good for the game and this thread is here to ask them to take a good look at t2 bpos
hey guys i am too lazy to farm up the isk required to afford a t2 bpo so can we please just take them all away from the game gob
if you really think that you would make much more money with a bpo than from invention you are an idiotnot supportedi dont own any t2 bpo and although i could afford one i dont see the need
sounds good to me
this there should either be a way to get them in game mechanics not overpriced second hand market or they should be gone
you gave whiners a finger learnings and now they want your leg t2 bpos go go ccp do it  this will bring you a lot of new short term players
proposal is just as bad as it was the last 100 times it was suggested
every current item in game should have an availability in some way excluding sales of those currently in existence with the exception of vanity items or tournament rewardst2 bpos should be turned into 5 years of what they manufacture too
op is at least being refreshingly honest when he says the main thing he doesnt like about t2 bpos is that he doesnt have one and doesnt feel like working to get the isk to buy one
correct on not having one part although isk is not an issue isk can be made with effort and getting one should not be effort free afterall same as one can get personal titan with some effort what is mainly rubbing me in the wrong way is that i would have to buy one from another player instead of having some ingame way of getting one well other than hoping that someone is stupid enough to fly one around in shuttle and im the lucky one popping it and looting one around as good probability of seeing that as seeing a pilot eject from state raven in front of me although my personal preference would be getting rid of them altogether as invention is perfectly capable of fulfilling the demand of t2 stuff for the eve and that would open up some new possibilities for it like positive me prints for example by making the initial bpc count towards quality of end product for example implementing some mechanics to get one in game is for the case if they cant be removed for some reason
that is my standpoint as well
there is you can buy one
the way t2 bpos were acquired was unfair but it would be even more unfair to remove them so no
buying an ingame item from another player playing the game isnt an ingame way of acquiring an itemoh carniflex just when i compliment you on your refreshing honesty you have to come out with some meretricious tat like that edit why not try something more creative that solves multiple problems at once for instance suggest a new drone npc consumable drop that increases the me of invented bpcs in return for correspondingly reduced alloy drops
this is the reason why they were not removed when invention was added and the reason why they never will

bitter vets are about the only voice that holds back the marketing departmentthey have a vision where eve has an unlimited audience if only it can be made easy for the lowest common denominator simple accessible to allthey are wrong
why would a new person care about beating the sp of a vet its all trivial hogwash and has no basis in the reality of eve the reality is there is a terminus and that terminus is the same for everyone no matter how fresh or jaded you arewhat it has done is force the gap to be about implants and not grinding skills that delay the funthe new players get to have fun sooner that is the bottom line and the only gap that ever mattered is the one created by learning skillsi dont think ccp saw it that way as for the max learning skills now crowd they have been saying that since learning skills existedconspiracy theory seriouslythere is no such thing as extra in eveand bush planned 911
when i was training learning skills i was trying very hard to not cancel my subscriptions it is not fun what purpose could it serve to force new players to deal with it just because you had to selfish muchyay straw man hi how are you havent seen you for almost an hourthere was no choice you trained learning period you may not train it right away but nobody plays this game and doesnt eventually train them all nobodyso what is the point of them if they are the sp equivalent of the must have module there are choices for everything else in evelearning skills were not a choice they were a grind pure and simple
if it wasnt for the bitter vets in my corp i would be training stupid skills right now thanks guys
the debate is literally pointless did you not read the devblog ccp explicitly say that they considered all sides of the issue and they are going to remove the learning skills whatever we say now the time to start fighting against their removal was a few months ago now the campaign has been fought and the proremoval guys wontake your nice veteran sp bonus and spend it wisely youre not going to change anyones mind now and it wouldnt matter even if you did
true ccp made up their mind and we all know what that means usually that doesnt necessarily mean tho that people if they are inclined to have to stop to express disagreement just because the man sticks it to you doesnt mean you cannot tell him you think he is full of s

supported  please as well nebulas
there are currently ecm strength and ecm optimal range rigs however there is no eccm rigs i think eccm rigs lets say 45 strength per rig 100 calibration would be a cool thing to implement
anything which tones down this overpowered bull gets my support
if reasonable then ok but since frogout supports you this will not go anywhere
so you want a rig that buffs the effectiveness of exactly one single module type which is eccm you are aware that the ecm rigs you mentioned affect multiple modules the racial jammers as well as the multipspecturm ones heck perhaps even the ecm bursts not sure cba to check tbhtbh i think youd have more success asking for factiondeadspace eccms to be implemented introducing another rig just to buff eccm fitted by 45 seems a bit too limited
i would like a reverse ecm rigmodule it would make it possible for the ecm ship that is jamming me to jam itself the jamming strength of the return jamming signal reflected off of my ship would be half of the one going to my ship so if someone is jamming my harbinger with a module that has a jamming strength of 30 points they would have a reflected jamming signal applied on to their ship of 15 pointsthis would make it harder for one ship to shut down 3 or 4 ships in a small fleet
i think everyone can agree that ecm in its current iteration is unfun unchallenging for both sides and either game breaking or useless depending on the scenario the most common scenario i see ecm used in is in getoutofjailfree scenarios in small gangs or usually by gatecamps so they can avoid similar sized gangs completely it is a mechanic which tends to fail in fleet fights due to ehp of such ships or completely overpowering against small gangs what it never is is funi recommend everyone reads through this thread written by malancanis which is a very good read and has a lot of good arguments both for and against the overwhelming majority of people tend to agree ecm is horrible but we need to give caldari specialised ships something else bad points about ecm it destroys solosmall gangs especially in situations where the targets are outnumbered it is an unfun mechanic there is no skill or synergy involved click on your jammers and pray the specialised caldari ships are worthless without ecm ecm is usually either game breaking or worthless there is very little middleground the counter eccm is often difficult to be fit on small gang ships and solo players eccm is also worthless when you are not facing ecm  smaller ships like interceptors frigates etc are permajammed by caldari specialised ships it is incredibly binary you are either jammed and cant do anything or you are unjammed and can do everythinggood points about ecm it gives a useful role to players with little sp it is useful at breaking up spider tanks and logisticsi propose making ecm reduce a targets maximum targets from 0 to 1 instead and buffing it so that is a bit more effective on specilised ships as it is now this will make specialised caldari ships i think that the capcitor use for ecm jammers should also be significantly reduced  what this acheives people are no longer completely shut down by ecm this will be a great benefit to scenarios as when mentioned above are used to get out of jail free this makes it much less frustrating in solo and small gang scenarios while still being crippling it also helps balance ecm against small targets where it currently is a permajam on every single frigate except for the caldari afs from a falcon battleships are still crippled by their scan resolution ecm retains its ability at breaking up spider tanks jammed rr battleships will have to choose between shooting hostiles or remote repairing friendlys it also means that an organised fleet can switch targets and jammed battleships even reacting quickly will have to contend with their scan resolution logistics suffer the same fate and logistics which rely on cap transfer basiliskguardian will lose all repping power all together this role would still be a incredibly useful and game changing ability for a player with low sp secondly i propose moving the ecm strength bonuses to role bonuses on specialised caldari ewar platforms this frees up a bonus capcitor bonuses should also be scrapped to free up bonuses and because of the earlier ecm change mentioned to reduce capacitor coststhe next thing and probably the biggest hurdle in this proposal is to give caldari ewar platforms a use outside ecm and for this i suggest replacing all the current ecm strength bonuses which will be moved to role bonuses with 10 optimal range and falloff to all electronic warfare damps target painters tracking disruptors and ecm this would be a nice change in making caldari electronic warfare platforms still maintain electronic superiority through increased range while not stepping on the toes of the other recon unique bonuses it gives a lot of versatility to caldari ewar platforms such as allowing them to damp or target paint at extreme ranges
thirdly i would increase the drone bay of all electronic warfare platforms to a decent size for that class and would also replace any existing range or cap related bonuses for ecm with shield bonuses the net result is what this would look likethe new griffin 10m3 drone bandwidthbay 15m3 totalcaldari frigate skill bonus 10 bonus to ecm remote sensor dampener target painter and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5 bonus to shield resists per levelrole bonus 75 bonus to the strength of ecm targer jammer strengththe new kitsune 15m3 drone bandwidthbay 15m3 totalcaldari frigate skill bonus10 bonus to ecm remote sensor dampener target painter and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5 bonus to shield resists per levelelectronic attack ships kill bonus10 bonus to shield hitpoints per level5 bonus to capacitor capacity per levelrole bonus 100 to the strength of ecm target jammer strengththe new blackbird 25m3 drone bandwidthbay 25m3 totalcaldari cruiser skill bonus10 bonus to ecm remote sensor dampener target painter and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5 bonus to shield resists per levelrole bonus 75 bonus to the strength of ecm targer jammer strengththe new falcon 30m3 drone bandwidthbay 40m3 totalcaldari cruiser skill bonus 10 bonus to ecm remote sensor dampener target painter and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level5 bonus to shield resists per levelrecon ship skill bonus10 bonus to shield capacity per level96 to 100 reduced cpu need for cloaking device per levelrole bonus 150 bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strengthnote i have replaced the 5 medium hybrid turret bonus with shield resists i feel that it is a more useful bonus and the falcon has gone from 2x light drones to 3x medium drones 2x light drones which should more than offset the damage lossthe new rook 25m3 drone bandwidthbay 50m3 totalcaldari cruiser skill bonus5 bonus to heavy and heavy assault missile launcher rate of fire per level10 bonus to ecm remote sensor dampener target painter and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per levelrecon ship skill bonus5 bonus to shield resists per level10 bonus to heavy assault  heavy missile velocity per levelrole bonus 150 bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strengththe new scorpion 50m3 drone bandwidthbay 125m3 totalcaldari battleship skill bonus20 bonus to ecm remote sensor dampener target painter and tracking disrupter optimal range and falloff per level20 bonus to ecm burst range per level5 bonus to shield resists per levelrole bonus 75 bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strengththe new widow 50m3 drone bandwidthbay 125m3 totalcaldari battleship skill bonus5 bonus to cruise and siege launcher rate of fire10 bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity per levelblack ops skill bonus5 bonus to shield resists per level25 bonus to cloaked velocity per levelrole bonus 150 bonus to the strength of ecm target jammer strengthnote i didnt give this ship an ewar optimal range bonus mostly because it seems the shield bonus would be better suited to its role
this results in making the caldari specilised recons more front line the extra drone bay makes them do semidecent damage and provides them more offensive and defensive support against hostiles similar to that of other recons the tank bonuses help give the ships more direct combat ability as well as helping to take away their fragileness the increased range to all ewar types option gives a niche to caldari ewar platforms and to fit different types of ewar and work at more effective range giving them more versatility and allowing them to fill more ewar roles without stepping on other recon toes the scorpion still maintains its role as the king of range ewar while also gaining the ability to go toetotoe in a more direct combat range and gives the caldari more of a solo bs similar to other t1 bs of the other races i believe this is a suitably replacement for ecm going from 0 to 1 target which is still incredibly effective at shutting down other ewar platforms and remote logistics the drone bonuses also give caldari pilots something more worthwhile to use drones for partilculary heavys in the case of the scorpion eccm is still useful and will still be needed on logistics remote repair battleships and electronic warfare platforms i think this would make ecm a lot more fun and strategic and also give the caldari specialised ships more direct combat capabilities as well as increasing their ewar options tldr ecm and electronic warfare drones reduces max locked targets from 0 to 1all caldari specialised platforms gain additional drone bays appropriate for their classall caldari specialised platforms gain tank related bonuses 10 optimal range to all ewar types and their strength bonus moved to a role bonusecm cap use is halfed
anything else you want perhaps nerf effectiveness of all other racial ew by 50 flat how about looking the word balance up in a dictionary first some people no just no kthxbb
i generally like the ideas that make jammed ships not totally useless i had proposed an ecm change a while back were the jam dice is rolled independently for every lock or lock in progress of the targeted ship so it would just reduce the target selection like sensor damps also do just based on chance not range this goes into a same directionof course proposing ewar bonuses other than ecm for caldari while leaving the other races out in the rain is unacceptableexcept for the suggestion for a bit more tank all the other proposed buffs are completely out of whack so not supported
boring fix from how i read it ecm is one of those things that is so hard to touch because with the nature of it you either nerf it to uselessness or have it too op currently it is more on the op side but has a few things keeping it from being too far gonethe 01 fix will either be effectively the same or a drastic nerf for larger ships if the 1 target remaining isnt the most important they might as well have 0 targets if it is the most important you feel the effects of it at a significantly lower levelthe idea of removing the range and giving drones doesnt sit well with me i dont want to switch to a gallente weapon system focus ecm and ewar in general needs more variety when it comes to range as it is i cant really see a bad thing to making ewar boats sturdier but that is a purely biased opinion and id rather someone else comment on itfixing ecm itself involves removing the random aspect having varying levels of effect and imo altering it to one ecm line with scripts reloading every target switch would be bad enough having to go refit is silly when there isnt another ewar system that necessitates refitting when you intend to use the same type of ewaras for messing with the randomness variation effect itself or what have you the nature of what its designed to interfere with makes that a tricky proposition as opposed to how clear cut things like the module issue are with it making it not remove the locks but hide them for the duration so the ships dont have to relock is one of the more common common sense suggestions my own personal idea was that it should negate the effects of the ewar of the target
i would appreciate it if you would reply with something more constructive i have spent a long time thinking about these changes and would prefer it if you at least spent your time discussion it rather than using a roll eyes smiley and a strawman argumentlets look at some of the changes i have made to various shipsthe griffin which is arguably the strongest change i suggestedit now can do an additional 59 dps with hobgoblin iis 47 with warriors it has gained just under 1000 effective hit points assuming it has a medium shield extender ii fit a bit under 1300 with shield rigs if it had no tank it would gain a whooping 300 effective hitpoints i fail to see how this is game breaking it does a bit more damage it is a bit more harder to kill its not going to soloing rifters or any combat orientated frigates and solo baitfit griffins which relied on ecm actually got nerfed the 10 optimal range bonus is not that useful on the griffin itselfi think those changes are reasonable well thought out and componsate the griffin fairly i am of course not a game designer the only experience i have is playing this game for nearly 4 years and being one of the top ranked solo pvpers in this game so my changes could well be flawed id appreciate it if you could constructively argue with me and provide a reasonably example of where these changes would overpower the ships
i was expecting more resistance from players who actually thought i was nerfing their playstyle than from people who would think the buff is too strong i agree that the all electronic warfare optimal range bonuses is a little strongmaybe i should reduce it or get rid of it entirely i just thought just drones and just tank would be a little on the weak side of replacing total lockdown from ecm its nice to see lots of peoples opinion on ecm and how we can change it so if nothing else comes from this proposal we can at least have a decent selection of opinions and ideas
i approve of the 01 idea as this would allow soloers who are falconised to still kill whatever is tackling them and escape and remove the get out of jail free card for people who use falcon altshowever i think giving ecm boats bonuses to all ewar is a tad on the silly side as is the drone idea especially with ecm drones as broken as they are
good idea with 01 ecm needs to be looked at
i wholeheartedly agree that ecm needs a thorough onceover to bring it back from the current either op or meh place it is nowif you are going to add firepower and utility and tank to all the ecm boats then what are you going to trade infittings capacitor massinertiaif they truly are to be the pinnacle of ewar platforms then there has to be a crippling sideeffect somewherei would suggest a doublingtripling in cap use of ewar modules ie not reduction which you also want to make the one ship incapable of shutting down an entire gang as it is now if people want ewar they should have to sacrifice the pilotsdps to achieve itexample ecm boat should not be able to run more than 23 modules with a mwd fitted for instance they are of course free to augment cap through injectionmods thus sacrificing survivabilitycombined with tankdps increase this should balance out nicely as the power inherent in the ships now comes at a cost tit for tat its the eve way angels exemptedwill still scale horribly and be useless on fleet level like all ewar but the tenman gang will no longer be wiped out by the fiveman who just happened to have a single bbrookfailcon availableby the way what about eccm what role will it play in this new world of all ecm boat gangs you envisionyou correctly mention it being difficult hah to use on smallgangsolo ships and that it has no benefit when not actually facing ecm unlike all other counter modules  a lot of the solution may be in adding to eccm rather than ecm  platformsone guaranteed locked target per eccm andor weapon sigresexpvel improvement andoretc
not 100 on the changes suggested but support the proposal in general
word homie
i dont care how its done but ecm is ridiculous against solo  small gangs and as you say becomes less and less important against increasing numbersit is unfun whether using it or having it used against you and it derives its benefits primarily from chance rather than thoughtful usesupported

you stole my name you dirty piece of  
under your system i can jam someone and they can still lock me and kill me even without eccm fittednounder your system ecm boats lose the disadvantage of being made of tissue paper while also having ecm ships gain a helluva lot more jamming strength than they currently have or keeping their strength the same while also gaining massive rangeeccm needs a buff to make it useful outside of an ecm situation i like the guaranteed lock idea but as it is its stacking strength particularly the stacking strength of remotelyprojected eccm and yes that does get used increases peoples sensor strengths massively rendering ecm virtually useless against that target after the second eccm your complaint that eccm is hard to fit on ships is also invalid considering that its hard to fit a lot of things on ships and one of the focal points of eve is that you cant have it all at one time anywaysyou also make the assumption that everyone has the same sense of fun or enjoyment as you and thus apply your ideas of fun to ecm warfare welcome to eve this is not the casefrigates being permajammed or nearly so by specialized ecm boats is how its supposed to be keep in mind that in order for that to happen an ecm ship has to get its jammer strength up with mods thus reducing tank even furtherthe entire proposal works out as a major buff to caldari ecm warfare with no bonuses lost and many advantages gainedshameless hijackingboost base sensor strength on all ships by 23 and nerf yes i said nerf eccm strength by 25 while making eccm modules guarantee at least one lockable target at all times leave existing ship stats besides the sensor strength alone before you cry that this would make eccm useless remember that it stacks almost exponentially under the current mechanicsthere frigates and other ships which also could use it get a boost eccm is worthwhile to fit but not op and solopvp lives on oh and logistics would still be able to target someone but they would have to either stick with their cap buddy or repair someone but not both unless its their cap buddy and cap buddies dont have dps
so is it that you enjoy being jammed or that you enjoy jamming others given we all have our different ideas of funbut aside from that i like your changes to the eccm modules problem is they are still a big sacrifice to a fit i think and esp if you are going out soloingsecond edit btw you only need to look at the other forms of ewar to see how ridiculous ecm is atmplease visit your user settings to reenable images
you probably missed his main change to ecm mechanics alltogether which would easily justify boosting dedicated ecm ships in other ways and posted without reading the thread right dimwitoh im not in 100 agreeance with the op but the basic idea of always being able to lock 1 target is magnificent and would be a badly needed gesture towards the solo and small gang communities supporting this
i hate ecm as it is
the more i think about this the more i like it makes ecm more effective as a genuine force multiplier but stops it from being completely debilitating against small gangssoloistsfrigates
i concur
no way im going through all this again have fun and let me know how it turns out
i like iti think giving the scorp a resistance bonus on top of her 8 meds is to much if you use it without ew modssomething like the brawler scorpion that was on the table during the last ecm changes would be more reasonable in my opinion as heavy ecm platform that fits well in heavy gangsthis would require a rof bonus and another lowbest taken form the high slots and a higher ecm strength instead of rangeedit forget to support
i dont agree with the details and most of your ship rebalancing but i agree with the idea in general and the 01 target locked is a good idea the ecm ship should normally be sitting well out of range anyways so that change wont threaten it
supporting gob
on the whole i agree with the main ideas of the proposalecm is overpowered and in order to balance it the ships that use it need to be rebalanced with iti read another thread a while back about an ecm change proposal that involved gradually reducing the number of locked targets down to 1 based on how many ecm mods the pilot is using on one targeted ship in this proposal there would also be at least one guaranteed target lock overall the proposal made sense but it left the ecm pilots ship too underpowered for the difference in its ewar effect i for one would gladly trade giving ecm pilots more dps and some more tank if it meant i could have at least 1 guaranteed locked target the bonuses to other ewar however i cannot support even slightlyheres something else that may be worth adding to the balance issue the first 2 or 3 seconds of a successful ecm lock besides having the ability to bring down the number of locked targets to 1 if there are enough ecm mods will hide all locked targets from view and usage at the end of those 2 or 3 seconds the locks are reinstated as if nothing happenedbesides the locks that are being negated by ecm normallythis will still give at least a brief window of opportunity for someone to escape if that is their goal but not be gamechanging in its effects in pvp for the most part
i really like the 1 target maximum idea while boosting strength which will make it great vs rr etc gangs and useless at raping soloers yes you can use a lot of other things to protect tacklers tds are very good at it and not randomthe boost to to other ewar might be too much if you want falcons to be as good as other races recons but fine if they are supposed to be the best ewar platform will also make flying them a lot more fun as you will actually have lots of tactical choices in how you hit f1f8
fail at reading comprehension 101 much i didnt state i wasnt in agreeance with ecm in need of some looking at i did state though that the details of the proposed changes are a major balance issue or more like f interracial balance lets buff caldari ewar ships and to the opi could care less i happen to remember you trolling providence under cva management for miner and ratter kills tho back in the day so spare me get over your ego issue and wave your epeen in someone elses face k i dont even bother to check battleclinic stats personally yeah so whatever gives you a woodyoh yeah 59 extra dps on a t1 frigate hull is totally negligible as is about 1k extra ehp who you think youre kidding here the griffin has supposedly by game design the role as a cheap ew frigate not a heavy hitter but hey for the sake of theorycrafting lets proceed on your path of changing ew for the lolz lets see how about changing the amarr pilgrim in the same spirit hm i give up the td bonus heck i graciously even forsake the option to fit tds at all on it after this epic sacrifice i want in exchange doubled drone bay size 125mUFFFD bandwidth 5 heavies kthx 2k extra armor hpyeah right hope you enjoyed the show please come back for next weeks issue of eve is about solopwnmachines
lol a heavy hitting 70 dps  4k ehp frig good one
mate it does almost as much dps as a maulus now that thing hits like a friggin truck
right way to drag it out of context not mentioning that the context was a t1 ew frig hull is pretty pro but hey im totally positive you guys fly 150 dps t1 ew frigs all the time right you also solo titans in your rifters right must be why your excuses for a corp dominate all of eve oh wait
i have done the research and they said they were bringing them back just making an effort to gently nudge ccp to remind them that this is still a wanted effect
i would like to see target painter bonus for mimi ships switched to tracking disruption bonus insteadmimi aside from the phoon do not use missles nor are we the missle race mimi is about speed speed and more speed please change bonus to tracking disruption i think it would be a far better fit
id like the sensor dampening from gallenteans to be replaced by websthat also wont happen
the increased signature also helps you getting better hits with guns sigradius is part of the tracking formularnot supported
you are aware that tracking disruptors are the amarr racial ew so with you proposed change in exchange you would dump the target painter bonus on the amarr ships or what right because amarr are widely know as the proliferate missileusing race
i think the current sun occlusion is dreadful i mean the star seemingly shrinks when an object goes in front of it this is fairly unrealistic this is even more noticeable when you warp to the star and position your ship correctly the whole star still seemingly vanishesi propose this make the star glow shine from behind the ships even when it is fully occluded it will just look so much better in my opinion
i know there has been a lot of discussion especially recently about the learning skills  ie they are a waste of time they discourage new players they are irrelevant to game play etc while i agree with these observations learning skills also fit the overall premise of eve in that you have to plan your character to be effective the real problem with learning skills is that once you have them trained besides allowing you to train other skills faster they truly are irrelevant to playing the game ccps solution to wipe out this skill set though it is about as equitable as possible especially in the timeframe given to get it done has an underlying effect of basically making eve easier a new player comes into the game and just starts training skills without any conscious effort given to the future of that character and at the same time everyone who has these skills trained gets a massive influx of skill points to assign however he or she wishes thus immediately making them stronger the fact that the vast majority of players here in the forums are ok with this or more precisely applaud this decision truly amazes me since most of them are usually against anything that would make eve easier the dumbingdown syndromemy proposal is thisinstead of completely and irrevocably wipingout the learning skills set revise each of the skills so that they become relevant instead of just being used to increase your training times add a function to each of the skills that effects an aspect of the game relevant to the skill as an example the learning skill itself in addition to increasing all training times could add an extra amount of time to the skill queue for each level trainedexampleslearning skill  increased queue timeanalytical mind  bonus to all scanning resultslogic  bonus to target acquisition similar to motion prediction but affecting all targetinginstant recall  slight advantage in games of chance incarnaeidetic memory  extra jump clones or ability to renamealter a jump cloneiron will  bonus to ship resistancesfocus  bonus to response timesspatial awareness  bonus slot on one ship per level or permanent bonus to cargodrone capacity per shipclarity  increased maneuverabilityempathy  bonus to faction standingspresence  lower base price on goods from npcs including incarna npcsplease note that the above examples are merely that examples of what could be done with the learning skills i am not suggesting that those specific bonuses be used although they could be perhaps with modification the point is why make the game easier with a quick kneejerk destruction of an established game mechanic when the skills could be made useful and enhance the game it may take a bit longer but in the long run everyone wins
supporting my topic always forget to do that oo 1
so your solution is to make them even more required therefore increasing the problem
no if you want new skills propose new skillsthese names must forever be wiped from new eden
how does this increase the problem the main reason everyone hates learning skills is that they add nothing to game play while requiring their training in order to keep up with everyone else by giving the skills gameplay relevance they would no longer be a waste of time you would gain the decrease to training times while also gaining bonuses to actual game mechanics and features this doesnt increase a problem nor does it dumbdown the game by eliminating the need to actually plan your characters paththey would be no more required than they are now but by training them you gain immediate benefits just like any other skill in the game wheres the problem
i have to disagree a lot of the suggestions that you gave such as bonuses to jump clones targeting etc are already provided by other skills outside the scope of the learning skills and besides the majority of the players feel that the learning skills are the main reason why new players get so easily confused about how to manage their training i have played for well over two years and yet i only have 800000 total learning skill points i honestly didnt need them anyways to be able to train for the hulk blackbird ecm modules mining modules t2 turrets etc in fact as training time went by i really didnt care for training time anymore its gonna take me 34 days of training to cruisers level 5 pfft whatever start the training
and the current learning skills dont have immediate benefit
not as far as actual game play is concerned
as i stated below the list of examples these were just examples of what could be done i took them off the top of my head with some serious thought like a dev teams brainstorm session the skills could have added bonuses that either enhanced already existing skills or added to areas that are lacking my examples are not suggestions per se just an indication of what could be done instead of just erasing them from the game
why not let learning skills die but then add a bonus attribute to other skills like evasive maneuvering 5 also gives you 5 pts in perceptionits an absurd idea just let it die learning skills are goners and no amount of silliness will bring them back
my god what is wrong with this community if someone suggests a proposal or idea that goes against the general consensus of the forum population immediately the idea is silly stupid a troll ludicrous and absolutely without merit if you dont agree with it just say so or even better in a mature fashion explain why you are against it and perhaps have an intelligent discussion the vast majority in here are so closedminded they couldnt or refuse to see anything good in an idea if it is in any way different than their own perception of what should be or what they wantlike it or not the learning skills could be saved and have a very positive influence on the game and everyone would benefit without the game losing a mechanic the loss of which essentially makes the game easier of course the proposal is probably too late and unless the majority in here suddenly decided to open their eyes and forget for a moment that they hate the learning skills as they are now and voted for this proposal it will vanish into the plethora of other proposals that just faded away but my deciding to submit the idea here is no more or less silly than any other and probably has more merit than most
your idea is just bad thats all since it doesnt fix the original problem and just makes it worse everyone with a working brain who isnt looking at his own bellybutton can see it clearly this is why your idea wont ever get much supportlearning skills are just bad game design dont add to the depth of the game and needlesly discourage new players from continuing to play the game the desision to get rid of them was made long ago all the serious discussion has been about how it should be done so it causes the least amount of harm to the people who have trained them and doesnt make training too slow any idea that keeps training skills in any form wont be considered seriously at this point im sure you think your bellybutton is amazing and people just dont get how amazing it is but no it is a disgusting hole full of lint and grime and you should wash it more oftenneedless to say at this point but im not supporting your idea
pretty much no one wants them saved they are an abomination that should be gone foreverthey will stay an abomination as long as they are required to be trained in the beginning which they will also be in your proposalif you think pressing the button to start training learning skills is hard then i got some bad news for you
tedious does not equal hardremoving the learnings makes the game better everyone hates them because they are terrible in all the ways something can belet them die the more painfully and the brighter the flame of the fire they burn in the better
malcanis law whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of new players that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer older players
your proposal indicates a lack of understandingthe issues with learning skills are multifaceted the fact that they have no gameplay affect is one of the aspects which makes them obnoxious but it is not the aspectwhat you suggest is buffing learning skillsthis would serve to marginally ease the boredom inherent in training them but it would encourage their training far more than before effectively amplifying the problemcan we please just let these things die in the ass without a whole lot of kicking and screaming
yup exactly im not even gonna bother answering the rest of them especially the child with the bellybutton fetish and an apparent iq half the size of her age
namecalling helps your agrument true storyanyway this solution makes the problem worse previously not training these skills was shooting yourself in the foot with these changes not training would be more akin to amputating a legjust let learning skills die and let me have my 12 attributes pleasenot supported
well as you can see the general consensus is that the learning skills are no longer useful to us if they ever were useful at all
only if they can be fired by really big ships suggestion lets call it the fotb missile fortb obviously stands for f off terrible blobbers light fotb missile to be launched only by dreadnaughts heavy fotb missile to be laucnhed only by supercarriers cruise fotb missile only to be launched by titansoh and make the launchers for them only mountable on caldari ships and ammo price like 1 iskmissile thereafter we can sit back and have a jolly good laugh at what goes for balance these days
seriously what makes you believe that such a weapon would be a good thing
it would stop blobs from existing this is a good thing
i think these are long overdue and would help add more counters to the currently very few working ones for ecm

currently if you are a sensor damped and fit a sensor booster to counter it that sensor booster is still useful to you if you are not damped same for tracking computers and tracking disruptors and cap injectors for neuting currently eccm doesnt give any combat bonuses if you are not attempting to be jammed therefore i propose adding a secondary effect to eccm and signal amp modules

i propose adding the following signiture radius values to ecmecm used from a frigatedestroyer 40m sig radiusecm used from a cruiserbattlecruiser 120m sig radiusecm used from a battleship 400m sig radiusthe centurion implants could be buffed to reduce the sig radius of ecm modulesecm would act the same way as missiles do now with explosion radius if your ecm sig radius is higher than the target ship then it reduces the chances of you jamming that ship this prevents falcons from shutting down interceptors with a single module and makes kitsune and griffin pilots more valuable in fleets

i propose that if a ship is losing more than 5 of its effective hitpoints per second then it is immune to all forms of ecm
your proposal is stupid
yeahagree yet another stupid proposal yasp not supported
if a ship is losing 5 of its ehp per second this means it is not recieving reps or the dps applied to it significantly out dpss the rep it is recieving this change will mean that fail pirates losing vagabonds to solo rifters will not be able to simply decloak a falcon alt and instawin this change will only mostly negetively impact people who blob soloers with ecm and make it so that people who are permajammed can shoot back a bit before going down which makes it more funsupporting my own thread
i propose everyone wardec this guy  but dont shoot him just jam him 247

having more shiny modules is always a good thing these modules dont have any faction or officer counterparts and would be a good thing for the game because they counter overpowered ecm bull i propose ccp implement these modules with better eccm stats and easier to fit cpu wise

i propose that ecm only prevents highslot modules from being activated on successful jams ecm is too often used as a get out of jail free card by changing this pathetic pirates cannot bail themselves out when their 7 man camps get solod by hyperions this also means people still have a chance of getting out since webs and scrams are often key for preventing other people to catch up to you and to get out of scram range
locked for spam
to prevent permajam situations and situations where people are ecm blobbed i suggest a limited number of ecm being able to be activated per ship frigates  destroyer hulls  2 maxcruiser and battlecruiser hulls  3 maxbattleship hulls  4 maxcapitals  unlimitedfurthermore any ship that fits a remote repair module is able to have 1 more ecm module activated on it at the same time this is so ecm can still break up spider tanks
imo the limit should be 1 ecm module per targetthat way falcon wouldnt be as overpowered versus solo eccm would actually work atm you need 23 eccm modules against full rack falcons and falcon would still be a gang versus gang powerhouse

problem is simple i suppose you all had it at least onceyoure activating a module wait a bit and see later that theres either  module is really red the module dont work anymore too latebecause simply you pushed the heat button without willing it cause its just a few milimeters ahead of the module activation buttonactivating heat by mistake is really easy to do and can make  happenhaving his mwdab not working anymore while traveling is a painhaving his defensegun modules dont working anymore on combat is deathof course we could see the red appearing but its not because we can see it if were careful that this dont need to be changedthe solution is very simple  remove activation of module by left cliking on a module and only allow it by right clicking on overloading rackor add a swith on the ui option pannel somwhere or maybe fitting pannel to allow heat to be totally blocked when checked

first  the bounty system bounties is no longer a single payoff instead an amount from the total bounty on a player is now placed on the ship he flies in for example frigate would be 50k cruiser would be 1m battle cruiser 10m and battleship 30m such bounty will only be rewarded if the person destroying the ship has in his possession the original kill right or a licensed version of it see kill rights belowso if a player has 100 million bounty on his head and he flies out in a battleship he comes under attack and lost his battleship if the aggressor has a a kill right or licensed version of it in his possession aggressor will gain 30m in bounty much like how npc bounties are distributed and the player which the bounty is placed on now only has 70m left on his bounty however if the aggressor does not have kill right or its licensed variant no bounty will be reduced and aggressor gains no bounty if multiple aggressor with kill rights are involved the one dealt most damage will get the bountysecond kill right overhaul kill rights can be traded contracted and will not expire it now has additional options players could choose a 1time bounty placement option ie you can only place bounty on the person once a destroy kill right option a license kill right optionone time bounty placement is self explanatory however poddingrelated kill right will automatically have its bounty doubleddestroy kill right option will eliminate all bounties on the targets head so if the target cannot bear the bounty on him then he can offer isk or other ways to back the kill right and destroy itlicensing kill right ie making copies of it will have a limit of max 5 copies and invoke a cool down timer of 1 month or maybe 2 weeks before the timer expires you cannot make more licenses unlike the original kill right which only dissapear if destroyed or all bounties are gone licenses are 1aggression only appreciate feed backs will keep on update in the 1st and 2nd post if good feed backs are given

its not simplification its fixing something that was stupid the boost of attribs will reduce learning times across the board thats what learning skills didlearning skills were just additional grind and a time waste for playersand the biggest reason was stupidityyou cant learn about learning faster
you shouldnt really call it simplification because that suggests that learning skills added complexitywhat they actually did was make new players go its going to cost me 15 dollars and at least a month before i can even start to do things ill go pound nails through my  instead
yup its a complex choice to make do it and get increased training speed or dont do it and get left behindreal hard choice assuming you are really damn hungry that day its sort of like getting one burger for 3 or two for 325 there is nothing complex about that choice
its for moments like this i made these
learning skills are a prime example of fake difficulty fake difficulty saps the fun out of the game by creating a barrier to progress in the form of withholding critical information or wasting the players time in eve this exists on top of the abundant content that already requires a guide book just to learn properly
learing skills made you progress faster
not while you are training them
no skills do anything while you train them shall we remove them all
once you were past the barrierincidentallythats also why they made little to no sense a huge part of the argument for keeping them is based on the i got them to skill better than those who didnt get them line of thinking which falls into the exact same trap if there is no race and just a matter of getting the training over with a bit faster the best solution would be to make everyone train a bit faster
nah just the ones that do nothing in themselves and work only as a speed bump about say 5 months long to actually playing the game
there is nothing about this that isnt wrong
thats just like your opinion manit would seem that most of the playerbase ccp and reality would disagree with it but hey
your right there isntthe problem is it doesnt take 5 months if you do it in your 1st 16 million skill pointsit takes 15 months and then if you didnt train them at 1st it will take 5 months down the line
ive seen this somewhere before
seems familiar doesnt itstill like the sigs

crumplecorn for a person whos claimed indifference to learning skills removal you sure do make a lot of posts in favor of the oppositionjust saiyan
ur dum
then i would suggest that since the learning skills were there first that the initial training bonus is a poorly designed additioni am fairly indifferent to their removal but have you seen how many threads arent about the learning skills not many
you could always make a thread thats not about them
my emphasis was on in favor of the opposition not a lot of posts
but then what would i make it aboutwell i always pick the side who is right
beats me
how about how silly it is that with the new keyboard shortcut defaults w is not mapped to warp to
its not wtf is it mapped to then i figured this would be a given
cant remember if its approach or orbit  probably approach since youd expect that one to be mapped to a and i seem to recall that there were a few other wtfitudes about those mappings
well if you believe one side is right and one is wrong then youre not indifferent are you
i hear googleing your skill order is depth
exactlyim for any change that get rid of the issue though im a nuke it from orbit kinda guybut yeah learning used to be fine rawr ccpmeh
its possible to differentiate correct and incorrect without caring
good points but i think your feelings are off basechanges are not implemented to simplify
you care enough about the debate to formulate a solid opinion which falls on one side what exactly is it that you dont care aboutbut besides that indifference literally means you do not differentiate if you differentiate you cant be indifferent
i dont think anything i say will change decisions already made but i hope that the next thing i read isnt that implants are gone because the newbies did not realize how useful they were or that we all get remaps every 6 months instead of 12 because people are not patient nah you can pay for remaps now much better lol
i dont deal in opinionsin this context the removal of the learning skillsthat is one definition and not the one which i intended
qed yeah you do the entire learning skills debate is about opinions the facts are simple newbies leave learning skills take time the sooner you get them the better off you are everything else is opinions there is no right or wrong in the learning skills debate thats why its a debate the disagreement comes down to different decisions leading to different outcomes which you can perceive as either beneficial or not depending on woah hey your opinionsyou care enough to voice your opinions i believe you dont care enough to quit the game over it but thats not particularly remarkableits not one definition its the definition if you take it to mean lack of interest youre interested enough to have an opinion if you take it to mean showing no care or concern you wouldnt be voicing that opinion which definition of indifference are you using
did you read the blog ccp could have made training faster but they did not want thatlearning skills have been an issue to a degree since i can remember started 2005 i dont think anyone wants to speed up training other than whats happened already with their removal soonif the training is too fast it would ruin the game you dont want lots of capitals flying around with out the smaller support ships it would just be unrealistic learning skills have been ear marked to go for sometime it seems they were just waiting for the right time the argument for removing learning skills has gone on for a long long time cant say i can think of anything else thats been debated so much for it to be removed from the gameso i cant see there being a general move to dumb the game down i think wow has been dumbed down so that younger kids are able to play it without much difficulty world questing but eve generally appeals to an older player base so its unlikey they will dumb it down too much if at allif young players were given the option of playing eve or wow i think most would choose wow because of its cartoon appearance and bright coloursthats my opinion anyway
heres your forum warrior uniform good you have you back sir 07
but i havent attempted to answer the question of the debate this time around merely point out flaws in certain argumentsfaulty arguments draw me like a moth to a flamei have never stated my opinion on the removal of the learning skills
its not lose of depth at alltbh the learning skills were just a pure time sink what kind of depth does that addand getting faction on market great no more cumbersome browsing through contracts and less jita spam again no lose of depth
your comment has become my forum signature well played
you claimed a handful of posts ago to support the right side you take many opportunities to pick apart the arguments of one side but never the other while you may not have explicitly voiced an opinion you have demonstrated clear bias in favor of one side
i certainly have a bias but thats a far cry from a full fledged opinionas for only picking at one side well one side vastly outnumbers the other and that same side tends to rely more often on fallacious arguments and that is what i meant by right side  the side that invokes fewer fallacies a poor way of putting it perhaps since i dont necessarily agree with their conclusioneveryone posting in favour of the learning skills is kind of getting dogpiled anyway so pointing out any flaws in their posts seems kind of redundant though i can if it will make you feel better
this is fair and probably true at least in a literal sense theres a lot of claims that learning skills are mandatory when in a technical sense theyre not but i would argue that the opposing side is guilty of ignoring the significant but subjective factors in favor of the literal theyre also guilty of relying on the slippery slope defense something that ive picked apart beforei have no issue with you picking sides or having opinions or having bias in and of itself especially given how strong my own opinions are i simply object to you expressing bias and then claiming indifference
you make me laughone of the arguments put forward by the keep them guys was that they help get rid of new people so that there is less players less lag so that sounds like a real good reason to keep them yeah lmaothe only people that would possibly lose something are the ones that are training characters to sell training skills fully trained were a good selling point
i agree the slippery slope argument does not apply in this case and it is brought up rather a lot youve lost me on the factors in favour of the literal bitand yet it is the case i am biased in their favour for whatever reason but i see valid arguments on both sides so if asked whether they should stay or go i cannot answer either way so while i dont agree as such with the decision to remove them i dont object to it either i do however object to some of the arguments for their removal which continue to be mentionedbowim here all weekand how often was this mentioned compared to say the idea that one must train the learning skills for ones first month or ones head will explode or whatever other dire consequences await
specifically i mean that one side will argue that there is a great amount of pressure both internal and external for a newbie to obtain learning skills as soon as possible the opposition will then often disregard that point on the grounds that learning skills are optional which while literally correct ignores the point of the argumentfair enough
you know i have never seen the the learnings are optional and a choice argument made by someone who isnt a vet with a bunch of alts that he can use to play withas a newer player with newer player friends with a single account i would say they are not optional at all point has been made in this thread that its 5 months vs 15 depending on if you train them right away or not and without them as a couple of my friends found who subsequently quit stuff takes forever to train after the bonus is overbut gallians lots of the later skills take forever to train even months yes but that is much later in the game t2 ships or stuff like carriers that newer people cant afford and wouldnt know what to do with and by the point people are concerned with those they have all manner of fun options of other ships to fly this is not true for new players who cant fly most anything at allif the only options in a choice are be ed up the ass now or be ed up the ass later then i would say it is no option at alli have also seen the garbage about the skill race which misses the point that most people are not so much concerned with having the most sp in the game but with being able to fly ships and have fun both of which are notoriously hard to do with no skills which brings us back to the first point
when the argument is that the perception that they must be trained immediately causes trouble for new players i agree though i have suggested admittedly despite knowing the impossibility that correcting peoples perceptions is a better option than removing the skillsi think or perhaps hope however that the reason this argument is so readily dismissed is due to it so often being presented as the learning skills actually must all be trained first with so many people presenting the perception itself rather than the argument which the perception supports the two become conflated in peoples minds i think
i wish english would had been my first language as then i could get along those kind of debates easier but the formulations you guys produce here are way out of my league at the moment probably forever
i find that using the word perception is misleading it implies that the pressures to obtain learning skills are largely subjective or imaginary when in fact the direct opposite is truemaybe so but often times the spirit is more important than the specifics a good point should never be dismissed on a technicality
i dont think anyone will give you a hard time over your english as long as its legible its not my first language either
this was not simplification that was more of a fix to a fail system especially when you cant find faction ships on the market lol lurning skills did not affected game play that much and there waay way too many other skills you have to traincheers
i dont mean to imply that the pressure to train them is merely a perception rather the perception is the driving force behind the pressureit is believed that the learning skills must be trained first at any cost even if the cost is boredom and subsequent departure from the game were this not the case if this belief were not so prevalent new players would hopefully be encouraged to do whatever suited them dealing only with the actual benefits of each optiontrue but it would help if the signal to noise ratio in the presentation of the point were better
that not i think and hope im writing to fluent for thatbut arguing with someone on the battlefield of words and formulations in a foreign language is fighting uphill imho
well to be pedantic about it the ideal is for learning skills to be trained up as much as possible but without invoking so much boredom that the player quits the game nobody in favor of learning skill removal wants newbies to leave well there may be few besides even if you take the ignoring learning skills is more fun path the main point is the choice between smaller amounts of fun sooner or greater amounts of fun later it is my strong and frequently vented opinion that this is not a reasonable choice to place upon newbies but yeah opinions
this is true if the desire is to maximise efficiency but i know from personal experience that chasing efficiency if it isnt really what you are after is a sure way to kill the game for yourself i think efficiency should be forgottenif you are willing to accept long term ineffeciency and instead focus on what you actually want from the game you can fit the learning skills in without even noticing they are there because they reduce the time to reach your goal if you can only ever set a short term goal like me you will end up being inefficient but you will also always get to what you want quickly on the other hand if you have a long term goal you will end up training lots of learning skills but they will be reducing the time to get to your goal not increasing itperhaps but i am not sure this dichotomy actually exists at least not in all cases if you are actually happy to aim for something well within your reach and something else after that and something else after that then even if you have to wait longer for the more distant things you should have plenty to keep you occupied in the meantime i know i always haveand even if the dichotomy does exist i like the idea that your character will reflect your motivations that a character driven towards long term goals will reach them faster while a character driven towards short term goals will reach those faster but yeah opinions
well they are all on the left side of the keyboard so you can hit them with one hand while mousing with the other thats why o isnt orbit for instance all those functions are mapped in or around the wasd cluster to make it easy to do with one hand it takes maybe five minutes to learn them and you can always remap them so i dont see it as a big dealbtw a is align which admittedly should be the same as approach like d is mapped to dockjumpactivateetc
awesome post black
youve got interesting points on a lot but i wanted to pick at thisits a nice idea to say just relax have fun and go at your own pace but at that point youre basically fighting human nature and the basic drive for success itd be a little different if eve was a quiet game where you meander through the levels and everybody ends up at max level dancing in social hubs after enough time but eve is considerably more ruthless theres no real advancement cap and theres a strong sense of competition i think this is actually what drives most new players off more than anything the idea that theyll never catch up now that that is a perception problem but learning skills certainly made it look worse
i agree that the learning skills made it look worse certainly if you are looking to catch up they will appear absolutely essential and i also agree that human nature comes into it this is why grinding games like wow and metagame grinding like xbox achievements and ps3 trophies are popular people naturally like to progress questthe thing i take issue with is this unlike these other things success in eve is not defined by your ability to progress quest unless you personally decide that progress questing is your goal so rather than fighting the drive for success i think what is needed is to redefine success the way you put it just relax have fun and go at your own pace to me implies a fixed choice between efficiency and inefficiency between doing it right and having fun but if success isnt defined by progress questing then this general idea of efficiency isnt a valid metric anymore rather you first need to define your own goal and then define efficiency in terms of that goal you can still strive for efficiency to do it right but aiming at your own goalso for a new player who just wants to shoot at things and is instead sitting around just training learning skills the message is not to just relax have fun but rather to work just as hard as they are only towards something else something that suits them to break this idea that there is only one kind of progress one kind of success and see what can actually be achieved in the gameand from that point of view the ideal way to approach learning skills depends on your aim the most efficient route to that aim not some general idea of efficiencythis turned out to be an interesting discussion but unfortunately it is late or early and i dont know if im making sense anymore and my eyes hurt so i must go to sleep now o
this last year its gone from omg total waste of time to train them gonna take you 3 12 year of training for them to be worth it to omg when i start i new char i should never logg and only train learning skills cus i will never be able to compete the new players you know the picture of eve learning curve i like that picture the new players really hard up the ass  them so hard they quit the gameeves been going downhill ever since oveur ed all over the playerbase by complaining about how much money ccp lost pr month banning all those macros
while what you say is generally true its not the impression one gets from eve from a two week trial pure marketing says that learning skills are a stupid idea that drive off potential customers learning skills are bad business and there are plenty of other things that we players can and will do that will drive off the rest of the riffraff that tries out the game
thisalso happened to wow and things slowly turned from worse to sht and from there to even worse
i began to play eve five years ago and continue to play it because of the freedom of choice we have as players things like the ownership we have over our stuff and even the space we live in and how the game is so player drivenwhen they start taking away our freedom then i will begin to worry making the game more accessible taking away needless complication and simplifying things is not something that sparks any kind of negative reaction in my brain looks like they are improving the game without changing what it is fundamentally a sandbox
many people believe that eve is being made simpler by removal of learning skills simple is the wrong term eve is being made easier and this is not an avalanche waiting to happen rather it is a continuation of a program aimed at making eve easier or if you will the avalanche started some time agoits been going on for some time and will continue into the foreseeable future ccp believes they will acquire more subscribers by making the game easier and that this acquisition will more than offset any loss they suffer from older players quitting another goal achieved by making eve easier is narrowing the difference in ability between players that have been in eve for years and those who have only been here for months here again ccp believes this is how they will grow their subscriber basethe software industry looks at this phenomena in terms of acquisition and retention most of industry realizes retention over acquisition is far more cost effective and worthwhile to the bottom line ccp believes that acquisition over retention is the way to go as such many of ccps decisions are viewed as junior decisionsthat having been said mothermoons comments in post 33 of this thread make some interesting points and the removal of learning skills with those comments in mind may not necessarily fit snuggly into the category of making eve easier in other words making eve easier in one place made learning skills less desirable for the game you poke there and something pops up somewhere elsebest regardswindjammer
but ccp introduced an artificial boundary with the double training speed i agree with you but i still think you and other over look what really happened learning skills were not complained about as much if at all until this change6 weeks or 20 weeks your choicei mean skills shouldnt be all there is to success and progress in eve progress should be measured by what you accomplish and how you go about it however i would argue the super fast or slow learning skills choice actually takes the focus off of the game and puts it on skill points learning skills in them self make it seem like skill points must be super important if there is a skill dedicated to making them accumulate faster and as we know to most players being able to get something faster means youve progressed in a game thus i say removing learning skills put the focus back on what eve is really about and doesnt distract new players into thinking that sp is what they need more of if you dont train them now it has a ripple effect on later skill training as well not only do you have to wait 5 months now because you didnt train during bonus time but that other player is miles ahead of you it currently takes 3 months to get to 16 million sp but it only takes 15 months to get to 16m if you just train learning skills now that puts you 15 months of effective sp behind the player that did not train learning skills however in 15 more months you have now met player b in effective sp and will now begin to pass him at double the rate in real skills so player a says oh man i guess i should train learning skills now that im 3 months into this game so he does he spends 4 months training them to a decent levelnow player a has 15 months of effective sp and 4 months of learning skill sp player b has the same 15 months of effective sp and 4 months more of real effective sphis learning skills done on top of all this player a has been in a drake for the past 4months without support skillsplayer b is a tech 2 battleship with all of his support skills trainednow if any player with a brain or that likes mmos sees this to be the case because they use evemon or go to eve university or have nice corpmates they will think ah ha so to advance in eve i must train learning skills sp is the important thingand bam they have completely missed the point of the game because they dont want to be 4 months behind in ship and weapons skills and they want a big sp number before eve was different you knew it would take 45 months no matter when you started so waiting 3 months meant that the guy training learning had way less real skills than you but it would take him about 56 months before he started to get more real skills than you now your behind in your 3rd month of gameplay and what happens when your like oh i actually want to play eve for a long timeyou realize that you could advance faster effective sp wise at the 3 month mark by restarting thats madness and only works to push the idea that sp is important on new players like a mallet opps caps locksi like the idea of future eve players not knowing they have it easy and just thinking oh in this game there is no way to advance faster than any other player and they will have to find something else that makes them feel like they are progressing more than other players like getting killmails or making friends going on mining ops starting little projects like little forums sigs or can art eve grave site killing miners in high sec starting a sig company making eve videos bloging running into wormholes finding the epic missions
mothermoon whats your take on the commissioned officers set and its included 30 day cerebral acceleration given what youve just had to say you must have a fairly heated opinion on itwindjammer
so in short this change while not necessary before the bonus training time takes the general idea of what means progress in a game and makes it so you have to focus on something other than skill gain instead what skills you train and what you do with them will become important just remember future players in 12 years wont know they have a boost and will have never heard of learning skills just like how new players have no idea what a vaga nano fit is pi think its a good change in the end this in fact seperates eve even farthur from other mmos where there is an optimal path to leveling up that noobs dont knw about and dispite just playing the game like it should be played end up months behind other players that started at the same timenow the game will be more about being effective with your choices and what you are given there is no longer a low hanging carrot to temp players into not having fun
basically with double training bonus this item gives a new players 6 in all attributes this is nuts because this would with a set of plus 5s make it so a players could get according to evemon all of their learning skills done to 53 in 3 weeks holy  now that aside i think it was a wierd time to introduce the item considering the changes to learning skills kinda like giving you some cake but then taking it away thats kinda odd as far as paying for an advantage i have to say im on the fence on one hand this gives players a reason to buy the box because other than that why not just buy it online its a small after learning skill bonus removal advantage and im for helping poor noobs think they can catch up to me thus maybe they will get out into space and realize skill points arent as important as tactics and having backup that extra 20 weapon damage isnt as important as web vs scram or afterburner vs mwdon the other hand it kinda penalizes players who buy online and makes them wonder oh maybe i should just restart and buy a boxed copy for the 6 implant and get farther there seems to be zero benefit for buying the game online and it brings up the issue of progression is based on how fast you train skills not what you do with them maybe the fix to this is to offer more than one way to buy the game steamretaileve site and offer different benefits for each option im all for making it easier for new players but making it easier just for the players that know what they are doing and know the little tricks is not cooli have to assume that mostly every new players does not spend a week or so looking up every trick about how to start a new character and minmax the hell out of playing the game an older more experienced players will have an advantage even if there isnt some boxed copy or master learning plan now the following is based on the idea that they do not get rid of the the new noob implantmaybe buying right off the eve online site should give you an implant and starter set of planetary interaction equipment right off the bat you can build yourself a little home and start making some extra moneys which will be a good deal to a new playerwhile another version like on steam can be based more on their resent hats wonderland with a set of 4 or 5 one of kind ships like the special shuttle and wormhole exploration ship this would appeal to players that dont care about starting off faster and just want shiny junk to play with pas it stands an uninformed player would not know they could spend the same amount of money at amazon as the eve online site less even and get a nice huge bonus to their game and that bugs me that after they join they are like oh what the hell i could of spent the same amount on a different site and got a bonusthe idea itself does not bother me as long as it it kept to vanity items and 1 month noob boosts im all for noobs having an easy time at 1st but what im not for is only the experienced noobs wait what getting the advantage as in stands only a current player would understand the value of the boxed bonus item and i think thats an important fact to remember wipes forehead
which begs the question whether ccp used the right reasons for the sledgehammer approach
itt crumpy returns to his forum warrior status by simply choosing a topic where he can get the most opposition and dives headon into the battlehavent you people notice that crumplecorn is simply arguing with you people for the sake of arguingalso i see you havent lose your touch crumpy wb o7
noticed something was up about a day and a half ago when none of his posts contained any serious opinions etheir way they were just designed to pick one term and attack it to keep the topic off reasons why it was a good ideawatching trippas counters was pretty good too she does not give up i am glad most of our opinions are the same that would be a long long fight full of pick apart quotes
we know the learning skills put people off of the gamethe fact that most people learn them as soon as possible really makes them unnecessary so why turn people off of the game because of something thats not necessary in the first placea lot of people will aim to get learning skills to 54 as soon as they can so there is no major difference for them being there or removing them and replacing the lost attributesonly real difference is people dont need to spend 2  3 months training something that only really amounts to wasted time and less fun because they are not able to train what they need to have fun with because they are training learning skillsthese two reasons are good enough to get rid of learning skills by themselvesonly people like ive said before that really lose out are those that were training characters to sell training skills fully trained were probably the biggest selling point as it was a set of skills that you needed regardless of what professions you chose to follow you might say that you dont need all of them for some professions but if you are selling a character you would want the character to appeal to the biggest section of the market biggest section of the market would be everyone who was looking to buy a character in this case as it would mean you could get on playing the game without having any boring learning skills to learn
i agreeoh they were always complained about but if the boost is the real problem now the boost should be fixedif i really wanted to be a forum warrior again i would have chosen to actively disagree with the antilearning crowd rather than posting the occasional nitpick though yes it would have been because there are more of them the argument that we should remove things that everyone ends up doing is a dangerous oneused right the learning skills save you time
not in this case and you know itnow you really are trollingyou should have called your character grumblecorn it would have been more appropriate
i wasnt referring to this case and you know it
so you were not actually answering the post  you reference the post and did not explain yourself fully trying to elicit a reaction so you were trolling
do i really have to explain why removing anything that everyone ends up training would be a bad road to go down
you are just arguing for the sake of arguing learning skills were the debate not anything else if we follow your reasoning there would be no skill tree left thats not going to happen most of the eve players would probably leave if that was the case ive not seen anyone complaining about skills other than the learning skills trolls aside have you
actually it was your argument that it would result in the removal of all skills simply shows it isnt a very good one
i can see you are unable to reason on any sensible level so as far as you are concerned ill leave it there
weve been through this before
heh heh
what about people mentioning it will take x number of years to max out all the skills as if playing the game was to achieve this feat over all other options bar none
nah i dont hate anyone life is too short to hold grudges
arbitrary limits and mandatory skills are bad mkay
why would people want to max out all the skills half of them would be useless to them anyway surely thats not why most people play the game i know some people want to be the ones with the highest amount of sp but personally i could not careless about that
to the opcomplexity you seek how about meaningful complexity rather than millions of inane idiotic little tweaky things posing as complexity did you know that consciousness in 3 dimensions is only possible by connection to the quantum field via pi electron resonance clouds contained in the tubulin protein molecules of neuronal microtubules  that is complex this game not so muchpatience i am currently enrolled in an atmospheric physics class doing some reasonable arithmetic i calculate that it takes longer to train eves fake skills in planetology from 4 to 5 than it does to complete a real upper division science course in atmospheric physics sorry but patience does not enter into it it seems completely bogus to make eves fake skills that are really just a timer that unlocks game content to take longer than actually learning real hard science bogusremaps skills trees are stupidly designed to encompass radical variation in the attributes needed to efficiently learn any given tree try training for exploration and youll see what i mean and we can only map attributes once in 365 days this pushes players to use stupid looking training scenarios that accommodate the stupidly designed skills trees players should not be so constrained as such stupid game mechanics are not in any way tied to fun and if you want to call that fun complexity i will counter by calling it a stupid inane and annoying exercise in tedium there are two fixes for this as i see it 1 align all skills in a given tree with the same attributes or 2 leave the stupidly designed skills trees as they are but allow remaps much more often to accommodate theman avalanche there should be an avalanche in the wings eves ui is so outdated and is complete garbage by any standards let alone comparison to any other modern mmos in terms of meeting the competition and keeping up with modern technical standards eve is in need of a lot of rework avalanche please bring it on 
nobody wants to have the most skills most people just want to be able to fly x at moderate competency or even high competency i find the skills dont matter crowd tend to be people with numerous alts and who can do everything in the game so for them skills trully dont matterfor real people though skills matter a lot and not in the gotta catch them all sense but in the cant do anything one
pretty much and being able to sell faction ships on the market is a bad ideawhy exactlyi think there is no need to explain why the removal of learning skills is anything but a step towards making eve more simple as that has been discussed enough here im just surprised people even manage to think of it that way i couldnt possibly find 1 single reason to even have those skills in the first place from a game design point of view learning to learn is just bad anywaypeople get upset about anything though so whatever
oh come on man youve been around as long as i have the thread would pop up randomly but never in the numbers it had been over the past year or socould be other reasons for that thoughedithey no one commented on my point that learning skills also make players think that sp must be important if there is a skill dedicated to just getting it faster and that the removal my have the added benefit of making new players in a few years think that sp must not be the focus of the game since there are so few way to increase it and will focus on other parts of the game to get their gamer progression fix who will completely forget about todays forum spam in the way way of vaga nanos
i dont think its a good point sp is very important as you need it to do things the pro learnings crowd seems to think that the anti learnings crowd wants sp for the sake of sp but the fact is that without sp or skills you cant do anythinggetting rid of the boost would be a terrible solution unless the purpose was to make eve a deserted wasteland
my thoughtshas anyone ever started a second account and spent weeks and weeks of trainig just for mandatory skills like learning has anyone brought a friend to the game or just told a newbie in your corp to train learning for the next x weeks to do things properly both are common events in this game and both are complete joykills which explains the general elation at this announcementso yes its a good change but at the same time it does simplify the game in a negative way if you consider skillpoints like fixed income in real life you will see there is natural variety introduced by peoples own individuality some people wanna squirrel away their money for retirement they cant afford everything they want now but in the long term they will have way more to spend from investments others will take what they get and blow it on fun stuff right awayits a bit silly to expect newbs to read up all the materials on optimizing skill training and plan for the future where it takes them over a year or more to recoup their skillpoint investments but people do it the resources are already there and they get an advantage over those who dontis the tradeoff ccp made here worth it id say yes but there is always another way to do thingsin my opinion the rate of skill training is way too fast and right now its only getting faster and the longer skillpoints accumulate the more homogenous and rounded characters become most of the playerbase is now a bunch of jackofalltrades types one of the ways this affects the game is organizational teamwork in newer corporations the things people can do are limited and theyre forced to have specific people fill specific roles in older organizations just having the right number of people online matters  not who they are because its expected that each person is gonna be rounded enough to fill any role needed at the time the longer the game goes on and the bigger the organization the less uniqueness and relevance your character is going to have which is more fun for you joining a corporation because they wanted 1 in the membercount or joining a corporation because you can supply them with something they need or lacki would have removed learning skills without giving everyone 12 attributes slowing down the overall training rate at the same time players would be allowed to boost skill training by up to 50 by leeching skillpoints from skills they already trainedthis lets people respecialize their characters very very slowly over time it makes sense in both ingame fiction and from the game design point of view that newbies should not be punished in the long run for mistakes made in the early game which the attribute respec and current learning removal changes address tell me if this is familiar im combat specced but i have some mining a new set of learning skills could be introduced to speed up the rate of respec 10 per level up to 50 so if you plan to do a major shift from say minmatar to caldari you could sink some skillpoints into this area and do it faster than the guy who is just making minor changes by depleting a single skill to zero when youre done you recover the skillpoints you invested in learning by depleting them back to zero in effect youre penalized temporarily in total skillpoints available during the time period that you are trying to change your characterafter these changes the total skillpoint count is probably the only thing that will make characters unique  but its a metric that wont matter as much anyone can aim for total efficiency it also results in there being a lot more full specialists ie everything to 5 because players will be less tempted to average and balance out their skillpoints equally this encourages specific team roles and makes unique corporationsdivisions based on specific skill sets viable138m sp and countin
exactly sp as such dont do anything to enable you to fly anything but to be able to fly a number of ships and fullfil a number of roles you need sp  and a lot of them no sp means not being able to do anything at allit already takes 15  2 years to be able to fly and fit a variety of ships and be able to say do logistics cov ops l4 missioning and fly a t3 cruiser all with decent t2 fits 2 years is a long enough wait i dont see why we should extend that by 2 months from training learning skillsthe catching up thing is an illusion most people dont want to be able to do more than other older players  they want to be able to do things at all preferably with good support skills
true to a degree but i now train things just because remember once you hit level 5 you aint going any higher
this is what im talking about people with 138 million sp not only think sp doesnt matter but that people should train slower which is mind boggling to say the leastthe rate of training is way too slow my good sir some skills take months to train there is already specialization but that only applies to newer chars because they have low amounts of spif what you want is specialization like that i would say make training faster and instill a sp ceiling say 50 million now that would be true specialization wouldnt itpeople above that ceiling should have their sp removed to bring them down to that ceiling there you go specialization at a rate that newer people can actually train without losing their mindswin win win winthat is unless the real purpose is to nerf new people and ensure they not only never catch up but can never fly anything
youre quite the pleb if you think id even bother to write a post just to nerf newbies its the most laughably generic response you could have come up with its like whenever i write something to increase the level of pvp consequences or player interaction i get called a griefer no i wrote it because i have a far better perspective on character advancement than most and can offer an alternative suggestion to what ccp is doing ive seen it from multiple angles many times including starting new characters starting specialized characters and helping newbies with their own training plans right now there are only two motivations for a faster skill training rate and theyre both garbagebusiness reality ccp has a ton of ships content and playstyles they want players to experience many in order to keep them interested and keep them subscribed the problem its more fun in the short term but in the long term people run out of newness you basically burn through all that content at a faster rate because theyd rather have you stick around for 12 years guaranteed than hope youre still interested in new space pixels five years later selfishness players want to advance faster the problem everyone plays by the same rules and the relative difference always stays the same it even increases in the case of attribute respecs because only vets can keep training two attribute types for a full year without gimping themselves the same goes for implants making them cheaper to the point where everyone can afford them just makes them a requirement and screws over the casuals and newbies who cant invest that much without grinding for a longer timethe idea i mentioned addresses both in significant ways if i had anything to add to it it would be that id want to see the skillpoint shifting apply from any character on the same account except ones you purchased this lets people with a lot of sp divide it up into 2 or 3 different personas and engage in different styles of play wanna do minmatar rp but youre amarr and cant even fly minmatar your options now are to essentially ruin your main character for a subpar experience or get a second account and start from scratch or get a second account and spend a lot of isk to buy an able characterfor the first time in history there would be a legitimate gameplay reason for people having three characters on one account as opposed to just metagaming with scout market and forum alts
sorry but i fail to see how forcing a 2 month waiting period is increasing complexity or anything i think and im not the only one obviously that its just ing annoying and something nobody enjoysalso faction ships on the market reduces complexity more mindmarket games i say
that was a horrible post
random pretentious nonsense is the best way for people to take you seriously true story
dear overly sensitive forum friend it was never my intention to hurt you with opinions and beliefs on the internet i pray the day comes when you too can post with bold righteousness and angry demanourlove that guy who makes you so mad you wish you were him
thanks to this update i not only have a reason to look forward to eve in december with some odd 18 million skill point to play with but also have finally managed to convinced several rl friends to join the removal of learning skills and the accompanying bonus with an additional 2 attribute points in each attribute has removed a lot of the initial down time from new characters and made it so that new players can hop right into learning fun gratifying abilities immediately without holding their character back the difference between a 54 learning character and a 00 learning character was roughly 8 million sp per year it would be foolish to make a new character and not learn all the learning skills firsttldr version thank you for this ccp this upcoming change will be the best one ive seen since starting this game for breathing even more life into a thriving game 
luv the changes lottsa of my frenz who went back to wow because learning took too long are now asking if eve has a lifetime subscription because they want to play and max the skills asap because its possible now luv it luv the changes i hate the old people who play this game anyway they should go back to wowreally the only way mythic could improve eve would be if they kep the 20 attrib points and brought back learning skills so we could train even faster if we train the skillz then we could complain again and get 40 attrib points luv the changehappy kwanza everyone
youre almost there just a bit further and youll have it follow the money and you will understand why ccp has done it this wayregardswindjammer

ill use this post to provide interim csmrelated updates when there something worth mentioning is on the radar with that in mind heres what is going on for the next few weeks there will be no scheduled csm working meetings in december due to holiday schedules and the summit in iceland next week informal discussions are being conducted related to preparing for the summitthere is a thread in assembly hall identifying the summit agenda and requesting questions youd like to see asked in various sessions please go there and share your thoughtsthe next working meeting of the csm is scheduled for sunday 23 january 2011 it is hoped that by that time the minutes from the december summit will be published but with holiday and travel schedules of both ccp and csm folks that is difficult to accurately forecast
what about supercap blobbing there is a thread in general chat atm where someone comments about the future of supercaps and i guess 00i think it is a fair assumptioni really would hate to see 00 turn into that
there will be no changes to the dec 14th plan at this time ccp has stated that they cannot make any changes and still do the qa work needed to make the dec 14th release datei too wanted some tweaks
be smart spend your free sp on skills that are even slower than learning skillsone of the skills ill be training with those free sp will be infomorph psychology some extra jump clones will be nice and i will save myself training one of the slowest skills there is leadership is another nice example anything with charisma is a good choice
you can spend an infinity of time making tweaks to make something perfect in your opinion or you can get it donepersonally im spending my points on low level skills 13 and it will be awesome
local is one part of a wider issue involving intel resources in general ccp would not be willing to make a significant change to localfor example introducing a local delay without making sure its balanced in their opinion with all intel resources in general iirc the issue came up in the pastrequesting a local delay or some sort of way to prevent things like automated local alerts and ccp replied that they wanted to do an overhaul of intel tools in general instead of just making a change to local in 00still its kind of a nagging issue to see so many invincible macroers in 00 so its worth bringing up to ccp again
i doubt ccp will ever fix local in 00 in such a manner than the players perceived as victims ratters plexers miners and macro users will ever have less of an advantage than they currently dothis game went pro carebear the moment ccp realized that it made them more  and the current paradigm isnt going to change
the problem is that whatever intel tools they end up giving players the bots and hacks will always give people an edge personally i cant think of any intel tools design that will reward skilled and alert players while not allowing bots to essentially be invincible and not giving a skilled attacker essentially free reign to kill everybodythe way wormholes work with local is awesomealthough i think the mashing the scanner is annoying i wish they made 00 like that but ccp is afraid to rock the boat
the argument has been hashed to death i just specifically couldnt find any developer posts
because bumping matters thats why this would pretty much eliminate bumping as written and that is a bad thing and it would also allow people to prealign and then not move eg miners in a belt could chargeup their warp drives and continue to mine  stay in range of their rocks then bolt as soon as someone shows up basically it removes any downside to prealigning also op doesnt very clearly state that if you prealign to something then click to warp to something in the same linear path that your chargeup will still workvisual effects are nice make the game shiny but leave the warp mechanic alone
you only charge up when you click warpnot when you align
i support cooler warping effects but leave the mechanics alone
i would much prefer this kind of warping mechanic you would have a real shock effect of ships landing you may want to add trails to ships warping off so that their destination can still be trackedthe biggest problem with punching straight up to maximum warp speed is the old session change timer you will be stuck at many gates unable to jump simply because your session change timer is still active when you arrive at the gate will be even more frustrating than it is now but their may be a work aroundall in all i agree with the proposal as an idea for change
i would prefer this to how it is now especially if it goes from 100 ms to 3 aus almost instantly rather than the long build up
you wouldnt instantly arrive at the other gate you would still travel at warp speed to and from each celestial you just enter and exit warp instantly
i support the graphics changei am in favor of reducing or eliminating the exponential rampup and rampdown at warp speed alternately i support scaling the duration of the rampup and rampdown periods with the warp speed that is ships that warp at 135 aus have twoninths the exponential ramp times of ships with 30 aus warp speedi am undecided on the proposed aligning mechanics

i like it i wonder if its not being done because of a technical hurdle or something to somewhat mitigate the dogpile effect of reinforcements being able to affect the battle more because of the slowdown i would think some sort of staggered entry to the system might have to be implemented when the slowdown gets to a certain point
i like the idea but i see it also needing to impact the guy in the station fitting his ships and the other guy in station buying stuff and selling stuff from the marketthe issues i see which can be resolved quick by the people in the fleets areclose your market windows before jumping into a systemclose your assets window before jumping into a systemset your overview properly so things like wrecks and drones are appropriately visibleinvisibleget all your fleet members to use cables rather than wireless reducing latencythe bullet time is a good idea but i find it hard to think of how it could be reasonably implemented so it couldnt be abused unless it applied to the whole universe
the way i see it is as huge fleetfights are rare and this is a really good way of helping to keep gameplay up whilst ccp run around like crazyfools just suspend typical non combat or combat related stuff in the system eg market orders contract acceptance etc as the fleetfight would be a temporary thing if youre in a null sec system where a massive fleetfight is to occur and youre not planning to fight or provide recon you tend to have time befor things really kick off and you tend to know that somethings bout to go downif anything u could allow a timer to say something about networked comm systems going down due to projected high congestion and count down untill not combat related game elements are isolated

lol its like legalizing cant fight it make it ledal d
a day later and i still cant think why this wouldnt workwe even have a logical fictional reason to support it ive never seen a serious proposal that didnt imidiately get at least one major negative reply let alone two pages worth and nothing but positive
i am indeed in college im studying math and comp sci
a fairly simple proposal not much needing to be said obviously being able to target yourself is out of the question so perhaps all that is needed is an additional rightclick option to repair self i dont foresee any major unbalancing issues here although tactics may change true though you could go on and on about how this would change so many things i just happen to think that being able to repair yourself with your own repair drones is logical simply put
simple proposal sure but there is a reason it isnt already possible it isnt nearly so simple to make happen and the value of this ability didnt seem to be all that high to rework the drone code
i have this under my drone ai improvements thread
i was baffled to find out that you couldnt do this
but the drone code needs to be reworked because its terriblei too was amazed you couldnt do this and was glad somebody told me before i trained the skill
i support this if only because it makes no since for them not to work on you if 5 autonomous drones can target another ship they can target yours period
im ok with this
i have to admit i was very confused and spent much time convinced i was doing something wrong and that they actually could when i found out you could not repair yourself with your very own drones
supported
this would be a nice feature
page 3 oh hell no
a lot can probably be done by a change to the ammo as blasters are also in need of helpsuggestion maymay not work judge for yourselfdamage across all ammo variants be the same but shorter range ammo uses less capacitor this makes hybrids more than just a different flavour of laser other balancing would also be necessary though
that would be like concord not allowing your guns to fire unless you have aggression rights on a target in highsec but then ccp implementing collision damage a bit more plausible lore wise but gameplay wise its the same
oh god yes does this mean we can finally gank all the scammers in jita with a crowbar mk ii
im sure this will happen one daymaybe 2 years from now
not supportedi dont want to have to watch my back all the time id rather be able to peacefully play some station poker and lol at the guy in the girl av spaming cyber for 1 mil isk vrs listen to a bunch of you got pwned noob
i can agree with that mostly but i do think there needs to be a way for capsuleers to fight not only is eve supposed to be at least somewhat harsh but it is also supposed to be relatively realistic ccp tried to come up with explanations for all of the weird things in eve from canon to lag aka spacial anomalies i cant imagine an explanation that would make sense for capsuleers to be unable to shoot each otherperhaps instead of making combat unavailable it should be heavily discouragedlets say as an example every time you shoot someone unprovoked in highsec space you get a 5 penalty with sec status just as an example i dont know what the actual number is then in highsec stations or station areas if you pull a gun you get a 10 sec hit along with a big sec hit with the stations owners and you heavily fined if you manage to kill someone before getting concordokken then the consequences are twice as bad or something like that for the rpers it can be said that the extra consequences are due to increased chances of hitting people who arent capsuleers cant respawn and arent part of any sort of military effort
nothing personal but im going to use you as a bit of a sounding board the internet spaceships fill that role i think dont they in that case we should have permadeath when we die away from our pods which have those brain scanners you see or instead of station security pointlessly killing the immortal capsuleer for murder they would do the realistic punishment of incarcerating themhow about something analogous to this i agree with thatas a punishment for pulling a gun i guess i think implementing a punishment for something as simple as brandishing ones weapon might be taking it a bit far personally which doesnt make any sense because capsuleers are as mortal as anyone else outside of their pods without the podbased neural scanner that forms the entire basis for our immortality
i recommend reading the empyrean age im not sure how to do spoiler tags but i dont think its a dramatic spoiler anyway one of the capsuleers in the novel makes use of clones specifically for suicide missions he is out of pod when he dies and while not being connected to a pod he is somehow reborni dont believe it ever explains how this is possible but its been a while since i read it that and i hear the jove have shiny new technology
i hate to be a complete troll but why is anyone worried about this its just testing phase for wod which may or may not have any relevance to eve as a whole same with dust unless they place in mechanics that affect sov or somehow destroy large amounts of isk no ccs dont count cause they are cheap and dont make a lot of money anyway if they dont and more importantly dont know how to make these things integrate with eve in a tangible way we can go back to what we were doing and let the devs sit and think about why no one is using stuff they spent years tinkering with
i dont object to you having a peaceful place to play poker i do object to playing poker being the only thing there is to do
if everything fails they could just set up some consoles in the stations where your chars have the option to play quafemantm and steer him on his epic quest to squash ebil piwates with thrown cold turkey oh hey did i just discover a new epic isksink but yeah seriously the implementation of any kind of instation combat options will most likely determine where the whole wis stuff heads to yet another attempt at mimicking 2nd life or proving that eveo is still somewhat of a pvp game
thats true too dont want it to be boring i suppose i just dont want to get shot in the back of the head by anyone just wandering around looking for lols even if there is no damage involved its just an anoyanceperhaps stations even high sec stations need a dangerous areas back alleys and there can be pummeling and muggings and things of that nature not sure if ill bother to train closed fist to lvl 5 though
since it is currently possible to do exactly what youre doing but we currently do not see alliances profligate in their deployment of rr sentry domi fleets one would have to assume that there is some reason we do not see fleets of rr sentry domisthe only issue i can see would be retrieving sentry drones so perhaps adding the ability for sentry drones to mwd back to the mothership would cause this rr sentry domi proliferation to become the caseat least that would be a change from the current fascination with drake fleets as a drone user myself i could not agree more with this proposal warts and alledit warts specifically being the fleet versions of commands which i feel would create a significant advantage for fleets using sentry drones
supported on all counts
ja
since andrea griffin showed me this topic i will copy paste my ideas that i had in other thread
i agree that eafs need some hot dev lovin mainly in the area of survivability the big question is in what area to improve it sig reduction speed tanking resistance buffingor as an oddball idea  cov ops cloak i guess it would depend on whether you want eafs as a minature combat recon or force recon
i could get behind this so long as eaf were left squishy

the voting may have been open for almost two weeks and there was even a login banner  but the login banner is the only way to reach those of us who spend our actual time ingame doing things instead of flaming on the forumsand that was not posted until voting had been ongoing for a weekbasically you gave your cronies who hang out on the forums an extra week at the expense of those of us who hang out in the gamewith 200 issues to sort through a week is not even close to enough i read a lot of issues its not like i didnt trydo it better next time ok id like my chance to contribute and i feel like i was shut outim sure you had no choice about shutting off the vote at this point  so next time get them up sooner and get word out sooner and be sure to include people who dont hang out on the forums talking smack at each otherthanks
thisill only add that i stringently followed the issue for months in multiple fora including this one with nothing substantive happening to the point where i gave it a rest only to come back after a short respite to find this opportunity for input closed not much of an opportunity at all as it turns out
i never saw this in eve news 24 and i was reading every weekday
why assume they have to sell 1 day plexes as several people have suggested selling 60 day gtcs that convert to 60 miniplexes will give the same value for plex not cost more in transaction fees and let them charge less then 15 for small cosmetic crap hint im not paying 15 for cosmetic 
not supported the cost of a t2 bpo means that it takes a very long time to get your investment back in the meantime your isk is locked into that bpo even if the thing that you make from it is not profitable hence owning one is a long term investmentrisk because there is invention there is no issue with people making t2 products for a cheap startup cost even if they do not own a bpo
lame better if you have to hunt for them
remove or make availablethoes saying stop whining and earn the isk to buythe original owners got given them for free they didnt buy themthey are not vanity items they generate real isktheir existance and use in game prevents economical invention of t2 mods for sale on markets with t2 bpo fed mods
you are so wrongthe only items that t2 bpos prevent invention from being profitable are those items that no one ever uses like armor thermic plating ii and stuff ive made over 80b profit in the last 16 months from invention so if you are unable to do your market research dont blame your failures on t2 bposthats true and its why invention was added it was a bad decision to introduce them in the first place but doing any change to them right now will screw hundreds of people that saved to afford one the least worst course of action is to not change anythingim sure that if ccp could go back in time they would never add them and implement invention from the start instead but unfortunatly thats not possibleanyways im done posting in this thread unless someone comes up with an argument that isnt i want free isk now its unfair
i agree with these statements
actually wouldnt it be the least worst course of action to make t2 bpos available in game from in game mechanics and spawns like every other bpo and item the current system only creates a money printing machine for bpo holders yes you can make more money via invention but it also takes 10 times the work and has 10 times the risk a bpo guarantees a steady income pretty much forever at no risk and no effortif they are so meaningless then everyone should get a hand at them and their numbers should increase nosupported
i suppose you have stopped buying ammunitions and ships when the npc sell order were removed several years ago right it is very evident that some people have returned after a hiatus first the ecm whines now this what will be the next
they are fueled by ccp zulu caving in on learning skills in an emorage fashion  so they figue if they scream loud enough the gods will hear them  
im guessing a new wave of suicide gank whinesbrace for incoming threads breathlessly detailing how every new player will certainly be murdered as soon as he undocks if ccp dont make hisec safe for freighters
some good points by mishkaii so ill answerthats called invention seeding t2 bpos just like t1 bpos wouldnt change the fact that the original owners got them for free it will only make t2 a second t1 it wont remove the unfair part of t2 bpossame for invention it is silly money to get the same daily income from t2 bpos i would have to buy 330b worth of t2 bpos at a 3 years roi my invention startup cost was 3b both bpos and invention are crazy moneymakers and both are fair the only thing that isnt is that the original owners got them from an unfair mechanic in regards to newer players like you me and most people in this threadyeah its a lot of clicking because the ui is utter  with a better ui it wouldnt be more than 10 minutes of clicking a dayyoure wrong that invention is risky though the build time of a batch of modulesships is less than 2 days 10 hours in my case the market can move 5 in 2 days but it doesnt matter because the profit margin is 40 to 75 on the other hand spending 10b on a t2 bpo is very risky because game design changes can waste your investment the guy that bought the 10mn mwd ii bpo a few weeks before tyrannis should know what i mean invention guarantees a steady income pretty much forever at no risk and medium efforta t2 bpo guarantees a steady income until game design changes waste it at a medium risk and low effortfor the same reasons as i said earlier it wouldnt remove the only unfair thing about t2 bpos which is the way they were won in the first place it would make t2 another t1 everyone can already get a hand at them do what i and hundreds people have done before htfu and head here
i would rather see invention made into less of a lottery than messing about with t2 bpos if you want one of those buy one but giving the researching time to make it super profitable would be about 2 years power to youid rather see an improvement on t2 bpcs and preharps some limited research allowed on them to increase the mat and time needs beyond the use of decryptors
that wouldnt change the profitday of inventors it would only lower the sale price of t2 items the profitday of inventors depends on the demand for t2 items and the number of inventors unless your idea brings a lot of new inventors into t2 manufacturing item abc ii would cost200k datacoresinvention chance  material cost300k inventors profitinstead of the current400k datacoresinvention chance  material cost300k inventors profittldr inventors make money because of the relatively low number of people interested in t2 production and your change wouldnt change their income
the original owners essentially did buy them with points in lotteries held for each bpo not all  and id suspect the vast majority  were t20 bpos im not even sure if those remained in game after the fallout over it either way most of the bpos were obtained legitimately through the game mechanics of the timesecondly youre assuming that the original owners still have these items id suspect that between people gaining and losing interest in eve over the years people moving away from places where its easy to cash out on t2 bpos and other changes very few of them lie in the hands of their original owners and those who have them now had to pay isk for itno matter how you view it it ends up being robbery of olderricher players who managed to get their hands on these things and even as someone who dosent have anything like this i dont see any better solution proposed here
the only way youre ever going to remove t2 bpos from the game is if you save up enough money to buy every single one of them jet them in a can and blow it up
hmm wonder how much that would cost
as has been said before the existence of t2 bpos has a neglible effect on the eve economy and most of the people who own them saved up and paid good isk for them i wont support any proposal that gives these players a big fat middle fingerand introducing more t2 bpos into the game would dilute invention which is a great mechanic  one of the best things introduced since i started playing in my opinion  and eventually the distinctive flavour of tech 2 would be gone as the other poster said earlier t2 would just be a more expensive t1building on the above suggestions heres a counterproposal for getting rid of the t2 bpos best of all its player drivencounter proposalhave a trusted member of the eve community release the full api key of one of their charactersask people to donate money to that character for the purpose of eliminating t2 bposthat character buys up t2 bpos with the donated moneytake these out in a shuttle and selfdestruct generating a killmail so that everyone can see that the bpo is gone forever this might need multiple attempts per bpoall we need for this to work is for ccp to distinguish between bpos and bpcs on killmails  or for there to be some other way of confirming the destruction of an item via api is there a better way in existence already i confess i dont knowoh and for someone with the requisite gravitas to step up
let nelass i would to correct two little details selfdestructing does not generate a killmail nor does it generate any loot recording the destruction of said bpos would probably be the best way to make sure that it actually happensedit fixed typos
i disagree with your points the falloff bonus is good with rails that have lots of it and the new void will make the optimal bonus a lot better with blasters which is admittedly pretty meh nowhowever your suggestion would make it a better ship
simple i and many others could do with a few more jump clonesi propose to change the infomorph psychology from 1 jump clonelevel to 2levelor add a new skill with informorph psychology 5 as prereq and rank 3 multiplier with 1 jclevel
supporting this duh
confirmatorywith all the new implant sets militia eccm sets midpirate sets etc that have been introduced we really need more jump clones
lets talk about sunshine for a bitthe inverse square lawwhat that means is that if a star is shining at the brightness of our sun at 2 aus distance in space say from the orbit of planet 2 then at 1 au the orbit of planet 1 it should be 4 times brighter this works in reverse as well in eve the inverse square law clearly doesnt apply stars are a uniform brightness no matter how far away you are from them the stars in new eden are ugly they were ugly before the graphics revamp of them they remain ugly now this should not be an issue they should be able to be ugly because we shouldnt be able to see the ugly parts of themwhy because of light it should be so damn bright near the stars that its impossible to see anything about them the surface of your ship facing the sun should shine with an incandescent brilliance as the light from the star is reflected off the hull leaving the back in apparent darkness and shadow space would be black no stars would shine they should be utterly smothered by the light from the nearest sunup close to the star it should be like this and as we back off further the brightest stars start to come out and if we move behind a moon or planet into the shadow the nebulas appear continuing out from the star into the night the light fades it becomes black your ship being lit only by the fiery tail of its engine exhaust the myriad of lights coming from the windows on its hull and occasional glitter of weapons fire the nebulas would shine faintly in the distance the many stars would cast a ghostly glow down onto the hull that is how space should bethat would be beautiful that would convey the immense distance seeing the star fade to blackness in the distance space growing dim and dark what we have now is nothing but a mockery of that a sad shadow of something that should be monumentally impressiveim proposing that if its feasible a general boast to dynamic lighting systems be done across the board weve seen what ccp is working on for incarna with ambient occlusion lets see this technology applied to eve at large make space truly awe inspiring in its vastness
wow there are some awesome ideas todayanything that makes the game better looking in a sensible way is good in my mind
so youre saying that they should change the brightness of the sun so that the game is mostly unplayable if you warp to the sun or are at a planet within a few aus of the sunsorry but i dont see why this would be a good idea i actually like to be able to see my ship when i warp to the sun instead of just blinding light from my monitormaybe youve forgotten that this is a game
if u wanna be feeling like ur playing a limited game then go play asteroids or tetris this is a space and social simulator
supported always hoped the ship would be a bit brighter when its sitting right on the sun we need a sunglass mode for when we do park our ship right by the sun though
you can take some liberties to make gameplay more enjoyable and still keep things realistic the info is transmitted to your pod through sensors so there are likely filters used to help the pilot manage the data and avoid overloading his senses minmatar also have cool aviator shade technology so it is easy to think of realistic reasons why the brightness can be limited to help gameplaythat doesnt mean the basic idea isnt good be generous with the lighting near the star and have mostly darkness with black space at the edge of the star system it creates better atmosphere for starsystems and much needed variation that also provides a sense of movement in space it will also provide beautiful and dramatic visuals since ship lights firing guns and explosions are the only sources of light at the edges of a star system a simple thing but greatly improves the atmosphere of the game and provides much needed variation
i support thismore realistic  more playable  prettier  good plan
since were discussing realism1 au is typically not where planet 1 orbits  in our solar system its where planet 3 aka earth orbits on averagethat said your science is correct and i wouldnt mind the changehowever  being as our podstechnology are responsible for rendering the view outside our ships to us how much of a change would this really make since i doubt that that view is being generated solely on visual data
just shrink jump ranges in general back to preprepredays eve is damn small when you can cover it in just a few jumpsccp already stated not once that they have full intention to reduce fleet bonuses to the grid rangeone day it will happen
this is a stupid buff to something that doesnt need buffingstoping thinking about what would be really cool and instead think about is this needed how will it influence the game
do please explain why this doesnt need a buff
it wont with the ehp of the aeon and the dmg bonus of the nyx the benefit of both of those ships outway the reverant in comparison to the aeons ehp bonus it doesnt have an advantage in tank over this ship the armor tanked nyx can deal similar dmg with the advantage of benefiting from rr in armor fleetstill sheild tanking battleship fleets are viable the reverant wont have as significant a role as its non faction brothers even then the wyvern with its tanking bonus will still be the normit definatly needs something and having a unique role would make it a ship worth keeping though i still wish they would fix sheild battleship fleets
so ive been on a kinda break since the end of summer  just doing skill changes  then i watched the new trailer and had that ooh i wanna go play for a bit moment and i saw the new ms model and thought ooh new shiny me wanna haz  then i read the stats for it and like most thought wtf srsly you troll me right ccp you troll me hardbut no no troll totally supporting the need for the revenant to get reexamined being a long standing fan of the nm id hoped for well i dunno what a wyvern with capital laser turrets maybeccp  youve really dropped the ball on this one and you either need to very carefully and precisely explain each and every stat line for the current incarnation of the revenant or scrap the current setup and start againem
strange must be my eyes but i cant find where i said it would never happen particularly as the topic between us revolved around something quite different but thats ok lets try to not throw behaviour suitable for caod at the assembly hall alrighti agree the current implementation of the revenant leaves much to be desired that being said when looking at proposals to make something nice and useful out of it we cant just look at the ship itself you also need to think of its use role adoption and impact on evegiving it a jumprange bonus i can see the logic behind it yes definately it does however not strike me as the better angle to take theres something to be said for concerns as mentioned in other posts here on 00 having become small as is dont get me wrong id love it but i can also see how it would make me want to go overboard with it all the way with the ship and with numbers of ships whether that is the smartest thing to do i doubt it 00 does have a bit of a history with how we take things into excess with ccp lagging behind trends created in the sandbox same goes for something i personally would love to see a ship which has the role of a supercarrier with a little bite in the form of a portal function where it takes ships within proximity and in fleet along with it on deployments in the same jump but yes thats an entirely different ballgame
i do agree that it needs something that is not its current bonus and the more i think about it even though im certainly not in favor of encouraging hot dropping or blobbing the jump range bonus makes alot of sense given the ships intended role of an oversized capital marauderthe ship is already quite fragile and i think the fact that it needs to be insystem in order to pass on this bonus would be a sufficient gimp to make people think twice about deploying it on reflection it seems quite balanced
because it gives older alliances more power and it makes eve more bloby
what you mean this wtf ccp threadoh wat
the bitter vets are the only reason new guys make it out of their steep learning curve in the early months there were many bitter vets that supported the removal of learning skills vets both for and against learning skills had those opinions to help the newer players something newer guys need to remember
and in summary what is the proposal you want csm to raise with ccp
1 to getting rid of learning skills ive been thinking of where im going to stick the sp i get for the past week 2mil sp to move around is a crap ton of sp right now as it stands im split between drones or ewar this is a very very hard decision
as someone who is both a bitter vet and has multiple characters with max learning skills i can whole heartedly say removing learning skills is the best thign ccp has done since warp to zero
it takes about 250 longer to train without them they are not optional1 for ignore bitter vets
im just fed up wasting time on learning skills when i create new characters that it helps the new players is just an unfortunate side effect
i take offense that bitter vets are being blamed as the ones against the removal of learning skills bitter vets like me are the ones who complained about having to train learning skills on their 3rd 4th 5th etc alt that it benefits noobs means we can maybe get more noob friends in the game to meat shield for us
exactly the view of most players who are 25years in who skilled to lvl5sand almost exactly the same goes for players 25 year in who didnt they get their sp back and are happy to know that they never have to worry about anyone ever catching up with themhowever if you are less than 12 months old and you actually planned to catch up with those players who are 2 years old and who didnt plan to lvl5 at the start your hopes are dashedand those saying there is no choice everyone skills learning to lvl5s then you are full of bs the average sp in learning skills is just over 2mill sp not 5million as some keep statingthere were 3 ways to effect the sphr ratio one of those has just been removed and that is a bad thingwhy not just give all toons the ability to fly a drake in the first place if you want everyone to have fun out of the boxjust removes an important aspect to skill planning and gives everyone a very static sphr ratio entrenching older players sp advantagehaving said that i agree with the changes i just wish i hadnt wasted my time planning to do 2772sphr with the view that others were doing less and i would catch upso essentially this helps anyone already ahead and removes the only method of ever catching or surpassing someone regardless of your or their ability to play this game
i agree that eve is selling their hardcore players for more 23 monthers  but the game has been moving in that direction for awhile no   so just sit back and watch all the dev efforts slowly shift to wod and thn they can really make a high turnover mass profit dad in 23 years easymode gametherre are other games and30 bucks a month is not enough for me to quit over
so what so what if eve finally is friendly to people who dont sub for six months right awayin relative terms those of us who stuck it out are not picky enough consumers because we paid to wait to pay to playit would be like insert generic mmorpg saying you have to level to 20 before you can have any abilities except that insert generic mmorpg doesnt make getting level 20 take 46 weeks
i cant wait to reallocate all of my learning sp in two weeks time im even training presence 5 in anticipation of it
ccp themselves stated learning skills were a mistake you do realize this right
learning skills suck ive been playing for 3 years with 2 accounts and that does not change my opinion they should be removed so no i do not support your proposal
not supportedbegone learning skillseve needs a slightly less damaging noobcurve the eradication of learning skills removes this and places skill firmly into attribute allocation however it removes the first month of boredom for noobs where you cant do anything but play wow or left4dead until learning is donethat is not fun i know because ive done it and am proud to have all my learning skills to 5i am delighted theyre being removed so i can max out a pile of charismabased skills i hateremoval of learning skills is win of the epic type
there is no downside to this removal ive read the complaints and they are found either wanting or ignorantnobody has lost any time here because youre getting back those points youll basically be swapping the time you spent training learning skills for whatever time you save on what skills you apply the point reimbursement to anyone who thinks otherwise can get bentnow stop wasting your time on something that unlike the plex debacle ccp wont crumble on and go play the game youre paying for
sorry if this is a repeat but i didnt see anything relating to this or know of anyone else that actually run interbus missionsi have a few hundred thousand loyality points with interbus and a level 4 interbus agent but there are no interbus stations this seems really odd for a corp to not have a home base i do know that up in the genesis region there is one system controlled by interbus but no station there it would be nice to have a place to use my loyality pointsmy suggestion would be to stick a station in that system they control which will allow any cap pilot to turn in hisher points but the reward will need to be new and different from all others add in new transport ships  interbus specific much like faction warshipsadd in new personal  trade goodsadd in new cargo expanders  meta 6 and upbasically add in stuff that conicedes with transportation of goods andor uses the knowledge of interbus thanks
walking around in a pos i think is an excellent idea i could see it now you riding in an elevator to ho up the spire of the tower and then when you arrive at the top you can look out at your titan parked in the shields somewhere and your in a huge observation deck would be really cool
i think something should be done indeed to make pos security more granular
this i always turn the camera away and then get blinded when i warp past the sun
dim definitely perhaps something like in sunshine with the filtering system

dim bubble gum background too
eccm rigs nice but why not just have them increase sensor strengththe only thing to consider is that they would make unprobeable ships a lot easier to fit
good idea  one side is strengthened both should be so its balanced how much of a benefit that might need tweaking
i think straight sensor boost rigs would be a good idea
so what do the majority of the rest of rigs do
op mentioned ecm and eccm rigs but if you totally insist you can ofc bring polycarbs and their relevance to ew into this discussion as well
now this this is a good idea
good idea
i support this venture entirely
shiroi sneezessorry im allergic to hypocrisy
no just noi can see you put a good deal of effort into this but it just doesnt pan out with all the changes you have you did not crossrace compare to see what you did or you just decided caldari ew ships should be god modethese ship adjustments are poor ideas and the effect of ecm unless you give it a burst style lose tracking then can reacquire 1 target  no no way in hell i may not like its op nature and the only ew drones worth using but these changes would make this worse than the sensor damp nerf while also granting caldari ew ships huge benefits for not using ecm look at the griffin first and compare it to the maulusgriff now 2 missiles 1 gun 1 dronemaulus 2 guns 2 dronesyour change puts 2 missiles 1 gun and 3 drones  6 weapons on an ew frigatein its role that 5 shield resists per level isnt bad  mids burned by ew mods type situation outside its role 4 mids you made the griffin used outside its role potentially one of the better combat t1 frigates in the gameill just touch on your changes making caldari ew the longest ranged ew ships using all other races ew 150 optimal and falloff on sensor dampstps and turret disruptors for caldari you just pushed the caldari ability to ewar through the roof when not using their racial ecm  they already have the longest targeting range of any ships in the game so now you give them the ability to use other races ew farther than those races can do with their own typenow  in its role  75 bonus to strength at the ship bonus level would you like to show me any other ew frigate that gets anything near that kind of bonus to their ew so i train caldari frigates to 2 so i can fly a griff and my ew picks up the strength bonuses that every other ew frigate has to be trained to 5 to obtain your no get out of jail free idea that feeds the gankersgate campers eliminates a huge portion of ecms viability at all primary  ok so i lose all targets except primary not a bad deal there i can ignore that type of ewar as any form of interference to my gate camp the gankers dream  no protection from the gank by those using ecmsorry  that doesnt work it guts ecm down way too much and replaces it with all other types for caldari im for modifying the stuff but not this way
nice attempt 210 for effort here have a kerchief with your hypocrisy despite the damage control attempts in this thread you cannot really deny the fact that intially the op opened up all ew ships by hisher suggestion for changes apparently only the caldari ones though not insinuating any hidden motives why i never here but quite obviously the interracial balance wasnt even worth a cursory thought in the theorycrafting done that is assuming that it was not the intention to totally screw up that balance solely in favor of caldari ew ships and sorry to say im not at all thrilled by the advent of wtfbbq caldari ew ships to rule them all ymmv
ive been saying much the same thing for a while my solution to the current state of ecm was actually just posted herethe main differences areit always succeedsyoure unable to lock the ship jamming you optional you can lock the ship jamming you if your sensor strength is greater than the strength of the jammereccm is changed to increase scan resolution and to increase the number of targets you can lock by one even while being jammedthe only boost to ecm ships is one that increases their standing power
various ships listed show this or similar what do the celestis bellicose arbitrator etc gain in return for giving the caldari boats nonracial ewar bonusesi do like the idea of ecm reducing max targets though maybe each module reducing by a fixed amount rather than setting to 1 that allows for variationst2 etc and might also make multitasking 5 more useful
definately not supported
ive rattled my brain a bit on the issue and i cant think of any balancing solution to the current situation without either beinga completely ineffectiveb so overpowered it directly destroys assets of a characterthough with things progressing the way they have the latter option might be the only real potential solutionlets be honest all power in the game is directed into the hands of a few select alliances and corporations and the few characters that control them these organizations in turn sit in the best space take the best moons resources bpos systems whatever they like and horde assets they maintain puppet alliances around them splitting 00 primarily but even empire space into factions pro this or pro that there is hardly a system in the game lacking this influence the only exceptions being systems these organizations have written off as not worth the effort with these assets the major alliances sit on their space uncontested and can only be challenged by another of their kind no other organization has the assets the income not to mention the capital and super capital fleets large enough to take on such an alliance the sandbox of eve the self described open universe of a game is truly closed you must know someone to get in even if you dont want in you must know someone who is because everyone else does how can you not when these alliances can drop in 20 supercaps or hundreds of paid mercenaries on a whim without even batting an eye at the potential costwhy because they dont care they dont care if they lose 20 supercaps they dont care if they lose 100 why would they with assets and reserves and income like that it can all be replaced to them at least anyone else would be bankrupt by such a loss one could take all players not immediately involved in 00 alliances and compare them to just one of these major organizations all the thousands of them in empire space add their collective incomes and still not match the 00 allianceeven besides all of aspects of the game created by player influence there remains the countless changes by ccp to help these major alliances in their continued domination of every aspect of the game recent improvements to 00 incomes for example infrastructure improvements constant tearing of minerals plexes pirates and planets in favor of 00 systems the complete inability for players to have access to a super capital without sovereignty much less the ability to afford one ensures that only the most powerful can obtain these ships and yet even in changes and additions ccp would call fair and balanced the equation still favors these major alliances factional warfare is now practically an extension of proxy 00 wars each faction backed by a particular alliance recent incursions in tyrannis have been even worse any system not in high security space was either completely locked down by a 00 alliance at the time of the incursion controlled by proxy by a factional warfare group or most recently completely ignored because 00 alliances realized there was no profit to be gained by them why does no one else show up you ask because these alliances have already ruined this new aspect of the game for everyone else ccps solution is to do nothing or to blatantly assist the very alliances that hold power over the rest of the players no doubt because gms still maintain characters in these alliances and yet claim no conflict of interest so that is the problem glaringly obvious as it iswhat is the solution i dont know if there is oneany possibility would likely be incredibly complicated effect nearly every aspect of gameplay and would take months to hash out but perhaps now is a good time to get started havent these organizations ruined the game for long enough
first in what will be an epic flame festthey worked hard to get where they are if you can get more people to follow you and out blob a small oo alliance and take space you are in then make allies and start a war to expand your territory this is the end game of eve and it is not easy to have your corp fly your flag as the leader of an empirework for it and stop worrying about super caps that will die like anything else if you apply enough numbers to the problem oh and if an alliance lost 20 they would care
you make your problem obvious but you have no proposal to offer at all even though you marked the thread as a proposal at this point in the thinking process general discussion or features and ideas forums might be a better choice since you are just basicly asking others to give out their ideas after you have something you think might be worthy of implementing with slight tweaks come back here and we can discuss it and vote on it
once upon time there was no alliances in game however regardless of that there were entities that people knew by their names curse alliance querious defence force to name a two all it takes is select few people meet in the poorly lit room exchange few nods and so things happen if for example black avatar and imperium tehnologies ceos meet in such room to say  make for example chat channel called qdf there is not a lot ccp can do about it and all the sudden if you go and take a bite out of black avatar assets shortly afterwards you find that imperium technologies guys just accidentaly happened to pass by see you as bigger threat and gank you with black avatar guys it was before my time ofc point is however that if you prevent in game ways of coordinating it will be done out of the game putting small guys at even greater disadvantage as they probably lack the out of the game infrastructure not everyone can afford a teramspeak server that can take thousand clients connecting to it while evevoice is free and usable even by small guys
is there supposed to be some sort of proposal behind this
im assuming something like nerf the nc they are strong and mean 
i feel your pain on this but to change it would change eve sure groups like the nc control vast amounts of territory and resources but it wasnt always that way and it probably wont always be that way bob once controlled ridiculous amounts of power too but because of the games mechanics and not in spite of them bob self destructed that is the fundamental ebb and flow of eve
totally agree this is a gamebreaking problem that will be the downfall of eve ccp better act fast or the game will be no more in a mere 18 months oh wait i thought you were talking about lag nvm then ibtl as the proposal proposes nothing
lets get more supporters people
they were awesome
engine trails plus thunder and lighting of capital jump and old cynos look at the start video of eve have you ever wondered what is this lighting reflected from the eye in the beginning yup  thats the old cynocapital jump it would be pathetic if you would see reflection of the new effect in there
everyone loves engine trails
helloin the menu you should have two options log off and change characterif you click on change characters you go to the charactermenu of your accountso you dont have to log in and type in your passwort if you want to switch between the characters of the same accountbest wishesmister lotto
supported since my alts are all on one account this would make it a little easier to switch to them for managing industry jobs etc
am of two minds on this one you need to have some form of cooldown timer though if only to prevent abuse of it that said weve been needing a proper logoff mechanic forever
well it used to exist  a loooooong time ago  but was removed because it killed the client in the end
under trade goods we have alot of personal standing around do nothing slackers granted some stations demand some but other then that the exotic dancer gets all the attentioni suggest adding slots in ships to add personal to your crewthey will act like rigs but can be removed and replaced at anytime plus they do not give negative only positive the postivie will need to be a small  but enough to attract people to use themfor example  scientist  give 5 bonus to mining scanning probingmilitia  give 5 bonus to attack strength of certain weapon typeetcnow with slaves since they are used mainly by amarr can only be used by amarr and one of the personal slots will have to be filled with a slaver hound or a slave handler of sorts but slaves give a 3 bonus to everything examplethis will add another phase to eve one which i think is good it will require charisma to be used more since all skills needed to actually use personal will require it as the primary attribute this will give new meaning to role players make it to where your race actually means something and will increase the traffic for personal use in gamenot quite sure about exotic dancer but i am sure someone can help determine the right bonus for herhim
since driving from work i thought of a twist to this to make it interestingwhen your ship goes down your crew escapes with you in your pod now if you get podded then your crew can be rescued and used by the enemy if they survive make pod killing alittle more worth while
i realize that there is already an existing thread in favor of the ccpannounced plan to removing learning skills however im not comfortable with characterizing those who disagree as bitter veterans thus with no offense intended to herping yourderp i would like to start a separate thread to express support for ccps chosen course of actionwe the undersigned believe that ccp chose a good method for removing learning skills and compensating both current and future players for the removal of said skills and further believe that the game will be better as a result some amongst the undersigned may disagree about whether the method chosen by ccp was the best method for addressing issues related to the learning skills but we all do agree that it is a good method in that it will be an improvement over the present situation and wish for ccp to continue either in the manner that it was described in the abovelinked developer blog or in some manner very similar to what was announcedthank you

this imo has to be the longest problem in eve history the logs are not showing anything havent been showing anything for a long time and by the looks of it wont be showing anythingwe need the logs fixed
i am going to guess you had a ship reimbursement petition get rejectedthat aside what should the logs show everything everyone does in game do you realize how much additional load that would put on the servers you think we have lag nowthe logs need to show enough to allow ccp to show when they have had an actual problem on their the servers end no more and certainly no less

what a bunch of unimaginative whinersminmatar  tracking disruption to maximize speed advantagecaldari  target painting to maximize missile damagegallente  ecm im at a bit of a loss on this one ill go with it gives the drones time to work and maximizes time to get in close with blastersamarr  sensor damps to maximize range advantage of lasers
but that would make too much sense we cant have that in eve
on the one hand thats a decent ideaon the other hand expect the prices of falcons to crash and burn horrendously also expect a lot of whining about how now caldari is even more useless in pvp
you have missed the point of racial ewar by a huge margin here ill explain whygallente like to engage at very close range so they use sensor damps to shape the battlefield and force enemy ships into close range fighting where gallente should always win lol blasters secondary ewar is long range warp disruption pretty useful when youre using scramblers but its a bit weird that the fed navy scrams arnt the longest rangeamarr use tracking disruption so that very fast targets cant track minnies forcing them to slow down where lasers can track remember my transversal  their transversal secondary ewar is energy neuts this prevents the use of mwds and active tanks something the minnies like to useminmatar use target painting to maximise dps and assist with turret tracking webs also assist with creating a speed advantage this is how they fightcaldari get ecm thats just the way it goes they also dont get a secondary ewar they put all their eggs into the ecm basket hence the double bonus to ecm on falcons and the likes

as the owner of a new indy toonless than a year i was hoping to make myself t2 rigs and t2 ships while able to invent such items building them is costly because of the need to get moon harvested products was just wondering why empire space was out of bounds couldnt it be simular to belts and pi the higher the sec the lower the income yes i know im just looking to ease my own cost some but it would be nice if i could eat away as much of the build cost as i could
wrong forum to post inand your too noob young to be making that proposalmoon mining while nerfed some time back is still profitable enough to be a problem in high secgo to low sec00 to get your moons
it was more of a question in wonder rather than expecting it anything to happen just smacks alittle that i have a pos on a moon but cant pull back alittle income from it but like all things in eve with time comes more new things and the leaving of empire behide to seek vast new incomes in the lawlessnessdamn hard to say worlds
why then clutter the ah forumsthere would had been gd or si forums for this
moved from assembly hall as this is more about discussion than a proposal
you dont need moons to make t2 anythingif you chose this option id add bring friends
ummm yes you doalso empire dwellers dont deserve things like minable moons bad enough concord protects you
its the same reason they dont let you mine moons in wh space taking towers out in high sec is a bear especially if its an ecm star ccp didnt want anyone to have a permanent safe isk trickle with no danger
so what youre saying is that you feel eve should be upgraded to a dx11 renderer i agree i mean wow can do it why cant eve
you dont need dx11 for that1 for sun beamsgod raysmoar shinies
i stand to lose billions of isk profits to this change because i was building a character manufacturing system based on the idea that people hate training learning skills buy a character with them already maxed and you can play as if you never had to train them at all but when dec 14th comes along ill have to find a different way to make those billionsso believe me when i say sod the learning skills and any idea that keeps them
because the other t2 bpo proposal is garbage how about something more interesting t2 bpo beacons the bpos become unusable in npc stations and whatever else theyre stored in shows up on the overview like a cyno beacon also theyd be viewable on the star map with a new filter that way if you want one or just want them out of the game you can go kill it

oh looksomebody else who doesnt know what hes talking about
oh lookanother goon how strange for a goon to want a reduction in skill training biggest whiners in eve
you have no ideaone goon runs out of cheetos or mountain dew and then thats all we hear about for hours on end
tbh i dont see what everyones complaining about learning skills were never that complex to begin with given that the rule of thumb was pretty much if youre playing eve for more than a month train your learning skills why people go on and on about how its ruining the complexity of eve is beyond me i remember when i first started playing i loaded up for my first level one mission taking out an incursis with some 125 rails and antimatter i remember going into the mission and wondering why it was i couldnt fking hit anything my friend then sat me down and explained the mechanics of the combat system to me optimal range falloff tracking speed transversal velocity i remember thinking what the everloving f you mean i have to factor all this crap in before i can so much as hit somethingcompare that to your average mmo where hitting something basically amounts to get biggest stickboomstick you can click on enemy lulz ensue if anything the biggest hit to the complexity of the game came to us in the form of eft which so nicely tells us exactly what fitting out a ship a certain way will do for us and even then think of the amount of numbers eft spits out at you seriously go open it up and just look at them allto all the people whining about the learning skill removal theyre a pain in the butt theyre practically mandatory so the argument of depthcomplexity is a sham and making eve a teeny tiny bit easier to get into at the lower end really shouldnt be that big of a deal you whiny little s
the smokey smokey it is not a good combination with the forums go deal with those munchies and head to bed and leave the talking to everyone else 
learning skills werent complex they were filler skills that is all just something else to train in the long list of other skills the only problem is these skills did not directly affect your trade combat or social skills when you finished a month of training your ship flew no faster could use no new pieces of equipment you could not buy or sell for more or less nor were there any other visible differences except that you trained more quickly it was a bad idea to skip em unless you were a low sp specialized char and it was a real bore to train emall together it isnt a loss ill enjoy putting that 18 mil sp elsewhere
wasting a month learning how to learn faster meant lots of new players got put off playing evefrom a financial point of view ccps accountants decided learning skills were counter intuitive and therefore cost them alot of possible income via new subsnerfing learning skills and replacing them with base attribute increases means more noobs might actually train proper useful skills during thier trial and are therefore more likely to subdownside is now macros haulers can be trained in even less timehowgallente destroyer in 2 days  triple cargo rigged  3x t2 cargo expanders  943m3 gallente cruiser in 4 days  exequror with 3x t2 cargos  3x cargo rigs  between 1900m3 and 2500m3 cargo hold depending on gal cruiser skill level
the loss of the 100 sp bonus helps a bit on that
actually the devs have gone on record saying that they think adding new stuff will bring in more subscribers than actually completing the development of current stuff fixing the ui fixing the sp curve etc while theyve gone back on that a bit recently i think its still the governing philosophy
and its been that way for the past 7 years they constantly jump from feature to feature its not new and any argument that says eve is dying because they are only focus on getting new players is flawed if the governing philosophy of the company hasnt changed for 7 tears this is nothing new people cosmos missions i mean come on are you saying the reason they never worked on them wasbecause they didnt care about the older players and just wanted new ones there were no old playersccp just has adhd they freaking love new features and always have and while some really big features have been left behind i thinka it might be the reason they do so well the game is changing so much its kinda addicting to see what random new thing is going to randomly completely change the gamebdespite eve is dying posts every expansion there is also a patch page as long as this thread with fixes and changes to old content that stuff just never gets advertised
i dont think eve is dying in fact im relatively certain eve has more people now than ever before however i do like new features as it keeps players around while i wish that they would at least split part of their dev team off even just 2 or 3 people to focus entirely on fixing the game these new features are bringing in players left and rightthe end result of eve is just as important to our enjoyment now as later think about it the more players we get at this moment the more folks well have to fight and play with the more players there are also the better chance another company down the road long after eve has shut down will look at eve and say i like the concept of this game lets give it a try sadly in mmo standards 50000100000 subscribers for a space game isnt as big of a money maker as say a cookie cutter fantasy wowripoff that can drag in several hundred thousand as players its all the same to us but it would be nice to give companies incentive to keep making space games 
well to be fair eve online has 350000 players more that city of heroes final fantasy 1114 warhammer online ectand while i agree with everything your saying i argue you to consider that they always release fixes over 100200 per expansion its just that ccp when they look at say factional warfare ugh they see fixing a feature that big as useless they would rather opt for waiting 2 years and redesigning it from scratch its more of a mindset thing
just another example of ccp putting profit before the culture of their game
they work reasonably well i dont recall any promises that they could eradicate all blobs foreveryoure looking for a technical fix to human behaviour these rarely if ever work
good luck doing much to a supercap blob with mere bombers unless you outblob them massively with numbers but then again youd face the conundrum bigger blob  blob  bring moah numbers shrug
i dont personally know of any dev posts exhaustively detailing the ccp vision for local and justifying its current stateyou could try and track down some 2 year old recordings of ccp zulupark and another 2 devs i forget open discussions on balance issues following his superb whats wrong with the game i paraphrase thread local being an omniscient intel tool that ruins attempts at stealthy gameplay was touched upon there
hey if they replaced the d scanner with a real time radar system that did the equivalent of hit d scanner every 5 seconds that might work or every 10 seconds if using more than half of the currently available 14 au part of the current issue in whs is people doing a site can align and get into warp before a hunter has dropped out of warp if they want to get all fancy there is even the possibility of tying d scannerradar hits to sensor strengthsig radius of ships so i may also become queen of england
removing local is just a boost to blobbing
thanks for the dev pointer helped immensely
there is only a tiny problem 50000 d scanner querying the server every 2 seconds if you recall a couple years ago a cooldown period was introduced for the d scanner because the number of queries from people mashing it constantly was giving the server troubles make it a system that run constantly like your suggested radar and server usage will spike horrendously
hmm correct me if im wrong but wouldnt delayed local be perfect for macroers i mean if youre using a macro youll hide yourself deep into 00 territory in a deadend rarely visited system and fire it up hunters that want to get you would not even know if you are in local until they scan the system right now with local in place you can travel through a fair amount of systems and check the local to see if anyone is there you can even scout the targeted area and gather intel on whos in which system during a certain part of the day making a list of players using macros easier to create macroers tend to work in low populated areas of space so in many systems you as a hunter will be alone if youre alone in the system youll just quickly skip it and proceed to another system looking for targets however if we take local out of the picture gathering intel about potential players that are using macro software to rat will be much harder boring and time consuming than it is now in other words it will discourage huntersmacro software will just evolve and adapt to the situation assuming that the macro software uses local as an intel tool in low populated areas which is the main argument for your claim you must realize that from a programming point of view theres no difference between gathering intel from local or from any other source take the directional scanner for example if the directional scanner modified or in current form would be the new intel gathering tool then not only that you are effectively hiding macroers in low populated areas like i described earlier but you are making them even more invincible than they are now a software that makes dscanner refresh requests in the minimum time intervals allowed by the game mechanics will always be more effective than a human in addition theres the server load problem or cpu per user any active intel gathering tool that sends a request to the server to get the information unlike watching local which is passive will increase server resource consumption per user naturally macro users will then make even bigger problems because their time effective automated software will consume much higher amounts of resources than the regular ineffective humanin the end just let me say im sorry in advance for this but it must be said justifying requests to change fundamental game mechanics good or bad that we all used for years by mentioning defense from illegal macro users is more or less pathetic not a single game mechanic that even a single legitimate paying customer uses in his every day gaming is worth changing by justifying it with antimacro fight legitimate users should not ever take one for the team when it comes to fighting against macroers if a game mechanic is bad or could be made better the only valid arguments must include legitimate players onlyanti outo
thats not what is said now is it it was not a couple of years ago it was far more recent that an actual cooldown was addedpeople only use the d scanner frequently in 00 and w spacehaving it only autoon in 00 and whs and manual as it is now in empire or in other words empire will be exactly as it is now would not dramatically increase server load if an appropriate time interval between querys was chosen people are used to having a foolproof and idiot proof warning that someone else is near them an automatic d scan of 20 seconds between activations would still give people ample time to react to threatsadding further safeguards whereby systems with more than 300 people in them had d scan implemented as a manual tool would further help mattersin addition the server load generated by the d scanner before the cooldown was a consequence of macros making requests several times a secondlastly having a sov upgrade that gave you empire like local channels as they are now that made the d scan manual would be a good step it would give alliances a greater degree of safety in exchange for not having the much more lucrative isk generating sov upgrades in that systemyou seem to be misconstruing the facts here a little
i am perfectly aware you were pushing for your hunter advantage proposing the 5 or even 10 seconds timer and half range currently it is 13 seconds unless i have missed a change and it was 2 seconds when it was nerfed 5 second for 7 au is a long timer 2 second timer was implemented apocrypha 15 released 20 august 2009 ie 14 months ago it fall decently within the couple of years mark no mention of 00 only change in your previous post and honestly i doubt a automated in 00not automated outside of 00 systems will work at most it would be a activatedeactivate d scanner option and everyone will keep it activated you know carebears use it to check for ninja looter in theirs missions low sec people to find probes and so on 20 seconds now make it 24 hours maybe you should read a bit on how fast probes can find a ship probably you know that perfectly and that is the reason why you want to push the timer up
if you want it implemented as an automatic measure in 00 only just tie it to the sov structureupgrades stuff what did we get that tcusbuwhatever crap for else if youre fine with 25 second sweep okay lvl 1 upgrade will do if you want a 5 second one sure get lvl 5 and pay the cost hell yeah sure some muppet will now complain 5 seconds are waaaaay to long and call the waaambulance its an example of how it could work ffs that way you dont hand the advantage of that automated scanradarwhatever on a platter to every macro and put some risk vs reward ratio into the equation by charging more isk for more effective scans in the systemand before anyone now claims that will lag out all of nullsec to kingdom come got any facts to prove that
while i agree that csmplayer engagement on the forums is somewhat lacking i am guilty myself its a fact that there is only so much time in the day that can be devoted to csm stuff the conversations that take place in the internal csm forums are often processrelated or bound by nda constraints they cannot feasibly involve nor be shared with players but they are a vital element in the effectiveness of the csm i feel the csm should do more to keep players informed about their routine activities inspired by one such request i am attempting to address that information gap with the recently created csm5 activity update wiki page it might be worthwhile to list the discussion topics we are addressing with devs under ongoing projects including which ccpians are involved i need to ask our ccp advocates if this is okay to do but i think players might find that interestingespecially if the topic status is identified active inactive concludedalso fwiw i do try when upvoting or opposing ah proposals to make a comment or two about reasons for my support or lack of it sometimes the benefits of a proposed change are so blatantly clear that not much needs to be said
ok tell you what make meaningful paragraphs from that monstrosity of a post and maybe ill come back and try to read it looking it like this its pointless

this is a cool proposal and would add some really good dynamicism to some elements of the gamei can see why some people dont like the mechanical change but i think theres some confusionwarp charge time would require total alignment and is a replacement to the slow ramp up in speed when a target is invunerable in warp whether bumping could occur at that point is debatable as physically a warp bubble would be acting on the ship any1 talking about bumping to prevent warp would have had the oppertunity to do so normally u cant bump forever guys the charge time should be indicated by an effect similar but not related to being webbed etc its the rapid deceleration that i think could be an issue cause the data collection and display of graphical elements elements would have to be almost instant client side at the moment its ramped up and the clinet computer is allowed time to crunch numbers to display properly how a sudden punch in to full graphics would work with many computers would be debatable as well as the effects of someones ship idle in space for a second or two while their computer catches up could result in some rage in a perfect world id be 2 thumbs up 2 big toes up and another but its gonna need a lil more deep thought to see if its gonna work well in biiiig fights when ur computer has to sweat profusely to crunch numbers rediculoously fast to stop u idlingthe only way i can see is if your computer starts the number crunching to display everything properly early before the server tells everyone else ur there that can spiral a lil out of control with client computers crunching numbers for a scene thats not fully composed due to other players clients not identifying themselves thereall in all we would need a lot more info on actually how the client and server communicates to see if the load would work without lag or excessive idle times to see if theres room to squeeze this in and that can only be done by having a csm raise it to the devs at ccp for that reason alone 1 from me for sure
just realised this warp change would also practically remove the appearance of noclipping through stations and ships etc when u go into warp that always bugged me

very glad that you liked it ccp atlas is there any chance that some of the suggestions for improvements will make it into the january contract refactoring
he forgot to tick the support this topic box though
i kind of like the idea a couple issues i see with it1 even though the game is moving slower that wont stop people from spamming buttons think about the classic video gamer leaning irl to in response to the turning in game not being fast enough or a better example is games with bullet time really how many people spam the keys anyway i know i do jump faster jump faster so that would still need to be addressed on the client end i think accepting the first click and not accepting another of the same command until the server has responded2 there will still be metagaming i remember in iac when we would be told to jet can ammo as fast as we could and have our drones out shooting to bring down the node so mc couldnt take out stations before our reinforcements got to us same would be true whether by that old trick i think gms get annoyed when people do that or simply dropping a bunch of carriers and super carriers into a system and dumping drones to slow it down3 nodes unfortunately each system is not hosted on a single server so unless the system was reinforced by ccp making a server laggy effects multiple systems so we might run into a random large fight in 00 and cause a bunch of missionplex runners to experience this slow down or will they just experience the node death they currently experience keep it to only reinforced nodes and you are missing half the laggy situationsi still like the idea just thought it would be nice to point out some cons
also watch the rorqual you can put a rorqual in a normal ship maintenance bayhow can this be the rorqual or a carrier is way to big to go into this tiny thing looks awful
i support bigger isnt always beter but it dam well helps
in support of my lady i too an in support of the the idea of continued and expanded diversity in the eve universei support this idea as long as it is tastefully done and not just for s and giggles weather or not you agree with another lifestyle you should be tolerant of that lifestyle and allow others to live the way they want to live if ccp decides to support this idea im sure it will be as tastefully done and done with respect
you rang
yes

i agree  the two things i found most surprising to find out was that repair drones couldnt repair their master and that the orca couldnt mine yah i have noob moments lol
totally supported i was dismayed when i found out i couldnt repair myself with my own droneson a side note this would open up whole new avenues for setup strategiesand that my friends is what eve is or at least should be all about
of course
supported i still remeaber the day i found out i could not repair myself with my own drones too
of course it does my drones still go off on their own to have tea with the queen
as long as i cant accidentally ecm myself with ecm drones and my combat drones cant attack me im okay with this i can see potential tactical reasons to use target painter and weapon disruptor drones on myself as well though
supportedme is surprised was expecting more disapproval of this idea
being able to leave the armor rep home and fit another plate has that effect

i too struggle to see what vampires have to do with evesure its smart to leverage eve code into new markets just wish it wasnt done at the expense of eve
not supported the mmo genre is predominantly based on social depth now im not saying that eve has no social depth it quite clearly does  however it is in desperate need of more attention a lot of mmo players like to feel connected with their avatar not just a generic spaceship that anyone else can flythe level of customisation and attachment that incarna will bring will attract a lot more players which will mean more players to shoot at in spaceand we can all agree that is a good thingfurther i dont like the idea of breaking the game down into 2 wholly different genres  it would split the community more and null and low sec would become even less populated

drones really need some love1but be careful with your wishes with intelligent drones you can afk do a lot it will be similar to afk makro mining and i dont want that
i think we already are seeing those fleets on the rise in response to drake army fleetsa sentry blob controlled by one person is beyond op there is no defense against such a thing the only warning you might get is one ship locking you before you instantly die rr domi blobs are hard enough to kill as it is
all drones should follow you in warp
im not sure if covert ops would help them out all that much their main problems are that they cant really commit to their ranges in combat due to dying in a fire whenever they try covert ops cloak doesnt really change that it would only give them some short lived utility

yes my bpc and bpo cans are such a mess its painful to work with copies i support anything which helps to make this mess better
good idea
supported
sup dawg i heard you like cans so we put some cans in your cansjokes aside it would be useful for blueprints and skill books
something must be done about t2 bpos eve is a cruel place but always having t2 hanging over the heads of all new players who were not around for the old days isnt rightlevel the field and remove them from gamelet it die so everyone can move on with more important things like lag
when you say recording do you mean with fraps i think that a vocal minority would be highly suspicious of this as it is technically possible to edit these things my concern is that they would be loud enough to harm the funding campaignthe perfect solution would be a new type of contract notarized destruction a public and therefore searchable contract which simply trashes the item but retains a permanent record of it in the form of a finished contractit could become a badge of honour to voluntarily destroy a unique item if there was some way of showing it off
that is a statement i can agree with
supportedt2 bpos must go one way or another how are they going to go and which compensation will be given to the owners is on the community and ccp do decide
i agree with this proposal either let everyone who works hard enough have one or do not let anyone have onefairness is a key element of eve and the absolute fairness in all mechanics ie if he can do it so can i makes the t2 bpo unfairness even more egregious
are you trolling or so who ever works hard enough can buy one just need money
leave tech 2 bpos ingame and bring back the lottery system
you can get a t2 bpo in exactly the same way that the great majority of current owners got theirs i dont see how much fairer it could be
currently if you join a fleet with an armor mindlinked commander you transparently aquire 15 extra armor hp magically improving your armor plates instantly no repping requiredif you do the same with a shield siege mindlink however your current shield total remains the same and you have 15 shield damage you will need to repair this to get the benefit of the additional hp be it through patience or active reppingthen it gets worseif your commander disconnects passes control to another or some other fleet organization changes or you simply jump into the next system you lose the extra shield and even if your bonusgiver has equivalent or less of a bonus you need to regeneraterepair it as if from scratch againarmor bonuses shift fleet all you want reducesaugments your armor total on the flyfor smaller ships this is usually mitigated within a few minutes for battleships it can take longer and forget about ever seeing your extra shield bonus if youre in a capital ship jumping into a firefight one can only laugh if you get a leviathan bonus youll be at 60 shields and need a triage carrier remote repairing you if you hope to see 100 shields anytime soonon top of this free hp boost armor tankers even have an implant set to improve their armor total even more thats fine shield and armor tanking are different and i like the diversity raw hp vs regenerated but for gang bonuses the difference in behavior is just too disruptive to be remotely equatedchange the shield fleet bonuses to be applied instantly and completely like other gang bonuses
supportedthis is a painw when youre roaming in smaller gangs with a few scimitars etc
supporting my own topic
not empty posting
sokratesz tried getting that passed in csm 4original ah thread so people dont relive the same debate againarguments against had been1 boost to passive tank was unfair compensated by not being immediate boost to total tank2 drake hatersarguments for well you got the ideathe compromise in the thread was to have the recharge rate slow down equal to the increase in shields from the gang bonus despite that csm voted 72 against the proposali supported it then i support it now
i thought it might have been brought up before but lol searching eve forumsafter reading that however i noticed that the arguments against it are speciousespecially the free t2 shield recharger one armor bonuses give two free t2 regenerative plate modules effectivelyadditionally the passive tanking argument while somewhat valid is also less of an issue yes you tank slightly harder thanks to the gang bonus but the worst case scenarioa mindlinked leviathan boosted brick drake gangis both unlikely to be seen and can be addressed with the compromise of a recharge time penalty added to the leviathan a mindlink alone doesnt have that dramatic an effectedit plus drakes buffed like that would have massive sigs and be very susceptible to bombs
so what happens if you are fighting in armor and have a friend keep toggling fleet booster role on and off repeatedly every time you get 10 shields magically appear in middle of a fight when everyones in armor
what happens when youre fighting in armor and the armor booster toggles fleet booster on and off repeatedlythe shield bonus should appear based on your shield percentageif you are at 0 shields and get a gang bonus you still have 0 shields if youre at 50 you stay at 50 and only get half the bonus immediately appliedthe total potential goes up
this is obvious and should have been done long ago
not emptyquoting
same thing that happens when you do this with armor ships and armor bonuses the its unfair since shield tanks get passive recharge argument is honestly nothing but pure bs passive recharge is one of the advantages that shield tanking as a whole gets to make up for its disadvantages like difficulty in fitting ewar tackle and antiewar like eccm the gang bonus is then supposed to boost the gangs shield tank as a whole not only a very specific part of it that is very rarely used in situations where you actually have gang bonusespassive tanks would not be affected by this change since the first 1015 shield is pretty irrelevant to them anyway since recharge is almost 0 up there and they already get the recharge rate boost from getting increased maximum shield but it would help make shield buffered ships more viable
smarti hope ccp adds it to its list of things to ignore along with the 100200 other good ideas from the last two prioritizations
i say this for years now outer space is way waaaay too brightchanging the light intensity to some more realistic behaviour instead would improve ambient and immersion so muchyes yes change it to inverse square

so older alliances are going to be the first to get a randomly dropped bpc that only comes out of lowsec i would be interested in your logic
your logic never ceases to amaze me but at least it is an interesting pattern when someones post does not fit the shout just slightly twist the route or the message untl its back where you want it hilarious how you keep doing that
it seems a legitimate question also if you look at 00 its predominately older alliances even providence is being taken over by ev0ke an incredibly old alliance right now 00 is about as unfriendly as it could be for a new alliance the few new alliances i have seen try to move in within the last 3 yearswith the exception of test were removed with extreme force why would a ship make this worse this would suggest you can kill a man who is already dead as for the anti blob statement ccp likes blobs they support and encourage them they put a sizable amount of money into helping larger and larger groups of players to blob so the idea that blobbing  bad is unfortunately not shared by ccp they think there should be alternatives for people but so far as small groups effecting sov goes well we know how that ends anyways the fact you simply try to dismiss what i say is telling if you have nothing to add i would welcome you to simply not respond but i appreciate the bump so argue away
see now that was almost a good reply but in the last paragraph you seemingly could not avoid falling prey to the same old habit i did not dismiss what you said at all but argue away at least it is a twist on someones post that brings a smile on peoples faces edit on the note of ccp liking blobs it may look that way but thats just a consequence of lack of affinity due to distance from experiencing these things directly and well lack of vision and maybe a little willpower to deal with such things its perfectly possible to deal with things but that is a totally different debate 
or it could be that the game itself is designed so we can have those sorts of large fleet fights in fact thats how balancing has been shifting towards they stated repeatedly at the last fan fest they enjoy both taking part and having take place the large fleet fights in eve you can assume they have a disconnect from not playing all you want but the fact is that many devs do play the game they just arent permitted to let people know they do ccp stated they wanted small gangs to be able to effect sov but obviously the dominion system is as unfriendly to small gangs as pos warfare is to solo battleships i think to say ccp dislikes blobs out of ignorance is in itself ignorance ccp stated they want all kinds of warfare to be both important and playable small large guerrilla and previously unused tactics that we simply havent thought up or encountered yet does dominion discourage all but large very nearly does this mean this ship will make things worse no it would mean a few things while you yourself may dislike blobs not everyone does maybe everyone in your circle does maybe everyone you talk to does that does not mean its a universal truth i know numerous people who literally only play the game for large scale combat why should my game play be less valid than yours1st a fleet looking to hotdrop a target past the edge of their unbuffed range would have to gather in one system i know nothing of you or any alliance you may play for but i am in the habit of supercaps logging into different systems and even different constellations with the target in mind so they are harder to track and lock down 2nd if you are saying that this would in fact encourage blobbing more you would be implying people arent already bringing everything they can to a fleet i think this is patently false if you know a fleet fight is coming you move within range or within the midpoints range before that time a ship that enhanced this would in fact do no harm to this practice if you are implying there would be supermobile supercap fleets then i would have to only chuckle at you only one alliance in the game that i know of routinely moves its supercap fleet around eve and i think balancing the game around one group of players is silly at best
argueing for a buff to the speed and range people can drop supers in eves current enviroment is just plain crackerswhat will you ask for next nerfs to the bounty office
hey i covered that exact complaint in the post directly above yours
look at the trend for the scale of battles in eve only tracked the battles where people were able to shoot each other ccp puts a lot of effort into making these ever increasingly larger battles happen they report these battles as indirect pats on their backs their advertising focuses on these giant battles they call it a massive multiplayer for a reason the more people involved the betteranyway this bonus would likely cause a different thing to happen smaller faster more spontaneous fights the faster things can move around in eve the less time people have to build up fleets the smaller the blobs
holy  this link is fantastic thank you bagehi
no problem ed
it makes it easier to tally how many are with and against the op
im not supporting this or am i
seriously though i fully support this idea
sad but true someone in marketing is of the opinion that the only thing holding eve back from 5m subscribers is its not easy enoughthey dont realise it has its niche market and the difficulty is a major drawcardeasy mode for the lose
 i think someone moved his cheesei support the removal of these useless skillsthey presented a down right annoying barrier of entry without them new players can spend training time on relevant skills rather than training to train faster remaps and implants allow for the improved benefits for those that want iti cant tell you how many new players and people trainign alts have cringed at the idea fo having to spend 23 months before they can train skills at a reasonable rate
it makes me laugh that you assume all hardcore or old players think learning skills were so awesome my character has 73mil sp ive been playing since 06 and ive always thought they were pants on head ed removing learning skills wont make the game easier it will simply be the removal a very bad piece of game design that shouldnt have been in eve in the first place it doesnt make anything easier except the first 2 weeks of grind if you guys are so attached to hazing maybe you should join a fraternity brofist
the only thing hard about learning skills is convincing yourself to keep your sub active while training them
learning skills  23 months of blasting your thrusters in place for longrun training speed increasenew system  removal of learning and refunding sp then adding in 12 unremappable base stats  faster base training overall and you get to spend the wasted points in more critical skillsread the dev blogs before you spout your nonsense in the forums
is this correctfrom the dev blog i got only this2012692 sp in learning you will find yourself down those skills but with 2012692 skillpoints to redistributei didnt catch any reference to getting more
lets introduce the equivelent of effective skill pointsyour getting 55m effective skill points  everyone is 2m  that you have in current learning  you will get in the form of redistibutable skill points35m you will get in the equivelent of attribute boost  as if ccp magically boosted all you learning skill to max 
to the guy who mentioned that removing the learning skills will be unfair to those who didnt invest in them the math simply doesnt support his argumentlets assume for the sake of this argument that there are two capsuleers with 70mil sp each one has invested 2mil sp for learning skills the other never did invest in them once the learning skills are removed and any sp invested into them have been reimbursed for allocation as per the developers the capsuleer who invested those 2mil sp for learning will just simply move the sp to other skills he shouldve been invested in long ago the other capsuleer who invested none will just have the same sp the way they are already setup in fact he will still have the same amount of sp as the other capsuleer at the same time both capsuleers will have the 12 bonuses given to them once the learning skills are removedno one will have gained nor have lost sp in the process abd both stand to benefit from the new bonus that comes after the removal of learning skills
sure why not
tbh even if it the store just had the skillbooks  implants it would be an improvement as the lp would actually be usefulpreferably thoughnanofibresoverdrivesexpandersreinforced bulkheadsinterbus shuttlecontainershull reppers
how about a iteron v interbus issueor even a interbus freighter oo yellow obelisk for the win
sounds reasonable and would only improve the immersion of evesupported

first of i want to say that incursions in concept are great but unfortunately the way it has been implemented it will fail miserably and likely be more of a nuisance than an enjoyable game featurefirst off since the incursions are broadcast to the world the valuable low sec areas where the mom bpcs get dropped are just going to be continually camping in by the larger pirate alliancescorps look at it this way new incursion starts today pirate corp looks it up and the corp starts camping the main entry areas for cheap thrills new people trying out the feature die horribly and loose interest unlikely to try again i could go on for pages on how this is gonna suck but thats not my purposeall of this work put into a great idea while leaving other stuff hanging the fact that ccp has left past features to die is known to all so i wont focus there so here are my thoughts on incursions done right and integrating it into existing game playlets play off the factional warefare the concept being once every month or some other fixed or random time the pirate faction of the winning side of the fw battle starts loosing side makes manipulation way to easycaldari vs gallente caldari are winning causing an incursion of guristas forces using the current incursion mechanics or modified version of these guristas forces would behave how the current sansha incursion would these guristas would then drop guristas equivalent loot at the same time amarr vs minmitar would run the same way at any point the regions would be invaded by the pirate faction of the winning faction with some careful thought 00 can be easily factored into thisthe idea creates influx of faction modsbpcs but only during the incursion if guristas are invading for 6 months straight the value of these modsbpcs would maybe drop a lot however anyone that held onto serpentis version could make a killing since the availability would be minimal want more sepentis mods then start fighting for the right faction to allow this could create a radically volatile market for faction items but then again faction mods should not be so fixed in priceobviously i kept the idea here light as to not have a 10 page report so please dont nit pick on how this could be manipulated and exploited geez i know i just dont feel like writing out every details to prevent such responses my real point here is instead of letting potential good features like fw sit to rot and introducing another potentially good feature in a not so good way use the good ideas and build on existing features hint to ccp even if its all new at least you give the image you are not letting your old stuff die out and youa re trying to revitalize it
this would carry more weight if the expansion you were complaining about was actually live on tq
i admit my complaints of the upcoming expansion are speculative however the conceptproposal is still valid which is really what this post is about
no it isnt valid because you are just guessing wait until an issue actually exists before complaining about it
you obviously didnt understand the overall point of my postwhile i started with a few negative projections the main point of the post was about an idea to integrate incursions with fw to provide more options and revitalize and old feature that hasnt seen much lovebut hey if you want to forum troll here rather than provide constructive feedback have at it oh wait you already have
thats why ccp wanted us all to come to sisi and test it out before deployment they want feedback like yours to ensure the maximum amount enjoyment of incursion even though the problem doesnt exist yet in tq your argument is valid and ccp should look into this before the problem even beginsto borrow a euphymism from the healthcare industry its cheaper to prevent the illness than it is to fix it

what if we nerfed eccm but added a minimum lockable targets number to it so if you had one eccm module fitted you could always at least lock one target two fitted would let you lock two and so onedit supporting this proposal or at least an iteration on it i like 01 i just think it might be worth requiring an eccm to gain that advantage
yeah no fraid i cant support this giving caldari wtf pwn ewar skills far beyond other races ewar abilities is not balanced in any sense of the wordhaving an ecm module reduce maxed locked targets to 1 means instaprimary the ecm ship which it will already be anyway as it stands now there is a chance that the jam will fail admittedly frigates stand almost no chance but small ships should have weaker sensor strength anywayi thought the idea to introduce a minimum locked targets for eccm interesting but beefing up the sensor strength is the appropriate counter to an ecm attackfor those small gangs that have been wtfpwnd by ecm in tha past i hope the experience taught your fcs which targets are supposed to be primary let me give you a hint it aint the dramiel

1 changing active targets from 0 to 1 will make ecm even more useless in big fights than they are now that means primary targets will be shot at no matter what and we all know that in big fleets there are multiple primary targets because 80 of the fleet is not listening to the fc2 changing active targets from 0 to 1 will cripple ecm ships in small gangs that means an interceptor will always have a point on an ecm ship unlike rapier for example which can chew interceptors in a couple of volleys falcons are far more vulnerable because they simply cant hit an interceptor and are as good as dead3 falcons and scorpions are not shield tankers if you ever flew one of them you would at least know how to fit itnot supported
yes
not supported please add that the jammed target cant target the jammer
if it is unfair that a target can lose all locksit is unfair that a target can be prevented from warping at up to 70 km awayit is unfair that any frigatesized and most cruisersized ships can have their cap instantly and completely drained by the click of a button from up to 60 km awayit is unfair that any ship within 10 km loses 90 of their speed almost instantlyhonestly the only reason people dont regularly complain about the uber recons from the other races is they rarely realize what hit them before they died whereas the effects of the ecm boats are very obvious and usually not paired with getting called primary target
do it
yes because they fought to earn and keep it completely fair mechanism if you want to address the mechanisms that lead to their power entry chokepoints old skool pos spam increased ease of logistics etc you might have something to address but changing all the stuff now isnt going to remove the hold that they have damage has already been doneyou have a terribly flawed view of the economy ok now you are getting just a wee bit too tinfoil hati agree that monolithic selfsustaining alliances are a crappy part of the game but your misinformed ranting isnt the way of going about changing it
i almost didnt want to take the time to respond to this due to the vast amount if incorrect info but let me try to summarizesandbox  the idea of the sandbox in eve is to allow the players to drive the results in any scenario you do this you will drive a few major power blocs a few second and third tier power blocks and their pets the idea to put in measures to stop this would in fact prevent the open sandbox results you are stating are not therethe 2 additional points i want to deflate for you are as follows1 even besides all of aspects of the game created by player influence there remains the countless changes by ccp to help these major alliances in their continued domination of every aspect of the game recent improvements to 00 incomes for example infrastructure improvements look one of the main reasons for some of the dominion changes was in fact to try and accomplish the exact opposite ccp changed game mechanics to make it extremely expensive to hold space and easier to take it over in addition they added even more costs for upgrades do you realize that having a system with a jump bridge now costs 300 mil a month and cyno jammed system now costs 600 mil a month each on top of regular sov bills and such this on what used to be essentially free their upgrades to plexes and other pve elements were to allow alliances to reduce space and support same number of people if you dont know already a team of about 510 people or less could consume all of the ded complexes in an entire region in less than a day in most cases these changes didnt impact 00 the way ccp intended but the point is still valid that you are misunderstanding ccps intent2 only a few alliances dominate and no one else can play the 00 game yes im paraphrasingbasically this is inaccurate also if you  as 1 person wanted to take over some 00 space you can not easily but then again those that have the space didnt get it easily you either a form an alliance build it up good and strong prove its worth and get taken in as an ally build up stronger until you are independent or b work your ass off as a renter 00 is obviously a lot more dynamic that you know here are a list of just a few space holding 00 alliances that have come and goneroadkillsmashdmciacka tettriumvirateirontcfnot to mention the recent issues around bobkenzokuit alliance and most recently goonswarm 
actually no it isnt what is the problem
you are given a choice with wormhole systems yes you can own your gold mine space even with just a couple of friends besides wspace is far more profitable for individual players than nullsec individual players dont get a single isk from moon mining while in wspace you share everythingfight between large alliances is a whole new dimension of this game you can choose to participate in it by joining or forming a large alliance or you can choose not to participate in it every choice has its pros and cons decide for yourself and choose how you would like to playpsyou would be surprised what good organisational skills a couple of fleet commanders just a little isk and a lot of diplomacy can create try it for yourself before crying on the forum about it
that is good point basically what you need to be the new powerhouse of eve is good leadership skills real life one not the ingame thingies and few good fcs and damn big pile of dedication for the dream of power good chunk of isk will help but is not essential in my opinion just would take a bit longer at first to get the avalanche moving there is downside of this though if alliance leader will have to leave it can make the whole thing crumble horribly fast the good alliance leader is sort of like a soul of entity  without it its just a shell a pile of meat for the grinder and the good fcs are your flags and banners rise them and and pilots rally around them to shed their share of blood even against odds that do not look good at first glance
evil zionist cabalin space
shut up and pay your rent
while were ending the tyranny of 00 alliances we should also end the tyranny of pirates hitting helpless low sec miners and mission runners mercs camping helpless haulers in jita suicide gankers tormenting helpless targets of opportunity in empire scammers victimizing the its too good to be true so id better jump on it crowd wormhole corps hoarding wormhole loot t2 bpo owners killing the margins of helpless inventorbuilders and so on
more thumbs up yeah
this topic pops up a lot and rightly so  but iirc ccp said theyll do it as soon as they can without a huge performance decrease
it seems like every other thread these days is complaining about the overpoweredness of traditional ecm but i havent seen much in the way of viable alternatives my inspiration came from the amarr ewar tactic of tracking disruptors  why not have an ewar mechanic that affects rate of firea mechanic like this would make a big difference to fleet fights  that nightmare or zealot might be pumping out some hefty volley damage at the moment but with a considerably lower rate of fire it indirectly strengthens your fleets shield and armour regeneration the good thing with an ewar such as this is that it isnt based on probability like current ecm and still gives opponents a chance of fighting back albeit less effectivelyit would be able to affect not just turrets but launchers as well if it was based on a percentage reduction im not enough of a mathematian or eft warrior to say what would be a reasonable rof reduction but i do feel that there is some potential in this idea what do you folks think
somebody suggested i post this here so ive gone ahead and done ita lot of the command ships are styled weapons usage and tank style on the tier 2 battle cruisers more than their tech1 tier 1 brethrensuch as thisi think this makes sense rp wise and gives a lot of people a chance to see their favourite tier2 bc all pimped out how they liketheir may be a slight balance issue with the gallente since theirs are the wrong way around but they could probably balance this out by switching a few industrial stats around or could maybe just go with the flow not all races have to be the same everywhereps  this doesnt spoil any possibilty of another tech2 bc class theres plenty of other ships that are used in more then 2 rolls t1 with multiple t2 variants see hictors
not supported it has to be consistency between the t1 tier1tier2 hulls and the fleetfield commands cant just have them picked randomly just imagine if the vargur used the typhoon hull and the panther used the tempest hull people would laugh at ccp

i would never guess where did you got that idea in the csm page about it or at the results of voting the 3rd most supported proposal from 203so what do you want from this post attention
i think you had a bad day
ive heard that ccp plans on opening the keyboard up to more shortcuts i propose that the asd and w buttons be used to designate orbit direction when pressed around whatever object in space is currently selectedthis would drastically improve the quality of space combat as you can now choose to orbit a ship and not fly directly into the middle of a blob of ships nearby if you did not intend to orbit in that directionorbit could be confirmed when releasing the button so that use of multiple buttons would produce diagonal resultsa for left orbit w for orbit over the top use a and w together for an orbital in the left and up direction a transparent orbit path could be displayed over the selected object giving the pilot a visual if checking for diagonal orbits and the pilot decides to go back to a single direction non diagonal orbit the release of one of the asdw buttons should change the orbit back within 5 seconds to avoid the mistake of someone wanting to chose a diagonal but not releasing the two keys at exactly the same time is that clear anyone wanna word that betterorbit command would not send if any of the asdw buttons are still pressed and will send command relating to whichever directional buttons were still held within the last 05 seconds of the last asdw button being releasedusing 05 seconds arbitrarily here 025 seconds or some other time may be usable i suspect 025 would be better than 05 but its just an exampledirection would be based on the players camera drone direction of view with respect to selected object so that straight over orbit is always straight and above the object with respect to the camera angle allowing for more control of the orbits and you can chose to focus your camera on the selected object for ease of orbit direction choicecomplicated in text as it may appear i believe ccp is certainly capable of this and it would give flying a much more involved and personal feel
propose all you want i think theyre planning on it being highly customisable
rewording my responsei feel like youre just being a dipstick but could be a bad first impression so i will ignore what i feel was dipstickishnessconsider my proposal to be that ccp bring in the option to allow asdw keys to perform the functions that i have outlined abovedid not know that word tee w a tee was censored here on the forums wow
can you explain how the crew is supposed to get into a sealed fluidfilled capsule with delicate brain scanner no cargo hold and a total volume of 1000m3
and how about you check previous posts before throwing your own on the forum
ahh thanks sorry i did searchs but didnt come up with anything thanks for the link
i would just like propose a very simple update to the interface i would like to see at maybe one or two extra orbit buttons they would all be user definable of course so on your display you would have the options of say 1k 10k  20k orbits im guessing this would be a fairly easy upgrade to implement into the current layout i hope this idea isnt to radical maybe im ahead of my time suggesting that a spaceships control panel would have this level complexity thanks anyway
approve
bitter vets are bitter i dont like being extreme about it you cant please everyone but ccp could say we are fixing lag we get 1million isk in donationsand people would cry and complain
well worded i fully support this
allow logging to be ran on the client side that uses the clients resources not the main server implement a logging system that does not need to communicate with the main servers encrypt the logs in some way that you cn detect if they have been tampered withaccept user logs as evidence of errors and fix those errors not all errors are server side some are client side and there is no way of knowing for sure what problems could arise there could be some specific hardwaresoftware combination that results in the client losing connection consistently things like this should be known by ccp and made public for others to know and avoid with no accurate way of logging both client and server there is no way to 100 guarantee that there was not an error in the code that caused an anomolytldr  the clients need logs too not just the server

for the record i havent lost anything recent this thread was created on behalf of my macro related what can ccp see thread which sadly by the looks of it is the logs dont see anything 
bump
would be nice
really damncuz ive been building all sorts of t2 modules and ships for a while nowand i dont mine a single moonamidoinitwrong
this is also why pi takes so many clicksccp knows that before people make a sizable amount of money from it they will have mangled their hands anyway
and also fwiw csms working really damn hard to work for you and to be honest always whining and complaining about csm this or csm that isnt helpful mister dragonbreathlike mr trump says i hate people who dont have solutions in other words come up with a solution to go with your complaint dont just  and moanbut hey looking forward to your application in csm 6 since you seem to be props 3 mynxee dv tdaze n trebozzzz000000rrrsz
my dear csm please remember that for every hysterical whiner on these forums there are those of us who 3 you
yeah but you never write you never call
supported
buffer tanking went through a series of successive buffsactive tanking didntccp cant buff active tanking without rebalancing every mission and npc in the gameccp cant nerf buffer tanks because people would whine mightily and it would go against the stated aim of making fights last longerin other words ccp has managed to wedge its truck in a blind alley it cant turn left it either doesnt want to or cant turn rightat the moment if you want to active tank in pvp at the subcap level you have to hope you arent going to be blobbed buffer tanking scales better with more opponents than active doesyou have hg crystals boosters and a factiondeadspaceofficer fit are flying one of a small number of hulls that are viable with active tanks when using the above stupidly expensive setupsdont just get jammed andor neuted outcaveats abound with rr as you are technically active tanking but this is only made possible by possession of a solid buffertldr active tanking is effectively dead in pvp only viable at a small gang level with silly isk invested and is pretty much relegated to pve where incoming damage is predictable ccp have created this situation and cant really fix it
line breaksplease make use of your returnenter key
ok thats the first part un wallotexted
the last three paragraphs were split it was one giant sentence
thanks alara ill even send you some isk after the expansion deployment so you can eliminate at least some of the pain you had to endure while making paragraphsop3rd party applications that catch macros and bots are on the market for quite some time none of them works 100 accurate because from the programming point of view its impossible there will always be false positives in even the most advanced and widespread applications of this kindeve already have a good way of detecting bots  players you can easily spot bots and petition them directly to ccp they will look into it and take appropriate action sooner or later i think that this way of doing things is perfect ccp with or without some kind of monitoring backend application can focus on investigating reported instances only instead of making everyone suffer by using an automated program that can report false positives besides macro software programmers will always adapt to any 3rd party application
